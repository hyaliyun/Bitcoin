Temenos was initially created in 1993, and has been listed on the Swiss stock exchange since 2001. Company profile Founded in 1993 and listed on the Swiss stock exchange (SIX: TEMN), Temenos AG is a provider of banking software systems to retail, corporate, universal, private, treasury, fund administration, Islamic, microfinance and community banks. Headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and with 67 offices in 40 countries, Temenos serves over 3,000 financial institutions in 145 countries across the world. It claims to be used by 41 of the top 50 banks worldwide. History The company was started in November 1993, by George Koukis and Kim Goodall having acquired the rights to GLOBUS, the successful banking software platform developed by a team of technical and banking experts in 1988. The company was renamed to Temenos, in reference to a lecture on money given by Hans-Wolfgang Frick at the Temenos Academy (1992), and continued to develop and market GLOBUS. In 2001, Temenos went public, and is listed on the main segment of the SWX Swiss Exchange (TEMN). Also in 2001, Temenos acquired a mainframe core banking application aimed at high-end retail banks, originally developed by IBM, and now marketed as Temenos Corebanking. On 30 September 2003 Temenos launched its T24 banking package. T24 was based on GLOBUS, but with a state-of-the-art banking technology platform. This was the result of 3 years of development effort and an investment of more than US$24 million. In 2011, George Koukis stepped down as chairman and became a non-executive director, and Andreas Andreades became chairman. = Acquisitions = { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" +Companies acquired by Temenos, listed by year - !scope=\\"col\\" Year !scope=\\"col\\" Company !scope=\\"col\\" Country - !scope=\\"row\\" 2007  Actis.bsp  Germany - !scope=\\"row\\" 2008  Financial Objects Ltd  United Kingdom - !scope=\\"row\\" 2008  Lydian Associates Ltd  United Kingdom - !scope=\\"row\\" 2009  Viveo  France - !scope=\\"row\\" 2010  FE Mobile  United Kingdom - !scope=\\"row\\" 2010  Odyssey Financial Technologies  Luxembourg - !scope=\\"row\\" 2011  Primisyn  Canada - !scope=\\"row\\" 2012  Edge IPK  United Kingdom - !scope=\\"row\\" 2013  Trinovus  United States - !scope=\\"row\\" 2015  Akcelerant  United States - !scope=\\"row\\" 2015  Multifonds  Luxembourg - !scope=\\"row\\" 2017  Rubik Financial Limited ('Rubik')  Australia - !scope=\\"row\\" 2018 Avoka United States - !scope=\\"row\\" 2019 Htrunk Software Solutions India - !scope=\\"row\\" 2019 Logical Glue United Kingdom - !scope=\\"row\\" 2019 Kony, Inc USA / India } References Category:Software companies of Switzerland Category:Banking software companies Category:Financial software companies Category:Companies based in Geneva Category:Companies listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange Category:Swiss brands Category:Software companies established in 1993 Category:Swiss companies established in 1993 ","title":"Temenos AG"},{"id":"17420014","text":"Schlieffen was a wolfpack of German U-boats that operated during the battle of the Atlantic in World War II.

The word itself, derived from the Latin plenarium (complete or full), hence concilium plenarium, also concilium plenum. Plenary councils have a legislative function that does not apply to other national synods. The ecumenical councils or synods are called plenary councils by Augustine of Hippo,C. illa, xi, Dist. 12 as they form a complete representation of the entire Church. Thus also, in ecclesiastical documents, provincial councils are denominated plenary, because all the bishops of a certain ecclesiastical province were represented. Later usage has restricted the term plenary to those councils which are presided over by a delegate of the Apostolic See, who has received special power for that purpose, and which are attended by all the metropolitans and bishops of some commonwealth, empire, or kingdom, or by their duly accredited representatives. In this article, only those modern provincial councils where the ecclesiastical province covered a whole country or countries (for example, Baltimore for the United States of America or Sydney for Australasia up to the mid-nineteenth century) are discussed, since it is only those that had de facto plenary effect. Such plenary synods are frequently called national councils. Plenary councils should be distinguished from: * plenary assemblies such as those for Canada, India or Poland which are meetings of a number of bishops from some given territory but without the authorisation to be a council; * the Synod of Bishops in the Catholic Church being a meeting of Bishops in the whole church instituted in 1965; and * Diocesan Synods, meetings of church representatives convened by the Bishop within one diocese. History Plenary councils, in the sense of national synods, are included under the term particular councils as opposed to universal councils. They are of the same nature as provincial councils, with the accidental difference that several ecclesiastical provinces are represented in national or plenary synods. In current canon law they are called by the Episcopal Conference of a given territory when approved by the Pope. The Episcopal Conference itself, a permanent body of bishops from a territory, is a relatively modern structure, with the earliest formed in Switzerland in 1863 and only confirmed as policy at Vatican II. The ability to meet regularly across large nations or territories waited on modern technology. In contrast, the need to meet for critical matters means that Plenary Councils, called only when absolutely necessary to justify the time and effort required, are quite ancient. =Ancient= Provincial councils, strictly so-called, date from the fourth century, when the metropolitical authority had become fully developed. But synods, approaching nearer to the modern signification of a plenary council, are to be recognized in the synodical assemblies of bishops under primatial, exarchal, or patriarchal authority, recorded from the fourth and fifth centuries, and possibly earlier. Such were, apparently, the synods held in Asia Minor at Iconium and Synnada in the third century, concerning the re-baptism of heretics; such were, certainly, the councils held later in the northern part of Latin Africa, presided over by the Archbishop of Carthage, Primate of Africa. The latter councils were officially designated plenary councils (Concilium Plenarium totius Africae). Their beginnings are without doubt to be referred, at least, to the fourth, and possibly to the third century. Synods of a somewhat similar nature (though approaching nearer to the idea of a general council) were the Council of Arles in Gaul in 314 (at which were present the Bishops of London, York, and Caerleon), and the Council of Sardica in 343 (whose canons were frequently cited as Nicene canons). To these we might add the Greek Council in Trullo (692). The popes were accustomed in former ages to hold synods which were designated Councils of the Apostolic See. They might be denominated, to a certain extent, emergency synods, and though they were generally composed of the bishops of Italy, yet bishops of other ecclesiastical provinces took part in them. Pope Martin I held such a council in 649, and Pope Agatho in 680. The patriarchs of Constantinople convoked, on special occasions, a synodos endemousa, at which were present bishops from various provinces of the Greek world who happened to be sojourning in the imperial city, or were summoned to give council to the emperor or the patriarch concerning matters that required special episcopal consultation. Still further narrowed down to our present idea of plenary councils are the synods convoked in the Frankish and West- Gothic kingdoms from the end of the sixth century, and designated national councils. The bishops in these synods were not gathered together because they belonged to certain ecclesiastical provinces, but because they were under the same civil government, and consequently had common interests which concerned the kingdom in which they lived or the people over whom they ruled. =France - Disputed Plenary Councils= As ecclesiastical jurisdiction is necessary for the person who presides over a plenary or national synod, this name has been refused to the assemblies of the bishops of France, which met without papal authorization in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. These comitia cleri Gallicani were not really plenary councils. The more noted among them were those held at Paris in 1681 and 1682. Convocations of ecclesiastics (Assembl√©es du Clerg√©) were frequent in France before the Revolution of 1789. They consisted of certain bishops deputed by the various ecclesiastical provinces of the kingdom, and of priests elected by their equals from the same provinces, to deliberate on the temporal affairs of the French churches, and more particularly on the assistance, generally monetary, to be accorded to the Government. After the establishment of the empire, Napoleon I held a great convention of bishops at Paris (1811), and is said to have been much incensed because Pius VII did not designate it a national council. Similarly, mere congresses of bishops, even of a whole nation, who meet to discuss common ecclesiastical affairs, without adhering to synodal forms, are not to be called national or plenary Councils, because no one having the proper jurisdiction has formally summoned them to a canonical synod. Such episcopal conventions have been praised by the Holy See, because they showed unity among the bishops, and zeal for asserting the rights of the Church and the progress of the Catholic cause in their midst, in accordance with the sacred canons, but, as the requisite legal forms and proper hierarchical authority are wanting, these congresses of bishops do not constitute a plenary council, no matter how full the representation of episcopal dignitaries may be. For example, in current usage plenary assemblies though in all other ways identical to plenary councils do not meet those requirements. =Modern Plenary Councils= After the nineteenth century, plenary councils became less frequent. For example, the United States held three plenary councils before 1884 and has held none since. From the first few years of the second half of the twentieth century there doesn't appear to be any plenary councils reported. Some prominent examples since the second decade of the nineteenth century in order of first plenary council in each territory are: * United States of America Plenary Councils ** Provincial Councils of Baltimore Ten Councils between 1829 and 1869. Prior to 1850, all dioceses in the United States were in the ecclesiastical province of Baltimore, so the Provincial Councils covered the whole nation, and were therefore plenary councils de facto. Baltimore was seen as the Primal see for the country (cf. Archbishop of Canterbury for England in both the pre-Reformation Catholic Church and the Anglican Church), and the US Bishops requested that this be confirmed in 1884, but the Vatican has never done so. ** Plenary Councils of Baltimore (1852, 1866 and 1884) By 1850 a need for the now multiple provinces in the nation to meet was formed, and so three full Plenary Councils across these provinces were held. The attendance at the Provincial Council of Baltimore was significantly lower from 1852 onwards as there were then fewer bishops in the restructured province. The Third Baltimore Council was notable for the Baltimore Catechism, the major catechism in North America from 1884 until the 1960s. * Irish Plenary Council (1875) Maynooth. Referred to officially as the Irish Episcopal Plenary Synod of Maynooth (synodi plenari√¶ Episcoporum hiberni√¶). This plenary council had a major influence on the Australasian council which followed it. * Australian and New Zealand Plenary Councils ** As in America, the plenary councils had been preceded by provincial councils with de facto plenary effect, the First and Second Provincial Councils of Australasia in 1844 (Sydney) and 1869 (Melbourne), as before 1874 Australia and New Zealand were one province. ** The plenary councils (1885, 1895 1905 and 1937) are also referred to as the First, Second, Third and Fourth Councils of Sydney, as per American usage with the Plenary Councils of Baltimore. As with Baltimore, Sydney was the de facto Primal see of the country. The first plenary council, like its two provincial predecessors, was a Plenary Council of Australasia (Concilii Plenarii Australasiae), the second and third are Plenary Councils of Australia (Concilii Plenarii Australiensis) and the fourth was again expanded to be the Plenary Council of Australia and New Zealand. The Plenary Councils focused less on doctrine and more on church governance, such as selection procedures for Bishops and diocesan boundaries. * South American Plenary Councils ** Latin American Plenary Council (1898) ** Brazilian Plenary Councils (1890 and 1939) * Chinese Plenary Council (1924) Plenary Council of Shanghai * French Indochina Plenary Council (1934) Plenary Council of Hanoi * Indian Plenary Council (1952) * Philippines Plenary Council (1953) Canon Law =Authorization= A plenary or national council may not be convoked or celebrated without the authority of the Apostolic See, as was solemnly and repeatedly declared by Pius IX. This has always been the practice in the Church, if not explicitly, at least from the fact that recourse could always be had to the Holy See against decisions of such councils. Now, however, express and special papal authorization is required. He who presides over the council must have the necessary jurisdiction, which is accorded by special Apostolic delegation. In the United States, the presidency of such synods has always been accorded by the Holy See to the archbishops of Baltimore. In their case, a papal delegation is necessary, for although they have a precedence of honour over all the other American metropolitans, yet they have no primatial or patriarchal jurisdiction. It is not uncommon for the pope to send from Rome a special delegate to preside over plenary councils. =Summons= Summons to a national or plenary council is to be sent to all archbishops and bishops of the nation, and they are obliged to appear, unless prevented by a canonical hindrance; to all administrators of dioceses sede plena or vacua, and to vicars capitular sede vacante; to vicars Apostolic possessed of episcopal jurisdiction; to the representatives of cathedral chapters, to abbots having quasi-episcopal jurisdiction. In the United States, custom has sanctioned the summoning of auxiliary, coadjutor, and visiting bishops; provincials of religious orders; all mitred abbots; rectors of major seminaries, as well as priests to serve as theologians and canonists. =Attendance= Only those who have a right to a summons have also a right to cast a decisive vote in councils. The others may give only a consultive vote. The fathers may, however, empower auxiliary, coadjutor, and visiting bishops, as well as procurators of absent bishops to cast a decisive vote. The Third Plenary Council of Baltimore allowed a decisive vote also to a general of a religious congregation, because this was done at the Vatican Council. At the latter council, however, such vote was granted only to generals of regular orders, but not to those of religious congregations At Baltimore, a decisive vote was refused to abbots of a single monastery, but conferred on arch-abbots. Those who have a consultive vote and who: * must attend from the given territory (province, nation or region) include: ** \\"the vicars general and episcopal vicars of all the particular churches; ** \\"elected representatives of the major superiors of religious institutes and societies of apostolic life; ** \\"rectors of ecclesiastical and Catholic universities and deans of faculties of theology and of canon law; ** \\"some rectors of major seminaries.\\" *may attend, include: ** \\"presbyters and other members of the Christian faithful who are called to particular councils, but in such a way that their number does not exceed half the number of church officials with a consultive vote attending. ** \\"cathedral chapters and the presbyteral council and pastoral council of each particular church who are to be invited to provincial councils so that two of their members represent them. ** \\"others who can also be invited as guests to particular councils, by the conference of bishops for a plenary council, or by the metropolitan together with the suffragan bishops for a provincial council.\\" Critics suggest that the Church does not communicate well the true limited role of lay participants in Plenary Councils, and that this may create unrealised expectations from the misapplication of the lay understanding of participation. This view is that the Church needs to find ways to make this consultative role of the laity more real. Process =Discussion= In particular councils, the subject-matter to be treated is what concerns discipline, the reformation of abuses, the repression of crimes, and the progress of the Catholic cause. In former times, such councils often condemned incipient heresies and opinions contrary to sound morals, but their decisions became dogmatic only after solemn confirmation by the Apostolic See. Thus, the Council of Milevum (416) and Council of Carthage (418) condemned Pelagianism, and the Council of Orange (Arausicanum) Semipelagianism. Such latitude is not allowed to modern synods, and the Fathers are warned that they are not to restrict opinions which are tolerated by the Catholic Church. =Decrees= One of the most important powers of the plenary council is its legislative function. Decrees of plenary councils must be submitted, before promulgation, for the confirmation, recognition and revision of the Holy See. Such recognition does not imply an approval of all the regulations submitted by the council. Bishops have the power of relaxing decrees of a plenary council in particular cases in their own dioceses, unless the council was confirmed in forma specifica at Rome. In like manner, when no specific confirmation of the decrees has been accorded, it is lawful to appeal from these councils. In modern times, it is not unusual for the Holy See to confirm councils in forma specifica, but only to accord them the necessary recognition. If, consequently, anything be found in their acts contrary to the common law of the Church, it would have no binding force unless a special apostolic derogation were made in its favour.  Future Plenary Councils  Australia will hold its Fifth Plenary Council in 2020. Archbishop Phillip Wilson of Adelaide was a proponent of a plenary council for over a decade. In a departure from previous councils, the first session will be held in Adelaide, South Australia, not Sydney. Unlike the Fourth Plenary Council of Sydney, it will not include New Zealand. Eight bishops of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops formally called for a plenary council in 2002 but this did not proceed. There is speculation from US sources that a successful plenary council in Australia will lead other provinces and nations within the Church, such as the US to ask for similar councils. In both the US and Australian instances the main driver for seeking a plenary council was to deal with the issues surrounding Catholic Church sexual abuse cases, though the Fifth Australian Plenary Council will deal with a wider range of issues. Archbishop Phillip Wilson of Adelaide gave evidence before the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse that the plenary council was the appropriate church forum to respond to the child sexual abuse issue, rather than national or diocesan synods because: However, because this issue is significant in many other territories, there is potential for the further revival of this long neglected form of governance through plenary councils in other jurisdictions if it is seen as being effective.

Biography Born in Hayes, Kent, the third child and first daughter of William Birkbeck Harris, a Lloyds Insurance clerk, and his wife Kathleen Marion Carey. With her younger sister Margaret \\"Percy\\" Harris she studied at The Chelsea Illustrators Studio in London. A fellow student was Elizabeth Montgomery Wilmot, and the three formed a theatre design partnership known as Motley Theatre Design Group. The first full-scale production on which they worked was Romeo and Juliet for the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS), John Gielgud's d√©but as a director. The great success of this led to an invitation from Gielgud to design Gordon Daviot's Richard of Bordeaux, which opened at the New Theatre in St Martins Lane, London, in February 1933. The production was a huge success, achieving cult status, with playgoers queuing round the block every night. It is widely recognised that the success was partly owing to the Motley sets and costumes, which captured the essence of the period in an artistic rather than a slavishly historical sense, and were much admired for their beauty and lightness. This early recognition led to a busy and highly successful decade during which they became Gielgud's regular collaborators, working with him on such productions as his celebrated Romeo and Juliet (1935), in which he alternated the parts of Romeo and Mercutio with Laurence Olivier,and his Hamlet of 1936. They also formed a partnership with the celebrated French director Michel Saint-Denis, whose production of Andr√© Obey's Noah, starring Gielgud in the title role, they designed in 1935. Saint Denis went on to found The London Theatre Studio (1936‚Äì1939), a radical new theatre school which incorporated courses in theatre design taught by the Motleys. This was the first time theatre design had been taught within a drama school in the UK. In addition to their teaching and theatre work, the Motleys also opened a couture house in 1936, to which Harris made a substantial contribution. At the outbreak of World War II, Margaret Harris and Elizabeth Montgomery were in the USA, working with Laurence Olivier, and they decided to remain there until the end of the war. Sophie Harris, still in England, married the actor and director George Devine (1910‚Äì1966) with whom she formed a relationship after the OUDS Romeo and Juliet. Their daughter Harriet was born in 1942. Working on her own for the first time, Sophie designed several plays and films during this period. Shortly after Devine's return after the war, he founded The Old Vic Theatre School, together with Saint-Denis and Glen Byam Shaw. Sophie, with Margaret Harris, back from America, taught design and costume at the school. Following the closure of the school in 1952, the Motleys continued to design extensively for both opera (at London's Sadler's Wells Theatre and English National Opera) and theatre. Their work at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre was much admired throughout the 1950s. Harris also had a successful solo career as a costume designer for films, as well as reviving her couture house under the name Elizabeth Curzon. In the early days of Devine's newly founded English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre (founded 1956), the Motleys designed numerous productions. Harris designed the costumes for several Woodfall Films, including Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1960), A Taste of Honey (1961), The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (1962), and This Sporting Life (1963), and for Jack Clayton (The Innocents (1961) and The Pumpkin Eater, for which she won a BAFTA Award for best costume designer. (1963)). Harris was divorced from George Devine in the early 1960s. She continued to work successfully in both theatre and film until her death in March 1966.

He is a former four-time JCW Heavyweight Champion. In his professional wrestling career, Robinson is an eight time Heavyweight champion having won the CCW Heavyweight Championship once, EPW Heavyweight Championship once, IWA Mid-South Heavyweight Championship once, JCW Heavyweight Championship four times, and MAW Heavyweight Championship once. In addition to these championships, he has won the IWA Mid-South Deathmatch Championship twice, MAW Tag Team Championship once with Hardcore Craig, and PWU Hardcore Championship twice. He held the NWA-CCW tag team title along with his brother, Joey \\"Kidd\\" Owens as the team of Pain Inc. Robinson is also the 2004 and 2007 IWA Mid- South King of the Deathmatch Tournament winner. Career =Before wrestling= Robinson was attending college on a baseball scholarship, when he was approached by a Marine Corps recruiter and he signed up with an open contract to 2nd Battalion Hotel Company at Parris Island. Robinson was one of 287 recruits to graduate (from an intake of 299) and was designated 0311, serving time in Bosnia. =Early career= Robinson grew up watching the \\"pure wrestling\\" style of United States Wrestling Association. After leaving the Marine Corps, he began wrestling in the local wrestling scene. At one event, Tracy Smothers was in attendance and saw Robinson wrestle. Following the match, Smothers told him about a wrestling school he, Jamie Dundee, and Kelly Wolfe were a part of and invited Robinson to train there. Under their training, Robinson learned the \\"pure wrestling\\" style which he had grown up watching. He soon started his professional career working for Kentuckiana Championship Wrestling. There, Robinson created his gimmick of an ex-Marine, which he legitimately was, and came to the ring waving an American flag and saluting the crowd. During this time, Extreme Championship Wrestling had begun to receive national exposure. After watching an episode of ECW, Robinson fell in love with the Hardcore wrestling style. Ian Rotten soon approached him about joining his promotion IWA Mid-South, which adapted the same hardcore style of wrestling as ECW. =IWA Mid-South= When Robinson first arrived in IWA-MS, he was still known as a \\"pure wrestler\\". However, Robinson experienced his first taste of the hardcore style in February 1998 at \\"No Blood No Guts No Glory '98\\". He was originally scheduled to face Shark Boy, while Mad Man Pondo was set to conclude a violent feud with wrestler Trailer Park Trash. The Pondo-Trash match was booked for Pondo to win, however, Trailer Park Trash refused to take part, so Ian Rotten switched the opponents and Robinson took part in his first hardcore match. Robinson decided to start wrestling deathmatches to show people that wrestling was not fake. He said that \\"people were saying [that] wrestling's fake, wrestling's fake, this and that. But by the time you got done watching one of my matches, you didn't walk out of that building saying that was fake. [You'd say] those two guys just killed each other.\\" Robinson went on to compete in a wide range of deathmatches in IWA, including 6 King of the Deathmatch tournaments. He also claimed the IWA-MS Heavyweight Championship on 2 occasions, as well as being a 2 time IWA-MS Deathmatch Champion. Robinson is only the second wrestler (behind Ian Rotten) to win the King of the Deathmatch tournament multiple times. Through his work in IWA-MS, Robinson gained national exposure and fully developed his Corporal Robinson character. =Insane Wrestling Federation= Robinson also wrestled in Insane Wrestling Federation, capturing the IWF Tag Team Title during his stint. The referee for the promotion, A. T. Huck, was also referee and friend of Insane Clown Posse and their promotion Juggalo Championship Wrestling. During Robinson's feud with Sabu, who was also a friend of the duo, Insane Clown Posse attended several shows. The group hung out backstage with their friends, and also began talking to and smoking with Robinson, eventually befriending him. =Juggalo Championship Wrestling (1999‚Äì2012)= In 1997, Robinson wrestled for Insane Clown Posse at the event ICP's Strangle-Mania Live. Two years later, he, 2 Tuff Tony, and Mad Man Pondo wrestled at the Dan Curtis Memorial, an independent wrestling booker who had recently worked for Insane Clown Posse.

He lived in Constantinople (now Istanbul) for about forty years and he is known for his 1911 book Turkey and its People.He is also author of the following books: ; ; Early life Pears was born on 18 March 1835 in York, England. He was educated privately and at the University of London where he took first-class honours in Roman law and jurisprudence. Pears was called to the Bar at Middle Temple in 1870. He was also private secretary to Frederick Temple, then Bishop of Exeter, and later Archbishop of Canterbury. Pears was also secretary to various associations connected with social work in London. Constantinople Pears settled in Constantinople in 1873. He practised in the consular courts and became president of the European bar there. He rose to become one of the leaders of the British colony in Constantinople. Pears travelled much through Turkish dominions, and studied Turkish history from both the Turkish and foreign perspectives. In this way, Pears acquired an intimate knowledge of Turkey. In 1876, as correspondent of The Daily News, he sent letters home describing Ottoman atrocities and the April Uprising in Bulgaria. The letters aroused popular demonstrations in England led by William Ewart Gladstone. At the time, the reports of these atrocities were generally disbelieved and Pears' letters placed all the incontrovertible facts before the English people. In 1909, Pears was knighted, returning to London to receive the honour in person on 22 July 1909. In 1911, Pears wrote the book Turkey and its People. It is regarded as his most distinguished book. In that book, he displayed his expert knowledge of Byzantine Constantinople. The book contains original material on the nationalities of the Ottoman empire. The book was an attempt to interpret Turkey to the western people. In 1916, Pears wrote Forty Years in Constantinople. This book is regarded as essential reading for the study of the Ottoman constitutional revolution of 1908. Death Pears died on 27 November 1919 in Malta from an accident on his journey home from Constantinople.

The term \\"Darshini \\" was first used by an entrepreneur Janardhan Airodi. Darshini means to see and select food from a menu. The concept of Darshini type restaurant model was conceived by R. Prabhakar in 1983 which is inspired from west. He set the standards for Darshini food. A darshini will find acceptance only if (a) it serves hot and quality food at pocket-friendly prices (b) limits itself to fewer items (c) knows how to control costs and (d) it uses pure water. All the menu includes mostly South Indian breakfast dishes. Food is generally served in stainless steel plates and cups. All darshinis are pay-first-eat-later. The main focus of Darshini model is to serve quickly the tasty, efficiently produced local food at affordable price. The first Darshini named Cafe Darshini was started in Jayanagar, Bangalore in the year 1983 by R. Prabhakar Cost optimization Darshinis are self service restaurant and they provide no place to sit for its customers. This gives darshinis an edge over other restaurants to offer affordable menu as they can cut expenditure on server salaries and furniture.

It was modelled on the similar English College there, founded for the same purpose. It has an unfortunate notoriety in consequence of the long dispute between the Jesuits and the secular clergy which centred around it in later times. History The Scots College was founded at Tournai, but soon transferred to Pont-√†-Mousson. In 1592, Pope Clement VIII directed it to be relocated to Douai; however three years later it again moved to Louvain, where it was located next to the Jesuit College.Baxter, J.H., \\"The Scots College at Douai\\", The Scottish Historical Review, Vol. 24, No. 96 (Jul., 1927), pp. 251-257 In 1506, however, it moved again, and it was not until after several further migrations that it settled finally at Douai in 1612. At the time of the English Civil War, the Scots Colleges tended to support the crown. Many of the students were from families of the nobility and gentry and loyal to the Stuarts. A number of students interrupted their studies to return home and take up arms for the King. The college was devoid of resources, and it was due to the zealous efforts of Father Parsons in Rome and Madrid, and of Father Creighton in France and Flanders, that numerous benefactions were given and it was placed on a permanent footing. For this reason, the Jesuits afterwards claimed the property as their own, although it was admitted that in its early years secular clergy had been educated there. Appeals and counter-appeals were made, but the question was still unsettled when the Jesuits were expelled from France in 1764.

Dedicated to St. Patrick, the college was sometimes referred to as St. Patrick's College, Douai. History It was founded in 1603 by Fr. Christopher Cusack (from Co. Meath), with the support of Philip III of Spain, as a Spanish foundation and endowed with 5,000 florins a year by the King of Spain.Christopher Cusack by Patrick M. Geoghegan, Cambridge Dictionary of Biography/RIA. Fr. Cusack had some years earlier tried to set up a hostel to support Irish candidates for the priesthood in Douai. The course of studies lasted six years and the students attended lectures at the university of Douai, where its Faculty of Theology took the Irish Seminary of Douai under its wing in 1610. In 1667 Louis XIV of France, took control Douai and the Irish college there became subject to French authority. The college benefited from expertise of english scholars in Douai, priests were trained to preach in the Irish language.The Rothe collection: a legacy of the Counter-Reformation in Ireland History Ireland, Issue 1(Jan/Feb 2013), Volume 21.

He was the husband of the photographer Emila Medkov√°. During the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia, the general hostility towards modern art and free thinking clashed with his artistic independence and the spiritual dimensions of his works leading to a long lasting ban on displaying his works. The first full exhibition was realised only in 2002 in the Rudolphinum gallery in Prague. A selection of his works had been exhibited in a local gallery in Roudnice nad Labem in 1989 with no public notice. He died in Prague in August 1974.  Work  Medek's work initially relies on the tradition of surrealism, later it brings new elements of the spiritual dimension. In 1952, he entered his \\"existential period\\" with the central theme of the human character in space, and at the turn of the 1950s and 1960s he came to abstract painting. As a result, so-called \\"prepared paintings\\" of color matter, arranged in the form of surface symbols and rationally distributed color formations have come into being. He brings the theme of the basic question of the meaning of human life directly to the color of its original image-making techniques (emails, etc.). In the last period of his life, he developed imaginative painting and also devoted himself to a book illustration. His work, thanks to non-public exhibitions (so-called \\"Confrontation\\"), became a model for younger radical artists. After 1960, Medek was allowed to realize some public monumental works, which included the altarpiece of the church in Jedovnice (1963), made together with sculptor Jan Koblasa and the compositions for the interiors of the Czechoslovak office. airlines in Damascus, Ko≈°ice (1963), Paris (1964), Prague (1969) and New York (1970). The central theme of Medek's work is the theme of human destiny, which is combined with the emotive expression of the intensive experience of the mystical character in an inwardly unified and unusually impressive whole, which speaks to the spectator with extreme urgency. Symbolism of sign systems creates special visual metaphors of human existence in its tragic, painful and mysterious dimensions.  The most important works  Medek's works are largely owned by galleries (e.g. Sydney, New York, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Hamburg, Bochum, Bratislava, Skopje, etc.) or are contained in private collections around the world. = Paintings = * Surrealism: \\"Magnetic Fish\\", \\"Noise of Silence\\", \\"The World of Onion\\", ad. * Existential surrealism: \\"The head of a sleeping imperialist dream\\", \\"Naked thorns\\", \\"Cranach's overflow with an imperialist flower\\", \\"Day and night\\", \\"Riddle\\", \\"Screaming\\", \\"Kiss\\", \\"The Feast\\" * Prepared paintings: \\"Cross of Iron\\", \\"Celebration of 21,870 red centimeters\\", cycle \\"Venus\\", own cycle \\"Prepared paintings\\", ad. * Imaginative paintings: Cycles \\"Hosts Without Host\\", \\"Tower Designers\\", \\"Angry Angels\\", \\"Angled Angel I, II\\", \\"Great Inquisitor\\", \\"Annunciation,\\" \\"Moving Grave I.-IV.\\" Medek's final painting was \\"The Four Circles\\" (1974). = Illustrations = * Otokar B≈ôezina - Hands * Vladim√≠r Holan - Babyloniaca * Franz Werfel - The Song About Bernadette  References  Category:1926 births Category:1974 deaths Category:Modern painters Category:Czech painters Category:Czech male painters Category:Czech illustrators Category:20th-century Czech painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:Czech Roman Catholics Category:Recipients of Medal of Merit (Czech Republic) Category:Artists from Prague ","title":"Mikul√°≈° Medek"},{"id":"17420515","text":"Sanja Bogosavljeviƒá (, born 28 June 1979 in Belgrade, Serbia, former SFR Yugoslavia) is a Serbian singer and a member of the girlband Beauty Queens, which was formed by gathering backing vocalists of Marija ≈†erifoviƒá after victory in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007.

He taught at Vanderbilt for more than 40 years. He served as chair of the political science department from 1988‚Äì92, and served as an associate dean in the arts and sciences college from 1986‚Äì88, and from 1997-2000. Life George J. Graham Jr., was born in Dayton, Ohio in 1938 and graduated from Wilbur Wright High School in 1956. He received his B.A. from Wabash College in 1960 and his Ph.D. from Indiana University in 1965. He was a member of the faculty of the political science faculty at Vanderbilt from 1963 until his death on November 30, 2006. He taught courses in political theory, for undergraduates, and in political theory, philosophy of social science, and democratic theory for graduate students. Graduate students were always his focus. Graham was a central figure in the Vanderbilt graduate program for many years; by the late 1980s-early 1990s, he was arguably the closest faculty member to the graduate students. In that era, he was adviser, and/or friend, to a number of graduate students who went on to successful careers. Work Graham's academic production was hampered by his perfectionism and a number of chronic health problems. His writings address a number of important topics in the field of political science, including the place of political theory (and, more narrowly, conceptual analysis) in political science, the role of consensus in democratic theory and practice, and political rhetoric. At the time of his death, his unfinished works included books on consensus and on the political thought of founding father James Wilson. Graham was very active in the political science profession and played a role in the creation of the Foundations of Political Theory section of the American Political Science Association. He was also a founding member of the Committee on Conceptual and Terminological Analysis (COCTA), a research committee of the International Political Science Association. Graham co-edited two books: The Post-Behavioral Era: Perspectives on Political Science (1972, co-editor George W. Carey), and Founding Principles of American Government: Two Hundred Years of Democracy on Trial (1977, co-editor Scarlett G. Graham). Fellowships In 1995-96, he was awarded a Fulbright and spent the year as Distinguished John Marshall Chair at the Budapest University of Economic Sciences (now Corvinus University of Budapest), in Hungary. He was also a recipient of a Guggenheim fellowship. Throughout his career he was active in a number of National Endowment for the Humanities-funded programs, including conferences on narrative and Greek culture. Further reading *In memoriam by W.

Early life Macpherson, the 3rd son of the Rev. William Macpherson, was born in 1858 at the Manse of Kilmuir Easter in Ross-shire, Scotland. He received his education at Fettes College, Edinburgh, and the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated in classics in 1879; M.B., C.M. in 1882. While at Edinburgh he was a boxing champion and a talented gymnast. With the aid of a scholarship he then further studied at T√ºbingen & Leipzig in Germany, in medicine, German and logic. Military career Funerary monument, Brompton Cemetery, London Having been commissioned into the British Army Medical Service his first Imperial tour of service was in India, from thence to a 5-year spell with the Gibraltar garrison, where along with his military duties he acted as the Rock's Medical Officer for Health. Whilst he was there he also found time to be the Editor of the Gibraltar Chronicle and was active in horse-racing and polo matches. Returning to England in 1890 he was appointed DADG, AMD2 at the War Office, a post which he held until 1902. In recognition of services during the Second Boer War, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the South African Honours list published on 26 June 1902. In 1902 he went on a mission to South Africa in the aftermath of the Boer War to see what lessons could be drawn for the Army Medical Service, his paper: Detailed Reports on Sanitary Conditions relating to the proposed Cantonments & Encampments for the Troops in South Africa was resultant. In 1904 he was appointed senior medical officer to the North China Command, and during this posting was attached as an observer with the Japanese Army in Manchuria for 2 years during its operations in that region during the Russo-Japanese War. The results of his experiences produced his Medical & Sanitary Reports from Officers attached to the Japanese Forces in the Field. On return to England in 1907 he joined the staff of the Director of Military Operations at the War Office. Tragedy struck in 1907 with the death of his wife, Elizabeth. In 1910 he was appointed as PMO at Malta, also remarrying this year to Geraldine, the daughter of General Sir John Doran, of Wexford, Ireland. In 1911 he requested and received the appointment as ADMS to the 4th Quetta Division in India, a post which allowed him to join his only son, who was himself then soldiering at the Quetta Imperial Garrison at the time. Whilst in Quetta he also held the post of lecturer at its staff college for 3 years. In early 1914 he returned to England in company with Sir Arthur Sloggett as his deputy on Sloggett's appointment as the director- general of the British Army's Medical Service at the War Office. Macpherson was in consequence appointed DDG AMS in 1914. =World War I= After the entry of England into the opening of the conflict in August 1914, Macpherson relinquished his post at the War Office and entered France on 7 October 1914, with the rank of a brigadier-general in the Army Medical Service Staff, first occupying the post of Advisor attached to the Indian Crops. Whilst with the Indian Corps his only child, Duncan, fell in action whilst serving as a lieutenant with the 7th Gurkha Rifles at Festubert on 23 November 1914 at the age of 25; Macpherson had spoken with him last only a few hours previously. This was the greatest sorrow of Macpherson's life, and he would not discuss the issue ever afterwards. In 1915 he was appointed as Director Medical Services, 1st Army, BEF France. In October 1915 he travelled to Salonika, where he held the post of DMS Salonika British Expeditionary Force. In March 1916 he returned to France to re-join the BEF there and assumed the post of DDGMS at General Headquarters, a position he retained until June 1918, when he was retired as having attained the service age limit. His rank on retirement was as a major-general. During World War I, he was mentioned in despatches nine times, and received honours from France, Italy and the United States. He was known as \\"Tiger Mac\\" on account of his energy and thoroughness. He was later appointed colonel-commandant of the RAMC. Later life Macpherson wrote extensively about wartime medical conditions in the Boer War and World War I, including the official Medical History of the War (HMSO 1922), and also edited Surgery of the War (HMSO, in two volumes). Prior to the war in 1909, he translated from German The Strategical and Tactical Employment of the Medical Service, as Carried Out in an Army Corps; with a Series of Problems by Maximilian Ritter von Hoen. He was a reviewer of other published works and frequent contributor to medical and military journals and reference works being composed. From 1921 to 1926 he was the R.A.M.C. representative on the British Medical Association's Council, and was a member of the Naval & Military Committee from 1921 to 1927.

A program written in high-level language is called source program.These include translations between high-level and human-readable computer languages such as C++ and Java, intermediate-level languages such as Java bytecode, low- level languages such as the assembly language and machine code, and between similar levels of language on different computing platforms, as well as from any of the above to another. The term is also used for translators between software implementations and hardware implementations (ASICs microchips) of the same program, and from software descriptions of a microchip to the logic gates needed to build it.  Different types of translators  There are 3 different types of translators as follows: = Compiler = A compiler is a translator used to convert high-level programming language to low-level programming language. It converts the whole program in one session and reports errors detected after the conversion. The compiler takes time to do its work as it translates high-level code to lower-level code all at once and then saves it to memory. A compiler is processor-dependent and platform-dependent. It has been addressed by alternate names as the following: special compiler, cross-compiler and, source-to-source compiler.https://teachcomputerscience.com/translators/https://www.microcontrollertips.com/compilers- translators-interpreters-assemblers-faq/ = Interpreter = The interpreter is similar to a compiler, it is a translator used to convert high-level programming language to low-level programming language. The difference is that it converts the program one line of code at a time and reports errors when detected, while also doing the conversion. An interpreter is faster than a compiler as it immediately executes the code upon reading the code. It is often used as a debugging tool for software development as it can execute a single line of code at a time.

Marie of Brienne (c. 1224‚Äì1275) was Latin Empress as the wife of Baldwin II of Courtenay. She served as regent during the absence of Baldwin II twice: in 1237‚Äì1239, and in 1243‚Äì1257. Family She was a daughter of John of Brienne and his third wife Berenguela of Leon.Guy Perry, John of Brienne: King of Jerusalem, Emperor of Constantinople, c.1175‚Äì1237, (Cambridge University Press, 2013), 16. Marie was a younger, paternal half- sister of Yolande of Jerusalem. She was also a sister of Alphonso of Brienne. Marriage On 19 April 1229, Marie was betrothed to Baldwin II, junior co- ruler of her father in the throne of the Latin Empire. The marriage was intended to establish a dynastic alliance between the two co-rulers. Marie was at most five-years-old at the time of her betrothal, her parents having married in 1224. Their marriage took place in 1234. The bride was about ten- years-old, the groom seventeen. By her marriage Marie became the junior co- empress of the Latin Empire. The senior one being her mother. Their marriage was recorded in the chronicle of Alberic of Trois-Fontaines. Empress In 1236, Constantinople was besieged by the combined forces of Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria and John III Doukas Vatatzes of the Empire of Nicaea. The city was only defended by its small garrison of knights, the fleet of the Republic of Venice and a minor force sent by Geoffrey II of Villehardouin, Prince of Achaea to reinforce the defense. The city was only spared conquest because of a quarrel between the two allies over who would receive command of the city in the event of a success. John V.A. Fine has suggested that Ivan Asen realised the greater threat posed to the Second Bulgarian Empire by the expansion of Nicaea rather than the weakened Latin Empire.John V.A. Fine, Jr., The Late Medieval Balkans (1987), p. 130 In any case, John of Brienne had taken command of the defense of Constantinople. Baldwin II undertook another mission, heading to Western Europe in attempt of raising the funds and recruiting the armed forces needed to secure the survival of their Empire. John died on 27 March 1237,Alberic of Trois-Fontaines, Chronica Albrici Monachi Trium Fontium, MGH SS XXIII Berenguela following him on 12 April.Obituaires de Sens Tome I.2 of the Abbey de Maubuisson, p. 655 The twelve-year-old Marie was left in nominal command of the city, as the sole representative of the imperial family present in it. Baldwin would not return until July 1239.John V.A. Fine, Jr., The Late Medieval Balkans (1987), page 132 Baldwin returned at the head of a Crusading force from Western Europe, variously estimated to include as few as thirty thousand men or as many as sixty thousand. This force was joined by a contingent of Cumans, combining to besiege Tzurulum, a Nicaean stronghold in Thrace. The city fell in 1240 but this seems to have been the only success of this force. They are not mentioned afterwards. John V.A. Fine presumes that most of them returned to their homes in Western Europe, only a few of them joining the existing garrison of Constantinople. For the moment, the Latin Empire had ensured its continued survival. Marie was approximately fifteen- year-old at the time her husband returned to his capital. On 15 April 1240 (Easter), Baldwin II was crowned emperor in Hagia Sophia. Their only known son, Philip of Courtenay, was born in 1243. However this period of relative peace for the couple was not to last. Baldwin left for the Kingdom in France by the end of 1243, intending to seek support from Louis IX of France. In his absence Marie became regent of the Empire, with Philip of Toucy as her initial co-regent. Philip was a son of Narjot of Toucy and his first wife. His mother was a daughter of Theodore Branas and Agnes of France. Baldwin was absent for several years, first staying in France and then joining Louis IX in the Seventh Crusade. He returned by 8 October 1248, the date of a charter that empowered her to mortgage his western lands in order to pay the huge debt of 24,000 hyperpers.Robert L. Wolff, \\"Mortgage and Redemption of an Emperor's Son: Castile and the Latin Empire of Constantinople\\", Speculum, 29 (1954), p. 60 Within a month of Baldwin's arrival, Marie left Constantinople for Western Europe, assuming they followed the instructions of Blanche of Castile, Marie's great-aunt, who had arranged for her visit and had given Baldwin 20,000 livres in exchange for two promises: not to sell his properties at Namur, and to send Marie to visit her within a month after his return to Constantinople. Baldwin is said to have prepared four armed ships to take Marie and her escort abroad. Marie arrived in Cyprus while Louis IX and the Crusaders were there, only to have a strong wind blow her ship free of its anchor, taking it and all its cargo to Acre, leaving Marie with only the clothes on her back and a cloak. The Crusaders there took care of her. Presumably soon after leaving Cyprus, Marie arrived in Negropont 30 January 1249, from where she reached France in May. According to the Chronique de Flandres, Marie stayed with her great-aunt until Blanche died in 1252, after which, it reports, Marie went to live in her husband's estates at Namur.Wolff, \\"Mortgage and Redemption\\", p. 61 For the next years Marie contested unsuccessfully with Henry of Luxembourg for control of those properties‚Äîwhich were the source of income for both Emperor and Empress‚Äîuntil her cession of these lands and castles 17 June 1258 to Margaret of Flanders. Despite this, the Castle of Namur refused to surrender to Henry of Luxembourg, the vassal of Margaret of Flanders, until St. Vincent's Day (21 January 1259).Wolff, \\"Mortgage and Redemption\\", pp. 62f After this she had gone to the court of Castile where she successfully raised the money to ransom her son Peter, who was held hostage by bankers in Venice and who was released at some date between June 1258 and 1 May 1261.Wolff, \\"Mortgage and Redemption\\", p. 64 Fall of Constantinople The imperial couple would not hold their capital for long. In July 1261, Alexios Strategopoulos, a general of Nicaea, was sent with a small advance force of 800 soldiers, most of them Cumans,Bartusis, Mark C. The Late Byzantine Army: Arms and Society, 1204‚Äì1453 (1997), p. 27. to keep a watch on the Bulgarians and spy out the defences of the Latins.Nicol, Donald M. The Last Centuries of Byzantium 1261‚Äì1453 (1993), p. 34. When the Byzantine force reached the village of Selymbria, they learned from independent local farmers (thelematarioi) that the entire Latin garrison, and the Venetian fleet, were absent conducting a raid against the Nicaean island of Daphnousia.Bartusis, Mark C. The Late Byzantine Army: Arms and Society, 1204‚Äì1453 (1997) (1997), p. 40. Although initially hesitant, due to both the small size of his force, which might be fatal if the Latin army returned, and because he would exceed his orders, Strategopoulos eventually decided not to lose such a golden opportunity to retake the city. On the night of 25 July 1261, Alexios and his men approached the city walls and hid at a monastery near the Pege Gate. Alexios sent a detachment of his men, who, led by some of the thelematarioi, made their way to the city through a secret passage. They attacked the walls from the inside, surprised the guards and opened the gate, allowing the Byzantine force entry into the city. The Latins were taken completely by surprise, and after some fighting, the Byzantine force gained control of the land walls. Fearing the revenge the Byzantines would exact upon them, the Latin inhabitants, from Emperor Baldwin II downwards, hurriedly rushed to the harbour, hoping to escape by ship. Thanks to the timely arrival of the returning Venetian fleet, they were evacuated, but the city was lost for good. Marie presumably managed to flee with her husband. Exile A Venetian ship took Baldwin and Marie to Euboea, from there proceeding to Athens, Apulia and then back to France. In the following years they survived by selling their de facto and de jure rights to various secondary titles and lands. On 26 March 1263, their rights to Namur were bought by Guy of Dampierre.Kerrebrouck, Patrick van, Les Cap√©tiens (2000), p. 462. Namur was at the time actually held by Henry V of Luxembourg but Guy would successfully conquer it by 1268. In January 1266, their rights to the Kingdom of Thessalonica were bought by Hugh IV, Duke of Burgundy for 13,000 livres tournois.Mihail-Dimitri Sturdza, Dictionnaire historique et G√©n√©alogique des grandes familles de Gr√®ce, d'Albanie et de Constantinople (1983), p. 489. At the time the city was under the control of Michael VIII Palaiologos, the Nicaean emperor who had moved his capital to Constantinople, while the title was also claimed by William VII, Marquess of Montferrat. On 27 May 1267, the Treaty of Viterbo, transferred much of the rights to the Latin Empire fiefs from Baldwin II to Charles I of Sicily.John V.A. Fine, Jr., The Late Medieval Balkans (1987), page 170 Charles was to be confirmed in possession of Corfu and some cities in Albania. He was also given suzerainty over the Principality of Achaea and sovereignty of the Aegean Islands, excepting those held by Venice and Lesbos, Chios, Samos, and Amorgos. Baldwin and Marie spend the rest of their lives in the court of Charles. In October 1273, Baldwin died in Naples. Marie survived him by about two years. She was buried in Assisi.

Excerpt from the missal, a liturgical book, of the Sint-Pieters abbey (Ghent), manufactured in the 13th century. Manuscript preserved in the Ghent University Library. A liturgical book, or service book, is a book published by the authority of a church body that contains the text and directions for the liturgy of its official religious services. Roman Rite Early 16th-century choirbook with Josquin's Missa de Beata Virgine (Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, MS Cappella Sistina 45, folios 1v‚Äì2r.). A decorative 14th century Missal of English origin, F. 1r. Sherbrooke Missal In the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, the primary liturgical books are the Roman Missal, which contains the texts of the Mass, and the Roman Breviary, which contains the text of the Liturgy of the Hours. With the 1969 reform of the Roman Missal by Pope Paul VI, now called the \\"Ordinary Use of the Roman Rite\\", the Scriptual readings were expanded considerably, requiring a separate book, known as the Lectionary. The Roman Ritual contains the texts of the sacraments other than the Mass, such as baptism, the sacrament of penance, the anointing of the sick, and the sacrament of marriage. The texts for the sacraments and ceremonies only performed by bishops, such as confirmation and Holy Orders, are contained within the Roman Pontifical. The Caeremoniale Episcoporum (The Ceremonial of Bishops)Caeremoniale Episcoporum ex decreto Sacrosancti Oecumenici Concilii Vaticani II instauratum, auctoritate Pauli Ioannis Pauli II promulgatum describes in greater detail than the ordinary liturgical books the ceremonies involved when a bishop presides over the celebration of Mass, the celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours or of the Word of God, particular Masses such as Candlemas, Palm Sunday or the Easter Vigil, the other sacraments, sacramentals, pastoral visitations etc. The Roman Martyrology gives an account of all the saints (not only martyrs) commemorated in the Church each day. Other Roman-Rite liturgical books include the Roman Gradual and the Gospel Book or Evangeliary. The Catholic Church is composed of 24 autonomous particular churches, the largest of which is the Latin or Western Church. The other 23 churches are collectively called the Eastern Catholic Churches, and use a variety of liturgical rites such as the Alexandrian Rite, Antiochene Rite, Armenian Rite, Byzantine Rite, and the East Syriac Rite among others. While the Roman Rite of the Western Church is by far the most common liturgical rite found within the Latin Church, a number of local Western (but not Roman) rites and uses also exist. Byzantine Rite An altar server holds the Chinovnik for an Orthodox bishop during divine services. The Rite of Constantinople, observed by the Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite, represents one of the most highly developed liturgical traditions in Christendom. While the Roman Catholic Liturgy of the Hours may be published in a single-volume breviary, such a feat is hardly possible for the Byzantine Rite, which requires quite a large library of books to chant the daily services. The regular services chanted in the Constantinopolitan liturgical tradition are the Canonical Hours and the Divine Liturgy. There are, in addition, occasional services (baptism, confession, etc.) and intercessory or devotional services (molieben, panikhida), which are not chanted on a daily basis, but according to need. The fixed portions of the services are called acolouthia (Greek: akolouthies, ; Slavonic: posledovanie), into which the sequences (changeable portions) are inserted., p. 12 The sequences can also be referred to as propers The sequences are governed by the convergence of several liturgical cycles, including the Paschal Cycle (movable cycle, dependent upon the variable date of Easter) and the Menaion (fixed cycle, dependent upon the calendar date). =Acolouthia= The fixed portions of the services are found in the following liturgical books: *Horologion (Greek: Œ©œÅŒøŒªœåŒ≥ŒπŒøŒΩ; Slavonic: Chasoslov, –ß–∞—Åoc–ªo–≤—ä), or Book of Hours, provides the fixed portions of the services as used by the reader and the chanters. For the sake of convenience, some small portions of the sequences are often included as well, such as feast day troparia, kontakia, and those portions which change according to the day of the week. The Horologion may also contain some devotional material such as the Prayers Before Communion, Thanksgiving After Communion, and Morning and Evening Prayers. *Euchologion (Greek: ŒïœÖœáŒøŒªœåŒ≥ŒπŒøŒΩ, Eukhologion; Slavonic: –°–ª—π–∂–µ–±–Ω–∏–∫—ä, Sluzhebnik)--Contains the fixed portions of the services which are said by the priest and deacon, as well as some of the variable portions which the clergy use, such as prokeimena and dismissals. The Great Euchologion contains the clergy parts of Vespers, Matins, the three Divine Liturgies, Compline and Midnight Office, the Lenten Hours. It also contains the complete services (including the parts for reader and chanters) for the Sacred Mysteries (Sacraments), Funeral, Monastic Tonsure, Consecration of a Church, and other occasional services. For convenience, the contents of the Great Euchologion in the Slavic tradition have been divided up as follows: **Litourgicon (Slavonic: Sluzhebnik)--contains Vespers, Matins and the three Divine Liturgies **Archieratikon (Slavonic: Chinovnik)--contains the parts of services performed by a bishop **Euchologion (Slavonic: Trebnik)--omits the portions contained in the Litourgicon and Archieratikon, and adds other minor acolouthia (such as the blessing of an Iconostasis, Holy Vessels, Vestments, etc.)Kovalchuk, op. cit, p. 14 =Sequences= Into this fixed framework, numerous movable parts of the service are inserted. These are taken from a variety of liturgical books: *Psalter (Greek: Œ®Œ±ŒªœÑŒÆœÅŒπŒøŒΩ, Psalterion; Slavonic: —∞–∞–ª—Ç—ã—Ä—å or —∞–∞–ª—Ç–∏—Ä—å, Psaltyr' ) - A book containing the 150 Psalms divided into KathismataThere is also a Psalm 151 included in the Orthodox Psalter, though it is not actually chanted during the Divine Services. together with the Biblical Canticles which are chanted at Matins.Originally, these canticles were chanted in their entirety every day, but they gradually came to be replaced by the Canon and are now normally only chanted on weekdays of Great Lent. The Psalter is used at Vespers and Matins,During Great Lent, Kathismata are read at the Little Hours also. and normally contains tables for determining which Kathismata are to be read at each service, depending upon the day of the week and the liturgical season of the year. *Octoechos (Greek: Œ†Œ±œÅŒ±Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ, Paraklƒìtikƒì; Slavonic: –û–∫—Ç–æ–∏—Ö—ä, Oktoikh or –û—Å–º–æ–≥–ª–∞—Å–Ω–∏–∫—ä, Osmoglasnik) - Literally, the Book of the \\"Eight Tones\\" or modes. This book contains an eight-week cycle, providing texts to be chanted for every day of the week at Vespers, Matins, Compline and (on Sundays) the Midnight Office. Each week, the hymns are sung in a different liturgical Mode or Tone. The origins of this book go back to compositions by St. John Damascene. *Menaion (Greek: ŒúŒ∑ŒΩŒ±ŒØŒøŒΩ; Slavonic: –ú–∏–Ω–µ—ß, Mineya) - A twelve-volume set which provides all liturgical texts for each day of the calendar year (including the akrosticha for the Irmologion).On non-leap years, the service for February 29 (St. John Cassian) may be chanted at Compline on Feb. 28 or some other more convenient day. The twelve volumes correspond to the months of the year. The liturgical year begins in September, so the first volume of the Menaion is September. *Sticherarion (Greek: Œ£œÑŒπœáŒ∑œÅŒ±œÅŒπ·Ω∏ŒΩ, today ŒîœåŒæŒ±œÉœÑŒ±œÅŒπŒøŒΩ) was called a chant book usually with musical notation. It is subdivided in the stichera for the cycle of the fixed feasts according to the yearly cycle between September and August (Menaion). The cycle of mobile feast is subdivided into two books. The first called Triodion contains the stichera sung during Lent and the Holy week, the second called Pentecostarion contains the post-paschal period between Easter and Pentecost, the weekly cycle after Pentecost until the Sunday of All Saints. **Triodion (Greek: Œ§œÅŒπ·ø¥Œ¥ŒπŒøŒΩ, Triodion; Slavonic: –ü–æ—Å—Ç–Ω–∞—ß –¢—Ä—óœâ–¥—å, Postnaya Triod' ; Romanian: Triodul)--Also called the Lenten Triodion. During Great Lent the services undergo profound changes. The Lenten Triodion contains propers for: ***the Pre-Lenten Season ***the Forty Days of Great Lent itself ***Lazarus Saturday and Palm Sunday ***Holy Week **Pentecostarion (Greek: Œ†ŒµŒΩœÑŒ∑Œ∫ŒøœÉœÑŒ¨œÅŒπŒøŒΩ, Pentekostarion; Slavonic: –¶–≤—£—Ç–Ω–∞—ß –¢—Ä—óœâ–¥—å, Tsvetnaya Triod' , literally \\"Flowery Triodon\\"; Romanian: Penticostar) - This volume contains the propers for the period from Pascha to the Sunday of All Saints. This period can be broken down into the following periods: ***Bright Week (Easter Week) ‚Äì The seven days from the Pascha (Easter Sunday) through the following Saturday ***Paschal Season ‚Äì The period from Thomas Sunday until Ascension ***Ascension and its Afterfeast ***Pentecost and its Afterfeast ***All Saints Sunday (the Sunday after Pentecost) *Synaxarion (Greek: Œ£œÖŒΩŒ±ŒæŒ¨œÅŒπŒøŒΩ; Romanian: Sinaxar) - The Synaxarion contains brief lives of the saints for each day of the year, usually read at Matins. *Irmologion (Greek: ŒïŒπœÅŒºŒøŒªœåŒ≥ŒπŒøŒΩ, Heirmologion; Slavonic: –ò—Ä–º–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–π, Irmologii) - Contains the Irmoi chanted at the Canon of Matins and other services. *Gospel Book (Greek: ŒïœÖŒ±Œ≥Œ≥Œ≠ŒªŒπŒøŒΩ, Evangelion) - Book containing the Gospel readings that are used at Matins, Divine Liturgy, and other services. Among the Greeks the Evang√©lion is laid out in order of the cycle of readings as they occur in the ecclesiastical year, with a section in the back providing the Gospel readings for Matins, Feasts and special occasions. In the Slavic usage, the Evang√©lion contains the four gospels in canonical order (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) with annotations in the margin to indicate the beginning and ending of each reading (and an index in the back). *Epistle Book (Greek: ŒëœÄœåœÉœÑŒøŒªŒøœÇ, Apostolos; Slavonic: –ê–ø–æ—Å—Ç–æ–ª—ä, Apostol) - Contains the readings from the Epistles and the Acts of the Apostles (the Apocalypse is not read during Divine Services in the Orthodox Church). It also contains the Prokeimenon and Alleluia verses that are chanted with the readings. The Apost√≥l is laid out in the same manner as the Evang√©lion, depending on whether the book was prepared for the Greek or Slavic usage.The Slavonic Apost√≥l will have all of the books of the New Testament (excluding the Gospels and Apocalypse) in their entirety, though not in the same order they are found in most English Bibles (Acts is placed first, etc.). =Other= *Typicon (Greek: Œ§œÖœÄŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ, Typikon; Slavonic: –¢—µ–ø–∏–∫—ä, Typik)--The book which ties all of the above together. It contains all of the rubrics, i.e., the rules for the performance of the Divine Services, giving directions for every possible combination of the materials from the other liturgical books into the Daily Cycle of Services. Many churches also publish annual liturgical calendars which give detailed instructions from the Typicon which are specific to the concurrence of sequences for that particular year. *Collections (Greek: ŒëŒΩŒ∏ŒøŒªœåŒ≥ŒπŒøŒΩ, Anthologion; Slavonic: –°–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫—ä, Sbornik)--There are numerous smaller anthologies available, taking portions from the books mentioned above, or from other sources. For instance, the Festal Menaion contains only those portions of the Menaion that have to do with the Great Feasts; and the General Menaion contains propers for each class of saints (with blank spaces for the name of the saint) which may be employed when one does not have the propers for that particular saint; etc. There are many different editions of these books which have been published over the years in a variety of liturgical languages. In Greek the Orthodox books are published at the Ph≈ìnix Press (formerly located in Venice, now at Patras), the Uniate books are published by the Congregation for the Oriental Churches. Each national Church has further its own editions in its liturgical language. There are also books of all kinds which collect and arrange materials from the list of books above into compendiums by various editors. The Uniate compendiums have a natural tendency to imitate the arrangement of the Roman books. Assyrian The books of the Church of the East, all in Syriac, are the Liturgy (containing their three liturgies), the Gospel (Evangelion), Apostle (Shlicha) and Lessons (Kariane), the \\"Turgama\\" (Interpretation), containing hymns sung by deacons at the liturgy (our Graduals and Sequences), the David (Dawidha = Psalter), \\"Khudhra\\" (= \\"cycle\\", containing antiphons, responsories, hymns, and collects for all Sundays), \\"Kash K√µl\\" (= \\"Collection of all\\"; the same chants for week-days), \\"Kdham u-Wathar\\" (= \\"Before and after\\"; certain prayers, psalms, and collects most often used, from the other books), \\"Gezza\\" (\\"Treasury\\", services for feast-days), Abu-Halim (the name of the compiler, containing collects for the end of the Nocturns on Sundays), \\"Bautha d'Ninwaie\\" (= \\"Prayer of the Ninevites\\", a collection of hymns ascribed to St. Ephrem the Syrian, used in Lent). The Baptism Office (\\"Taksa d'Amadha\\") is generally bound up with the Liturgies. The \\"Taksa d'Siamidha\\" has the ordination services. The \\"Taksa d'Husaia\\" contains the office for Penance, the \\"Kthawa d'Burrakha\\" is the marriage service, the \\"Kahneita\\", the burial of clergy, the \\"Annidha\\" that of laymen. Lastly the \\"Khamis\\" and \\"Warda\\" are further collections of hymns (see Badger, \\"The Nestorians and their Rituals\\", London, 1852, II, 16‚Äì25). Naturally not every church possesses this varied collection of books. The most necessary ones are printed by the Anglican missionaries at Urmi for the \\"Nestorian\\" Christians. The Chaldean Catholic books are printed, some at Propaganda, some by the Dominicans at Mosul (\\"Missale chaldaicum\\", 1845; \\"Manuale Sacerdotum\\", 1858; \\"Breviarium chaldaicum\\", 1865). A Chaldean \\"Breviary\\" was published in three vohunes at Paris in 1886‚Äì7, edited by P√®re Bedgan, a missionary of the Congr√©gation des Missions. The Malabar Christians deemed heretics by Rome use the traditional books of the Church of the East, and the \\"Uniate\\" Chaldean Catholics have books revised (much Latinized) by the Synod of Diamper (1599; it ordered all their old books to be burned). The Malabar Catholic \\"Missal\\" was published at Rome in 1774, the \\"Ordo rituum et lectionum\\" in 1775. Coptic Coptic lectionary with Bohairic script on the left hand of the page and Arabic on the right. The Coptic Books (in Coptic with Arabic rubrics, and generally with the text transliterated in Arabic characters too) are the Euchologion (Kit√£b al- Khulagi almuqaddas), very often (but quite wrongly) called Missal. This corresponds to the Byzantine Euchologion. The Coptic equivalent of the Horologion is the Agpeya. Then the Lectionary called Katam√£rus; the Synaks√£r, containing legends of saints; the \\"Deacon's Manual\\"; an Antiphonary (called Difn√£ri); the Psalter, Theotokia (containing offices of the Virgin Mary); Doxologia; collections of hymns for the choir and a number of smaller books for the various other offices. The Coptic Orthodox Church has a very sumptuously printed set of their books, edited by Gladios Labib, published at Cairo (Katam√£rus, 1900‚Äì2; Euchologion, 1904; Funeral Service, 1905). These books were first grouped and arranged for the Coptic Catholic Church by Raphael Tuki, and printed at Rome in the eighteenth century. Their arrangement is obviously an imitation of that of the Latin service-books (Missale coptice et arabice, 1736; Diurnum alexandrinum copto-arabicum, 1750; Pontificale et Euchologium, 1761, 1762; Rituale coptice et arabice, 1763; Theotokia, 1764). Cyril II, the Uniate Coptic patriarch, published a \\"missal\\", \\"ritual\\", and \\"Holy Week book\\" (Cairo, 1898‚Äì1902). Ethiopian The Ethiopian service books are, with the exception of the Eucharistic Liturgy (the Missal), the least known of any. Hardly anything of them has been published, and no one seems yet to have made a systematic investigation of liturgical manuscripts in Abyssinia. Since the Ethiopic or Ge'ez Rite is derived from the Coptic, their books correspond more or less to the Coptic books. Peter the Ethiopian (Petrus Ethyops) published the Liturgy with the baptism service and some blessings at the end of his edition of the Ethiopic New Testament (Tasfa Sion, Rome, 1548). Various students have published fragments of the Rite in Europe (cf. Chaine, \\"Grammaire √©thiopienne\\", Beirut, 1907; bibliography, p. 269), but these can hardly be called service-books. Syrian The Syriac Orthodox (Jacobite) and Catholic-Syrian liturgical books have never been published as a whole. A fragment of the liturgy was published in Syriac and Latin at Antwerp (1572) by Fabricius Boderianus (D. Seven alexandrini . . . de ritibus baptismi et sacr√¶ Synaxis). The Syrian Catholics have a Euchologion (Syriac and Karshuni), published at Rome in 1843 (Missale Syriacum), and a \\"Book of clerks used in the ecclesiastical ministries\\" (Liber ministerii, Syriac only, Beirut, 1888). The Divine Office, collected like a Breviary, was published at Mosul in seven volumes (1886‚Äì96), the ferial office alone at Rome in 1853, and at Sharfi in the Lebanon (1898). A Ritual ‚Äì \\"Book of Ceremony\\" ‚Äì for the Syrian Uniats is issued by the Jesuits at Beirut. Maronite The Maronites have an abundance of liturgical books for their divine liturgy. The Maronite Synod at Deir al- Luweize (1736) committed a uniform preparation of all their books to the patriarch (Part II, Sess. I, xiii, etc.) These books are all referred to in Western or Latin terms (Missal, Ritual, Pontifical, etc.). The Missal (in this case the name is not incorrect) was published at Rome in 1592 and 1716, since then repeatedly, in whole or in part, at Beirut. Little books containing the Ordinary of the Liturgy with the Anaphora commonly used are issued by many Catholic booksellers at Beirut. The \\"Book of the Minister\\" (containing the deacon's and other ministers' parts of the Liturgy) was published at Rome in 1596 and at Beirut in 1888. The \\"Ferial Office\\", called Fard, \\"Burden\\" or \\"Duty\\" (the only one commonly used by the clergy), was issued at Rome in 1890, at Beirut in 1900. The whole Divine Office began to be published at Rome in 1666, but only two volumes of the summer part appeared. A Ritual with various additional prayers was issued at Rome in 1839. All Maronite books are in Syriac and Karshuni. Armenian Armenian liturgical manuscript, 13th century, Kilikia. The Armenian Liturgical Books are quite definitely drawn up, arranged, and authorized. They are the only other set among Eastern Churches whose arrangement can be compared to those of the Byzantines. There are eight official Armenian service-books: #the Directory, or Calendar, corresponding to the Byzantine Typikon, #the Manual of Mysteries of the Sacred Oblation (= a Euchologion), #the Book of Ordinations, often bound up with the former, #the Lectionary, #the Hymn-book (containing the variable hymns of the Liturgy), #the Book of Hours (containing the Divine Office and, generally, the deacon's part of the Liturgy), #the Book of Canticles (containing the hymns of the Office), #the Mashdotz, or Ritual (containing the rites of the sacraments). The books of both the Armenian Apostolic Church (Oriental-Orthodox) and Armenian Catholic Church have been published a great number of times; the latest Orthodox editions are those of Constantinople and Jerusalem, the Catholic ones have been issued at Rome, Vienna, and especially Venice (at the Monastery of San Lazaro). There are many extracts from them, especially from the Liturgy. Anglican In the wake of the English Reformation, a reformed liturgy was introduced into the Church of England. The first liturgical book published for general use throughout the church was the Book of Common Prayer of 1549, edited by Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury. The work of 1549 was the first prayer book to contain the forms of service for daily and Sunday worship in English and to do so within a single volume; it included morning prayer, evening prayer, the Litany, and Holy Communion. The book included the other occasional services in full: the orders for baptism, confirmation, marriage, 'prayers to be said with the sick' and a funeral service. It set out in full the Epistle and Gospel readings for the Sunday Communion Service. Set Old Testament and New Testament readings for daily prayer were specified in tabular format as were the set Psalms; and canticles, mostly biblical, that were provided to be sung between the readings.Careless, Sue, Discovering the Book of Common Prayer: A hands-on approach (Volume 1:Daily Prayer), Toronto: Anglican Book Center Publishing, Numerous editions have followed, and currently throughout the Anglican Communion, various Books of Common Prayer are published by the different Anglican provinces. Other official books are published by the member churches for the official use of their churches, such as the Lectionary, Book of Occasional Services, etc. =Anglo-Catholic= In the late 1800s, as part of the Anglo-Catholic movement, the Anglican Missal was published, to provide a particular way, drawn from the Sarum Use, of celebrating the Eucharist according to Anglican liturgical tradition. Many Anglo-Catholic parishes use the Anglican Missal, or some variation of it such as the English Missal, for the celebration of the Eucharist. Variations include the Anglican Service Book and A Manual of Anglo-Catholic Devotion, and the directive books A Priest's Handbook by Dennis Michno and Ceremonies of the Eucharist by Howard E. Galley. All of these books (with the exception of Manual) are intended primarily for celebration of the Eucharist. They contain meditations for the presiding celebrant(s) during the liturgy, and other material such as the rite for the blessing of palms on Palm Sunday, propers for special feast days, and instructions for proper ceremonial order. These books are used as a more expansively Catholic context in which to celebrate the liturgical use found in the Book of Common Prayer and related liturgical books. Lutheran Martin Luther was in favor of preserving the Mass of the Church and, other than translating it into the vernacular language of the people, he made very few changes to the liturgy. Over the centuries since the days of the Reformation, the many diverging branches of Lutheran denominations ‚Äì despite developing a wide swath of differing core beliefs, have maintained and cherished the liturgy and its ancient roots. Owing to its widespread diaspora of branches, and especially because of the wide variety of regional languages, customs, and beliefs, there have been many different books of Worship prepared and used by congregations worldwide.Lutheranforum.org Besides the formal liturgy itself, Lutheran worship books usually contain the orders for the minor services during the week, such as Vespers, Morning Prayer, and Compline, along with large sections of hymns, Psalms, and prayers and other needed information for the correct following of the liturgical calendar. One particular Lutheran hymnal, used by the Moderate/Liberal Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the largest Lutheran denomination in the U.S., is Evangelical Lutheran Worship. The ELW (as it is called) is also used by a few smaller denominations as well, but is mostly frowned upon by more conservative Lutheran bodies, which use their own versions.Lutheranliturgy.org Methodist John Wesley, the Anglican priest who was a principal leader of the early Methodist revival, wrote that When the Methodists in America were separated from the Church of England because of the American Revolution, John Wesley himself provided a revised version of The Book of Common Prayer called the Sunday Service of the Methodists in North America. Wesley's Sunday Service has shaped the official liturgies of the Methodists ever since. For this reason, Methodist liturgy is clearly Anglican in its character, though Methodists have generally allowed for more flexibility and freedom in how the liturgy is celebrated than is typical of Anglican churches. Today, the primary liturgical books of the United Methodist Church are The United Methodist Hymnal and The United Methodist Book of Worship, along with their non-English counterparts. These worship books contain the liturgies of the church that are generally derived from Wesley's Sunday Service and from the 20th Century liturgical renewal movement. They also contain the hymnody of the Church, which has always been an important part of Methodist worship.

Biography Scholars had originally placed his birthdate to be c. 1760, but Birchall's age in a 1772 deposition is given as \\"22 years or thereabouts\\".Rabin and Zohn, 126. Born in London, he may have been apprenticed by 1771 to William Randall, the cousin and one of the successors of printer John Walsh. In 1783, he partnered with a one \\"T. Beardmore\\" as Beardmore & Birchall before leaving for another partnership with Hugh Andrews that same year. He issued publications under the names Birchall & Andrews and Birchall & Co. from 1783 to May 1789 when the partnership was dissolved, Andrews taking on the business by himself.Kidson, Smith, and Jones. From 1789 onward, Birchall continued alone in publishing works, operating out of his address at Bond Street. Birchall enjoyed a collaboration with composer Ludwig van Beethoven, which began in May 1805 with the publication of Beethoven's Violin Sonata in A major (Op. 47). Birchall also published the original English editions of the piano adaption of Wellington's Victory (Op. 91), the Violin Sonata in G Major (Op. 96), the Piano Trio in B flat major (Op. 97), and Anton Diabelli's piano adaptation of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7. He purchased the copyrights for these four works from Beethoven in 1815. During his later years, Birchall's correspondence with Beethoven also mentioned other possible projects, but these never came to fruition; this was partly a result of Beethoven's high fees and Birchall's declining health.Clive, 33. In addition to Beethoven's works, Birchall printed various glees, country dance books, and Italian vocal works. He also published works by George Frideric Handel and Johann Sebastian Bach, including the first English edition of the Well- Tempered Clavier in 1810 edited by Samuel Wesley and Charles Frederick Horn. After Birchall's death, his employee Christopher Lonsdale took over the firm. Notes References *Clive, Peter (2001). Beethoven and His World: A Biographical Dictionary.

Thanks to the scouting of Vojmir Kaƒçiƒá, he quickly came to Hajduk Split. Vedran made his debut in November 1972 against Sloboda Tuzla. He was the youngest member of the Hajduk golden generation and would be the last one of them to leave the club later. Ro≈æiƒá played technically beautiful football and at the beginning he played as a left back. During the Branko Zebec years, he played in the midfield. Later he became a left center back where he was good at attacking counter play and had good marking against enemy strikers. Later in his career he played as a sweeper. He played the Backenbauer role perfectly. He was known for his elegance in front of the keeper. He could easily jump in the 11 meter box and return the ball to the keeper. Many defenders in Yugoslavia would try to copy that style. He was not an aggressive player, he didn't talk much to the press and was very moderate. During the 70s when Hajduk players such as ≈†urjak,Mu≈æiniƒá and ≈Ωungul were superstars, he would drive every day after training to his house in Trogir and would ignore the media attention.

Residential development therefore started after the commuter train services were introduced.Lang√•rd & Ruud: 56 From 1885 this train was operated with a Class 13 locomotive. It proved to be underpowered, so a larger locomotive was taken into use instead. As there was no turntable at Lian, the locomotive was forced to back on the return to Christiania.Lang√•rd & Ruud: 72 A commuter train departing the station The station developed as the center of the community at Ljan. It was located close to the general store, while the post office was operated as part of the railway station. There was a newspaper kiosk at the station. A small garden was kept by the railway company at the southern end of the station. This was frequently used as a playground. Initially there were four daily trains per direction per day,Henriksen: 92 with a twenty-minute travel time to Oslo.Henriksen: 94 Throughout the 1890s the population increased, leading to a steady increase in the number of commuter trains to Lian.Lang√•rd & Ruud: 75 By 1893 there were 17 trains per direction per day.Lang√•rd & Ruud: 78 By 1894 the population at Ljan had reached 430. In addition to passenger transport, wood from Enebakk was carried overland to Ljan and then freighted by rail to the city. Next door was a coaching inn which had a restaurant.Henriksen: 130 The train station's spelling was changed from Lian to Ljan on April 1894.Bjerke & Holom: 40 From 1895 some of the trains were extended to Kullebunden (later renamed Kolbotn Station). Ljan was one of the first Norwegian stations to receive an interlocking system, on 1 January 1901. This was a limited system which was not fail proof, so the operation had to manually control that they did not place the switches in a conflicting manner.Lang√•rd & Ruud: 88 Gerhard Fischer's station building with the Oslofjord Work on a new route between Ljan and Holm started in 1917. It involved demolishing the Ljan Viaduct south of the station and rerouting the line via a new Hauketo Station. The realignment of the route made it necessary to build a new station at Ljan. At the same time the route past the station was rebuilt to double track. Just south of Ljan Station the Sole Tunnel was built‚Äîthe first double-track tunnel in Norway.Lang√•rd & Ruud: 117 The original station building was replaced with a new station building designed by Gerhard Fischer at NSB Arkitektkontor. The old station was bought as a private residence and moved to Herreg√•rdsveien 6B.Henriksen: 127 A complete interlocking system became operational on 12 May 1926. Electrification of the √òstfold Line started in the 1930s, and the section from Oslo to Ljan was completed on 9 December 1936 and from Ljan to Kolbotn on 18 January 1937.Lang√•rd & Ruud: 121 The station became unmanned in 1988. Operation of the station building was taken over by Ljan Vel, a residents' association. A caf√© was opened in the station building in 1996. The Norwegian National Rail Administration upgraded the information system in 2010, including new speakers, information boards with real-time information. Facilities The station still largely has the same layout and structures as in 1923 Ljan Station is situated from Oslo Central Station, at an elevation of above mean sea level. The √òstfold Line past Ljan is double track and electrified, with the station partially located in a curve. The station has two side platforms. Track 1, closest to the station, has a platform, while Track 2's is . They are tall, respectively. There is an underpass under the tracks, with original Neoclassical entrances. There is bicycle and car parking, but no ticket vending machine. The two-story, brick station building was designed by Gerhard Fischer. As it was a single order, the station has a Neoclassical design which does not have any similar buildings elsewhere on the railway network, in part due to the short-lived popularity of the style in Norway.Hartmann: 90 The station is listed as a cultural heritage.Hartmann: 133 Prior to receiving the project, Fischer had recently been in Italy and brought home inspiration from there. The station's two-story part is rectangular and almost symmetrical. The single-story annexes on both sides break with the symmetry. In its original layout the ground floor featured a waiting room, ticket office, post office and a cargo facility. The upper story was originally a station master's residence.Hartmann: 91 The station building measures .NSB Arkitektkontor: 43 On the road side of the station there is a preserved Neoclassical brick superstructure which covers the stairs down to the underpass. There is a smaller superstructure on the other platform. The upper floor of the former housed the signaling control until the installation of centralized traffic control.NSB Arkitektkontor: 44 Both of these structures are also preserved. There is also a disused wooden cargo building at the station.NSB Arkitektkontor: 46 Service NSB Class 73 train passing through the station in 2006. Only commuter trains call at Ljan. The station is served by line L2 of the Oslo Commuter Rail, operated by the Norwegian State Railways. During regular hours this involves two trains per hour per direction which run from Ski Station via the √òstfold Line to Oslo Central Station and onward to Sk√∏yen Station. Ljan is not served by the L2x express services. Travel time is 8 minutes to Oslo S and 26 minutes to Ski. Despite the double track, the √òstfold Line past Ljan has reached its capacity limitation due to the mix of commuter, regional and freight trains. The Follo Line is scheduled for completion in 2021. It will allow regional trains to bypass the √òstfold Line between Oslo and Ski, freeing up capacity. This will allow the L2 service to increase to at least four hourly services from the early 2020s.

The station opened on 15 February 1925, after the √òstfold Line had been moved to avoid the Ljan Viaduct. Its original wooden station building is now a pizzeria. The station has been unmanned since 1980. Eight Ruter bus lines feed the station. History When √òstfold Line opened in 1879 it followed a more westerly right-of-way through Holm. The line passed over Ljansdalen on the Ljan Viaduct.

There were some condominiums, but the neighborhood consisted for the most part of single dwellings. The train had a major competitor in a bus route. Prinsdalsruten was established in 1928 and started serving the Prinsdal area. It continued past Hauketo and then drove Mosseveien into the city center. It took the name Oslo og Folle Busstrafikk in 1964. The patronage shifted between the bus and trains. Mosseveien was increasingly congested and the could often take 40 minutes.

Although he died at age 38, Klusemann left behind an extensive body of work.  Art  Georg Klusemann belongs to a group of artists such as Werner Gilles, Eduard Bargheer or Gerhard Hoehme, whose work reflects their adoption of Italian culture. He studied at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf under Teo Otto, from 1962 to 1968, with Katharina Sieverding and J√∂rg Immendorff. After extensive travels to Spain, the Orient and Latin America, his work gained a clear original profile (Hans M. SchmidtHans M. Schmidt: Welttheater, Backstage oder die Sch√∂nheit und das Verborgene: Zu Werk und Leben von Georg Klusemann, in: Georg Klusemann, 2 vols. (referred to as \\"Gesamtwerk\\"), 2000, 9-74). Impulses from contemporary European Art can be traced to Joan Mir√≥, Victor Vasarely, Giorgio Morandi or Domenico Gnoli, to Surrealism or OpArt. But the impulses are transformed and integrated into a unique concept that cannot be associated to any known current in Art. Critics have called him \\"Baroque\\" (Joachim Burmeister), \\"Indefatigable and fantastic\\" (Vittorio Sgarbi), \\"Arcimboldesque\\" (Heiner Stachelhaus), \\"an oscillator between abstraction and realism, narrative and representation, elusiveness and application\\" (Dieter RonteDieter Ronte: Verit√† come metafora, in: Orbis sensualium pictus: Diciotti autori per Georg Klusemann, Pisa 1991, 15ff, first 1989), or a \\"legitimator of computer art\\" (Giampiero PavanatiGiampiero Pavanti: La risoluzione nelle opere di Georg Klusemann, in: La meccanica della illusione, catalogue for the exhibition at the Museo Palazzo Bagatti Valsecchi, Milan, 1988). Patrick Waldberg, the major biographer of surrealism, wrote of Klusemann's work that it is \\"full of waving drapes, flying boxes, objects coming up in the air, swelling balloons, windows bursting open, instruments coming to life and all this according to a harmony beyond logic\\".Patrick Waldberg: Georg Klusemann: La stanza incantata, in: Orbis sensualium pictus, op. cit., 13ff, first 1972 Georg's biographer Hans M.

To decipher the intricacies of these images one must learn to accept ones judgement as always temporary and never ultimate.\\"Klaus Honnef in: Georg Klusemann: Bilder, Zeichnungen, Collagen, Graphik 1967-1981, ed. Kunstverein f√ºr die Rheinlande und Westfalen, D√ºsseldorf 1983 Georg Klusemann worked as a painter, drawer, etcher, and author of children books. His oeuvre comprises at least 350 canvases, 330 etchings, hundreds of drawings, gouaches and water colors, as well as poems and fables. His children books were published by Beltz & Gelberg and Peter Hammer Verlag and are still part of school curricula in German elementary schools because of their playful and imaginative approach to intercultural communication. After several monographies about his work and more than 20 catalogues, the complete works were published in two volumes by Hatje Cantz Verlag in the year 2000. Georg Klusemann's paintings and etchings have been the object of more than 40 exhibitions in France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Venezuela and the U.S.A. The major retrospectives have taken place at the Museum Folkwang in Essen, the Kunstverein f√ºr die Rheinlande und Westfalen in D√ºsseldorf, at the Goethe- Institut New York, at the Bagatti Valsecchi Museum in Milan and at the Museo d'arte contemporanea Villa CroceItalian Infopage on this exhibition in Genua. His works are part of the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Albertina in Vienna, the Rheinische Landesmuseum in Bonn, the Museo d'arte contemporanea Villa Croce in Genua and the Museo de Bellas Artes in Caracas, as well as of numerous private collections. In 1994, a children's opera based on his Die wundersame Reise nach Esmir was first played at the in Recklinghausen.Information from the composer Matthias Bonitz  Personal life  He was born in an area of Essen called An der Kluse (near ), below Villa H√ºgel. In 1968, he met Elena Hochman- Klusemann, a Jewish sociologist raised in Venezuela. Elena's mother was a Holocaust survivor who struggled with her daughter's marriage to a German. They moved to Tuscany, where Elena later sank into depression and Klusemann turned to alcohol. He started to vomit blood three months before his death. He is the subject of the documentary Georg by his daughter Caterina Klusemann, completed in 2008 for Arte/ZDF. In the film, several friends and fellow artists like the painter Ulrich Erben, the writer Ingrid Bach√©r (who had written that \\"there was something magnificent about him, nothing small, narrow, he overflowed with life\\"), the writer Hermann Schulz, and his publisher Hans-Joachim Gelberg, as well as his wife reconstruct his brief but intense life.

Situated from Oslo Central Station (Oslo S), it features two side platforms. Rosenholm is served by the L2 line of the Norwegian State Railways's Oslo Commuter Rail. It features a major park and ride parking lot, but does not have a significant population near by. History The railway past Rosenholm opened on 5 June 1873. It was doubled 15 December 1936 and electrified on 18 January 1937.Bjerke & Holom: 37 Holmlia was established as a suburb in the 1970s, although it had been served by a station since 1932. Holmlia Station served the northern part of the suburb well and was moved north and received a new structure from 2 June 1982.Lang√•rd & Ruud: 180 The Rosenholm area, albeit on the Oppeg√•rd side, was selected as the site of the Norwegian head offices for IBM, who opened their complex in 1987. The station is named for a smallholding which was previously situated northwest of the station. Rosenholm Station was established with two goals in mind. The first was creating an efficient park and ride station for commuters from Follo and √òstfold. The second was to target IBM employees. The station was situated too far from the residential area to be of much value for the residents at Holmlia.Lang√•rd & Ruud: 181 Proposals for a station at Rosenholm were first put forward in 1976, but at the time the Norwegian State Railways concluded that there would not be sufficient ridership from the station. By 1987 the number of residents and work places had increased sufficiently that the agency reconsidered. The station opened on 1 July 1988, after a large parking facility with 250 spaces built at the site. The site was chosen because it was immediately within the city limits of Oslo, and thus only have to pay an Oslo fare. It was also situated before Mosseveien on E18 where the greatest congestion occurs. The plans called for up to 800 parking places to be built in the future. Investments totaled 2.6 million Norwegian kroner. Rosenholm never met its main targets, never becoming particularly popular with commuters nor with IBM employees. In later years the popularity has risen and by 2016 the Norwegian National Rail Administration was working with plans to expand the parking space. Facilities Rosenholm Station is situated from Oslo Central Station,Bjerke & Holom: 40 immediately north of the municipal boundary between Oslo and Oppeg√•rd. The √òstfold Line past Grorud is double track and electrified. The station features two side platforms, tall, each with a shed. There is an overpass between the tracks to the south of the platforms. There are ticket machines and a bicycle shed at the station, as well as free parking for 212 cars. Service The station is served by line L2 of the Oslo Commuter Rail, operated by the Norwegian State Railways. During regular hours this involves two trains per hour per direction which run from Ski Station via the √òstfold Line to Oslo Central Station and onward to Sk√∏yen Station. Rosenholm is not served by the L2x express services. Travel time is 14 minutes to Oslo S and 20 to Ski.

The term is derived from the Greek œáœÅ·øÜœÉŒπœÇ chresis meaning \\"a use\\" and refers to published usage of a name. The technical meaning of the related term synonym is for different names that refer to the same object or concept. As noted by Hobart and Rozella B. Smith, zoological systematists had been using \\"the term (synonymy) in another sense as well, namely in reference to all occurrences of any name or set of names (usually synonyms) in the literature.\\" Such a \\"synonymy\\" could include multiple listings, one for each place the author found a name used, rather than a summarized list of different synonyms. The term \\"chresonym\\" was created to distinguish this second sense of the term \\"synonym.\\" The concept of synonymy is furthermore different in the zoological and botanical codes of nomenclature. A name that correctly refers to a taxon is further termed an orthochresonym while one that is applied incorrectly for a given taxon may be termed a heterochresonym.Dubois, A. (2000). \\"Synonymies and related lists in zoology: general proposals, with examples in herpetology\\". Dumerilia. 4 (2): 33‚Äì98.Dubois, A. (2010). \\"Retroactive changes should be introduced in the Code only with great care: problems related to the spellings of nomina\\". Zootaxa. 2426: 1‚Äì42.  Example (orthochresonymy)  Page 116 in Hershkovitz (1969) showing the chresonym Physeter catodon Harmer 1928 Species names consist of a genus part and a species part to create a binomial name. Species names often also include a reference to the original publication of the name by including the author and sometimes the year of publication of the name. As an example, the sperm whale, Physeter catodon, was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. Thus, the name may also be referenced as Physeter catodon Linnaeus 1758. That name was also used by Harmer in 1928 to refer to the species in the Proceedings of the Linnaean Society of London and of course, it has appeared in numerous other publications since then. Taxonomic catalogues, such as Catalog of Living Whales by Philip Hershkovitz, may reference this usage with a Genus+species+authorship convention that may appear to indicate a new species (a homonym) when in fact it is referencing a particular usage of a species name (a chresonym). Hershkovitz, for example refers to Physeter catodon Harmer 1928, which can cause confusion as this name+author combination really refers to the same name that Linnaeus first published in 1758.  Example (heterochresonymy)  Nepenthes rafflesiana, a species of pitcher plant, was described by William Jack in 1835. The name Nepenthes rafflesiana as used by Hugh Low in 1848 is a heterochresonym. Cheek and Jebb (2001) explain the situation thus: > Low, ... accidentally, or otherwise, had described what we know as N. > rafflesiana as Nepenthes √ó hookeriana and vice versa in his book \\"Sarawak, > its Inhabitants and Productions\\" (1848). Masters was the first author to > note this in the Gardeners' Chronicle..., where he gives the first full > description and illustration of Nepenthes √ó hookeriana. The description that Maxwell Tylden Masters provided in 1881 for the taxon that had previously been known to gardeners as Nepenthes hookeriana (an interchangeable form of the name for the hybrid Nepenthes √ó hookeriana) differs from Low's description. The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants does not require that descriptions from so long ago include specification of a type specimen, and types can be chosen later to fit these old names. Since the descriptions differ, Low's and Masters' name have different types. Masters therefore created a later homonym, which, according to the rules of the code is illegitimate.

If these three measures are not performed to compensate for the natural conditioning of air by the respiratory system, lung infections and lung tissue damage may occur. This is particularly problematic in high gas-flow therapies such as [mechanical ventilation], in patient populations with highly sensitive respiratory tracts (i.e. asthmatics), or among those requiring ventilation for longer periods of time. The two methods currently available for this purpose are active or passive respiratory gas humidification. Active respiratory gas humidifiers An active respiratory gas humidifier ensures that patients on mechanical ventilation are supplied with optimally conditioned respiratory gas. In active humidifying processes, moisture and heat is input to respiratory gas by an electrically powered humidifier. Performance data and safety-related requirements for active respiratory gas humidifiers are specified by the standard ISO 8185. According to that standard, the minimum water content of inspired respiratory gas is ca. 33 mg/dm¬≥ and the maximum respiratory gas temperature is ca. 42 ¬∞C. The aggregation of water in the gas produced by an active respiratory gas humidifer may be a suspension, or aerosol, which is produced by a nebulizer; or particulate water, output from an evaporator or bubble humidifier. =Nebulizers= Nebulizers generate aerosols consisting of droplets of various sizes that are admixed to the inspired respiratory gas. Types of nebulizers currently on the market include #Small volume nebulizers, which are used to administer medications such as salbuterol or albuterol. #Large volume nebulizers, which are similar to bubble humidifiers except for the addition of an air entrainment port, and #Ultrasonic nebulizers, which may carry a risk of overwatering the patient. The high density mist produced by nebulizers is useful in decreasing the viscosity of respiratory secretions in those suffering from conditions such as cystic fibrosis, croup, epiglottitis, and bronchiectasis. =Evaporators= Evaporators enrich the inspired respiratory gas with water vapor. In a throughflow evaporator, the inspiration flow is led through a warmed up water bath, in case of a surface evaporator however the inspiration flow is guided along the surface of the water level. Consequently, a surface evaporator transports only water vapor and no water droplets into the patient. The advantage of it is, water vapor doesn't carry any germs. Therefore, the risk of passing on germs by surface evaporators is minimal. =Bubble humidifiers= In a bubble humidifier, or bubble bottle as they are affectionately known by respiratory therapists, the inspiration flow is guided through a capillary system. In this capillary system warmed up water is circulating. Although the humidifying capacity of a bubble respiratory gas humidifier is rather low, it may be improved by increasing the water temperature. A bubble bottle is mostly used in oxygen therapy with high flow rates via a mask or nasal cannula in order to prevent drying of the mucous membranes in the nose and mouth. Passive respiratory gas humidifiers Passive respiratory gas humidifiers are independent from any external energy source or external water supply. They function as heat and moisture exchangers (HMEs) and are placed like an artificial nose between a tube and Y piece. Here they withdraw heat and moisture from expirations, which they resupply to the inspired gas during the following inspiration. As there are significant functional differences among the various HMEs on the market, respiratory therapists should test the efficacy of each individual model. The ideal HME has high reversible water retention capacity, small internal volume, and low flow resistance. To enable the absorption of sufficient amounts of water and heat, the expiratory stream of respiratory gas must be fully filtered through the HME. Leakages in the system, such as may be caused by bronchial fistulae, will render this system less effective. Other negative effects of this technology include increased secretions (i.e. mucus) and nosebleeds, either or which may clog an HME. In such cases, the application of active respiratory gas humidifiers is recommended. References * W. Oczenski, H. Andel und A. Werba: \\"Atmen - Atemhilfen.\\" Thieme, Stuttgart 2003, * J.

It was the dominant inter-island shipping line in Indonesia during the last half century of the colonial era. KPM maintained connections between the islands of Indonesia,  Before World War II  = Foundation of the KPM = A KPM advertisement in 1910. Koningsplein, Batavia. The building is now the headquarters of the Indonesian Ministry of Transportation. In 1863 the British Nederlandsch-Indische Stoomvaartmaatschappij (NISM) had won a tender for a number of subsidized shipping lines in the Dutch East Indies. As a consequence the inter island shipping lines got centered on Singapore. Furthermore all but two of the many ships required were built in the United Kingdom. The minister of colonial affairs Jacobus Sprenger van Eyk and the businessmen Jan Boissevain (1836-1904), Willem Ruys and P.E. Tegelberg then came up with a plan for a new 'national' shipping line. On 19 March 1888 a law was made to govern the relations between the (Dutch East Indies) government and the new public company Koninklijke Paketvaart Maatschappij. The KPM had to hold office in the Netherlands or Dutch East Indies; Appointments of executives and representatives had to be approved by the government; A government representative would have access to the administration and meetings of the company; an obligation to build half of the required ships in the Netherlands; an obligation to use only Dutch commanders, navigators and engineers; and finally the government subsidies for operating the lines. The establishment of the KPM would indeed have the desired effects. The KPM supported the unification of the Dutch colonial economy as the Netherlands expanded its territory across the Indonesian archipelago. The company brought inter-island commerce back to the capital, Batavia (now Jakarta) rather than to Singapore, which shifted economic activity to Java, and supplied more cargo for the shipping lines between Batavia and the Netherlands. Transport on this route was provided by the Stoomvaart Maatschappij Nederland (executives Jan Boissevain and P.E. Tegelberg) and Rotterdamsche Lloyd (executive Willem Ruys) = First ships = The foundation of the KPM also had a significant effect on the Dutch shipbuilding industry. The KPM would order all its ships in the Netherlands. Especially in the early 1890s this allowed the Dutch shipyards to gain more experience in building faster ships and to catch up with the foreign competition. In a few years the KPM ordered Both, Reael, Maetsuijcker and Coen at De Schelde Van Diemen and Carpentier at Fijenoord, Reijnst, Van Goens and Speelman at the Koninklijke Fabriek van Stoom- en andere Werktuigen, Reijniersz and Zwaardecroon at Maatschappij De Maas in Rotterdam, Van Riebeeck at J en K Smit in Slikkerveer and Camphuys at Huijgens and van Gelder in Amsterdam. = Routes = The line's routes, beyond the home islands, included services to the ports of Singapore and Hong Kong, Shanghai, Manila, Saigon; the Australian ports of Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide; African ports such as Durban, East London, Port Elizabeth, Mossel Bay, Cape Town, Zanzibar, Mombasa, and the Indian Ocean ports of R√©union and Mauritius and Mah√©. = Tourism = To advance a tourism in Indonesia, the company built a hotel on Bali in 1928, launching a tourism industry in the region. World War II During the second world war with Japan, the ships of KPM assisted the Dutch, British and Australian war ships with the protection of Singapore. During the Battle of the Java Sea, KPM ships also assisted the supply of ammunition. In the Netherlands East Indies, several of KPM ships were rented by the Royal Netherlands Navy to participate in the defense of the Netherlands East Indies and Singapore too against the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy. KPM ships were involved in the first months of the Pacific war in movement of supplies and troops. In January plans were made for the Aquitania to transport troops from Australia to Singapore until concern about putting such a large and valued transport loaded with 3,456 troops in range of Japanese air strikes resulted in a plan to transfer the troops to smaller vessels from Aquitania at Ratai Bay in the Sunda Strait. Aquitania and escort, the cruiser Canberra, sailed from Sydney on 10 January and reached Ratai Bay on 20 January where the troops were distributed among the KPM vessels Both, Reijnst, Van der Lijn, Sloet van de Beele, Van Swoll, and Reael and the British flagged ship Taishan. That convoy reached Singapore on 24 January. Company ships reaching Australia during the Japanese advance through the islands were incorporated into the fleet being assembled by United States Forces in Australia (USFIA), shortly to be redesignated as U.S. Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA) and later the U.S. Army Services of Supply (USASOS), for support of the defense of Australia and campaign against the Japanese in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA). In early 1942 twenty-one small KPM vessels, loaded with refugees and limping into Australian ports, were obtained by charter for U.S. Army use and became known as the \\"KPM vessels\\" in the SWPA fleet. The means by which these vessels were brought under control of the SWPA command was complex and involved discussions with the Netherlands government officials in exile in both London and Washington as well as locally in Australia. Initially the original twenty-one vessels that reached Australia were chartered by the Chief Quartermaster, USAFIA, on 26 March 1942 with long term details to be negotiated at higher levels. The eventual decision, involving governments in London, Washington and the Combined Chiefs of Staff, was that the charters would be handled by the British Ministry of War Transport (BMWT) for the U. S. Army. The complex arrangement was a \\"bareboat charter to BMWT and through the War Shipping Administration (WSA) the ships were assigned by WSA to the Army but 'not, repeat not, on bareboat but on gross basis,' though under 'full control' of the Army.\\" In early March 1943 almost half the permanent local fleet was composed of the refugee KPM vessels: > On 6 March 1943, nearly 16 months after the beginning of the war, the > permanent local fleet consisted of 43 vessels: the 21 KPM vessels obtained > on 26 March 1942 and the 6 additional KPM vessels obtained on 19 January > 1943; 3 vessels from the China Navigation Co. Ltd. (the Anhui, the Hanyang, > and the Yochow); the Empire Hamble (ex Thepsatri Nawa. previously Admiral > Senn), of Siamese registry, assigned 15 October 1942; the , the West Cactus > (assigned 20 May 1942), and the Portmar (salvaged and reconditioned in 1942 > by port-battalion troops), of U. S. registry; and 9 unnamed Liberty ships, > which probably were in temporary service. The Coast Farmer had been sunk on > 21 July 1942, and the Dona Nati had been withdrawn. Dutch hospital ship Maetsuycker served as Southwest Pacific Area interbase hospital ship. The twenty-one original vessels were: Balikpapan (1938), , Bontekoe (1922), Both (1931), Cremer (1926), Generaal Verspijck (1928), Janssens (1935), , , Khoen Hoea (1924),Ship was built for Thong Ek Steamship Co. specifically designed for the Singapore/Pontianak (Borneo) trade and chartered to KPM sometime in 1940. Evacuated part of ABDA naval staff from Java to Australia. (Gill, 1957, p. 627) Maetsuycker (1936), , Sibigo (1926), Stagen (1919), Swartenhondt (1924), , Van den Bosch (1903), Van der Lijn (1928), , Van Heutsz (1926) and Van Spilbergen (1908). Two of the ships, Maetsuycker and Tasman, were converted to hospital ships to handle casualties in the New Guinea campaign. Both ships, though under United States Army control, were Dutch flagged and certified as hospital ships under the Hague Convention by the Netherlands Government in exile. Post-war period With the declaration of independence and the establishment of Indonesia as a nation in 1945 and 1949 respectively, the highly profitable KPM remained under Dutch ownership and management. KPM became a major focus for Indonesian activists seeking to reduce Dutch influence in the post-colonial economy. After competing with the national Pelayaran Nasional Indonesia (National Indonesian Shipping) line and demonstrations by the trade union laborers on 3 December 1957, KPM was faced with nationalization and so decided to move its headquarters and international shipping assets to Singapore in 1958. From that base, KPM bought control of Maatschappij Zeetransport (the Oranje Lijn) of Rotterdam, thus entering the European-Canadian trade. This effort was unsuccessful, so KPM sold its Oranje Lijn holdings, and the company was liquidated. KPM itself continued until 1 January 1967, when it merged with the Koninklijke Java China Paketvaart Lijnen (KJCPL) of Amsterdam. Crews and ships continued service with other lines until finally all former KPM elements were taken over by Nedlloyd in 1977. The company later merged into Nedlloyd, P&O; Nedlloyd and finally Maersk.

History The station was on the Great Central Main Line which ran between London Marylebone and Manchester via Sheffield Victoria. It was opened on 1 June 1892 as Staveley Town and renamed Staveley Central on 25 September 1950 by British Railways to reduce confusion with the ex-MR station, also called Staveley Town, which was about 250 yards away on the same street. The MR station was on the Barrow Hill to Clowne and Barrow Hill to Pleasley West lines. The renaming also reduced the likelihood of people confusing the station with that at Barrow Hill, but that was normally referred to as Barrow Hill. Staveley Central closed on 4 March 1963, but continued to serve Summer weekend excursion traffic until the end of the 1964 season. The station was the northern junction for the loop line to and so had four platforms. The timber-built booking hall was on the Lowgates road overbridge and there was a waiting room on each platform. The station was also the junction for branches to the Ireland, Hartington and Markham Collieries and at the south end was Staveley (G.C.) Engine Shed (shed code 38D and latterly 41H in BR days). This, too, was subject to confusion with the ex-MR \\"Staveley\\" engine shed over a mile away at Barrow Hill, which was coded 18D in BR days. Staveley ex-GC engine shed has been razed to the ground, but Barrow Hill Engine Shed has risen from the ashes as a significant railway engineering and preservation site.

In spite of its small size it is an important local centre in the region known in South Africa as Bushmanland. The surrounding districts are arid, sparsely populated, rugged and picturesque. There is little in the way of cropping and local farmers run sheep or goats for a living. As a tourist destination it is not sufficiently spectacular to rival the spring flowers of the coastal regions of Namaqualand, but it has its attractions for biologists and conservationists and those with an interest in its remarkable diversity of often-tiny xerophytes and animal life. Unidentified Zaluzianskya in Bushmanland, less than across, flowering after unusual rains Some claim that Pofadder was named after Klaas Pofadder, a koranna (Koi-Koi) Captain of the area. Others maintain that this is an exercise in latter-day political correctness and that no record exists to prove that the village was not named after the venomous snake that is common enough in the district. The settlement is situated on the N14 national road from Upington to Springbok and lies 50 km from the Onseepkans border post on the Namibian border, along the R358. Pofadder is near to the Ritchie Falls, the second highest waterfall on the Orange River, after the Augrabies Falls. Ritchie Falls are in a pristine wilderness area, only accessible after a two- day hike or by rafting down from Onseepkans. Guided hikes and rafting trips are available. Like Kalamazoo and Timbuktu, the name \\"Pofadder\\" is used to represent somewhere very remote, far away and out of the mainstream of the world. This usage is most common in South Africa, while Timbuktu is used in most of the Commonwealth for this purpose and Kalamazoo in the United States. Putsonderwater is used in a similar way.

It is the state's greatest jewelry and lingerie producer, ranking second in the country. The city was mainly colonized by Italian immigrants in the 19th century and still retains their traditions. The name comes from the Guaran√≠ language and its meaning is disputed, most likely being Desert Valley.  History  The immigrant settlement that would eventually give birth to the city began in the early 19th century in the area that is the present-day municipality of Mu√ßum, a smaller number of German cattle herders also established themselves in the area now known as S√£o Valentim do Sul, both towns that used to be part of Guapor√©. In 1892 the colony of Guapor√© was established, on area belonging to the cities of Lajeado and Passo Fundo. The colony's manager, Eng. Jos√© Montauri de Aguiar Leit√£o, designated to Eng. Vespasiano Corr√™a the task of zoning and dividing the town's area in some 5000 shares of 0.25 to 0.30 km2. Soon after, settlers from the first Italian colonies in the state (mainly Caxias do Sul, Bento Gon√ßalves and Veran√≥polis) came to the newly formed town and, in 1896, the colony had already reached 7,000 inhabitants. In 1897 the Santo Ant√¥nio Parish was created, under the Porto Alegre Diocese, being an important step the formation of a city in local culture. By 1900 the population had grown to 13,727. This success led to the formal establishment, on 11 December 1903, of the Municipality of Guapor√©, with Eng. Vespasiano Rodrigues Corr√™a as the first mayor, inaugurated on 1 January 1904. By 1910, Guapor√© had around 30,000 inhabitants, even more than today, with 1,020 living in the town center, which had over 170 buildings, a town square, telegraph, post office and church. Agriculture was the most important economical activity, the main crops being rice, beans, corn, soy, orange and vines. Furthermore, 82 businesses and a few industries were established by the time, producing aguardente, wine, cheese and lard. Through the years, several districts emancipated from Guapor√©, significantly reducing the city's area and population. Today, several municipalities make up what was once Guapor√©, the largest being Casca (emancipated in 1954), Mu√ßum (1959), Serafina Corr√™a (1960) and Dois Lajeados (1987), among many others. = The Immigrants = Upon their arrival, throughout the 19th century, the immigrants were devoid of anything of value and had to rely on their strong will and bold spirits to build a new life on a new land. With over a century gone by, the memory of these origins is still felt in the religious strength and willingness to work of the community. The religious passion is clearly seen in the numerous chapels on rural areas and the Central Church, built in Neogothic style between 1897 and 1947. The city also has a 13 m Christ statue placed on a 7 m pedestal on the city's tallest mountain. In 1907, with the arrival of the Pasqualli family to the city, the industry that would become an economical backbone had its humble beginnings as they applied their goldsmith knowledge to become the first jewellers established in Guapor√©. Over a hundred years after its foundation, Guapor√© has set itself as an important commercial, industrial, cultural and touristic centre for dozens of cities in the region.  Geography  Guapor√© is located on the Serra Ga√∫cha a mountainous area of the north-eastern Rio Grande do Sul. The city center is at an altitude of 478 m above sea level, although some peaks reach the 700 m mark. It is situated between the highlands of the Planalto and lowlands of the Depress√£o Central and is composed of Igneous rock formed in the end of the Mesozoic Era. It is in an area of Basaltic Rock, that lay's upon layers of Arenite and Granite. The rivers Carreiro and Guapor√© flow on the eastern and western borders of the city, respectively. = Climate = Due to its location, Guapor√© is subject to a Humid subtropical climate, summers are cool and winters are moderately cold, with common occurrence of frost and occasional snowfall.  Statistics  Below are some available figures on the city's economy and life. * GDP: R$ 323,682,673 IBGE/2008 * GDP per capita: R$ 14468.20 IBGE/2008 * Total Exports: US$ 18,509,548 FOB 2008 * HDI: 0.826 high UNDP/2000 * Illiteracy: 6.48% 2000 * Life expectancy: 73.84 years 2000 * Infant mortality rate: 3.83 2007  Culture  In addition to the Italian majority, there is significant presence of German and Polish descendants, as well as other European nationalities. Despite generations of foreign influence, those of Italian descent still maintain several traditions including the use of the Talian dialect, itself derived from the Venetian language, an Italian dialect. Furthermore, the cold winters gave rise to the tradition of gathering family and friends around wood-burning-stoves (used for heating and cooking) to eat pine nuts, chat and play cards. Typical Italian cousine is very common and served in any occasion. Hunting and fishing, once important sources of sustenance, have now become usual pastime sports. The Gaucho culture has also found its way into peoples lives over time. Nowadays the tradition of drinking chimarr√£o is very widespread, and public celebrations of the Ragamuffin War are held every year in the central square, usually on the week leading up to the state holiday of September 20.  Tourism  The city has always attracted tourists from many places and for many different reasons, be it shopping tourism, racing enthusiasts, railway fans, religious people or even those simply attracted by the small town charm. Main tourist attractions include: * Igreja Matriz de Santo Ant√¥nio - city's central church built in French Neogothic style starting in 1947. The church was designed by the Italian Tiziano Bettanin. * Christ the Redeemer Statue - The 13 m tall statue is placed on a 7 m pedestal on top of a 741 m peak west of the city centre. Every year, on Good Friday, thousands march up the mountain in honour of Christ's sacrifice. * Guapor√© Commercial Center - With dozens of Jewellery and Lingerie shops, it attracts tourists from all over on the look for new items and low prices. * Vespasiano Corr√™a Square - Central square in the center of town, bordered by the Santo Ant√¥nio Church, City Hall and the city's main streets. * Aut√≥dromo Internacional de Guapor√© - Racetrack that has always offered entertainment to the local population and numerous tourists. The main event is the yearly leg of the Formula Truck championship, a Brazilian Truck Racing competition. * Kart√≥dromo - Kart track by the aforementioned racetrack. * Ferrovia do Trigo (Wheat Railway) - Railway built in the 60s and 70s to complete the connection of the whole north-east of the state to the capital. The mountainous terrain ensued in the construction of over 20 viaducts and bridges as well as several tunnels of up to 2 km in length. Every year, many enthusiasts walk these rails in order to catch a glimpse of the amazing and beautiful engineering works.  Sport and Leisure  Many locations are available to the population for practising sports and other leisure activities. Many football fields are spread throughout the city and many locals have some sort of countryside retreat for the weekends. Other sport and leisure options include: * Aut√≥dromo Internacional de Guapor√© - Aside from the many races held in the local motorsports circuit over the whole year, the area still holds a Kart Racing Track, a swimming pool, camping area and facilities for the traditional Sunday barbecues and other activities. * AFAG - Ca√ßa e Pesca - Offers areas for fishing, Shooting Sports, Camping and Off-road motorcycling. * AABB (Banco do Brasil Athletic Association) - With a football field and facilities for parties and other events, the usually members-only location is often rented for private occasions. * Clube Uni√£o Guaporense - The old building by the central square hosts a restaurant and ballroom used by many for celebrations. Swimming Pools, Tennis Courts, Snooker and card playing tables are also available for members. * Guapor√© Aerodrome - (ICAO: SSGR) The airfield's 1,100 m gravel runway is occasionally used by light aircraft.  Notable people  * Renato Ga√∫cho: retired football player, having played for clubs such as Esportivo, Gr√™mio, Flamengo, Botafogo and Fluminense, currently coaches Gr√™mio. *Ale Vanzella: bossa nova / indie rock musician  Notes   External links  Category:Municipalities in Rio Grande do Sul ","title":"Guapor√©, Rio Grande do Sul"},{"id":"17421652","text":"Captain Guy D'Oyly-Hughes DSO & Bar, DSC (8 August 1891 ‚Äì 8 June 1940) was an officer in the Royal Navy.

As of 2010 ELM contained 146 different motifs that annotate more than 1300 experimentally determined instances within proteins. The current version of the ELM server provides filtering by cell compartment, phylogeny, globular domain clash (using the SMART/Pfam databases) and structure. In addition, both the known ELM instances and any positionally conserved matches in sequences similar to ELM instance sequences are identified and displayed.

TDR: The Drama Review was founded in 1955 by Robert W. Corrigan as the \\"Carleton Drama Review\\" (so named because Corrigan was a faculty member at Carleton College). Corrigan took TDR with him to Tulane University in 1957 where he renamed it the Tulane Drama Review. In 1962, Corrigan left Tulane for Carnegie Mellon University and Richard Schechner became editor. Schechner left Tulane for New York University in 1967 taking TDR with him and renaming it TDR: The Drama Review. Erika Munk succeeded Schechner as editor in 1969. Michael Kirby became editor in 1970. In 1986, Kirby resigned and Schechner resumed TDR's editorship. Schechner continues as editor as of 2020. TDR is owned by New York University and is published in hard copy and online by the MIT Press. From 2011 onwards, TDR's point of view was expanded by means of a consortium of editors: Joseph Roach, Tavia Nyong'o, and Elise Morrison (Yale University), Rebecca Schneider (Brown University), William (Huizhu) Sun (Shanghai Theatre Academy), and Branislav Jakovljevic (Stanford University). From 2011 until 2017, Jill Dolan and Stacy Wolf (Princeton University) was a member of the TDR Consortium. Within the Consortium, Schechner continues as editor-in-chief, Mariellen Sandford, continue as Associate Editor, and Sara Brady as Managing Editor. One issue a year is edited by a Consortium editor or editors. TDR is not peer-reviewed, a fact that has been somewhat controversial. However, submissions to TDR are often sent by Schechner for evaluation to one or more of TDR's Contributing Editors, an international group of distinguished scholars and artists. In his article \\"TDR and Me,\\" Schechner called the objectivity that is associated with the process of peer review \\"a chimera\\" Expanding on this, he explained: \\"The opinion of a group remains subjective.

See The Free Dictionary - Accouterments; MacMillan Dictionary - Accouterments; and Wiktionary - accounterment. Retrieved January 18, 2016. Accoutrements can be intended for field, garrison or ceremonial purposes. Most accoutrements for field use are purely practical in nature. Ceremonial accoutrements may no longer have a practical purpose in modern operations but may be retained to maintain a tradition. Garrison accoutrements will vary in their usefulness and include both practical and ceremonial/traditional items. Some accoutrements such as lanyards, have both a traditional/ceremonial and a practical purpose. In these cases a different item may be worn in garrison or ceremonial occasions than that used in the field. For example, in the Australian army different corps and units wear different coloured lanyards for service or ceremonial dress, but universally use drab natural fibre coloured lanyards for pistol retention in the field. Sources of accoutrements Accoutrements can be issued by the service or employer or obtained privately. Similarly, accoutrements can be commercially produced, government produced or commercially produced under government contract. Informal names for accoutrements The forces of various nations have or have had different names for the basic accoutrements issued to most or all soldiers, such as: * TA-50 (US Army) *DP-1 (Australian Army). In some cases these common or informal names derive from the form number/name that the equipment issue to the individual is recorded on. Unofficial use Accoutrements are widely collected by militaria collectors and historical re-enactors. Some accoutrements used by re-enactors are reproductions, as the originals may no longer be available or too expensive or valuable to use. Value The accoutrements of the modern soldier may include equipment such as sophisticated electronics e.g. radios and night vision equipment and may be worth tens or in exceptional cases, e.g. some special forces soldiers, hundreds of thousands of dollars. In some cases, accoutrements are expendable or \\"written off\\" at the time of issue. Other items must be returned or otherwise accounted (e.g. covered by a loss or damage form) for when the individual leaves an organization. Accoutrements on the private market for collectors can be valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on their rarity and/or provenance. For example, a relatively mundane item that can be proven to have belonged to a historically important figure may costs hundreds or thousands of times the cost of a similar item owned by a non historically significant user. Examples Examples of accoutrements include: * webbing (load bearing equipment) * body armour * helmets * backpacks * whistles * gas masks * equipment for living in the field such as bedding, portable shelters * rain or foul weather gear * hand cuffs * first aid kit * spurs * entrenching tools * navigational equipment, such as compasses and protractors * brassards - e.g. MP (military police) brassards  References  Category:Military equipment ","title":"Accoutrements"},{"id":"17421751","text":"Location of Coqueiral in the state of Minas Gerais Coqueiral is a municipality in the south of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais.

It was one of five hotels in the R.T. Ford & Company hotel chain and was identical to the Ford Hotel, Buffalo and Ford Hotel, Montreal. The 750-room hotel consisted of three 12-story wings connected at the rear by a perpendicular spine atop a one-story base contained the lobby, restaurants and other amenities. The structure was located on Dundas Street West, east of Bay Street. It was built in 1928 and for several decades was one of the city's most prominent hotels. The hotel was next to the Toronto Bus Terminal and provided cheap rooms for lower income travellers. It was also well known as a site for crime and vice. The Toronto Star called it the \\"rendezvous of choice for couples pursuing an illicit affair.\\" The building was demolished in 1973 and the site is today home to the Atrium on Bay, now known simply as \\"Atrium\\".

It was demolished in 2000 and replaced with Hampton Inn and Suites Hotel. * Ford Hotel, Rochester ‚Äì Built in 1915 as the Hotel Richford for Men, a 400-room fireproof hotel. In 1929, the hotel was renamed the Ford Hotel, now for men and women; in 1944 the name went back to Richford. The hotel, at 67 Chestnut Street & Elm Street, operated until 1968 and subsequently became the Richmond Office Building, with multiple tenants until the early 2000s. At some point the building was covered in metal cladding, changing its original appearance. In 2007 the vacant building was sold to a developer to create high-end condominiums with street-level retail. However, due to the recession and other stalled projects in the former Midtown Plaza area, financing has been difficult. * Hotel Ford, Montreal ‚Äì Opened in 1930, the 750-room hotel served as CBC-Radio-Canada Montreal headquarters from 1936 to the early seventies.

Life Cousens was born in Brookline, Massachusetts to Sarah (Wiggen) and John Emmons Cousens, members of the Shawmut Universalist Society. He entered Tufts College in Medford in 1894, but dropped out during his senior year after his father's death in order to run the family coal company, not receiving his B.A. until 1903. His company flourished, eventually merging with the Metropolitan Coal Company. He gained business experience as its vice president, and served in many high-level positions of the Brookline Savings Bank and other Brookline financial organizations. He married Elizabeth Frances Edwards in 1906 and they raised their niece Isabel Jean but had no other children. He was a member of the Audubon Society, the American Museum of Natural History, the Massachusetts Horticultural Society, and the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Presidency As an alumnus of Tufts, Cousens was involved in many aspects of alumni operations, and became a trustee in 1911, serving on the finance committee, the board of visitors to the medical school, and the executive committee. He was thus a potential replacement for the office of president upon the resignation of Hermon Carey Bumpus in 1919. He was initially appointed acting president due to the trustees' concern over his lack of experience in education, but within a year impressed them enough to make him president. His presidency coincided with the Great Depression, but he managed to keep the college's finances in good shape and modestly improve the campus, adding one building to the campus each year, including the Cousens Gymnasium, built in 1931‚Äì1932. During Cousens' presidency, Tufts remained a small regional institution. However, he began administrative reforms that later allowed Tufts to grow into an international university, including taking the management and day-to-day operations of the college from the trustees and putting them in the hands of a centralized administration. He also attempted to institute academic reforms such as a more competitive three-tier system that base Bachelor's and professional degrees on stricter expectations of quality work; however, these and other controversial curriculum reforms failed due to faculty opposition. He also oversaw the 1930 creation of the New England Medical Center, a joint operation of the Tufts Medical School, the Boston Dispensary, and the Boston Floating Hospital. In 1933, the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy was established jointly with Harvard Law School. Cousens courted alumni and students, writing for the alumni magazine and the weekly newspaper and giving students, including the poet John Holmes, private financial aid. Death He died while in office on July 2, 1937, of a heart attack, and the funeral service was held at Goddard Chapel.

His elder brother William Seymour, 2nd Earl of Hertford (1587‚Äì1660), also a Royalist commander in the Civil War, was created Marquess of Hertford in 1640 by King Charles I and at the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660 was restored to the Dukedom of Somerset and Barony of Seymour forfeited by their great-grandfather the first Duke, and became the 2nd Duke of Somerset and 2nd Baron Seymour. Career In June 1611 he was accused of abetting the escape of his brother William Seymour and his wife Arabella Stuart, but protested his innocence. He was knighted by King James I at Royston on 23 October 1613. In 1612 was settled on him by his grandfather the manor of \\"Puriton with Downend\\" in Somerset, formerly one of the many possessions of his great-grandfather the 1st Duke of Somerset.'Puriton', in A History of the County of Somerset: Volume 8, the Poldens and the Levels, ed. Robert Dunning (London, 2004), pp. 146‚Äì160 http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/som/vol8/pp146-160 Parliamentary career In 1621 Seymour was elected Member of Parliament for Wiltshire. In May he proposed that distinctly harsh penalties should be inflicted on Edward Floyd. He was elected MP for Marlborough in 1624. In that parliament he worked hard to induce a war with Spain, but protested against any extensive military operations in continental Europe and opposed sending an army to the Palatinate on the ground of the \\"extreme charge\\". In 1625 he was again elected MP for Wiltshire. On 30 July he proposed that the grant be limited to one subsidy and one-fifteenth, about a tenth of what King Charles I required to meet his engagements. He rejected the overtures which the Duke of Buckingham made to him, and in July he refused to join in the attack on Lord-Keeper Williams because Buckingham was secretly abetting this. In August he attacked the government for conducting a continental war, inveighing against peculation in high places and the sale of offices at court. On these grounds he dissuaded the House from granting supplies. He was re-elected to the new parliament summoned in February 1626, but was made Sheriff of Wiltshire to prevent his sitting. In the following July his name was struck off the commission of the peace. Thenceforth Seymour adhered to Wentworth's policy of moderation. In 1628 he was elected MP for Wiltshire and Marlborough and chose to sit for Wiltshire. On 29 April he joined Noy and Digges when they tried to modify the Commons' Bill of Liberties, and supported Wentworth's Habeas Corpus Bill. He also advocated, with Wentworth against Eliot, a joint-committee of the two Houses on the Petition of Right. In May 1639 Seymour refused to pay ship- money, and in the following March he was elected without opposition as MP for Wiltshire to the Short Parliament. In this parliament he spoke powerfully against granting any subsidies to the King before receiving any redress of grievances, and apparently compared \\"our affayres to the bondage of the Israelites in Egypt\\". In November 1640 he was elected MP for Marlborough to the Long Parliament. He soon began to differ from the popular party, and on 19 February 1641 he was created Baron Seymour of Trowbridge, Wiltshire, a year after his elder brother had been created Marquess of Hertford. In the House of Lords he insisted on voting against Strafford's attainder, although the opposite party denied his competence to vote because he was not a peer when the charges against Strafford were first brought up. Civil War In June 1642, Seymour signed the declaration that the king had no intention of war. He followed the King to York, offering to raise twenty horse in his cause, and Parliament accordingly declared him a delinquent. In autumn 1642 he went with his brother, the Marquis of Hertford, into the Westcountry to organise the royalist forces and suppress the parliamentary militia. He crossed the Bristol Channel from Minehead to Glamorganshire on a similar errand in September. In December 1643 he signed the letter of the peers to the council in Scotland, protesting against the invitation sent by parliament to the Scots to invade England. Early in 1645 he was on the commission for the defence and government of Oxford and the adjacent counties. In February he was one of the commissioners appointed to treat at Uxbridge, and in May he was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He was at Oxford when it surrendered on 22 June. He was admitted to composition and his fine was fixed at ¬£3,725 by the Committee for Compounding with Delinquents. He attended a council at Hampton Court on 7 October 1647, but took no part in politics during the Commonwealth and Protectorate periods. Restoration After the Restoration of the Monarchy Seymour was re-appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, serving from 1660 until 1664. Marriages and children Seymour married twice: *Firstly in 1620 to Frances Prinne (buried 7 September 1626, St Peter and St Paul Church, Marlborough), daughter of Sir Gilbert Prinne of Allington, Wiltshire, by whom he had children including: **Charles Seymour, 2nd Baron Seymour of Trowbridge (1621-1665) **Frances Seymour, daughter, who married Sir William Ducie. **William Seymour, son (baptised 7 September 1626, St Peter and St Paul Church, Marlborough-?) *Secondly in 1635 he married Catherine Lee (died 1701), daughter of Sir Robert Lee by his wife Anne Lowe of Billesley, Warwickshire. Death and burial Seymour died in 1664 at the age of about 74, and was buried in the chancel of Bedwyn Magna church, the parish church of the Seymours' ancestral seat of Wulfhall, owned by his brother.

Soldiers who qualify for AW2 are assigned to the program as soon as possible after arriving at the Warrior Transition Unit (WTU). AW2 supports these Soldiers and their Families throughout their recovery and transition, even into Veteran status. Through the local, personalized support of AW2 Advocates, AW2 strives to foster the Soldier's independence. There are more than 20,000 severely wounded, ill and injured Soldiers and Veterans currently enrolled in AW2. Eligility requirements In order to be considered eligible for entry into AW2, Soldiers must suffer from wounds, illnesses, or injuries incurred in the line of duty after September 10, 2001 AND receive or expect to receive at least a 30% rating from the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) for one of the conditions listed below: * Blindness or severe loss of vision * Loss of limb * Hearing loss or deafness * Burns or permanent disfigurement * Paralysis/spinal cord injury * Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) * Fatal and incurable disease with limited life expectancy of one year or less * Receive a 30 percent IDES (Army) disability rating for any other combat related condition or condition caused by an instrumentality of war, including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other Behavioral Health (BH) conditions * Receive a combined 50 percent IDES (Army) disability rating for any other combat related conditions or conditions caused by an instrumentality of war At this time there are no exceptions to AW2 entry criteria. However, AW2 is currently evaluating the appeals process. AW2 Advocates Upon enrollment in the U.S. Army Wounded Warrior Program (AW2), each Soldier is assigned an AW2 Advocate, who helps the Soldier with the recovery and transition process, fostering the Soldier's independence. Together, AW2 Advocates and AW2 Soldiers collaborate to set goals for the Soldiers' and Families' future. AW2 Advocates are located at Warrior Transition Units (WTUs), military treatment facilities (MTFs), most Army installations and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities to provide personalized local support on a wide range of issues and resources. Warrior Care and Transition Program The Army's Warrior Care and Transition Program (WCTP), headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, evaluates and treats wounded, ill and injured Soldiers through a comprehensive, Soldier- centric process of medical care, rehabilitation, professional development and achievement of personal goals. Led by the Army's Warrior Transition Command (WTC), the WCTP serves an essential role, not only in managing the care and recovery of Soldiers evacuated from theater, but also those preparing to deploy and those who have returned from combat that require complex care management to cope with the effects of war and multiple deployments. WTC works to ensure everything possible is done to enable Soldiers to return to duty. WTC also plays an important role in ensuring Reserve Component Soldiers receive the care they require prior to and after deployment to remain mission ready. AW2 is a key program in executing the WCTP. WCTP is a subordinate command of United States Army Medical Command. Services provided by other military branches Wounded or disabled Veterans from other branches of service are served through other programs. * U.S. Marine Corps: the Marine For Life program and the Wounded Warrior Regiment, which has battalion headquarters on the east and west coasts. * U.S. Air Force: Air Force Wounded Warrior Program (AFW2) for airmen with certain combat-related injuries.Air Force Wounded Warrior Program (AFW2) * U.S. Navy: Safe Harbor provides personalized support and assistance to severely injured sailors and their families.

Early life and education Wessell was born in Warren, Pennsylvania to Swedish immigrants Nils Johan Wessell, a Congregationalist minister, and Esther Walquist Wessell, a nurse. He obtained his B.S. in psychology from Lafayette College in 1934, his master's in psychology from Brown University in 1935, and his Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Rochester in 1938. (He was later awarded honorary degrees from Lafayette College, Lesley College, Boston University, Boston College, Northeastern University, Brown University, and Brandeis University.) He married Marian Sigler about 1938 and had two children, Nils H. and Roberta. Career at Tufts Brought to Tufts in 1939 by his mentor, Tufts president Leonard Carmichael, Wessell taught psychology (1939-1947) and was dean of liberal arts (1939-1953) and vice president (1951-1953). Upon becoming president of the college on December 9, 1953, he called for Tufts to become a university, leading the Massachusetts Board of Corporations to change the name from Tufts College to Tufts University. In addition to the name change, Wessell committed to developing graduate programs in the colleges of arts, sciences and engineering in order to become a true research university. Biology and chemistry laboratories, an engineering building, new dormitories, and the Wessell Library were built during his presidency, and the Experimental College and Lincoln Filene Center for Public Service were opened. He resigned in 1966 due to his belief in \\"change in the office of president in a university every 10 or 15 years.\\" Later life Wessell served as a member of the board of the trustees of his alma mater, Lafayette College, from 1958 to 1964. He was also the president of the Institute for Educational Development from 1965 to 1968 and president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation from 1968 to 1979. In 1976, he was chairman of a New York commission that studied the possibility of merging the City University of New York system with the State University of New York system, ultimately advising against it. In 1979 Wessell was named \\"Swedish American of the year\\". He died at his home in Naples, Florida on March 4, 2007.

For many years, it was host to an annual PGA Tour event.  History  The club was founded in 1913 by some local businessmen in what was then called White Station, Tennessee. The first 18-hole course was opened on August 7, 1914. In 1915 the first clubhouse opened. On December 16, 1919, the clubhouse was destroyed in a fire, blamed on defective wiring. In the summer of 1921, a new clubhouse opened. Colonial Country Club remained in this location for over forty years. In 1968 the club announced plans to relocate to the suburb of Cordova, Tennessee, near Interstate 40. The new venue would offer two separate 18-hole championship golf courses, as well as a practice area, a clubhouse, an Olympic sized swimming pool, 6 tennis courts, and snack-bar/dressing facility. Both courses were designed by Joe Finger. The new clubhouse and courses opened in 1972. Colonial Country Club has been located there ever since.  Courses  The two courses are known as the North Course and the South Course. The South Course is the course which hosted the professional tour events.  Tournaments  Colonial has hosted many tournaments at both of its locations, including the Memphis Open, now known as the St. Jude Classic. This PGA Tour event began in 1958 and was played at Colonial through 1988. Many years, regional qualifying for the U.S. Open has taken place at Colonial. 1977 1977 was the most memorable year for Colonial as two huge events occurred which made national news at the PGA Tour event (then known as the Danny Thomas Memphis Classic). 1\\\\. President Gerald Ford made a hole-in-one during Wednesday's Celebrity Pro-Am. 2\\\\. Two days later, Al Geiberger shot a record low round of 59 on Friday of the tournament.

The river rises from the eastern slopes of the Blackall Range and flows east through Eumundi, before entering the sea at Cotton Tree, Maroochydore. Other populated centres in the catchment include Nambour, Eudlo, Yandina and Coolum. The suburb south of Airport and North of River and west of Motorway is known as Maroochy River. Course The watershed of the Maroochy River encompasses of undulating hills which have been cleared for agriculture and urban uses. There are three dams in the catchment area including Wappa Dam, Cooloolabin Dam and Poona Dam which total to of capacity. There are two main arms: North and South Maroochy Rivers. Tributaries of the river include Petrie Creek and its major tributary Paynter Creek, Eudlo Creek, Coolum Creek, Doonan Creek and Yandina Creek. There is one Canal system open to the river Maroochy Waters and a second Canal system with restricted access to river namely Twin Waters. There are also numerous lake systems which drain to the river and its creeks such as Sunshine Cove. There are a number of named Islands in the river including Pincushion Island, Goat Island, Channel Island, Chambers Island & Bungee's Island. Cultural Significance Maroochy, meaning ‚Äòswan‚Äô, is a culturally significant river as Indigenous cultural heritage records depict stories of the formation of the river together with other locally significant lands including Mudjimba Island, Mount Coolum and Mount Ninderry. Environment The Maroochy River is part of a blue carbon initiative, Australia first partnership, that undertakes to provide land use options for recreation, farming and the like, via environmentally effective approaches that maintain and improve the natural environment. The area is described as the ‚ÄòBlue Heart‚Äô, spans more than 5000 hectares aimed to preserve the benefits of the natural ecosystem the wetland areas, whilst improving human and environmental health and working toward a zero net emissions target. The Maroochy River and wetland areas bordered by Bli Bli, Marcoola, Mudjimba, Diddillibah, Twin Waters and Maroochydore suburbs, consists of several Australian Commonwealth, 'nationally important wetlands' and 'protected area' locations.< Floods Significant floods on the Maroochy River have occurred in 1893, 1951, 1974 and 1992. In 1994 the Maroochy River flood warning system was set up to provide river height predictions for the Maroochy Shire Council. History In the early days of settlement, the only way to travel from Yandina to Maroochydore was by boat along the Maroochy River. By 1930, growth of urban settlements improved due to transport access changing in the Maroochy River region. The mouth of the river was affected by the 2009 southeast Queensland oil spill, reaching about upstream to the Maroochy Bridge.

In 1990, erosion led to the closure of a 0.75-mile section of the road between Cortland Place and Porter Street. This touched off a decades-long dispute between people who wanted the road repaired and those who wanted to keep the portion in Rock Creek Park free of automobile traffic. In 2017, that portion of Klingle Road became Klingle Valley Trail, reserved for hikers and bicyclists.  Location  The valley forms the boundary between the Woodley Park neighborhood to the south and the Cleveland Park neighborhood to the north. A small stream, usually called Klingle Creek (but sometimes the Klingle Tributary), flows through it, and empties into Rock Creek. Much of the valley is administered by the National Park Service as a part of Rock Creek Park. The mouth of the valley joins the mouth of another narrow valley occupied by Porter Street.  History  Formerly Klingle Ford Road, Klingle Road became a public roadway in 1839, but only later was named Klingle. The road is named for Joshua Pierce Klingle, the nephew of Pierce Mill owner Joshua Pierce and was originally known as Klingle's Road. Klingle, who was adopted by Pierce when his parents died, inherited Pierce's land upon his death and in 1891 sold a large portion of it to the federal government for the creation of Rock Creek Park. In 1885, the Klingle Road right-of-way was deeded to the City for use as a public highway. Five years later, when Congress authorized the creation of Rock Creek Park, Klingle formed the rough southern border of the new park. Along with Peirce Mill and Military Roads, it was the only roads that spanned the park north of the National Zoological Park. In 1913, the city generated a plan to straighten and widen the street as Klingle Parkway, connecting Beach Drive and Reno Road. Before World War I, the road was used by farmers to bring grain to Peirce Mill. Klingle Road remains listed as an arterial roadway for vehicular traffic on the District of Columbia's Functional Classification Map and is a part of DC's permanent system of highways. Klingle Road remains a right-of-way on the federal-aid system and has not been officially or administratively closed.  Closure and ensuing dispute  A section of the roadway was barricaded in 1990 after erosion severely damaged a section. Because the road had been used by up to 3,200 cars a day, a campaign was launched to repair and reopen the road.http://www.repairklingleroad.org/ But a competing campaign, led by the Sierra Club of DC, advocated for replacing the road with a bicycle, hiking, or bridle path. View of the closed road, through the heavily forested parkland. The repair-and-rebuild group persuaded the DC government to commission a feasibility study by the Berger Group, and engineering consultancy. Published in August 1999,District of Columbia Department of Transportation (2001). \\"The Klingle Road Feasibility Study.\\" the study ruled out no options, and so did not end the dispute. In 2003, Mayor Anthony Williams expressed opposition to the demands that the road be rebuilt,District of Columbia.

In 2008, District Mayor Adrian Fenty attempted to bypass the environmental impact statement by providing full local funding of the automobile road. But Councilmember Mary Cheh, Ward 3, succeeded in replacing this appropriation with a provision calling for the road to \\"remain closed to motorized vehicular traffic,\\" and the right-of-way employed instead for a non-motorized use trail.District of Columbia City Council (2008). \\"Klingle Road Sustainable Development Amendment Act of 2008.\\" Sec. 6016 of Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Support Act of 2008 (Act A17-0419). Councilmember Jim Graham, Ward 1, attempted to restore funding for the automobile road, but his amendment was rejected by the District Council by a 10‚Äì3 vote.  Outcome  After two decades of dispute, the road was replaced with a trail for hikers and bicyclists. A 2011 Environmental Assessment resulted in a finding of \\"No Significant Impact\\" .Finding of No Significant Impact for Klingle Valley Trail Accessed 2012-08-11. This Assessment identified, as the \\"preferred option\\", a 10-foot-wide permeable-surface multi-use trail, full stream channel and bank stabilization for Klingle Creek, a multi-use trail connecting this trail to the existing Rock Creek trail, and pole or bollard lighting of the trail to facilitate nighttime use.

It has become a cultural symbol of Paraguay.  Location  Main entrance of Manzana de la Rivera Located at Juan de Ayolas 129, Asunci√≥n, Paraguay, the architectonic complex is a group of nine restored houses as well as some new construction. It is located in front of the Government House. Its name comes from an old nearby street name, the Calle de la Rivera.  History  Patio Leonor After the change of government in 1989, people wanted to restore a few places in town. In this context, a group of architecture students started the campaign Salvemos la Manzana frente al palacio which means let‚Äôs save the city block in front of the government house, opposing a project that intended to demolish it to build a park in its place. The restoration works started in 1991. Its first director was the architect Carlos Colombino.  Houses of la Manzana  Viola House The Viola House is a typical colonial construction dated from 1750-1758. Its location relates to the layout of the streets before Doctor Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia squared the city. The house has a tile roof. There is a gallery in front; behind the gallery there is a blacksmith's shop built over wooden beams and columns. Previously, the house had three big rooms, now there's only one, located in front . In the back part there is a passing gallery, as a sample of the culata yovai, a type of antique Paraguayan house. The roof of the gallery is made of palm and tacuara; the tiles are set with a mud kind of cement. Nowadays it houses the Museo Memoria de la Ciudad, a museum in commemoration of the city, and exhibits texts, maps, objects, paints, graphics, as well as other elements that tell the history of Asunci√≥n, since its foundation until modern times. Clari House Located next to the ‚ÄúViola House‚Äù, this house is a simple construction with an interior gallery with rooms next to each other. Built by the architect Clari at the beginnings of the 20th century with a late Art Nouveau style. The house is now used as the Caf√© Bar Casa Clari. The newly built Miguel Acevedo addition is used as an art gallery Clari-Mestre House This building, adjoining with ‚ÄúCasa Clari‚Äù was built in 1912 in a neoclassical style. When it was restored, it had a zinc roof, which was supposedly placed after its initial construction. The ceiling was made of cardboard, with relief and no colors. Due to the bad condition of the ceiling and roof, it was decided to put a tile roof on the house. Because the house has different levels, it was easy to create an auditorium. The Ruy Diaz de Guzm√°n auditorium is used for concerts, theater shows, dance shows and book presentations among various other activities. Vert√∫a House From all the buildings that make up the Manzana, this was the only one that had the possibilities of having a second floor. It was built in 1898 in a neoclassic style. There used to be a sweetshop with the same name. In 1993 it turns into the office of the Municipal Library, having more than 20.000 volumes of books. It also has an ‚Äúhemeroteca‚Äù a place for quick and actualized reading, as well as a mobile library service that visits many schools and parks in the city. Emasa House At the point of restoration, this building needed the most work. It was first used as a customs office, with a number of big rooms along one side of a hallway. After that, a printing house had been using the building, and it was necessary to remove part of the roof. Nowadays, the office of the Cultural Centre of the City, the office of the Spanish Agency of International Cooperation (Agencia Espa√±ola de Cooperacion Internacional), and the office of the Paraguayan Chamber of the Associated Booksellers (Camara paraguaya de Libreros Asociados) are in there. It also has a space named ‚ÄúLa Galeria‚Äù (the gallery) that works as an exhibition place, mainly of sculptures and equipment. Castelv√≠ House House Castelv√≠ Previously known as the ‚ÄúCasa Serra‚Äù, the ‚ÄúCastelvi House‚Äù is a building from the year 1804, and was still built within the colonial system. The house was built by the Catalan Jos√© Castelvi, who was Asuncion's vice mayor. It has the original doors, windows, window bars, and one of the floors. It's a pre-Franciscan house, located 15 m from the street; it has an external garden that forms part of the urban zone. Nowadays there are two exhibition rooms: Juan A. Samudio and Domingo Mart√≠nez de Irala. There is also a playroom for the kids. In the garden of the house is named Patio Arecay√° in commemoration of the Arecay√° Indian rebellion, and is used for various outside activities. Serra I and Serra II Houses Both houses represent the neoclassical style of housing, with rooms located near the street. They have two hallways, so it's supposed that they were two houses that merged into each other. It now houses the Municipal videotheque which has videos and documentaries on educational and cultural topics, especially designed for students. In the Patio Leonor, (joining of the internal gardens between ‚ÄúCastelvi‚Äù and ‚Äúserra I and II‚Äù) different kinds of shows are carried out. Ballario Built in 1901 in a neoclassical style, this was the house that was restored last in June, 1996. The house is site of the offices of the UNESCO in Paraguay. Sculpture at the entrance of la Manzana de la Rivera  Other facts  In 1993 there were plans to build an experimental theater in the wasteground that was part of the Manzana. A design contest was set up, in which young architects were asked to submit their ideas. The winner was Javier Corval√°n. The multi-use lounge Federico Garc√≠a Lorca was inaugurated on June 26, 1999, with the visit of the Spanish president Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar.

The first conference took place in 1988, and the 2019 conference was the thirty-second. People with an interest in canals gather together to learn more about them, to exchange views, and to enjoy and celebrate successful canal restoration projects. The organisation has undergone some name changes. The conference in 1988 was known as the \\"First National Conference on Historic Canals\\". In 1990, the \\"national\\" gave way to the \\"International Conference on Historic Canals\\", and in 1996 it became the World Canals Conference.  Attendees  The conferences are attended by large numbers of canal professionals, tourism experts and academics, as well as many canal enthusiasts and boaters, from all over the world. Their particular concerns and interests include: * preservation * restoration * urban and rural economic regeneration * sustainable development * ways of attracting tourists * education and interpretation * involvement of volunteers and the community The Conference programme duly addresses these interests by providing a varied lecture programme and relevant excursions to local canal projects. The prospectus of the 2007 Conference in Liverpool (see external link below) offers not only lectures, including on the Anderton Boat Lift, the Tate Liverpool canal warehouse conversion to a museum, the Liverpool Canal Link and the Roubaix Canal, but also local excursions and site visits, e.g. Manchester's Castlefield canals, Stalybridge on the Huddersfield Narrow Canal, and the Barton Swing Aqueduct on the Manchester Ship Canal.

In Apache country, the half-native Chato shoots the local sheriff in self-defence, and finds himself hunted by a posse of ex-Confederates, who rape his wife and leave her hogtied in the open as a bait to trap him. Ignoring the bait, Chato uses his superior fieldcraft skills to lure each of the posse to their death. The film can be classified in the revisionist Western genre, which was at its height at the time, with a dramatising of racism and oblique referencing of the Vietnam war. The original screenplay was written by Gerry Wilson. Plot The film opens as the half- Apache Chato orders a drink at a bar. The bartender ignores him and serves the local sheriff who has arrived after Chato. The sheriff calls Chato a \\"redskin\\" and tells him the bar is for whites only. He moves behind Chato while hurling a stream of abuse at him. The sheriff's taunts escalate, and he draws his gun while saying that he is going to kill Chato. Chato whirls around and shoots the sheriff in the gut, killing him, in self-defense. He rides out of town on his Appaloosa. Former Confederate officer, Captain Quincey Whitmore, dons his Confederate Army uniform, and gathers a posse, mainly composed of other former Confederate soldiers and Southern/Confederate sympathizers. As Captain Whitmore and his posse ride across the country, it grows in number at each stop. It includes local ranchers and townspeople, along with a Mexican Mestizo ranch hand employed by one of these recruited ranchers, who is used as a scout and tracker. Chato calmly watches the posse's progress, staying one step ahead of them. From a hilltop, he fires on them, drawing them into an ill-advised ascent. As the posse struggles to climb the hill, Chato descends the other side and scatters their horses. He seems generally sanguine about their pursuit. At one point, he kills a rattlesnake, chops off its rattle, and wraps the rattle in the snake's skin. He puts the bundle in his coat pocket without explanation. As the posse continues to be outwitted by Chato, their divisions become more pronounced. When they come across a set of empty wickiups the posse gleefully burn them, led by the Hooker brothers. In a valley, Chato spies a woman filling a water jug. As they smile at each other, it becomes clear that she is his wife. He greets his son and gives him the rattlesnake toy (which we realize that Chato must have fashioned earlier, from the rattlesnake that he had killed) from his pocket. They enter Chato's hogan, happy to be reunited. Chato resumes his normal life, busying himself with breaking horses during the day. The posse eventually discovers his home, and the Hooker brothers brutally gang rape Chato's wife, and then hogtie her naked outside the hogan as bait, in order to lead Chato in a trap. Perceiving the threat of ambush, Chato and his full Apache kinsman devise a plan, and Chato's kinsman creates a diversion that allows Chato to rescue his wife. During the confusion, Chato's kinsman is shot and wounded. The sadistic members of the posse hang him upside down and set him on fire while he is still alive. Disgusted by such barbarity, Whitmore shoots the burning man through the head, putting him out of his misery. As he prepares to avenge his dead friend and his violated wife, Chato abandons the dress of his European side, and dons the native moccasins and loin cloth of the Apache side of his heritage. He lures the posse members into individual traps, killing them one at a time, starting with the youngest Hooker brother, who has developed an obsessive fixation on kidnapping the woman that he had raped for himself, and goes ahead, alone, to take Chato's wife away from him, presumably after having killed Chato. After they find the younger brother staked out and dead, the posse grows more fractious, and the insidious evil of the remaining Hooker brothers, and the pressure of realizing that the posse is no longer the hunter, but, rather, the prey, rips away their unit cohesion, until they begin to turn on each other, and the sadistic Hooker brothers murder Whitmore and the peaceful holdouts, who have tried to turn back. Chato picks off the remaining members of the posse, right down to the last man, whom Chato allows to flee, in terror, alone and horseless, without supplies, deeper into Apache territory, as Chato impassively sits his horse and watches.

Reception =Critical response= When released Vincent Canby panned the film calling it a \\"...long, idiotic revenge Western...It was directed by Michael Winner in some lovely landscapes near Almeria, Spain. Just about everybody gets shot or knifed, and one man dies after Chato lassos him with a live rattlesnake.\\"Canby, Vincent. The New York Times, film review, June 8, 1972. Last accessed: May 3, 2011. TV Guide, echoing Canby, wrote, \\"A great cast is primarily wasted in this gory, below-average, and overlong film. The script could have been written for a silent film to fit with Bronson's traditional man-of-few-words image (in fact, more grunts and squint than words)...As usual Bronson must rely upon the conviction that there are viewers who find silence eloquent.\\"TV Guide, film review. Last accessed: May 3, 2011. A more recent Film4 review was more positive observing that Chato's Land \\"...though no masterpiece, is an effective and frequently disturbing piece of filmmaking. A tough, cynical western with well-paced direction and a fine performance from Charles Bronson and the cast of vagabonds out to get him. A quality film from Michael Winner.\\"Film4 web site. Last accessed: May 3, 2011. =1970s political overtones= Film critic Graeme Clark discussed an often discussed contemporary political theme of the film when it was released in the early 1970s, writing, \\"There are those who view this film as an allegory of the United States' presence in Vietnam, which was contemporary to this storyline, but perhaps that is giving the filmmakers too much credit. Granted, there is the theme of the white men intruding on a land where they are frequently under fire, and ending up humiliated as a result, but when this was made it was not entirely clear that America would be on the losing side as the conflict may have been winding down, but was by no means over.\\"Graeme Clark.

Biography speech he delivered to the U.S. Congress following the attack on Pearl Harbor, which FDR revised to begin, \\"a date which will live in infamy\\". Grace Tully was born in Bayonne, New Jersey. Her father was a businessman and a loyalist to the Democratic Party. He died when she was young, and Tully and her two sisters and brother were raised by their mother.Grace Tully Biographical Timeline, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum She received her secretarial education at the Grace Institute in New York, and after graduating was appointed as secretary to Patrick Hayes, bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. In 1928, Grace Tully started to work for the Democratic National Committee, and was assigned to assist Eleanor Roosevelt, who was organizing support for presidential nominee Al Smith. Later that year, when FDR was nominated for Governor of New York, Grace Tully went to work on his staff. After Roosevelt's successful election, Tully began serving as the assistant to Missy LeHand, who was Roosevelt's personal secretary in Roosevelt's office at Albany, New York. Tully was given the dictation and typing duties that Lehand disliked. Tully served with FDR for his four years as governor. Grace Tully moved to Washington, D.C., in 1933, when Roosevelt was elected President. Both she and Missy LeHand were important figures for FDR during his presidency. Tully frequently accompanied FDR on his trips to Hyde Park and Shangri-La (today called Camp David). When Missy LeHand suffered a stroke in 1941, Grace Tully took over her position as personal secretary to the President. Tully was not an intimate or romantic companion for Roosevelt in the same way as LeHand had been.Jean Edward Smith, FDR, p. 495, Random House, 2007 She was working for the President at his \\"Little White House\\" in Warm Springs in April 1945, and was present at his death. Then she served as the Executive Secretary for the FDR Foundation. In 1949 she published her memoirs, FDR: My Boss. In 1955 she joined the staff of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee, working with Lyndon B. Johnson, the Senate Majority Leader at the time. She retired ten years later and died in 1984.

Pronovost is Chief Clinical Transformation Officer at University Hospitals (UH) health system in Northeast Ohio. At UH, Pronovost is responsible for improving value across the health system, helping people stay well, get well and manage their most acute medical conditions. He is the clinical lead for population health and the lead for high-reliability medicine, with direct responsibility for the UH employee accountable care organization. He is also responsible for telehealth and virtual health programs serving patient and provider communities. He previously served as an intensive care specialist physician at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. He is a Professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in the Departments of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, and Surgery, Professor of Healthcare Management at the Carey Business School, Professor of Health Policy and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and is Medical Director for the Center for Innovation in Quality Patient Care. He introduced an intensive care checklist protocol that during an 18-month period saved 1500 lives and $100 million in the State of Michigan. According to Atul Gawande in The New Yorker, Pronovost's \\"work has already saved more lives than that of any laboratory scientist in the past decade\\". In 2008 Time named Pronovost one of the 100 most influential people in the world. That same year, Pronovost was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship. Pronovost's book Safe Patients, Smart Hospitals: How One Doctor's Checklist Can Help Us Change Health Care from the Inside Out was released in February 2010. Early life and education Pronovost grew up in Waterbury, Connecticut. His parents were an elementary school teacher and a math professor. He received his B.S. from Fairfield University, M.D. from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and Ph.D. from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. In his Ph.D. thesis at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, he documented that in intensive-care units in Maryland, an intensive care specialist on the staff reduced death rates by a third. Work In 2003 he founded the Quality and Safety Research Group. He has published over 200 articles and chapters on patient safety and advises the World Health Organization on improving patient safety measurement through WHO's World Alliance for Patient Safety. He started studying hospital-acquired infections in 2001, concluding that a simple 5 item check-list protocol would greatly reduce infections when inserting a central venous catheter; Doctors should: # Wash their hands with soap. # Clean the patient's skin with chlorhexidine antiseptic. # Put sterile drapes over the entire patient. # Wear a sterile mask, hat, gown and gloves. # Put a sterile dressing over the catheter site. In the Keystone Initiative, a 2003 study by a collection of Michigan hospitals and health organizations, the median rate of infections at a typical ICU dropped from 2.7 per 1,000 patients to zero after three months. The Keystone Initiative published its results in the December, 2006 New England Journal of Medicine. In the first three months of the project, the infection rate in Michigan's ICUs decreased by sixty-six per cent. In the Initiative's first eighteen months, they estimated that 1500 lives and $100 million were saved. These results were sustained for almost four years. Several reasons may explain why a simple checklist protocol is not more widely adapted: *Many physicians do not like being monitored by nurses or otherwise being forced to follow a checklist; *A wish to avoid standardized tasks and bureaucracy; and *A focus by researchers on \\"more exciting\\" issues such as disease biology and new treatment therapies. According to Pronovost, :The fundamental problem with the quality of American medicine is that we‚Äôve failed to view delivery of health care as a science. The tasks of medical science fall into three buckets. One is understanding disease biology. One is finding effective therapies. And one is ensuring those therapies are delivered effectively. That third bucket has been almost totally ignored by research funders, government, and academia. It‚Äôs viewed as the art of medicine. That‚Äôs a mistake, a huge mistake. And from a taxpayer‚Äôs perspective it‚Äôs outrageous. =Recent work= In 2013, Pronovost co-founded Doctella, a startup that provides surgical checklists for patients to improve patient engagement, patient safety, and lead to better health outcomes.Doctella.com Also in 2013, Pronovost advocated for a system of alcohol and drug testing for doctors in a Journal of the American Medical Association article. He has participated in an online course, or MOOC, from Johns Hopkins provided via Coursera. In January 2018, he announced that he would be taking a position at United HealthCare. Shortly after taking the position he was promoted to Chief Medical Officer. Within weeks of taking this position, his departure from the position and the company was confirmed, although no reason was given. In October 2018, he joined University Hospitals as Chief Clinical Transformation Officer. Honors In 2008, he was named in Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world, and was also named a MacArthur Fellow. In 2011, Pronovost was recognized for his outstanding professional achievement and commitment to service with election to membership in the Institute of Medicine, one of the highest honors in the fields of health and medicine.\\"Johns Hopkins Scientists Elected Into Institute of Medicine\\".

This principle was established by Brouwer in 1928 using intuitionistic principles, and can also be proven using Church's thesis. The analogous property in classical analysis is the fact that any continuous function from the continuum to {0,1} is constant. It follows from the indecomposability principle that any property of real numbers that is decided (each real number either has or does not have that property) is in fact trivial (either all the real numbers have that property, or else none of them do). Conversely, if a property of real numbers is not trivial, then the property is not decided for all real numbers. This contradicts the law of the excluded middle, according to which every property of the real numbers is decided; so, since there are many nontrivial properties, there are many nontrivial partitions of the continuum. In CZF, it is consistent to assume the universe of all sets is indecomposable‚Äîso that any class for which membership is decided (every set is either a member of the class, or else not a member of the class) is either empty or the entire universe.

In medieval Kerala, they served as part of the landed nobility and were sworn to the service of the rajas of the area, first that of Palghat and then later that of Cochin. Based at Kavalappara Desam in Karakkat, Valluvanada, their holdings extended to areas such as Kailiad and Panayur. Early history The Kavalappara Moopil Nayar, also known as the Karakkattu Kumaran Raman, were one of the four chiefly dynasties or perumpata nayar of ancient Nedunganad. They became independent from the chieftainship of Nedungethiri in the 15th century A.D., soon after the arrival of the Zamorin of Calicut to Nedunganad. Based at Eruppe Desam near Karakkat, Nedunganad, their holdings included some ninety- six villages.  Nedunganad  Nedunganad, one of the seventeen districts during the Chera regime of Kodungallur, was situated between Kalladikkodan hills to the seashore villages of Ponnani-Purang. The chieftain of Nedunganad, known as Nedungethirippad, was an inefficient ruler. Kavalappara Nayar with other three (Thrikkateeri Nayar, Vattakkavil and Veettikkad nayars) became more powerful than Nedungethiri. Nedungethiri asked the help of the Zamorin of Calicut. The procession of the Eralppad was known as kottichezhunnallathu. The Zamorin built a palace at Karimpuzha. This was happened soon after 1487 A.D. When the Zamorin's procession reached Karimpuzha, the three Nayar chiefs of Nedunganad, came and received him. Kavalappara refused to attend the meeting of the Eralppad at Karimpuzha. He declared independence and asked the help of Cochin. He was so fortunate, because his land was situated on the banks of River Nila, adjacent to the boundary of the King of Cochin.  Mythology and medieval history  The family are Moopil Nairs and claim to be descendants of Karakalamma, a child of Vararuchi, a Brahmin saint, and a Pulayar woman. Through this association, they also share kinship with the Kadambur Brahmins and the two communities recognise their shared ancient heritage in occasional rituals. The Kavalapparas also claim to have been independent chieftains from the later stages of the Chera dynasty until the arrival of the Zamorin of Calicut in 1748, although this is not historically accurate. K. K. N. Kurup, a historian of the Malabar region, notes that absence of their name from highly detailed documents of the period indicates that they were no more than \\"dependent landed aristocracy\\", variously of the rajas of Palghat and of Cochin. They were naduvazhi of the raja of Palghat, meaning that they were a form of feudatory governor who inherited their role, which included some political powers, but were subservient to him. During the period when clashes between the Zamorin of Calicut and the king of Cochin were common, which coincided with the arrival of Europeans in the area, the Kavalapparas were able to exploit the uncertainty and unrest to their advantage. They successfully fought in an alliance with forces from the kingdom of Travancore against the Zamorin and by around 1760 they had reached a deal with the kingdom whereby they gained independence from interference in return for ceding to it a monopoly of the pepper growing on family properties. Unhampered by the objections previously raised by the Zamorin and by the raja of Cochin, they constructed a kottaram as a physical symbol of their independence. This residence took a form common to the royal family of Travancore and thus different from the kovilakam palaces that traditionally belied the status of Malabar rulers. Thereafter, the Kavalapparas and the royal house of Travancore retained close ties and it was to Travancore that the family fled when the Mysorean occupation of Malabar dispossessed them of their properties. The Kavalappara joined with Kesava Pillai and forces of the East India Company (EIC) in the Third Anglo-Mysore War, supplying both soldiers and grain. In recognition of this, Pillai, who was Diwan of Travancore and acting for the Bombay Presidency, reinstated their position as chieftains. A dispute arose because this arrangement contradicted one made around the same time between the king of Cochin and the Madras Presidency, which allowed for the king to have control of the Kavalappara territories. In 1792, the Kavalappara chieftain ‚Äî who was seeking reinstatement in Kavalappara itself and in Edatara, Kongad and Mannur ‚Äî was given a one-year reinstatement in a subordinate role by a Joint Commission instituted by the EIC in the Bombay Presidency. This was challenged by the king of Cochin, who said that the Kavalappars were his \\"acknowledged dependent[s]\\" and paid tribute to him, but the arrangement was continued with some financial amendments in 1793. The traditional system of land tenancies and land ownership in Malabar, known as janmi, had resulted in a small number of families owning most of the land. The EIC had determined to use a slightly modified form of the existing janmi administrative processes to collect revenue. Under this modified system, the janmis were granted leases on land and were responsible for collecting revenue ‚Äî almost entirely based on a proportion of agricultural produce ‚Äî on behalf of the EIC. The janmis, such as the Kavalapparas, sublet to tenants known as kanakkarans, who had some security of tenure, and both could sublet to verumpattakkars, who were tenants-at-will. Thus, in 1794, the EIC granted the Kavalappara family a quinquennial lease on lands but it also disbarred from the feudal privileges of collecting death taxes from the Mappilas and some festival offerings from the ryots. All revenue collecting responsibilities were lost in 1796 when they were transferred to direct control of the EIC, although the EIC did return a portion of the funds collected by the system of malikhana that recognised the loyalty of certain ruling families. In common with many of his peers, the Kavalappara chieftain had amassed considerable arrears in revenue monies that he was supposed to hand over and as a result of the transfer of revenue collection he now became nothing more than a landed aristocrat without political influence. Some feudal rights were retained, notably of control over some temples, but by the end of the nineteenth century the family estates were being administered by the Court of Wards and remained so until 1910.

It was founded in 1929, and operated by the Dominican Order. The name is a reference to Psalm 42 (41): As the hart panteth after the fountains of water; so my soul panteth after thee, O God. History Editions du Cerf was founded in 1929 at the request of Pope Pius XI, by Father Marie-Vincent Bernadot. Father Bernadot had already founded a journal, La Vie spirituelle (\\"The Spiritual Life\\"), with a goal to return Christian spirituality to its true sources of Holy Scripture, the Church Fathers and the great mystics. Following this, in 1928, he and other intellectuals such as Jacques Maritain founded La Vie Intellectuelle (\\"The Intellectual Life\\"), seeking to create an alternative belief system in response to those of Charles Maurras and his far-right monarchist movement Action Fran√ßaise (condemned by the Holy See in 1926) and also to Marxist ideologies. They gave him the objective to \\"judge events in the unchanging and living light of a Christianity disengaged from conformity to the fashions of the times, where it can find itself smothered to the point of paralysis; and to cause the truth to shine, to make the message of Christ heard when it becomes obscured by the power of routine, timidity, or compromise.\\" With this mandate, the publishing house was founded, on October 11, 1929, at Juvisy-sur- Orge. In 1937, the offices were moved to Paris, at 29 Boulevard La Tour- Maubourg, in the same buildings that contain the convent of Saint Dominic.

He is considered responsible for revolutionising grape growing due to his work on canopy management techniques. Biography Smart is a graduate from Sydney University with honours in agricultural science in 1966. Additionally he holds the degrees MSc (Hons) from Macquarie University following a study of sunlight use by vineyards, a PhD from Cornell University in New York State studying under the Professor Nelson Shaulis, and in 1995 awarded a D.Sc. in agriculture by the Stellenbosch University, South Africa, in recognition of research into canopy management effects on vineyard yield and quality. Smart is the developer of the Smart-Dyson Trellis, a modification of the Scott Henry trellis, with curtains trained up and down from the one cordon, along with John Dyson of California.winepros.com.au. Smart is the author of the book Sunlight into Wine as well as a contributor to several trade publications, and the viticulture editor of The Oxford Companion to Wine.winepros.com.au. Global warming changes Smart has warned that as a consequence of the ongoing ramifications of global warming, there will be a variety of effects on viticulture, among which that some red grape varieties may lose colour, some wines will lose varietal flavor, some white varieties may disappear. He has also warned of the consequent dangers of vine infestation as temperatures rise, particularly in the case of the glassy-winged sharpshooter, vector of Pierce's Disease, and the aphid Hyalestes obsoletus, which spreads a phytoplasma disease Bois Noir. Higher temperatures mean both insects will be able to survive winters and move further. Hyalestes obsoletus has recently been found in German vines. Furthermore, he has stated that following the Earth's changes, China is set to come to prominence as a wine-producing region.

White Chair in Sleep Medicine, as well as a Distinguished Chair in Consciousness Science, at the University of Wisconsin. He is best known for his IIT, a mathematical theory of consciousness, which he has proposed since 2004 and the symbol of which is Phi (œÜ). Biography Tononi was born in Trento, Italy, and obtained an M.D. in psychiatry and a Ph.D. in neurobiology at the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa, Italy. He is an authority on sleep, and in particular the genetics and etiology of sleep. Tononi and collaborators have pioneered several complementary approaches to study sleep: * genomics * proteomics * fruit fly models * rodent models employing multiunit / local field potential recordings in behaving animals * in vivo voltammetry and microscopy * high-density EEG recordings and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in humans * large-scale computer models of sleep and wakefulness This research has led to a comprehensive hypothesis on the function of sleep (proposed with sleep researcher Chiara Cirelli), the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis. According to the hypothesis, wakefulness leads to a net increase in synaptic strength, and sleep is necessary to reestablish synaptic homeostasis. The hypothesis has implications for understanding the effects of sleep deprivation and for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to sleep disorders and neuropsychiatric disorders. Tononi is a leader in the field of consciousness studies, and has co-authored a book on the subject with Nobel prize winner Gerald Edelman. Tononi also developed the integrated information theory (IIT): a scientific theory of what consciousness is, how it can be measured, how it is correlated with brain states, and why it fades when we fall into dreamless sleep and returns when we dream. The theory is being tested with neuroimaging, Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and computer models. His work has been described as \\"the only really promising fundamental theory of consciousness\\" by collaborator Christof Koch.

Kn√∫tsdr√°pur (plural of Kn√∫tsdr√°pa) are Old Norse skaldic compositions in the form of dr√°pur which were recited for the praise of Cnut. Most of √ìttarr's poem is cited in the Kn√Ωtlinga saga, while one stanza is known only from other sources such as the Heimskringla. It has been debated whether strophe 9 truly belongs to √ìttarr's Kn√∫tsdr√°pa or to a poem which √ìttarr composed for Cnut's father Svein Haraldsson.Egilsson, et al. (eds.). Edda Snorra Sturlusonar.

I/105), by Joseph Haydn was composed in London between February and March 1792. The work is a sinfonia concertante with four instruments in the solo group: violin, cello, oboe and bassoon. It is believed to be a response to similar works composed by Ignaz Pleyel, a former student of Haydn's who London newspapers were promoting as a 'rival' to Haydn. In addition to the solo group the Sinfonia Concertante is scored for flute, 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani and strings.  Background  The composition was written during the first of the composer's two visits to London. It is believed that Johann Peter Salomon asked Haydn to compose the work because of the success of similar works written by Pleyel and performed in a rival concert series. Manuscript evidence indicates that the work was written in some haste and Haydn is known to have complained of eyestrain while working on it. The first performance was given on 9 March 1792, with Salomon as lead violinist in the solo group. The other members of the solo group are only known by their surnames, Harrington (Oboe), Holmes (Bassoon) and Menel (Cello). The performance was highly successful and not only was the work encored the following week, it was performed again during Haydn's 1794 visit to London with equal success. Reviewing the first performance, The Monday Herald commented as follows: \\"The last performance at SALOMAN'S Concert deserves to be mentioned as one of the richest treats which the resent season has afforded. A new concertante from HAYDN combined with all the excellencies of music; it was profound, airy, affecting, and original, and the performance was in unison with the merit of the composition. SALOMON particularly exerted himself on this occasion, in doing justice to the music of his friend HAYDN... The room had a very brilliant attendance.\\"Landon, H. C. Robbins, liner notes to Haydn: Cello Concertos in C & D, Sinfonia Concertante, Steven Isserlis, Chamber Orchestra of Europe, Sir Roger Norrington, BMG Classics, 1998 The Oracle was also enthusiastic, giving the performance this notice: \\"Haydn directed for the first time the Performance of a New Concertante -- the third movement of which seemed expressly calculated to shew the brilliancy of SALOMON'S, and the sweetness of his tone. The prevailing manner of this Master pervaded every movement -- it had all his usual grandeur, contrasted by the levity of airy transition, and the sudden surprises of abrupt rests... The Company were very brilliant.\\"  Structure  There are three movements: #Allegro #Andante #Finale: Allegro con spirito A typical performance will take between 21 and 25 minutes.

Career Marcel H√∂ttecke began his career in his hometown soccer club TSV R√ºthen. His qualities got noticed and he soon transferred into the youth team of SC Lippstadt. From there he moved on to Westfalia Erwitte and then to SC Paderborn 07. It didn't take long before scouts from LR Ahlen (now Rot Weiss Ahlen) recognized Marcel's great talent and hired him for his youth team. In the 2006/07 season and still a youth player, he became part of the professional team of LR Ahlen, which at that time played in the second division (2. Bundesliga) in Germany. During the winter break he moved to Borussia Dortmund, where he was behind Roman Weidenfeller and Marc Ziegler the third goalkeeper of the first team. As goalkeeper of the second team of Dortmund, he played in the 2007/08 season in the Regionalliga Nord in 30 games, 17 times with a clean sheet. Marcel had his debut in the Bundesliga (first division in Germany) on April 16, 2008 in the 1:3 home defeat against Hannover 96. He was also between the posts in the May 2nd, 2008 game against 1 FC Nuremberg, in which he did not concede a goal and the game ended scoreless 0:0. In the last game of the 2007-08 lower division regional league season H√∂ttecke was seriously injured and as a result missed the entire 2008/09 season. Coming back from the injury, he reclaimed the spot of first goalkeeper of the second team of Borussia Dortmund, playing in the 3rd division. Trying to move back into a higher level team, Marcel H√∂ttecke joined the second division team of 1. FC Union Berlin in mid-April 2010. H√∂ttecke was hired as backup goalkeeper to Jan Glinker and received a contract until the end of the 2012/13 season. In the course of the season H√∂ttecke replaced Jan as the #1 goalkeeper and played most of the games of the regular season. His good performances were also honored by the fans who voted him \\"Unioner of the Year 2011\\". In the following season, H√∂ttecke started as a regular goalkeeper, but then again got seriously injured at the beginning of the season and then lost his place back to Glinker. With the hiring of Daniel Haas as a goalkeeper at the beginning of the season 2012/13 at Union Berlin, H√∂ttecke finally lost his #1 goalkeeper place in the squad. Nevertheless, he remained with the team until the end of his contract. After his departure from Union Berlin, he moved to Berliner AK 07 into the fourth division in Germany, the Regionalliga. After a season at the BAK 07 in 2014, H√∂ttecke returned to his birth town and former club SV Lippstadt 08. After the season 2015/16, in June 2016, H√∂ttecke ended his active career as a goalkeeper. But he is staying loyal to the sport of soccer and starting with season 2016/17 joined Borussia M√∂nchengladbach as goalkeeper coach in the youth department, U17-U19.

Early life Pugsley was born in Minnesota. He attended El Camino Junior College, the University of Florida, and graduated from UCLA. After serving in the U.S. Army, he spent a year cruising on a 38-foot sailboat, and another year living in Mexico with his wife and children. He then returned to the U.S. and spent the next two decades as a businessman. Career In the late 1950s to mid 1960s Pugsley worked at General Dynamics - Astronautics Sycamore Canyon Rocket Test facility as a technical writer. Among other projects, he wrote countdown procedures for Atlas and Centaur Rocket tests. In the late 1960s Pugsley entered the investment business, founded a publishing company, the Common Sense Press, and wrote his first book, Common Sense Economics. It sold over 150,000 hardcover copies. His second book, The Alpha Strategy (1980), was on the New York Times bestseller list for nine weeks in 1981. Pugsley distributed a PDF edition of the book free of charge (as of 2012, the author's domain has expired. A reposting of the PDF has been provided by fans). Even after 31 years in circulation as of 2012, The Alpha Strategy is considered a standard reference on stocking up on food and household goods as a hedge against inflation.

Because of its unusually small angular size, it was thought to be young‚Äîless than about one thousand years old. In 2007, X-ray observations made with the Chandra X-ray Observatory revealed that the object was about 15% larger than in the earlier VLA observations. Further observations made with the VLA in 2008 verified increase in size, implying it is no more than 150 years old. A more recent estimate put its observable age at 110 years as of the data collection in 2008. That study also found that it was probably triggered by the merger of two white dwarf stars. Announcement The discovery that G1.9+0.3 had been identified as the youngest known Galactic SNR was announced on May 14, 2008 at a NASA press conference. In the days leading up to the announcement, NASA said that they were going \\"to announce the discovery of an object in our Galaxy astronomers have been hunting for more than 50 years.\\" Before this discovery, the youngest-known Milky Way supernova remnant was Cassiopeia A, at about 330 years.

It houses Kirkaldy's huge testing machine, and many smaller more modern machines. It is open on the first Sunday of each month. The building at 99 Southwark Street became a listed building in 1971, and was promoted to Grade II* in June 2014. Background Kirkaldy was born in Dundee in 1820, and educated at Edinburgh University. He worked at Napier shipbuilding works from 1843, where he became Chief Draughtsman and Calculator. He left in 1861 and over the next two and a half years studied existing mechanical testing methods and designed his own testing machine. William Fairbairn had pioneered tensile strength measurement as well as assessing creep and fatigue on large structures as well as small. Entirely at his own expense, Kirkaldy commissioned his machine from the Leeds firm of Greenwood & Batley, closely supervising its production. Aggrieved over the slow rate of manufacture, after 15 months he had the machine delivered to Southwark still unfinished, in September 1865. Universal Testing Machine Kirkaldy's testing machine. The testing machine is long and weighs some . It works horizontally, the load applied by a hydraulic cylinder and ram. The working fluid is water not oil. The load is measured by a weighing system consisting of a number of levers with the final one carrying a jockey weight. The operator lets water into the hydraulic cylinder and as the pressure and hence load on the test piece increases the jockey weight is wound along to balance the hydraulic load. As it is wound it moves along a graduated scale and when the object under test fails the number on this scale is noted and multiplied by the weight to give the failure load. The weight can be varied in increments of using slotted plates on a hanger. On the lower scale this reads up to , and up to can be put onto the hanger. A separate jockey weight system above this one allowed the machine to measure loads of up to . The machine is kept in working order at the Kirkaldy Museum in Southwark. Problems can occur with the gasket which seals the single hydraulic cylinder. The gasket is in the original material, leather, rather than a more modern material. Originally the London Hydraulic Power Company supplied the high-pressure water, but now the museum uses an electric pump. When breaking specimens for visitor demonstrations a load not exceeding is used. Kirkaldy also developed methods for examining the microstructure of metals using optical microscopy. It involved cutting sections, polishing the sections and then etching to reveal different constituents. Notable tests The Kirkaldy works also tested components for the Eads Bridge across the Mississippi River in St. Louis, USA, which was completed in 1874, for Hammersmith Bridge (1887), the old Wembley Stadium (1923), and for the Skylon that was built for the nearby Festival of Britain in 1951. It also helped accident analysis by testing materials from structures that failed, including the Tay Bridge Disaster of 1879 and the BOAC Flight 781 De Havilland Comet crash of 1954. =Tay bridge disaster= Fallen Tay Bridge from the north In 1880 Kirkaldy tested many samples from the first Tay railway bridge for the official Inquiry into the collapse of the bridge's central section on 28 December 1879. He confirmed that the wrought iron tie bars failed at their connections to the cast iron columns of the bridge, when he tested intact tie bars with complete lugs still attached. The attachments were cast iron lugs which fractured at the bolt holes, and after the disaster numerous fractured lugs were found lying on the piers. The critical strengthening elements were much weaker than had been supposed by Thomas Bouch, the engineer of the first bridge. They failed at about tensile load rather than the specified , and were a prime cause of the collapse of the bridge. Since Kirkaldy tested several samples of each of the lower and upper lugs, he was able to show that they exhibited a range of strengths, the lowest results being caused by defects like blow holes in the cast metal. Thus some of the upper lugs were actually weaker than the strongest lower lugs, an observation confirmed by damage shown on the remains left on the piers after the disaster. He tested the wrought iron tie bars themselves, and they proved tough, as specified, although only slightly stronger than the cast iron lugs to which they were attached. The high girders were also made of wrought iron and had a very high tensile strength. They were found after the accident at the bottom of the Tay estuary and had sustained relatively little damage compared with the cast iron columns which supported them. Some were reused in local houses, and when they were demolished in the 1960s, some were removed to the Royal Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, where they are on public display. Building of the Eads Bridge, St. Louis, USA Kirkaldy Testing Works Kirkaldy first operated his machine at premises on The Grove, Southwark, London SE1. His business was successful, and he moved the machine to larger purpose-built new premises at 99 Southwark Street, leased from the Crown Estate, in 1874. The new building was designed in an Italian Romanesque style by the architect Thomas Roger Smith and constructed in 1873. The four-storey building has five bays, and was built of brown and yellow stock brocks with buff banding and stucco details around the door and windows. Over the door is the motto \\"Facts not Opinions\\". The heavy machine was installed on the ground floor, supported by brick piers in the basement. The testing room retains many of its original features, including fitted shelving and matchboard dado, with a ceiling held up by cast iron beams supported by four iron pillars. The basement houses a Denison machine for testing marine chains, acquired by Kirkaldy in 1906. After Kirkaldy's death in 1897, the testing works were run by his son William George Kirkaldy (1862‚Äì1914) and then by his widow Annie with a manager Dr Gilbert Henry Gulliver. Kirkaldy's grandson David William Henry Kirkaldy (1910‚Äì1992) took over in 1934. When he retired in 1965, the business was acquired by Treharne & Davies, but closed as a commercial venture in 1974. The upper floors of the building were converted into offices, but the basement and ground floors reopened as a museum in 1984. The works became a listed building in 1971, promoted to Grade II* in June 2014.Kirkaldy's testing works and testing machine, List Entry Summary, Historic England The new landlord had plans to convert the museum space into a restaurant, but negotiations to renew the museum's lease continue as of October 2015.

The shock had a moment magnitude of 6.6 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). The earthquake was particularly destructive in Bam, with the death toll amounting to at least 26,271 people and injuring up to 30,000. The effects of the earthquake were exacerbated by the use of mud brick as the standard construction medium; many of the area's structures did not comply with earthquake regulations set in 1989. Following the earthquake the U.S. offered direct humanitarian assistance to Iran and in return the state promised to comply with an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency which supports greater monitoring of its nuclear interests. In total a reported 44 countries sent in personnel to assist in relief operations and 60 countries offered assistance. Following the earthquake, the Iranian government seriously considered moving the capital of Tehran in fear of an earthquake occurring there. The earthquake had a psychological impact on many of the victims for years afterwards. A new institutional framework in Iran was established to address problems of urban planning and to reconstruct the city of Bam in compliance with strict seismic regulations. This process marked a turning point, as government ministers and international organizations collaborated under this framework with local engineers and local people to organize the systematic rebuilding of the city. Background =City of Bam= An ancient site near Bam, taken in September 2003, three months before the earthquake. Before the earthquake, Bam had a population of roughly 97,000. It is one of the most popular tourism areas of Iran, one of its most popular attractions being its 2000-year-old mud-brick Bam Citadel. During the Safavid dynasty (1501‚Äì1736) Bam was a large trading hub due to its location on the Silk Road. It gradually declined in significance after the Afghans invaded in 1722, serving as an army camp until its abandonment in 1932. The city became a tourist attraction in 1953, when restoration of Bam's Old Quarter began. =Iranian earthquake education= There is little earthquake education in Iran although the International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology established a Public Education Department in 1990 to improve \\"the safety, preventing, and preparedness culture against the earthquake among all groups of the society\\". In October 2003, Bahram Akasheh, professor of geophysics at Tehran University, called the effects of public ignorance about earthquakes \\"poisonous\\". =Tectonics= Intersection of tectonic plates in Iran. Iran suffers from frequent earthquakes, with minor quakes occurring almost daily. This earthquake occurred as a result of stresses generated by movement of one tectonic plate, the Arabian plate, moving northward against another, the Eurasian plate, at approximately per year. The Earth's crust deforms in response to the plate motion in a broad zone spanning the width of Iran and extending north into Turkmenistan. Earthquakes occur as the result of reverse faulting and strike-slip faulting in the zone of deformation. The preliminary analysis of the pattern of seismic-waves radiating from December 26, 2003 earthquake was consistent with the earthquake having been caused by right-lateral strike-slip motion on a north-south oriented fault. The earthquake occurred in a region within which major north-south, right-lateral, strike-slip faults had been previously mapped, and the epicenter is near the previously mapped, north-south oriented Bam Fault. However, field investigations will be necessary to find if the earthquake occurred on the Bam Fault or on another. The Bam earthquake is south of the destructive earthquakes of June 11, 1981 (magnitude 6.6, approximately 3,000 deaths) and July 28, 1981 (magnitude 7.3, approximately 1,500 deaths). These earthquakes were caused by a combination of reverse-motion and strike-slip motion on the north-south oriented Gowk fault. The rupture length of the earthquake was estimated to be around 24 kilometers. More than half of the quake was produced from its southern segment of approximately , where the slip reached a maximum of up to resulting in a large stress drop of at least 6 MPa. Optical remote sensing data shows that the Bam fault is not a single fault but consists of a 4‚Äì5 km wide fault system with the main branch running between the cities of Bam and Baravat. The fault ruptured by the Bam earthquake is believed to stretch the along northwest branch of this fault system from Bam southward. Based on these results, scientists suggest that the Bam earthquake ruptured a hidden fault and that in this process an unusually strong asperity was involved, causing the widespread devastation of the tremor. Damage and casualties The quake occurred at 01:56 UTC (5:26 AM Iran Standard Time) on December 26, 2003. Its epicenter was roughly southwest of the ancient city of Bam. Maximum intensities were at Bam and Baravat, with the most damage concentrated within the radius around the city. The earthquake damage in Bam At least 26,271 people were killed and 30,000 injured. In terms of human loss the quake was the worst to occur in Iranian history. The BBC reported that a large number of victims were crushed while sleeping. Eleven-thousand students were killed and 1/5 of the 5,400 local teaching staff were also. This caused a significant problem for the local education system. Up to ninety percent of buildings and infrastructure in the Bam area were either damaged or destroyed, with 70% of houses being completely destroyed, plus 70‚Äì90% of Bam's residential areas. This left an estimated 100,000 homeless. Not a single house was standing in Baravat. An important regional center during the 16th and 17th centuries, Bam contained many buildings that were not constructed to survive such ruptures. Many houses in Bam were homemade, and its owners did not use skilled labor or proper building materials to resist earthquakes in the construction. These were often built in the traditional mud-brick style. Mohsen Aboutorabi, professor of architecture at the University of Central England, demonstrated the lack of good building materials by banging two bricks together in Bam, resulting in cracking. On the other hand, Iranian regulations laid down in the 1989 Iran seismic code were better enforced in high rise buildings and skyscrapers. Damage to a building in Bam One reason for the large number of casualties was that when the walls began to fall down, the heavy roofs would collapse, leaving few air pockets in them. The dust and lack of oxygen contributed to the suffocation of survivors. The Iranian government promised to prosecute anyone who violated building regulations, even setting up a special unit to deal with the issue. A study of 210 victims showed that on average, each person had spent 1.9 hours under destroyed buildings. Among the victims, approximately 19 had compartment syndrome, 32 contracted impaired renal function, and fractures among their bones were common. As a result of these fractures neural injuries were also common. The Bam Citadel was considered one of the best surviving mud citadels before the quake. Most of it was destroyed, including a large square tower. Electricity and water supplies were cut by the earthquake. At least 29 serious aftershocks struck Bam following the main shock.\\" A large number of schools were affected by the tremor. An estimated 1,200 teachers and 10,000 students were killed. Ali Zang-Abadi, head of education in Bam, described the state of pupils and teachers as \\"badly need[ing] psychological help because they are morally devastated\\". Around January 5, teachers were being registered to resume educating. Response =Iran‚ÄìUnited States relations= Relations between the United States and Iran thawed due to the earthquake. U.S.-Iranian relations had been tense during the early years of the George W. Bush. presidency, having reached a low after the \\"axis of evil\\" speech given by President George W. Bush. However, following the earthquake, White House spokesman Scott McClellan spoke on behalf of President Bush: \\"Our thoughts and prayers are with those who were injured and with the families of those who were killed.\\" Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue squad inspect earthquake damage in Bam The U.S. offered direct humanitarian assistance to Iran which was initially rejected but accepted later. On December 30 an 81-member emergency response team was deployed to Iran via U.S. military aircraft which consisted of search and rescue squads, aid coordinators, and medical support resulting in the first U.S. military airplanes to land in Iran for more than 20 years. Sanctions were temporarily relieved to help the rescue effort. In return, Iran promised to comply with an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency which supported better monitoring of its nuclear interests. This led U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell to suggest direct talks with Iran in the future, however, he also said that the U.S. was still concerned about other Iranian issues such as the prospect of terrorism and the country's support of Hamas. Reaction to the help and rescue from the U.S. was mixed. It was well received by physicians and civilians at the scene, however, in contrast to this support, IRNA, the state-controlled radio in Iran, accused the United States of illegal interference in internal matters. Khatami, while not criticizing U.S. aid, had expressed regret about the politicization of this event. Interior Minister Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari accepted U.S. assistance but rejected Israeli assistance due to the political tensions between the two countries and Iran's lack of recognition of the state of Israel. =Relief= Bam was described as \\"literally a rubble pile\\" by the U.S. relief coordinator, Bill Garvelink. Iranian President Mohammad Khatami called the earthquake a \\"national tragedy\\" and urged all Iranians to help its victims. The disaster brought in prompt pledges of aid, resulting in President Khatami's statement that the \\"spirit of humanity and kindness is alive.\\" The Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei visited the damaged areas on December 29, urging all Iranians and international organizations to help in anyway possible. On January 8, the International Federation of the Red Cross and the U.N. launched an international appeal for relief together at a conference in Bam, appealing for $42 million and $31.3 million respectively. In response a reported 44 countries sent in personnel to assist in operations and 60 countries had offered assistance in the aftermath of the earthquake. By January 15, the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) had distributed approximately 100,000 rations of food. The United Nations sent experts to coordinate the relief effort. The Red Crescent set up tents to house survivors. The People's Republic of China was one of the first countries to supply aid. Upon hearing of the quake, it immediately sent a 43-member rescue squad. In total, its government donated 15 million yuan (US$1.81 million). Many individuals and companies also donated money and/or supplies. Tents being constructed in the United Nations compound in Bam The 81-member emergency response team worked with an 11-member Fairfax County USAR Task Force (VA-TF1), 57 member International Medical/Surgical Response Team (IMSuRT), and a 6-member Management Support Team (MST) from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). USAID and OFDA sent in five airlifts of supplies for relief, including 1,146 tents, 4,448 kitchen sets, approximately 12,500 blankets, and 430 rolls of plastic sheeting amounting to a cost of $543,605. The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) sent in seven C-130s with approximately 68 tonnes of medical supplies and 2,000 blankets also assisting in relief. From December 31 to January 4, the IMSuRT field hospital treated 727 patients, including surgeries and post-trauma cases of shock. The IMSuRT hospital closed on January 5, and from then on the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) field hospital took the responsibility, reporting 550 outpatients per day on January 13. That day, the IFRC announced that the Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS) had sent in 75 volunteers, organized in 11 teams to treat earthquake survivors for shock and to provide psychological support. During the nights following the earthquake, the temperatures would drop to \\"bitterly cold\\" extremes, effectively killing some survivors. Many of these individuals were living in unheated tents among the rubble which forced the coordinators to move thousands of families to heated camps on the outskirts of Bam. Unfortunately, this action was met with some resistance and resulted in many residents to stay in place. The Iranian government was, conversely, criticized for not doing enough supplying of tents. Those that owned motorized vehicles were met with jammed traffic going both ways through Bam. Survivors loaded their belongings to move elsewhere while relief supplies, volunteers, and relatives were arriving. In some areas, looters stole food from warehouses and local markets, causing the police force to react to stop further destabilization of the rescue efforts. On December 29, a baby girl named Nassin was discovered alive under the rubble in her deceased mother's arms. China Daily called it \\"a rare moment of joy amid the devastation of Iran's worst earthquake for years.\\" Around this time, relief operations had begun to shift from finding survivors to caring for them. Rescue workers began to slow their efforts, although three individuals were discovered alive shortly after. Water and electricity were restored to most parts of the city by then as well. One of the most notable rescues was that of 97-year-old SharbƒÅnou MƒÅzandarƒÅnƒ´ (ÿ¥Ÿáÿ±ÿ®ÿßŸÜŸà ŸÖÿßÿ≤ŸÜÿØÿ±ÿßŸÜ€å in Persian), who was trapped in her home for eight days until she was rescued unhurt on January 3. Rescue workers took three hours to dig her out after sniffer dogs found her. Renewed media interest came to Bam on January 8, when a man was pulled out of the rubble alive. The chances of finding more living survivors following this were reportedly very slim. An Iranian navy helicopter crashed southwest of Bam on December 28 after making a delivery of tents and blankets. It was headed toward Bandar Abbas as it went down for unknown reasons. On deck were two pilots and a third person, none of whom survived. The helicopter was one of more than 500 who delivered aid to the Bam region. Aftermath The Iranian government considered moving the capital of Tehran after the earthquake in response to scientific predictions After the earthquake, the Iranian government considered moving the state capital from Tehran to another location for fear of a crippling event similar to what had just befallen Bam. Tehran lies on a major fault which scientists have predicted may suffer from a devastating earthquake similar to that of Bam in the near future. The most cited example for the new capital was Isfahan, a city in central Iran that had previously served as capital until it was moved to Tehran in 1788. The year 2003 was later declared to be the deadliest earthquake year globally since 1990, primarily due to the Bam earthquake which contributed almost 75% of the Earth's earthquake fatalities for that year. =Reconstruction= Planning In January 2004, the United Nations estimated that a reconstruction of Bam would cost between US$700 million and $1 billion. It called on the international community to provide money for this endeavor. The Iranian government had announced over state television that it had earmarked roughly $410 million for this reconstruction. Given the failure of the mud brick buildings and lack of compliance with the 1989 Iranian seismic code, the reconstruction in Bam paid special attention to using earthquake durable materials. Dr. Hamid Eskander who was in charge of the Bam reconstruction effort said \\"There will be no more mud bricks in Bam. The new design will have to take into account proper seismic design techniques and parameters. When you go with the old-style buildings and old-style engineering you're looking for trouble so we're going to change it now.\\"* Horst Indorf, a representative for permanent shelter issues from ASB, a German non-government organization, frowned on the use of iron structures in the city given its movement during an earthquake, saying \\"The best architecture for this area is clay brick (with nets) but this means 80 to 90 cm thick walls and a very good insulated roof\\". While reconstruction efforts got underway, the Housing Foundation (HF) took action to provide temporary shelters for the homeless and initiated a program for removing debris of about 19,000 houses in the city and 4,000 in rural areas. The Iranian Government established the Guiding Office for the Recovery of Bam (GO), consisting of a panel of 11 members, with the Minister of Housing and Urban Development as the chairman. The G.O. played a key role in the reconstruction progress by appointing consulting architects to plan, analyze and review possible strategies in the urban redesign for enhanced earthquake resistance in the future. The general community affected by the earthquake were given the liberty to actively participate in the planning, design and construction process, with householders often contributing in the reconstruction by selecting their own designs and cooperating with the architects and contractors to ensure a desirable and effective redevelopment. Also established was the Council of Architecture and Urban Development (CAUD), a council of eight prominent professionals including HF members, architects, engineers, and businessman. CAUD played a role in the governance and finance of the reconstruction by ensuring that new structures complied with guidelines and by regulating bank loans and credit for the newly built structures. The council inaugurated the Bam Sustainable Reconstruction Manifesto, a further committee of experts in reconstruction to ensure the planning and building was conducted in coordination with the seismic code but also to retain the sense of urban identity of Bam during these efforts. The United Nations Human Settlements Programme, UN-HABITAT, launched a project to address the issue of earthquake-resistant structures on March 1, 2004 in Bam. The UN worked together with the government councils and the community to overlook the reconstruction process which also involved the Islamic Revolutionary Housing Foundation. The UN Habitat project was scheduled to last six months and was estimated to cost $400,000. Problems of redevelopment While the established councils and efforts at collaborative planning were set up during the reconstruction phase, it has been considerably more difficult for the many stakeholders in the building to gain consensus on architectural decision making, given diverse and often conflicting interests. In reality actual collaboration was more limited than initially foreseen, and international support and involvement in relation to actual reconstruction was low. In addition to this, the reconstruction plan has been markedly slow to implement. It took a considerable amount of time for the planning company to prepare the city's new overall urban plan, and two years after the disaster was still not adopted and authorised for implementation by the councils involved. This was largely due to a conflict of interest between them and the contractors and the differing architectural demands of people at a local level. Consequently, the actual reconstruction was initiated without acknowledgment to the overall urban strategic master plan, resulting in the discarding of many of the original proposals and scope for collaboration. Notably the city reconstruction planners have had serious difficulties in regards to the planning of the streets and their width, which has seen them purchase over 1200 properties to facilitate and help shape the infrastructural redevelopment process. One of the factors that the re-developers failed to take into account was therefore social factors such as vulnerability, resulting in a slow rebuilding process.http://www.ehs.unu.edu/file.php?id=355 Successes and benefits of redevelopment Although the reconstruction process was prolonged and planning was often difficult to coordinate and approve, the post-earthquake reconstruction of Bam is considered by the stakeholders in the process to be of monumental importance and influence in the future for the way in which reconstruction programs in the country operate. During the reconstruction of Bam, the engineers significantly raised the standards of building and the obligations of the 1989 Seismic building code were closely followed. Economically, the redevelopment of Bam following the earthquake provided the city with considerable opportunities for growth, and culturally, despite the extensive damage caused by the earthquake, has seen many continuities and even an advancement in these traditions. Notably the redesign and rebuilding of the city greatly improved the irrigation system and its quality, crucial to the date industry in Bam. During the reconstruction process, the improvement of the irrigation system beyond its original state increased the quality and quantity of production, and the rapidity of the process prevented the collapse of date production following the earthquake. The growth of the date industry since the earthquake in Bam has seen the expansion of the palm orchards, and an increase in investment and employment. =Medical impact= Psychologically, the earthquake had a profound impact on its victims and not just in the immediate aftermath. As a result of the quake, two hospitals in Bam collapsed leaving the remaining hospitals to be overcrowded. Emergency centers were set up to care for the injured, though many centers did not have enough room to do so. Of all of Bam's health workers, half were killed in the rupture. The World Health Organization (WHO) appealed for $4 million in medical relief. One of the priorities in this operation was to help mental health patients, many of whom were traumatized over the experience. A situation report released by the U.N. Disaster Assessment Coordination Team noted a rise in post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Another effect of the rupture on the medical community was the disruption of drug trafficking. Before the earthquake in Bam, roughly 20% of the population over 15 was addicted. Syringes with opium were supplied to drug addicts in the aftermath. The Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS), who had begun a planned six month recuperation programme in the aftermath, were still present in Bam a year later. In September 2004, the treatment of mental disorders associated with the disaster was still at a high level, with one counselling centre in Bam receiving 129 new Post Traumatic Stress Disorder patients in that month. In December 2004, Mohammed Mukhier, head of delegation for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Iran said about the situation, ‚ÄúTwelve months later, signs of the devastation are still evident, not just in the collapsed buildings but in peoples‚Äô minds. Integrating psychological support into the relief effort right from the beginning of a sudden-onset disaster is a model that could be used more widely. Our experience in Iran can be used in response to future disasters elsewhere, and we should take care to provide that support both to the victims and to rescue workers.\\" The psychological programme assessed 20,000 people, 9,300 of which were identified as needing mental support, with more than 5,600 people going through individual or group counseling as a result. The Iranian Red Crescent Society received support from the Red Cross societies of Denmark, Iceland, and Italy but the main source of funding was provided by ECHO, the humanitarian office of the European Union. The programme not only provided conventional medical therapy, but also provided affected people with leisure facilities such as painting, sewing and computer classes as a treatment. Although the permanent hospital in Bam was rebuilt, the temporary hospital is stored in preparation for a future emergency response to as disaster, not only in Iran but in the regional area. In response to the earthquake, the International Federation of the Red Cross mobilized international funds and resources to assist the Iranian Red Crescent in vastly improving its environmental disaster response strategies which has seen the construction of an urban health center and ten schools with a formal training programme for its relief officers, and a road rescue station, completed in late 2005. Rise of illicit drugs and fall-off working people of bam After the earthquake, survivors began using opium on a large scale which was easily accessible due to Bam's location on a trade route for drugs coming from Afghanistan and Pakistan. By 2006, over 50% of men and roughly 15% of women were addicted with the youngest addict allegedly being 11 years of age. Construction workers have historically been large injectors, and the rise in addiction may have been attributed to this group passing needles on to the public. An anonymous UNICEF worker claimed that drugs were slowing reconstruction and lessening motivation. =Films based on the earthquake= Colors of Memory, released in 2008, tells the story of a surgeon who returns home to Bam after living in Germany for 33 years. Dr. Parsa arrives in Tehran to perform a complex operation, where he notices a family friend named \\"Quanati\\" who urges him to come back to his hometown of Bam for assistance. The film was praised by Canadian Online Explorer as \\"both celebratory and heartbreaking\\" and urged Iranians \\"to bring tissues.\\" Voices of Bam, released in 2006, is a Dutch-made documentary film about the incident.

History The word brig is Scots for \\"bridge\\", hence the Brig o' Doon is the \\"Bridge over the River Doon\\". The bridge is thought to have been built in the early fifteenth century. According to John R. Hume, the bridge was built by James Kennedy, who died in 1465, but the first recorded mention was in 1512. The bridge was described as \\"ruinous\\" in 1593. The bridge features on the 2007 and 2016 series of ¬£5 notes issued by the Bank of Scotland, alongside the statue to Robert Burns, that is located in Dumfries.Bank of Scotland - ¬£5 Polymer Design The bridge is located near Alloway and crosses the River Doon. It is a single arched bridge, with a steeply humped span of and a rise of . It has been repaired many times, most recently in 1978, and many parts of the stonework do not match. The B7024 public road is carried over the River Doon by the New Bridge of Doon, a single-arch stone bridge built downstream of the old one in 1816 to cope with increasing traffic. The old bridge was sold to the builders of the new bridge as a quarry for material, but money was raised to purchase the old bridge back, and the trustees of the new bridge decided to quarry somewhere else. In literature Tam O‚ÄôShanter reaches Brig o'Doon, Robbie Burns Statue, Victoria Park, Halifax, Nova Scotia The line of the cobbles in the roadway is cranked, due to the belief that this pattern would stop witches from crossing. It is used as the setting for the final verse of the Robert Burns's poem Tam o' Shanter. In this scene Tam is on horseback and is being chased by Nannie the witch. He is just able to escape her by crossing the bridge (over a running stream), narrowly avoiding her attack as she is only able to grab the horse's tail which comes away in her hands: \\"The carlin caught her by the rump and left puir Meg wi' scarce a stump.\\" The Broadway musical Brigadoon also takes its name from this site, though the musical's location is fictional.

Diaspidid scales are far more substantial than those of most other families, incorporating the exuviae from the first two nymphal instars and sometimes faecal matter and fragments of the host plant. These can be complex and extremely waterproof structures rather resembling a suit of armor. For this reason these insects are commonly referred to as armored scale insects.

A lithophane presents a three-dimensional image ‚Äì completely different from two-dimensional engravings and daguerreotypes that are \\"flat\\". The images change characteristics depending on the light source behind them. Window lithophane panel scenes change throughout the day depending on the amount of sunlight. The varying lightsource is what makes lithophanes more interesting to the viewer than two-dimensional pictures. The word \\"lithophane\\" derives from Greek \\"litho\\", which is from \\"lithos\\" which means stone or rock, and \\"phainein\\" meaning \\"to cause to appear\\" or \\"to cause to appear suddenly\\". From this is derived a meaning for lithophane of \\"light in stone\\" or to \\"appear in stone\\" as the three-dimensional image appears suddenly when lit with a back light source. History European lithophanes were first produced nearly at the same time in France, Germany, Prussia, and England around the later part of the 1820s.Jean-Baptiste 1858, pp. 187-191Jean-Baptiste 1884, pp. 691-692 Many times historians credit Baron Paul de Bourging (1791‚Äì1864) with inventing the process \\"email ombrant\\" (pottery decorating) of lithophanes in 1827 in France. Robert Griffith Jones acquired Bourging's rights in 1828 and licensed out to English factories to make them. The English factories sometimes used the name \\"lithophane\\" for specimens of ordinary \\"email ombrant.\\" Some say however it was Georg Friedrich Christoph (1781‚Äì1848) of Prussia that actually perfected the true lithophane process in 1828. Others say the technique was developed in Berlin and other parts of Germany by such manufacturers as Berlin porcelain (K√∂niglichen Porzellan-Manufaktur or Porzellanmanufactur). This is why sometimes lithophanes are referred to as \\"Berlin transparency.\\" There is a well known mark of Ad'T' on lithophanes from Rubles, near Melun in France. It is thought to be the mark of Baron A. de Tremblay, however some scholars on the subject think he only made earthenware and not true lithophanes and the mark belongs to a yet unknown source. Lithophane in ambient light Many historians argue that the inspiration for the idea came originally from China nearly a thousand years before in the Tang Dynasty. According to the scholar R. L. Hobson during the Ming Dynasty the Chinese produced bowls \\"as thin as paper\\" with secret decorations (an hua) in them. According to W. Hodgson she describes some Chinese biscuit porcelains as looking like \\"little screens with landscapes in relief\\" which resemble white porcelain that is obtained in Switzerland. Other potential precursors to the European lithophanes come from the Chinese Song Dynasty. Qingbai wares had translucency with carved and molded designs of flowers, fish, and birds. Japanese lithophane tea sets are referred to as \\"dragonware\\" and were popular for GI trading in Japan during World War II. A lithophane holder and lithophane. The holder was made by the Royal Prussian Iron Foundries in Germany, 1820s. Held at the Birmingham Museum of Art. In the early part of the 20th century many lithophane investigators were making connections between the European 18th and 19th century ceramics and the Chinese porcelains. In France they used the term \\"Blanc de Chine\\" in the 18th century to designate a highly translucent Chinese porcelain, now called Dehua porcelain. Porcelain factories in France, Germany and England mimicked the Chinese \\"Blanc de Chine\\" in the 17th and 18th centuries. These same factories then started to make lithophanes in the early part of the 19th century. The technical and aesthetic inspirations for European lithophanes can be seen coming from Chinese works, however the exact relationship between the two remains elusive to this day. However there is no known lithophane plaque produced anywhere in China prior to 1800. Lithophanes were made by specialized European craftspeople beginning as an image carved in warm wax on a glass plate. This was then backlit and carved.Klimaszewski, Nicolai, Ceramics Monthly, \\"Hand-Carving Lithophanes\\", October 2007, Volume 55, Issue 8. Sometimes the carving table was near a window and had a mirror below the table to provide constant light for carving. A modeler would duplicate the image on a flat wax plate carving relief and intaglio. Where the wax was carved thinnest more would shine through. Of course where the wax was carved thickest then there was less light shone through. A plaster gypsum mold was cast from the wax. It was sometimes cast in metal for the production of multiple molds. The casts were removed from the molds and then fired to about 2300 degrees Fahrenheit. The porcelain would include around 66% kaolin, 30% feldspar and 4% soapstone. It turned out that up to about 60% of the porcelains would warp or crack in the kiln causing them to become useless. Finished lithophanes are somewhere between one sixteenth of an inch thin to almost a quarter inch (1.5 to 6mm) thick. Lithophanes were produced in Austria, Belgium, Bohemia, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Sweden, and Wales in the 19th century.Lise, pp. 82, 83, 88, 136, 168-169 Lithophanes by the hundreds of thousands were made in the middle of the eighteen hundreds by such firms as Wedgwood in England, Meissen porcelain in Dresden, and Belleek in Ireland. Lithophanes were produced then in the United States as well, however not nearly as much as in Europe. Popular subjects of lithophanes were religious themes, portraits, genre scenes, literature ideas such as stories from the Bible, and masterpieces. Some lithophanes even commemorated events such as the opening of the Eiffel Tower in 1889. Lithophanes were in various formats from plaques to be hung in windows to candle shields.Great Exhibition 1852, p. 1150New-York Exhibition 1853, p. 142 They were also in fireplace screens, night lights, tea warmers, and match boxes. Many were pieces of bottoms of beer steins, mugs and cups. Some were souvenir ornaments of erotica images. They were even in lanterns and lamps. Rare miniature lithophanes are parts of doll house furnishings. According to Henry Barnard, Samuel Colt's first biographer, Colt ordered and had installed on his new home (\\"Armsmear\\") in Hartford, Connecticut dozens of lithophanes he purchased in Berlin in 1855 and 1856.Samuel Colt's porcelain transparencies - Magazine Antiques, April, 2006, 169 no. 4, pp. 106-115The Home, The Arm, and the Armory of Samuel Colt, a Memorial by Barnard, Henry, New York 1866Houze, p. 230-238 Colt probably got the idea from the 1851 Great (Crystal Palace) Exhibition in London or the New York Great Exhibition of 1853 or in a Prussia visit in 1854. Scenic views and portraits were for the public and private rooms of Colt's wife. Inspirational panes were for the windows of Colt's upstairs bedroom. Lithophanes of humorous nature were put in the windows of Colt's billiard room of his new home. One of particular interest was of the Battle of Trafalgar. Others were of Stolzenfels Castle on the Rhine River and a view of Koblenz. Barnard described the lithophanes as \\"a veritable art gallery.\\" A photograph of Armsmear taken between 1857 and 1861 shows over one hundred lithophanes. A photograph of 1907 shows the lithophanes of Armsmear still in place. Many of Colts surviving lithophanes are currently at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art. Samuel Colt had 111 lithophanes made of his likeness from a photograph for wide distribution in 1855. In this lithophane portrait he is sitting at a small desk holding a \\"Belt Pistol\\" in his right hand and has a directional compass in his left hand. One of these he sent to Senator Thomas J. Rusk who responded in a letter of 3 January 1856 when he received it, Modern lithophanes More recently lithophanes have been made with the use of CNC machines and 3D printing, starting with the shades of a black and white photograph used to generate a heightmap surface, which is then used to mill or print a solid object from a semi-translucent material.

He was the owner of Auberge de l‚ÄôIll, a classical French restaurant, which was first awarded a 3-star Michelin Rating in 1967 and continues to be one of the oldest 3-star establishments in France. His restaurant has served as a school for many of the world's premier French chefs, including Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Hubert Keller. Personal life Haeberlin was born in the village of Illhaeusern in the Alsace region of France. In 1882 his grandparents (Fr√©d√©ric, a farmer, and Fr√©d√©rique, a cook) had bought a small inn and cafe in the town, called L‚ÄôArbre Vert. His father (another Fr√©d√©ric, but known as Fritz) was born in 1888, and his mother (Marthe Oberlin) was a pastry cook. His brother, Jean-Pierre Haeberlin, was a decorative artist who oversaw operations of the restaurant with Paul. At the age of 14, Paul became an apprentice at the H√¥tel de la P√©pini√®re in Ribeauvill√©, next moving to Paris where he worked in restaurants such as Poccardi and R√¥tisserie P√©rigourdine. Haeberlin had to give up cooking during World War II when he was drafted into the French army. Though he was able to discharge himself, he then went on to operate as a resistance fighter under Charles de Gaulle's Free French forces. His family's inn, L‚ÄôArbre Vert (the green tree) was destroyed in a bombing raid in 1945 near the end of the war. The family rebuilt it after World War II, renaming the restaurant Auberge de l‚ÄôIll. In 1953 he married Marie Ittel, and they had two children (Marc and Dani√®le), both of whom work in the family restaurant. In 1976 his son took over the kitchen of Auberge de l‚ÄôIll, and in 2007 Paul Haeberlin fully retired. Cuisine Haeberlin was known for his innovative new versions of traditional Alsace dishes. With the aim of \\"revolutioniz[ing] previous conceptions of French cuisine\\", it was Haeberlin‚Äôs unique style which helped to define what would eventually become nouvelle cuisine.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica entry for Paul Haeberlin He received his first Michelin star in 1952, the second in 1957, and the maximum three in 1967. It has retained them ever since; an unbroken record bettered only by Paul Bocuse, who achieved his third star two years earlier. Death Haeberlin died in Illhaeusern on 10 May 2008. According to Michel Scheer (manager of Auberge de l‚ÄôIll), he had been \\"suffering from kidney and heart disease, among other ailments\\".Grimes, William Paul Haeberlin Star Chef and Restaurateur, The Independent, Tuesday 24 June 2008  References   External links  * Official site of the Auberge de l'Ill including the history of the Haeberlin family.

It is part of a complex of care facilities now operated by Covenant Health Systems, a Roman Catholic non- profit organization based in Massachusetts. The hospital has 233 beds. It was founded in 1888 by the Grey Nuns, and has been a major provider of emergency health services in the Lewiston-Auburn area since. Campus The medical center is located just south of the Bates College campus, and occupies a triangular lot bounded by Campus Avenue and Golder and Sabattus Streets. Separating the medical center from the campus is St. Mary's d'Youville Pavilion, a senior care facility also operated by Covenant Health. Access to the hospital is via a circular drive on Sabattus Street. The facility's largest buildings are the result of expansion in the 1960s in 1970s. History The hospital was founded in June 1888 by the Sisters of Charity of St. Hyacinthe, and was the first Catholic-run hospital in the state. The sisters originally converted the Sarah J. Golder house into a 30-bed hospital and orphanage. Saint Mary's hospital was also known as the Sister's Hospital, the French Hospital, or the Catholic Hospital. The first purpose-built hospital building was constructed in 1902. This Late Gothic Revival building was designed by Lewiston architect William R. Miller, and still forms part of the facility today. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 for its architecture and historical significance.St. Mary's Historical Information Wall of Shame In October 2019, an investigation by the Maine Human Rights Commission found that employees of Saint Mary's Regional Medical Center created a 'wall of shame' displaying confidential medical records of patients with disabilities. The commission found that the employees displayed confidential medical records of patients with disabilities detailing issues with their genitalia, body odor and bodily functions (urination and defecation), and that the exhibit had contributed to a hostile work environment. The wall of shame was displayed from June 2015-January 2017. On October 3, 2019, Covenant Health President and CEO Stephen Grubbs and St. Mary's Health System President Steven Jorgensen released a statement saying, 'St. Mary's apologizes for employees' 'wall of shame' that showed confidential medical information. Covenant Health and St. Mary‚Äôs Health System does not tolerate or condone discrimination or harassment of any kind, for any reason. ... We sincerely apologize.'

By contrast, \\"Maine's two largest hospital systems are offering employer-paid leave if they need to be quarantined\\" for coronavirus exposure. St. Mary's spokesperson Jason Gould confirmed the hospital's leave policy as described in the report. Three days after the report, St. Mary's president Steven Jorgensen reversed the policy and in a memo to hospital employees, stating that \\"employees who are quarantined for COVID-19 work-related exposure will now receive their 'regular pay' and that, 'employees who were previously quarantined and used earned time will have their earned time restored.'\\" See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Androscoggin County, Maine *List of hospitals in Maine References External links *St. Mary's Website Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1902 Category:Hospital buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Catholic hospitals in North America Category:Hospitals in Maine Category:Buildings and structures in Lewiston, Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Lewiston, Maine Category:Hospitals established in 1888 Category:1888 establishments in Maine ","title":"Saint Mary's Regional Medical Center (Maine)"},{"id":"17423141","text":"A CEMEC: No longer a true BMW...

The event is best recorded at Ireviken, Gotland, where over 50% of trilobite species became extinct; 80% of the global conodont species also become extinct in this interval. Anatomy of the event The event lasted around 200,000 years, spanning the base of the Wenlock epoch. It comprises eight extinction \\"datum points\\"‚Äîthe first four being regularly spaced, every 30,797 years, and linked to the Milankovic obliquity cycle.

Correspondingly, shallow-water reefs were barely affected, while pelagic and hemipelagic organisms such as the graptolites, conodonts and trilobites were hit hardest.

Mutiny of the Matoika is the common name for the events in July 1920 involving a large portion of the Olympic team of the United States while on board the U.S. Army transport ship , headed to Antwerp for the 1920 Summer Olympics. Princess Matoika was a last-minute substitute for another ship and, according to the athletes, did not have adequate accommodations or training facilities on board. Near the end of the voyage, the athletes published a list of grievances and demands and distributed copies of the document to the United States Secretary of War, the American Olympic Committee (AOC) members, and the press. The incident received wide coverage in American newspapers at the time and was still being discussed in the popular press years later. The event was not a mutiny in the traditional sense, but has been called that since the mid-1930s.  Background  In 1920, the number of ocean liners carrying passengers on the North Atlantic gradually increased, but was still far below the pre-war years; arrivals at Atlantic ports in the United States were still down some 60% from pre-war numbers.Immigration Information Bureau. See figures for 1913, the last full year before the war (pp. 165‚Äì174) vs. the figures for 1920 (pp. 198‚Äì202). With the fewer ships and sailings available, the AOC made arrangements with both the U.S. Army and the U.S. Navy to transport the United States Olympic team to Antwerp. The Navy agreed to carry team members who were affiliated with their branch of the service, and the Army, to carry civilian and Army-affiliated competitors. The Olympic trip got off to a bad start when the Army's scheduled ship, , was declared unseaworthy, requiring a last-minute substitution. The last-minute selection of the Matoika meant the original planned departure date, July 20, had to be pushed back by six days to ready the liner to sail. This article in The New York Times and one in The Washington Post (\\"Uncle Sam causes delay in American Olympic invasion\\", July 10, 1920, p. 6) both identify the ship as the Northern Pacific. Findling and Pelle mistakenly identify the ship as Northern Pacific's sister ship (p. 56). The Matoika had been in the service of the U.S. Army as a transport ship since September 1919, and, until the time of her selection, had been returning American soldiers from Europe and repatriating the remains of Americans killed during the war.For returning troops, see, for example: For repatriated remains, see: Before World War I, the Matoika had been a passenger liner for North German Lloyd by the name of Princess Alice. After the United States joined the conflict in 1917, the liner had been pressed into service for the U.S. Navy carrying American troops to Europe; she was renamed Princess Matoika, after one of the given names for Pocahontas, as part of an order to replace Germanic names of seized ships with American names.  Voyage  On the afternoon of July 26, the athletes attended a farewell reception at the Manhattan Opera House presided over by Gustavus T. Kirby, chairman of the American Olympic Committee (AOC), who read congratulatory telegrams to the team from the governors of eleven states. At the end of the reception, the 230 civilian and U.S. Army-affiliated team members marched from the Opera House to the Hudson Pier and ferried to Hoboken, New Jersey, and the waiting Matoika. (The 101 U.S. Navy-affiliated athletes and coaches were carried on cruiser , a frequent convoy escort of Princess Matoika during World War I.Crowell and Wilson, p. 609, 610‚Äì11) American shot putter Pat McDonald (seen here in the 1912 Summer Olympics) was one of the ringleaders of the Mutiny of the Matoika\\" When female team members,Parker, p. 15. AOC members, and U.S. Army athletes and officials accompanying the team were assigned first-class cabins and the balance of the male athletes were relegated to troop quarters on lower decks, grumbling from team members quartered belowdecks began almost immediately. Before the Matoika even sailed, runner Joie Ray, a competitor in the 1500 meters in 1920, complained about the conditions declaring that \\"if those in charge had deliberately tried to create a psychology of depression and resentment among the members of the team, they couldn't have done anything more effective\\". Two days after sailing, some of the first-place winners at the Olympic tryouts were moved to the sick bay to escape the sweltering heat on the lower decks, but the majority remained below. Fencer Joseph B. B. Parker‚Äîwho, as an Army athlete, was bunked in a cabin‚Äîcommented that the troop accommodations were all right for troops but \\"not conducive to bringing men to the games in the pink of condition.\\" Training conditions aboard the ship were less than ideal throughout the voyage. Rough seas for parts of the journey hampered training and contributed to widespread seasickness.Findling and Pelle, p. 56. Although the long distance runners were able to practice by making multiple circuits of the ship, the sprinters and hurdlers were provided only a cork track‚Äîtwo-thirds the length of the shortest track event at the games‚Äîon which to practice. Javelins were tethered by rope and aimed by their throwers at the sea, and, when thrown, would often come down in unexpected locations.Rivera, p. 29. The only facility for swimmers was a canvas saltwater tank set up on the lower deck; the tank split when filled for the first time. Even after it was repaired, the best the swimmers could do was to practice strokes while tied to the corner of the tank with a rope, and divers, with no other facilities available, were allocated just a few minutes a day in the tank.Rivera, p. 19 Conditions on the ship contributed to several injuries to athletes. During foggy weather, American decathlete Everett Ellis fell on the slippery deck, suffering a bad sprain, and shot putter Pat McDonald sprained his thumb while tossing a medicine ball on the pitching deck. Despite the problems encountered by some of the team, others were able to work out adequately. Fencers, wrestlers, and boxers were all able to work out in close- to-usual routines. But perhaps the most impressive training feat was a high jump by Richmond W. Landon who cleared a high jump on the rolling deck, a jump not far off of his eventual gold-medal-winning (and Olympic record) jump of .  The \\"mutiny\\"  By the time the ship neared Antwerp, the team members had had enough of the \\"rusty old troop carrier\\". The team initially threatened to boycott the games if the conditions in the host city were not better than those aboard the Matoika, but quickly rescinded that. The group, with McDonald and Norman Ross serving as ringleaders, drafted a resolution in which they condemned the AOC and outlined their grievances and demands: * the quarters aboard the ship were unlivable * the food on board was terrible. * they requested better accommodation in Antwerp * they requested cabin passage on the way home * and they requested train fare to their homes from New York after returning. They were careful to give credit to the crew of Princess Matoika who, in the athletes' assessment, did \\"everything possible to improve conditions\\". The document was signed by 150 of the athletes; some of the U.S. Army athletes agreed with the resolution but could not sign it. They had 200 copies of the resolution printed and addressed copies to Secretary of War Newton Diehl Baker, the members of the AOC, and members of the press.  Aftermath  After the Olympics were over, fencer Parker summarized the situation by saying that all who made the trip would want to compete for the United States in future Olympics, but \\"never again ‚Ä¶ under the management of the Executive Committee of the Olympic team of 1920\\". In 1922, author Newton Fuessle brought up the specter of the 1920 Olympic passage on the Matoika when discussing the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and his hopes that the NCAA would take over the functions of the Amateur Athletic Union in controlling American Olympic teams in the future. By the mid-1930s, the events on board were known as the \\"Mutiny of the Matoika\\". Sportswriter John Kieran, in his 1936 book The Story of the Olympic Games: 776 B.C. to 1960 A.D., related the story of the mutiny by that name.Kieran, p. 124.

Biography Carpenter was of Native American and Spanish heritage.The Bob Crane Case - Crime Library on truTV.com He was born on an Indian reservation where as a teenager he often earned money as a migrant worker harvesting apricots. Carpenter served in the U.S. Army and was married twice. Following his retirement from the Army he took a job marketing video technology, achieving expertise in that field and becoming head of the video wing of a new Japanese electronics company debuting in the United States called Sonycom, later to be known simply as Sony. John had a child, John Michael Carpenter, from his first marriage who was adopted with the last name of Merrill. John Carpenter had three grandchildren from his first marriage and six great grandchildren. Relationship with Bob Crane During the run of Hogan's Heroes, Richard Dawson introduced Crane to Carpenter, a regional sales manager for Sony Electronics, who often helped famous clients with video and audio equipment. The two men struck up a friendship and began going to bars together. Crane attracted women due to his celebrity status and introduced Carpenter as his manager. Later, they would videotape their sexual encounters. While Crane's son Robert later insisted that all of the women were aware of the videotaping and consented to it, some, according to one source, had no idea they had been recorded until informed by Scottsdale police after Crane's murder. Carpenter later became national sales manager at Akai, and arranged his business trips to coincide with Crane's dinner-theater touring schedule so that the two could continue seducing and videotaping women after Hogan's Heroes had run its course. Carpenter trial In 1994, Crane's murder case was re-opened and Carpenter was tried and eventually acquitted. As a result of the accusation, he was fired from work as National Service Manager at Kenwood USA, a California electronics firm. He always maintained his innocence, and later said he felt a huge relief after his name had been cleared. One jury member later said in an interview that the jury believed there was insufficient proof to determine Carpenter's guilt and that \\"you cannot prove someone guilty on speculation.\\" Carpenter's acquittal was spearheaded by defense attorney Dan Roth. The Law Offices of Roth and Roth were located in Scottsdale, AZ. Carpenter's acquittal subsequently propelled Mr. Roth's reputation as one of Arizona's most sought-after defense attorneys. Portrayal in Auto Focus In the 2002 biopic Auto Focus, Carpenter was played by Willem Dafoe. The film strongly suggests that Carpenter was bisexual and was sexually attracted to Crane, which was presented by the prosecution's case as Carpenter's motive for the crime. No witnesses or evidence were presented to support the prosecution's claims. In the special features section of the DVD, a documentary extra has Carpenter's second wife adamantly asserting that Carpenter was completely heterosexual. The film also portrays Carpenter as suffering from colorblindness. References External links *Richard Dawson interview ‚Äì Richard Dawson talks about Carpenter, see Part 2, starting at 29:25.

He was beatified by Pope John Paul II on 2002. Biography =Early life and priesthood= Vitchev was born on May 23, 1893 at Srem, near Topolovgrad, Bulgaria and came from a peasant Orthodox family. He joined the Catholic congregation known as the Assumptionists, or Augustinians of the Assumption, in 1910, beginning his novitiate in Gempe, Belgium, and later taking the name Kamen. He pursued his studies of philosophy and theology in Louvain, Belgium. He was ordained a priest in Constantinople (Istanbul) on December 22, 1921. After a brief period teaching at St. Augustine College in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, and at a high school seminary in Kumkapƒ±, Turkey, he returned to Strasbourg and Rome, to complete his studies and obtained a doctorate in theology in 1929. =Bulgarian communist regime= Very knowledgeable in the history of the Bulgarian church, Vitchev published several articles in the review known as √âchos d'Orient. In 1930 he was appointed professor of philosophy and Dean of Studies at St. Augustine College in Plovdiv and maintained this position until the school was closed by the Communist regime on August 2, 1948. After this prestigious institution founded and maintained by the Assumptionists was closed, Vitchev became superior of the Assumptionist seminary in Plovdiv which housed a small number of students. That same year all foreign members of religious orders were expelled and Vitchev was named Vicar-Provincial of the remaining Bulgarian Assumptionists. They numbered 20 and staffed 5 Oriental and 4 Latin rite parishes. As a Soviet satellite, Bulgaria suffered from the wave of anti-Church legislation that swept the bloc in the years after World War II (e.g. the arrest of Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac in Yugoslavia in 1946, of Cardinal J√≥zsef Mindszenty in Hungary in 1948, of Archbishop Josef Beran in Czechoslovakia in 1950, and of Cardinal Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski in Poland in 1953). =Death= Highly esteemed and respected by the influential young graduates of St. Augustine College, Vitchev posed a threat to the Communist authorities in Bulgaria and was arrested on July 4, 1952. After what international organizations universally considered a show trial which began on September 29, 1952 and ended with a guilty verdict and a death sentence on October 3, Vitchev, two of his Assumptionists companions, Josaphat Chichkov and Pavel Djidjov, and a Passionist bishop, Eugene Bossilkov, were shot to death, without public notice, at approximately 11:30 PM the evening of November 11, 1952. Beatification Vitchev was declared a martyr for the faith and beatified by Pope John Paul II in Plovdiv on May 26, 2002. On July 28, 2010, the Bulgarian parliament passed a law officially rehabilitating all of those who had been condemned by the People's Republic of Bulgaria in 1952, including Vitchev.

It houses educational facilities for Solar One, a non-profit organisation concerned with green energy, arts, and education. The Solar 1 building is located at the north end of Stuyvesant Cove Park, the city‚Äôs only all-native plant park, which Solar 1 actively maintains. Situated on a brownfield site, Stuyvesant Cove Park offers opportunities for the local community to become involved in the park and learn about its special features. The Park has been designated a Wildlife Habitat by the National Wildlife Federation for providing a quality habitat by virtue of its standards of conscientious planning, landscaping and sustainable gardening. More than 250 volunteers and 80 student interns have spent more than 5,000 hours working in the park, planting, watering and weeding the thousands of new plants that have been added over the years. Solar 1 is a prototype for Solar 2, planned as the first building in NYC to generate power in excess of what it uses, thereby putting more power into the grid than it takes out. It will be a landmark and a model for future NYC buildings.  History  In 2001, the Community Environmental Center (CEC), a non-profit organisation, was designated by the New York City Economic Development Corporation (EDC) to develop and manage an environmental learning center in the recently constructed Stuyvesant Cove Park. Located along the East River between 18th and 23rd Streets in Manhattan on a brownfield site, the park opened to the public in January 2002. Under a 40-year lease with the EDC, CEC gained responsibility for the design and construction of Solar 2, educational programming, and park maintenance. In May 2003, CEC opened Solar 1, a solar-powered building, where students and residents from the City and the greater Metro area learn first hand the principles about energy conservation in their urban neighborhood. The Solar 2 Green Energy Arts and Education Center will be a new Platinum LEED certified ‚Äúnet-zero‚Äù building that will replace Solar 1 and will be the only one of its kind in New York City.  Education Solar One provides education initiatives to children in the five boroughs of New York through after-school and summer camp programs. The education initiatives focus on energy and design, educating future environmental city dwellers. The K-12 education programs are located at the Solar One education center. Program topics for the 1.5 hour classes include Renewable Energy, Sustainable Design and Estuary and Park Ecology. In addition to this, Solar One offers a longer-term education initiative called Green Design Lab. The Green Design Lab is a year-long curriculum guide for how to green a school. It provides hands-on learning opportunities that bring sustainability to life by using the school building as a teaching tool. It includes 5 units: Energy, Water, Air Quality, Materials and Food. = Energy Connections Program= Solar One Energy Connections (S1EC) connects New York City residents, businesses, and community-based organizations to energy efficiency and renewable energy resources through education, outreach, and project partnerships. Their mission is to make all New Yorkers part of our New York City's ambitious efforts to combat climate change and develop a clean, green economy. =Green Jobs Program= For several years, Solar One built programs with job training components. Beginning in 2009, they began to focus on developing a program focused solely on training people for jobs in the emerging green economy. Today, S1 runs a robust program with over a dozen workforce agency partners that covers many topics: Solar (PV) installation, energy efficiency and Weatherizaton, carpentry, plumbing and more. Workforce organizations that offer Green Training Programs includes: Strive, Vocational Foundation, Non-Traditional Employment for Women, Green City Force and Covenant House New York, =Green Arts= Solar One‚Äôs Green Arts programming creates a new approach to learning about green energy and conservation. The Green Energy Arts Festival is an annual series of events that attract diverse audience members who might not otherwise attend a ‚Äúgreen‚Äù event. Each year during the spring, summer and fall, S1 offers a variety of free, public programs and events, like the Solar-Powered Dance and Film Series, the Sun To Stars festival, Family Days, musical performances and more. Solar 2 In 2012, S1 hopes to break ground on SOLAR 2, an 8,000 square foot 100% green- powered education and arts center that is slated to be New York‚Äôs first Platinum LEED educational facility. SOLAR 2 was designed by the renowned green architecture firm Kiss & Cathcart, and engineered by the firm of Arup.

The Three Stags' Heads in Wardlow Mires is a Grade II listed building and listed on the Campaign for Real Ale's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors. It is like a farmhouse might have been 200 years ago: a small stone flagged room with a cast-iron range, whitewashed walls, a small bar and a couple of rickety tables and chairs. For many years the mummified remains of a cat were exhibited in a glass case. The cat's remains were found during alterations to a chimney breast and were thought to have been placed there for superstitious reasons. Above Wardlow Mires is an unusual large rocky outcrop known as Peter's Stone. The name is believed to come from its resemblance to St. Peter's in Rome. The other more grisly name for Peter's Stone is Gibbet Rock, for it was here that Lingard's body was displayed for the entertainment of visitors for several months.PeakDistrictOnline accessed 15 May 2008 References External links Category:Villages in Derbyshire Category:Towns and villages of the Peak District Category:Civil parishes in Derbyshire Category:Derbyshire Dales ","title":"Wardlow"},{"id":"17423523","text":"The 1988 Kansas State Wildcats football team represented Kansas State University in the 1988 NCAA Division I-A football season.

It was an agreement made by the representative of Queen Elizabeth I of England, the Duke of Norfolk, and the group of rebellious nobles known as the Scottish Lords of the Congregation. The purpose was to agree the terms under which an English fleet and army would come to Scotland to expel the French troops who were defending the Regency of Mary of Guise. The Lords were trying both to expel the French and to effect the Scottish Reformation, and this led to rioting and armed conflict. England and the Scottish Lords of the Congregation The leader of the Lords of the Congregation was the Duke of Chatelherault. He had formerly been Regent, but in this treaty was described as \\"second person\\", meaning that he was heir to the throne after Mary, Queen of Scots. His representatives at Berwick were James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray, Patrick, Lord Ruthven, Sir John Maxwell of Terregles, William Maitland younger of Lethington, John Wishart of Pitarrow, and Master Henry Balnaves of Halhill. England's representative was Thomas, Duke of Norfolk. The English ambassador in France, Nicholas Throckmorton, encouraged Elizabeth to support the Scottish lords, arguing the benefits for her in Ireland and a stable alliance in future with Scotland severed from its auld alliance with France.V. Smith, 'Perspectives on Female Monarchy', in J. Daybell & S. Norrhem, Gender and Political Culture in Early Modern Europe (Abingdon, 2017), 145‚Äì6, 147. Duke of Ch√¢tellerault, Scotland's representative at Berwick The treaty was effective: the English navy already had a fleet in the Firth of Forth commanded by William Winter, and now an English army under Baron Grey de Wilton marched north from Berwick into Scotland. The Scottish Lords arranged to rendezvous with the English army on 31 March 1560, at Aitchison's Haven, the harbour of Newbattle Abbey at Prestongrange in East Lothian.HMC Salisbury Hatfield , vol. 1 (London, 1883), 190, 194: Sadler State Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1809), 714. On 24 March 1560 Elizabeth had a proclamation published and circulated in English, French and Italian, which detailed her concerns over Mary's use of English heraldry and the ambitions of the Guise family. The proclamation stressed that England was not at war with France or Scotland, although Elizabeth had been forced to \\"put in order, to her great charges, certain forces both by sea and land.\\"A Proclamacion declayring the Quenes Maiesties Purpose, 24 March 1559 (Richard Jugge & John Cawood, London, 1560): digitised by EEBO subscription required. The English force assisted with the Siege of Leith until hostilities ended in July 1560, after the death of Mary of Guise and the signing of the Treaty of Edinburgh. Under the terms of the treaty, the French fortifications at Leith, new works at Dunbar Castle and at Eyemouth were demolished and the French and English went home. The religious ambitions of the Scottish lords were realised in the Reformation Parliament of August 1560. This parliament also ratified the treaty; William Maitland commended it and the goodwill and favour of Elizabeth in relieving the extreme necessity and \\"almost utter ruen of the whole countrie.\\" According to the English observer Thomas Randolph, there was common consent and some would have happily signed in their own blood.Calendar of State Papers relating to Scotland, vol. 1 (London, 1898), 43, 27 August 1560. Context and the historians John Knox thought the treaty so important in explaining the actions of the Lords of the Congregation to posterity that he inserted the whole text into his History of the Reformation. Knox directly related the treaty to the thinking of his colleague Christopher Goodman in his tract, How Superior Powers Ought to be Obeyed, by writing: The modern historian Michael Lynch called the treaty \\"an astonishing document which mentioned many things but not religion.\\"Lynch, Michael, Scotland, A New History, Pimlico (1992), 196. Pamela Ritchie, historian and author of a political biography of Mary of Guise, sees the treaty as facilitating \\"the interference of a foreign monarch in what was essentially a domestic crisis.\\"Ritchie, Pamela E., Mary of Guise in Scotland 1548‚Äì1560, Tuckwell (2002), 238‚Äì40. William Ferguson argued that previous historians had overemphasised the significance of the treaty and the English military action. While the intervention was opportunistic, arranged following the tumult of Amboise when France was first troubled by her wars of Religion, the English army did not receive widespread welcome and support, and failed to take Leith by storm.Ferguson, William, Scotland's Relations with England, John Donald (1977), 70‚Äì73. The English were aware of the probable impact of troubles in France; Cecil wrote to Ralph Sadler on 22 March 1560 that: > we here doo trust well that the bravery of the French wilbe cooled; at home > they have ynough to doo with trooble partly for religion, partly for > governance; God send his just wrath amomgst them to their amendment.Sadler > State Papers, vol.1, Edinburgh (1809), 710 The Scottish Lords had already seen the opportunity arising from pressures on France's borders. On 20 January Richard Maitland wrote to his friend in London of their readiness to abandon the Auld Alliance, noting; > It shall not be amiss to consider in what case the French be presently, > their estate is not always so calm at home as everyman thinketh ... the > demand by the Empire for the restitution of Metz, Toul, and Verdun may grow > to some business.CSP Foreign Elizabeth, vol.2 (1865), pp. 300‚Äì1 no. 607 & > note Articles of the treaty On the 27 March 1560, Mary of Guise wrote to her brothers, the Cardinal and Duke of Guise, that she never saw anything so shameful as the Articles.Calendar of State Papers Foreign, 1559‚Äì60, London (1865), 481 (no. 906, para. 4).

The church is flanked by a 1908 rectory and a 1914 parochial school, and the three-building complex is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its association with the Czech American settlement of south-central Minnesota. History The group of immigrants who settled New Prague had originally settled around Dubuque, Iowa, but many of them died of cholera. Four men from the community traveled up the Mississippi River to Saint Paul, in search of a healthier climate. They met with Catholics in the area who advised them that Benedictines from Saint John's Abbey near Saint Cloud, Minnesota, were helping settlers find land. The explorers from the Czech community got lost, though, and ended up following the Minnesota River to Shakopee instead. They found that there was ample land to the south, so the four men purchased land and brought their families north from Iowa. The parish of St. Wenceslaus was organized in 1856, and a log church was built the following year. The log church was destroyed by fire in 1864, so a more permanent building was erected in 1866, built of brick and stone. As the parish grew, though, more room was needed. Father Francis Tichy directed the building of the new church, which was designed by St. Paul architect Hermann Kretz. The building was originally slated to cost $53,000, but cost overruns raised the cost to $85,000. As a result of dissatisfaction over the costs, Father Tichy resigned from the parish in 1906, and his successor Father Jaroslav Cermak oversaw the completion of the building. Archbishop John Ireland dedicated the new building on July 7, 1907. Brick and Kasota limestone were used for constructing the spacious building.Gresham, Will G. (ed.), History of Nicollet and LeSueur Counties, Minnesota, Vol. I, pp. 504‚Äì05. B. F. Bowen (Indianapolis 1916). It dominates the skyline of the small city of New Prague, measuring , with two towers that rise . The architectural style combines neoclassical and Romanesque architectural styles, and it is based on a church in Prague, Czech Republic. The church's namesake, Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia was born near Prague circa 907 CE. A statue of King Wenceslaus is located in a niche above the main entrance. A large pipe organ at the rear of the church was operational until the 2000s. The church, rectory, and school were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 for their local significance in the themes of education, exploration/settlement, and religion. The three-building complex was nominated for its association with the Czech American settlement of south-central Minnesota. As of 2009, there were about 1,440 member families in the St. Wenceslaus parish, making it the largest parish in the local area. A consolidation plan announced in October 2010 by the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis called for five much smaller parishes in the area to be merged into St. Wenceslaus parish. After the plan was revised to consolidate one of the smallest parishes into a different receiving church, St. Wenceslaus became the receiving parish for the former parishes of St. Benedict in New Prague, St. Joseph in Lexington, St. John the Evangelist in Union Hill, and St. Scholastica in Heidelberg. The St. Benedict and St. Joseph churches were closed, while the St. John the Evangelist and St. Scholastica churches are still being used for worship as parts of the \\"greater St. Wenceslaus community\\". St. Wenceslaus parish operates an elementary school that enrolls children from pre-kindergarten through eighth grade.

Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 18 July Several steam-powered devices were later experimented with or proposed, such as Taqi al-Din's steam jack, a steam turbine in 16th-century Ottoman Egypt, and Thomas Savery's steam pump in 17th-century England. In 1712, Thomas Newcomen's atmospheric engine became the first commercially successful engine using the principle of the piston and cylinder, which was the fundamental type of steam engine used until the early 20th century. The steam engine was used to pump water out of coal mines. During the Industrial Revolution, steam engines started to replace water and wind power, and eventually became the dominant source of power in the late 19th century and remaining so into the early decades of the 20th century, when the more efficient steam turbine and the internal combustion engine resulted in the rapid replacement of the steam engines. The steam turbine has become the most common method by which electrical power generators are driven. Investigations are being made into the practicalities of reviving the reciprocating steam engine as the basis for the new wave of advanced steam technology. Precursors =Early uses of steam power= Aeolipile. The earliest known rudimentary steam engine and reaction steam turbine, the aeolipile, is described by a mathematician and engineer named Heron of Alexandria (Heron) in 1st century Roman Egypt, as recorded in his manuscript Spiritalia seu Pneumatica.Heron Alexandrinus (Hero of Alexandria) (c. 62 CE): Spiritalia seu Pneumatica. Reprinted 1998 by K G Saur GmbH, Munich. . Steam ejected tangentially from nozzles caused a pivoted ball to rotate. Its thermal efficiency was low. This suggests that the conversion of steam pressure into mechanical movement was known in Roman Egypt in the 1st century. Heron also devised a machine that used air heated in an altar fire to displace a quantity of water from a closed vessel. The weight of the water was made to pull a hidden rope to operate temple doors. Some historians have conflated the two inventions to assert, incorrectly, that the aeolipile was capable of useful work. According to William of Malmesbury, in 1125, Reims was home to a church that had an organ powered by air escaping from compression \\"by heated water\\", apparently designed and constructed by professor Gerbertus. Among the papers of Leonardo da Vinci dating to the late 15th century is the design for a steam-powered cannon called the Architonnerre, which works by the sudden influx of hot water into a sealed, red-hot cannon. A rudimentary impact steam turbine was described in 1551 by Taqi al-Din, a philosopher, astronomer and engineer in 16th century Ottoman Egypt, who described a method for rotating a spit by means of a jet of steam playing on rotary vanes around the periphery of a wheel. A similar device for rotating a spit was also later described by John Wilkins in 1648.Taqi al-Din and the First Steam Turbine, 1551 A.D. , web page, accessed on line October 23, 2009; this web page refers to Ahmad Y Hassan (1976), Taqi al-Din and Arabic Mechanical Engineering, pp. 34-5, Institute for the History of Arabic Science, University of Aleppo. These devices were then called \\"mills\\" but are now known as steam jacks. Another similar rudimentary steam turbine is shown by Giovanni Branca, an Italian engineer, in 1629 for turning a cylindrical escapement device that alternately lifted and let fall a pair of pestles working in mortars. The steam flow of these early steam turbines, however, was not concentrated and most of its energy was dissipated in all directions. This would have led to a great waste of energy and so they were never seriously considered for industrial use. In 1605 French mathematician Florence Rivault in his treatise on artillery wrote on his discovery that water, if confined in a bombshell and heated, would explode the shells.Robert Henry Thurston, A history of the growth of the steam-engine, D. Appleton and company, 1903, Google Print, p.15-16 (public domain) In 1606, the Spaniard Jer√≥nimo de Ayanz y Beaumont demonstrated and was granted a patent for a steam powered water pump. The pump was successfully used to drain the inundated mines of Guadalcanal, Spain. Development of the commercial steam engine ‚ÄúThe discoveries that, when brought together by Thomas Newcomen in 1712, resulted in the steam engine were:\\" *The concept of a vacuum (i.e. a reduction in pressure below ambient) *The concept of pressure *Techniques for creating a vacuum *A means of generating steam *The piston and cylinder In 1643 Evangelista Torricelli conducted experiments on suction lift water pumps to test their limits, which was about 32 feet (Atmospheric pressure is 32.9 feet or 10.03 meters. Vapor pressure of water lowers theoretical lift height.). He devised an experiment using a tube filled with mercury and inverted in a bowl of mercury (a barometer) and observed an empty space above the column of mercury, which he theorized contained nothing, that is, a vacuum. Influenced by Torricelli, Otto von Guericke invented a vacuum pump by modifying an air pump used for pressurizing an air gun. Guericke put on a demonstration in 1654 in Magdeburg, Germany, where he was mayor. Two copper hemispheres were fitted together and air was pumped out. Weights strapped to the hemispheres could not pull them apart until the air valve was opened. The experiment was repeated in 1656 using two teams of 8 horses each, which could not separate the Magdeburg hemispheres. Gaspar Schott was the first to describe the hemisphere experiment in his Mechanica Hydraulico- Pneumatica (1657). After reading Schott's book, Robert Boyle built an improved vacuum pump and conducted related experiments. Denis Papin became interested in using a vacuum to generate motive power while working with Christiaan Huygens and Gottfried Leibniz in Paris in 1663. Papin worked for Robert Boyle from 1676 to 1679, publishing an account of his work in Continuation of New Experiments (1680) and gave a presentation to Royal Society in 1689. From 1690 on Papin began experimenting with a piston to produce power with steam, building model steam engines. He experimented with atmospheric and pressure steam engines, publishing his results in 1707. In 1663 Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester published a book of 100 inventions which described a method for raising water between floors employing a similar principle to that of a coffee percolator. His system was the first to separate the boiler (a heated cannon barrel) from the pumping action. Water was admitted into a reinforced barrel from a cistern, and then a valve was opened to admit steam from a separate boiler. The pressure built over the top of the water, driving it up a pipe.Tredgold, pg. 3 He installed his steam-powered device on the wall of the Great Tower at Raglan Castle to supply water through the tower. The grooves in the wall where the engine was installed were still to be seen in the 19th century. However, no one was prepared to risk money for such a revolutionary concept, and without backers the machine remained undeveloped. Samuel Morland, a mathematician and inventor who worked on pumps, left notes at the Vauxhall Ordinance Office on a steam pump design that Thomas Savery read. In 1698 Savery built a steam pump called ‚ÄúThe Miner‚Äôs Friend.‚Äù It employed both vacuum and pressure. These were used for low horsepower service for a number of years. Thomas Newcomen was a merchant who dealt in cast iron goods. Newcomen's engine was based on the piston and cylinder design proposed by Papin. In Newcomen's engine steam was condensed by water sprayed inside the cylinder, causing atmospheric pressure to move the piston. Newcomen's first engine installed for pumping in a mine in 1712 at Dudley Castle in Staffordshire. =Cylinders= Denis Papin's design for a piston-and-cylinder engine, 1680. Denis Papin (22 August 1647 ‚Äì c. 1712) was a French physicist, mathematician and inventor, best known for his pioneering invention of the steam digester, the forerunner of the pressure cooker. In the mid-1670s Papin collaborated with the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens on an engine which drove out the air from a cylinder by exploding gunpowder inside it. Realising the incompleteness of the vacuum produced by this means and on moving to England in 1680, Papin devised a version of the same cylinder that obtained a more complete vacuum from boiling water and then allowing the steam to condense; in this way he was able to raise weights by attaching the end of the piston to a rope passing over a pulley. As a demonstration model the system worked, but in order to repeat the process the whole apparatus had to be dismantled and reassembled. Papin quickly saw that to make an automatic cycle the steam would have to be generated separately in a boiler; however, he did not take the project further. Papin also designed a paddle boat driven by a jet playing on a mill-wheel in a combination of Taqi al Din and Savery's conceptions and he is also credited with a number of significant devices such as the safety valve. Papin's years of research into the problems of harnessing steam was to play a key part in the development of the first successful industrial engines that soon followed his death. =Savery steam pump= The first steam engine to be applied industrially was the \\"fire-engine\\" or \\"Miner's Friend\\", designed by Thomas Savery in 1698. This was a pistonless steam pump, similar to the one developed by Worcester. Savery made two key contributions that greatly improved the practicality of the design. First, in order to allow the water supply to be placed below the engine, he used condensed steam to produce a partial vacuum in the pumping reservoir (the barrel in Worcester's example), and using that to pull the water upward. Secondly, in order to rapidly cool the steam to produce the vacuum, he ran cold water over the reservoir. Operation required several valves; when the reservoir was empty at the start of a cycle a valve was opened to admit steam. The valve was closed to seal the reservoir and the cooling water valve turned on to condense the steam and create a partial vacuum. A supply valve was opened, pulling water upward into the reservoir, and the typical engine could pull water up to 20 feet.Tredgold, pg. 6 This was closed and the steam valve reopened, building pressure over the water and pumping it upward, as in the Worcester design. The cycle essentially doubled the distance that water could be pumped for any given pressure of steam, and production examples raised water about 40 feet. Savery's engine solved a problem that had only recently become a serious one; raising water out of the mines in southern England as they reached greater depths. Savery's engine was somewhat less efficient than Newcomen's, but this was compensated for by the fact that the separate pump used by the Newcomen engine was inefficient, giving the two engines roughly the same efficiency of 6 million foot pounds per bushel of coal (less than 1%). Nor was the Savery engine very safe because part of its cycle required steam under pressure supplied by a boiler, and given the technology of the period the pressure vessel could not be made strong enough and so was prone to explosion. The explosion of one of his pumps at Broad Waters (near Wednesbury), about 1705, probably marks the end of attempts to exploit his invention. The Savery engine was less expensive than Newcomen's and was produced in smaller sizes. Some builders were manufacturing improved versions of the Savery engine until late in the 18th century. Bento de Moura Portugal, FRS, introduced an ingenious improvement of Savery's construction \\"to render it capable of working itself\\", as described by John Smeaton in the Philosophical Transactions published in 1751. Atmospheric condensing engines =Newcomen \\"atmospheric\\" engine= Engraving of Newcomen engine. This appears to be copied from a drawing in Desaguliers' 1744 work: \\"A course of experimental philosophy\\", itself believed to have been a reversed copy of Henry Beighton's engraving dated 1717, that may represent what is probably the second Newcomen engine erected around 1714 at Griff colliery, Warwickshire.Hulse David K (1999): \\"The early development of the steam engine\\"; TEE Publishing, Leamington Spa, UK, ISBN, 85761 107 1 It was Thomas Newcomen with his \\"atmospheric-engine\\" of 1712 who can be said to have brought together most of the essential elements established by Papin in order to develop the first practical steam engine for which there could be a commercial demand. This took the shape of a reciprocating beam engine installed at surface level driving a succession of pumps at one end of the beam. The engine, attached by chains from other end of the beam, worked on the atmospheric, or vacuum principle. Newcomen's design used some elements of earlier concepts. Like the Savery design, Newcomen's engine used steam, cooled with water, to create a vacuum. Unlike Savery's pump, however, Newcomen used the vacuum to pull on a piston instead of pulling on water directly. The upper end of the cylinder was open to the atmospheric pressure, and when the vacuum formed, the atmospheric pressure above the piston pushed it down into the cylinder. The piston was lubricated and sealed by a trickle of water from the same cistern that supplied the cooling water. Further, to improve the cooling effect, he sprayed water directly into the cylinder. Animation of a Newcomen atmospheric engine in action The piston was attached by a chain to a large pivoted beam. When the piston pulled the beam, the other side of the beam was pulled upward. This end was attached to a rod that pulled on a series of conventional pump handles in the mine. At the end of this power stroke, the steam valve was reopened, and the weight of the pump rods pulled the beam down, lifting the piston and drawing steam into the cylinder again. Using the piston and beam allowed the Newcomen engine to power pumps at different levels throughout the mine, as well as eliminating the need for any high-pressure steam. The entire system was isolated to a single building on the surface. Although inefficient and extremely heavy on coal (compared to later engines), these engines raised far greater volumes of water and from greater depths than had previously been possible.L. T. C. Rolt and J. S. Allen, The Steam Engine of Thomas Newcomen (Landmark Publishing, Ashbourne 1997). Over 100 Newcomen engines were installed around England by 1735, and it is estimated that as many as 2,000 were in operation by 1800 (including Watt versions). John Smeaton made numerous improvements to the Newcomen engine, notably the seals, and by improving these was able to almost triple their efficiency. He also preferred to use wheels instead of beams for transferring power from the cylinder, which made his engines more compact. Smeaton was the first to develop a rigorous theory of steam engine design of operation. He worked backward from the intended role to calculate the amount of power that would be needed for the task, the size and speed of a cylinder that would provide it, the size of boiler needed to feed it, and the amount of fuel it would consume. These were developed empirically after studying dozens of Newcomen engines in Cornwall and Newcastle, and building an experimental engine of his own at his home in Austhorpe in 1770. By the time the Watt engine was introduced only a few years later, Smeaton had built dozens of ever-larger engines into the 100 hp range.Tredgold, pg. 21-24 =Watt's separate condenser= Early Watt pumping engine. While working at the University of Glasgow as an instrument maker and repairman in 1759, James Watt was introduced to the power of steam by Professor John Robison. Fascinated, Watt took to reading everything he could on the subject, and independently developed the concept of latent heat, only recently published by Joseph Black at the same university. When Watt learned that the University owned a small working model of a Newcomen engine, he pressed to have it returned from London where it was being unsuccessfully repaired. Watt repaired the machine, but found it was barely functional even when fully repaired. After working with the design, Watt concluded that 80% of the steam used by the engine was wasted. Instead of providing motive force, it was instead being used to heat the cylinder. In the Newcomen design, every power stroke was started with a spray of cold water, which not only condensed the steam, but also cooled the walls of the cylinder. This heat had to be replaced before the cylinder would accept steam again. In the Newcomen engine the heat was supplied only by the steam, so when the steam valve was opened again the vast majority condensed on the cold walls as soon as it was admitted to the cylinder. It took a considerable amount of time and steam before the cylinder warmed back up and the steam started to fill it up. Watt solved the problem of the water spray by removing the cold water to a different cylinder, placed beside the power cylinder. Once the induction stroke was complete a valve was opened between the two, and any steam that entered the cylinder would condense inside this cold cylinder. This would create a vacuum that would pull more of the steam into the cylinder, and so on until the steam was mostly condensed. The valve was then closed, and operation of the main cylinder continued as it would on a conventional Newcomen engine. As the power cylinder remained at operational temperature throughout, the system was ready for another stroke as soon as the piston was pulled back to the top. Maintaining the temperature was a jacket around the cylinder where steam was admitted. Watt produced a working model in 1765. Convinced that this was a great advance, Watt entered into partnerships to provide venture capital while he worked on the design. Not content with this single improvement, Watt worked tirelessly on a series of other improvements to practically every part of the engine. Watt further improved the system by adding a small vacuum pump to pull the steam out of the cylinder into the condenser, further improving cycle times. A more radical change from the Newcomen design was closing off the top of the cylinder and introducing low-pressure steam above the piston. Now the power was not due to the difference of atmospheric pressure and the vacuum, but the pressure of the steam and the vacuum, a somewhat higher value. On the upward return stroke, the steam on top was transferred through a pipe to the underside of the piston ready to be condensed for the downward stroke. Sealing of the piston on a Newcomen engine had been achieved by maintaining a small quantity of water on its upper side. This was no longer possible in Watt's engine due to the presence of the steam. Watt spent considerable effort to find a seal that worked, eventually obtained by using a mixture of tallow and oil. The piston rod also passed through a gland on the top cylinder cover sealed in a similar way. The piston sealing problem was due to having no way to produce a sufficiently round cylinder. Watt tried having cylinders bored from cast iron, but they were too out of round. Watt was forced to use a hammered iron cylinder. The following quotation is from Roe (1916): > \\"When [John] Smeaton first saw the engine he reported to the Society of > Engineers that 'neither the tools nor the workmen existed who could > manufacture such a complex machine with sufficient precision' \\" Watt finally considered the design good enough to release in 1774, and the Watt engine was released to the market. As portions of the design could be easily fitted to existing Newcomen engines, there was no need to build an entirely new engine at the mines. Instead, Watt and his business partner Matthew Boulton licensed the improvements to engine operators, charging them a portion of the money they would save in reduced fuel costs. The design was wildly successful, and the Boulton and Watt company was formed to license the design and help new manufacturers build the engines. The two would later open the Soho Foundry to produce engines of their own. In 1774 John Wilkinson invented a boring machine with the shaft holding the boring tool supported on both ends, extending through the cylinder, unlike the then used cantilevered borers. With this machine he was able to successfully bore the cylinder for Boulton and Watt's first commercial engine in 1776.. Reprinted by McGraw-Hill, New York and London, 1926 (); and by Lindsay Publications, Inc., Bradley, Illinois, (). Watt never ceased improving his designs. This further improved the operating cycle speed, introduced governors, automatic valves, double- acting pistons, a variety of rotary power takeoffs and many other improvements. Watt's technology enabled the widespread commercial use of stationary steam engines.Ogg, David. (1965), Europe of the Ancien Regime: 1715-1783 Fontana History of Europe, (pp. 117 & 283) Humphrey Gainsborough produced a model condensing steam engine in the 1760s, which he showed to Richard Lovell Edgeworth, a member of the Lunar Society. Gainsborough believed that Watt had used his ideas for the invention;Tyler, David (2004): Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press. however James Watt was not a member of the Lunar Society at this period and his many accounts explaining the succession of thought processes leading to the final design would tend to belie this story. Power was still limited by the low pressure, the displacement of the cylinder, combustion and evaporation rates and condenser capacity. Maximum theoretical efficiency was limited by the relatively low temperature differential on either side of the piston; this meant that for a Watt engine to provide a usable amount of power, the first production engines had to be very large, and were thus expensive to build and install. =Watt double-acting and rotative engines= Watt developed a double-acting engine in which steam drove the piston in both directions, thereby increasing the engine speed and efficiency. The double-acting principle also significantly increased the output of a given physical sized engine. Boulton & Watt developed the reciprocating engine into the rotative type. Unlike the Newcomen engine, the Watt engine could operate smoothly enough to be connected to a drive shaft ‚Äì via sun and planet gears ‚Äì to provide rotary power along with double-acting condensing cylinders. The earliest example was built as a demonstrator and was installed in Boulton's factory to work machines for lapping (polishing) buttons or similar. For this reason it was always known as the Lap Engine.Hulse, David K., The development of rotary motion by steam power (TEE Publishing Ltd., Leamington, UK., 2001) In early steam engines the piston is usually connected by a rod to a balanced beam, rather than directly to a flywheel, and these engines are therefore known as beam engines. Early steam engines did not provide constant enough speed for critical operations such as cotton spinning. To control speed the engine was used to pump water for a water wheel, which powered the machinery. High-pressure engines As the 18th century advanced, the call was for higher pressures; this was strongly resisted by Watt who used the monopoly his patent gave him to prevent others from building high-pressure engines and using them in vehicles. He mistrusted the boiler technology of the day, the way they were constructed and the strength of the materials used. The important advantages of high-pressure engines were: #They could be made much smaller than previously for a given power output. There was thus the potential for steam engines to be developed that were small and powerful enough to propel themselves and other objects. As a result, steam power for transportation now became a practicality in the form of ships and land vehicles, which revolutionised cargo businesses, travel, military strategy, and essentially every aspect of society. # Because of their smaller size, they were much less expensive. # They did not require the significant quantities of condenser cooling water needed by atmospheric engines. # They could be designed to run at higher speeds, making them more suitable for powering machinery. The disadvantages were: # In the low-pressure range they were less efficient than condensing engines, especially if steam was not used expansively. # They were more susceptible to boiler explosions. The main difference between how high-pressure and low-pressure steam engines work is the source of the force that moves the piston. In the engines of Newcomen and Watt, it is the condensation of the steam that creates most of the pressure difference, causing atmospheric pressure (Newcomen) and low-pressure steam, seldom more than 7 psi boiler pressure,https://archive.org/stream/cu31924004249532#page/n45/mode/2up p.21 plus condenser vacuum\\"The Steam Engine a brief history of the reciprocating engine, R.J.Law, Science Museum, Her Majesty's Stationery Office London, , p.12 (Watt), to move the piston. In a high-pressure engine, most of the pressure difference is provided by the high-pressure steam from the boiler; the low-pressure side of the piston may be at atmospheric pressure or connected to the condenser pressure. Newcomen's indicator diagram, almost all below the atmospheric line, would see a revival nearly 200 years later with the low pressure cylinder of triple expansion engines contributing about 20% of the engine power, again almost completely below the atmospheric line. The first known advocate of \\"strong steam\\" was Jacob Leupold in his scheme for an engine that appeared in encyclopaedic works from around 1725. Various projects for steam propelled boats and vehicles also appeared throughout the century one of the most promising being Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot's who demonstrated his \\"fardier\\" (steam wagon), in 1769. Whilst the working pressure used for this vehicle is unknown, the small size of the boiler gave insufficient steam production rate to allow the fardier to advance more than a few hundred metres at a time before having to stop to raise steam. Other projects and models were proposed, but as with William Murdoch's model of 1784, many were blocked by Boulton and Watt. This did not apply in the US, and in 1788 a steamboat built by John Fitch operated in regular commercial service along the Delaware River between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Burlington, New Jersey, carrying as many as 30 passengers. This boat could typically make 7 to 8 miles per hour, and traveled more than during its short length of service. The Fitch steamboat was not a commercial success, as this route was adequately covered by relatively good wagon roads. In 1802 William Symington built a practical steamboat, and in 1807 Robert Fulton used a Watt steam engine to power the first commercially successful steamboat. Oliver Evans in his turn was in favour of \\"strong steam\\" which he applied to boat engines and to stationary uses. He was a pioneer of cylindrical boilers; however Evans' boilers did suffer several serious boiler explosions, which tended to lend weight to Watt's qualms. He founded the Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company in 1811 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The company introduced high-pressure steam engines to the riverboat trade in the Mississippi watershed. The first high-pressure steam engine was invented in 1800 by Richard Trevithick. The importance of raising steam under pressure (from a thermodynamic standpoint) is that it attains a higher temperature. Thus, any engine using high-pressure steam operates at a higher temperature and pressure differential than is possible with a low-pressure vacuum engine. The high-pressure engine thus became the basis for most further development of reciprocating steam technology. Even so, around the year 1800, \\"high pressure\\" amounted to what today would be considered very low pressure, i.e. 40-50 psi (276-345 kPa), the point being that the high-pressure engine in question was non-condensing, driven solely by the expansive power of the steam, and once that steam had performed work it was usually exhausted at higher-than-atmospheric pressure. The blast of the exhausting steam into the chimney could be exploited to create induced draught through the fire grate and thus increase the rate of burning, hence creating more heat in a smaller furnace, at the expense of creating back pressure on the exhaust side of the piston. On 21 February 1804, at the Penydarren ironworks at Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales, the first self-propelled railway steam engine or steam locomotive, built by Richard Trevithick, was demonstrated.Young, Robert: \\"Timothy Hackworth and the Locomotive\\"; the Book guild Ltd, Lewes, U.K. (2000) (reprint of 1923 ed.) pp.18-21 =Cornish engine and compounding= Trevithick pumping engine (Cornish system). Around 1811 Richard Trevithick was required to update a Watt pumping engine in order to adapt it to one of his new large cylindrical Cornish boilers. When Trevithick left for South America in 1816, his improvements were continued by William Sims. In a parallel, Arthur Woolf developed a compound engine with two cylinders, so that steam expanded in a high-pressure cylinder before being released into a low-pressure one. Efficiency was further improved by Samuel Groase, who insulated the boiler, engine, and pipes. Steam pressure above the piston was increased eventually reaching or even and now provided much of the power for the downward stroke; at the same time condensing was improved. This considerably raised efficiency and further pumping engines on the Cornish system (often known as Cornish engines) continued to be built new throughout the 19th century. Older Watt engines were updated to conform. The take-up of these Cornish improvements was slow in textile manufacturing areas where coal was cheap, due to the higher capital cost of the engines and the greater wear that they suffered. The change only began in the 1830s, usually by compounding through adding another (high-pressure) cylinder. Another limitation of early steam engines was speed variability, which made them unsuitable for many textile applications, especially spinning. In order to obtain steady speeds, early steam powered textile mills used the steam engine to pump water to a water wheel, which drove the machinery. Many of these engines were supplied worldwide and gave reliable and efficient service over a great many years with greatly reduced coal consumption. Some of them were very large and the type continued to be built right down to the 1890s. Corliss engine \\"Gordon's improved Corliss valvegear\\", detailed view. The wrist-plate is the central plate from which rods radiate to each of the 4 valves. The Corliss steam engine (patented 1849) was called the greatest improvement since James Watt.Thomson, p. 83-85. The Corliss engine had greatly improved speed control and better efficiency, making it suitable to all sorts of industrial applications, including spinning. Corliss used separate ports for steam supply and exhaust, which prevented the exhaust from cooling the passage used by the hot steam. Corliss also used partially rotating valves that provided quick action, helping to reduce pressure losses. The valves themselves were also a source of reduced friction, especially compared to the slide valve, which typically used 10% of an engine's power. Corliss used automatic variable cut off. The valve gear controlled engine speed by using the governor to vary the timing of the cut off. This was partly responsible for the efficiency improvement in addition to the better speed control. Porter-Allen high speed steam engine Porter-Allen high speed engine. Enlarge to see the Porter governor at left front of flywheel The Porter-Allen engine, introduced in 1862, used an advanced valve gear mechanism developed for Porter by Allen, a mechanic of exceptional ability, and was at first generally known as the Allen engine. The high speed engine was a precision machine that was well balanced, achievements made possible by advancements in machine tools and manufacturing technology. The high speed engine ran at piston speeds from three to five times the speed of ordinary engines. It also had low speed variability. The high speed engine was widely used in sawmills to power circular saws. Later it was used for electrical generation. The engine had several advantages. It could, in some cases, be directly coupled. If gears or belts and drums were used, they could be much smaller sizes. The engine itself was also small for the amount of power it developed. Porter greatly improved the fly-ball governor by reducing the rotating weight and adding a weight around the shaft. This significantly improved speed control. Porter's governor became the leading type by 1880. The efficiency of the Porter-Allen engine was good, but not equal to the Corliss engine. =Uniflow (or unaflow) engine= The uniflow engine was the most efficient type of high-pressure engine. It was invented in 1911 and was used in ships, but was displaced by steam turbines and later marine diesel engines.Discusses engine types in the container shipping era but does not even mention uniflo.

He was specialized in Germanic and Indo-European studies and was active at the University of Texas at Austin for much of his career. Holding a PhD degree in Germanic philology from the Free University of Brussels, Polom√© was professor and head of the Department of Linguistics at the Official University of the Congo and Ruanda- Urundi in the late 1950s and conducted research on Bantu languages. He subsequently served as a professor of comparative linguistics and religions at the University of Texas at Austin from 1962 to 1997. While a professor at Austin, Polom√© co-founded the Journal of Indo-European Studies, of which he was an editor for many years. Polom√© was known as a specialist on Indo- European and Germanic religion. He was an author and editor of numerous scholarly publications, and the teacher of several students who subsequently became prominent scholars in his fields of study. Early life and education Edgar C. Polom√© was born in Molenbeek-Saint-Jean, a suburb of Brussels, Belgium, on 31 July 1920. His parents were Marcel F√©licien Polom√© and Berthe Henry. He was an only child. His father was a Walloon, and his mother was Flemish, but both of his parents spoke French at home. He spoke Dutch with the family maid. Polom√© attended a Dutch-language primary school, and received his secondary education at the French-language Ath√©n√©e Royal de Koekelberg, where he immersed himself in classical philology and acquired proficiency in Latin, Greek, German and English, graduating as the best in his class. He would eventually acquire proficiency in a large number of languages, including several Italic (such as French, Italian and Latin), Germanic (such as Dutch, English, German, Swedish, Danish and Gothic), Indo-Iranian (such as Hindi, Sanskrit, Pali, Avestan and Old Persian), Celtic, Baltic and Bantu languages (particularly Swahili), and Greek and Hittite. After winning a scholarship, Polom√© entered the Free University of Brussels to study Germanic philology. Passing his freshman exams with the highest distinction, Polom√© was conscripted into the Belgian Armed Forces during the Battle of Belgium. He subsequently resumed his studies, receiving a candidature (roughly equivalent to a bachelor's degree) in Germanic philology in 1941. The Free University of Brussels was closed by the German occupiers in 1942. In 1943, Polom√© gained a licenciate (roughly equivalent to a master's degree) in Germanic philology at the University of Louvain. While gaining his licenciate he also worked on Sanskrit and Indology with √âtienne Lamotte. During this time, Polom√© developed a strong interest in the comparative study of religions and cultures, which he would maintain for the rest of his life. After the end of World War II in Europe, Polom√© joined the United States Army as an interpreter in Germany. He combined his work for the Americans with the study of Celtic. Returning to Beligum Polom√© re-enrolled at the University of Brussels, completing his PhD degree in Germanic philology in 1949 with the highest distinction. His PhD thesis was on the laryngeal theory of Indo-European linguistics, and was supervised by . During his research for the dissertation, Polom√© came in contact with the foremost scholars on Indo-European linguistics of the day, including Julius Pokorny, Georges Dum√©zil, √âmile Benveniste, Jerzy Kury≈Çowicz and Winfred P. Lehmann. The works of Dum√©zil in particular would have very strong influence on Polom√©, who became one of Dum√©zil's most consistent supporters. Early career From 1942 to 1956, Polom√© taught Germanic languages on a non-regular basis at the Ath√©n√©e Adolphe Max in Brussels. From 1954 to 1956 he taught Dutch at the Belgian Broadcasting Corporation. Polom√© was subsequently appointed to the faculty of the Official University of the Congo and Ruanda-Urundi in √âlisabethville (now Lubumbashi), Belgian Congo. Here he established its Department of Linguistics. The department was the most advanced of its kind in Africa at the time and conducted pioneering research on the Bantu languages. While in Congo, Polom√© published a number of works on Swahili; he was interested in the relationship between language and culture, which made him turn to fields such as modern sociolinguistics. Polom√© would become well remembered for his research on Bantu linguistics. His Swahili Language Handbook (1967) was in use at universities for many decades.. \\"His textbook Swahili Language Handbook is still used in many universities; among other books he wrote or edited... Perhaps his greatest legacy to mankind is his students, so many of whom continue his work as teachers and scholars.\\" Career at the University of Texas at Austin Gilded side of the Trundholm sun chariot, an object from the Nordic Bronze Age. Polom√© was interested in Germanic religion and its Indo-European components. In 1960, the Republic of the Congo was proclaimed, leading to the Congo Crisis. Polom√© fled as a refugee to Southern Rhodesia. Winfred P. Lehmann then invited him to the University of Texas at Austin, where the absence of Werner Winter gave him the opportunity to teach Hindi, Latin, Hittite and other languages as a visiting professor for one semester. In 1962 Polom√© was appointed a tenured professor at the Department of Germanic Languages at Austin. This department was not limited to Germanic languages, but covered many other aspects of linguistics as well. His teaching was particularly devoted to Indo-European and Germanic studies, linguistics and African languages. He taught courses in a number of departments, including the departments for anthropology, classics, linguistics, foreign language education and Germanic languages. Topics on which he taught included historical linguistics, comparative linguistics, sociolinguistics, comparative religions and the history of religion. In linguistics, languages Polom√© taught at Austin included Sanskrit, Pali, Hittite, Avestan and Old Persian, and the comparative grammar of Indo-Iranian, Greek, Latin, Germanic, Celtic, Baltic and Bantu languages (particularly Swahili). He also taught courses in ancient Germanic culture and religion, and Indo-European culture and religion. Among his students at Austin, Polom√© became well known for his extensive knowledge and eclectic approach to scholarly problems. Notable students on whom Polom√© had a strong influence include Joseph C. Salmons and Bridget Drinka, who became prominent scholars in the field themselves.. \\"He was unbelievable. He knew more than anybody that I've ever met in terms of culture, languages and religions. My career is completely his doing.\\" \\"To the extent that I am a critical thinker and an inquisitive researcher today, I owe these attributes to Edgar's care, guidance, and meticulous attention to detail. No one did more to shape my mind and my ability to reason than Edgar did... He showed me the value of his own eclectic approach: read profusely, examine the validity of all sides of the issue, stake out a position, but keep your mind open to other interpretations. This might be what I would really call Polome's Law: immerse yourself in the possibilities.\\" Polom√©s research centered particularly on Indo-European and Germanic studies, and Bantu languages. He was known for his interdisciplinary approach, and was interested in linguistics, culture and religion. His most important contributions were to the study of the language, culture and history of the Germanic peoples. Questions examined by Polom√© in this regard include Celtic-Germanic relations, and the Indo-European components in Germanic languages and culture. He conducted extensive work on Germanic religion. Polom√© was the author and editor of several books, and authored hundreds of articles and reviews for scholarly journals. Throughout his career, Polom√© was a member of numerous learned societies, including the American Oriental Society, the Association for Asian Studies, African Studies Association, Linguistic Society of America, the American Anthropological Association, the Modern Language Association of America, Soci√©t√© de Linguistique de Paris, and the . Polom√© was director of the Center for Asian Studies at Austin from 1962 to 1972. He gained American citizenship in 1966. In 1968 he was granted a Fulbright professorship in Kiel, Germany. In the following year he edited Old Norse Literature and Mythology (1969). Along with Lehmann, Polom√© was instrumental in the creation of the Department of Linguistics and the Department of Oriental and African Languages and Literature (DOALL) at Austin, which was established in 1969 with Polom√© as chairman (1969‚Äì1976). In 1969‚Äì1970 he stayed in Tanzania with a grant from the Ford Foundation and again surveyed African languages. Based at the University of Dar es Salaam, where he was a visiting professor, Polom√© also helped to improve the linguistics programs at the University of Nairobi during this period.

From 1972 to 1978, Polom√© was chairman of the Language Committee of the American Institute of Indian Studies. Together with the archaeologist Marija Gimbutas, Polom√© co- founded the Journal of Indo-European Studies (JIES) in 1973. At JIES, Polom√© served from the beginning as mythology editor, was responsible for linguistics, and was made managing editor in 1987. In 1995, Polom√© launched the JIES Book Chronicle, which reviews books of interest to Indo-European studies. Together with A. Richard Diebold Jr., Polom√© co-edited the Journal of Indo-European Studies Monograph Series. Polom√© was a friend of J. P. Mallory, who would eventually assume many of his duties at the journal. Polom√© was a co-editor of Mankind Quarterly, which like the JIES is published by the anthropologist Roger Pearson. Polom√© was along with Gimbutas, Colin Renfrew, Arthur Koestler and many other scholars of prominence a member of the patronage committee of ', which is the journal of Alain de Benoist's Nouvelle Droite think tank GRECE. While Pearson and Benoist have been associated with far-right politics, Polom√© and Gimbutas have not been suspected of harboring such political sympathies.. \\"[N]one of Pearson‚Äôs writing appeared in the one publication at the institute of acknowledged academic value, the Journal of Indo-European Studies, which he left to the control of respected scholars Edgar Polom√© and Marija Gimbutas...\\". \\"[A]mong the members of the patronage committee of Nouvelle Ecole , we find not only scholars above suspicion, like Manfred Mayrhofer, Edgar Polom√©, Colin Renfrew, the late Arthur Koestler or the late Marija Gimbutas, but also the famous scholar Mircea Eliade...\\" Polome¬¥s Language, Society and Paleoculture (1982) examined the relationships between culture and language in ancient societies. In 1985, Polom√© was appointed Christie and Stanley E. Adams Jr. Centennial professor at the College of Liberal Arts at University of Texas at Austin. A Festschrift for Polom√© was published by Mouton de Gruyter in 1988. The following year, his Essays on Germanic Religion (1989) was published. In 1990, Polom√© organized Perspectives on the Ancient Indo-European World, which was an international seminar funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. In the following years, Polom√© authored and edited a number of works on historical linguistics, including Research Guide to Language Change (1990), and Reconstructing Languages and Cultures (1992). A second Festschrift for Polom√© was published in two volumes as part of the JIES monograph series in 1991. Last years Polom√© suffered a stroke in 1993, and was left paralyzed on his left side. He retired as professor emeritus in 1997. He nevertheless remained a prolific author and editor. Polom√© died of osteosarcoma at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas on March 11, 2000. He was survived by his wife Sharon, his son Andre, his daughter Monique, two grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. A third Festschrift intended for Polom√©s 80th birthday, was published posthumously as a Gedenkschrift in three volumes. Personal life Polom√© married Julia Schwindt in on July 22, 1944. They had two children, Andre Polom√© and Monique Polom√© Ellsworth. Julia died on May 27, 1975. On July 11, 1980 Polom√© married Barbara Baker Harris. They divorced on January 29, 1990. On February 8, 1991 Polom√© married his third wife Sharon Looper Rankin, with whom he lived until his death.

More broadly it refers to the theological system inferred from the various sermons, theological treatises, letters, journals, diaries, hymns, and other spiritual writings of the Wesleys and their contemporary coadjutors such as John William Fletcher. Wesleyan‚ÄìArminian theology, manifest today in Methodism (inclusive of the Holiness movement), is named for its founders, the Wesleys, as well as for Jacob Arminius, since it is a subset of Arminian theology. In 1736, these two brothers traveled to the Georgia colony in America as missionaries for the Church of England; they left rather disheartened at what they saw. Both of them subsequently had \\"religious experiences,\\" especially John in 1738, being greatly influenced by the Moravian Christians. They began to organize a renewal movement within the Church of England to focus on personal faith and holiness. John Wesley took Protestant churches to task over the nature of sanctification, the process by which a believer is conformed to the image of Christ, emphasizing New Testament teachings regarding the work of God and the believer in sanctification. The movement did well within the Church of England in Britain, but when the movement crossed the ocean into America, it took on a form of its own, finally being established as the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1784. The Methodist churches are similar to Anglicanism (in Church government and liturgical practices), yet have added a strong emphasis on personal faith and personal experience, especially on the new birth and entire sanctification. At its heart, the theology of John Wesley stressed the life of Christian holiness: to love God with all one‚Äôs heart, mind, soul and strength, and to love one's neighbour as oneself. Wesley‚Äôs teaching also stressed experiential religion and moral responsibility.Commonplace Holiness: Wesley & Methodism  History  The doctrine of Wesleyan‚ÄìArminianism was founded as an attempt to explain Christianity in a manner unlike the teachings of Calvinism. Arminianism is a theological study conducted by Jacobus Arminius, from the Netherlands, in opposition to Calvinist orthodoxy on the basis of free will. After the death of Arminius the followers, led by Simon Episcopius, presented a document concerning the Arminian beliefs to the Netherlands. This document is known today as the five articles of Remonstrance. Wesleyan Arminianism, on the other hand, was founded upon the theological teachings of John Wesley, an English evangelist, and the beliefs of this dogma are derived from his many publications, including his sermons, journal, abridgements of theological, devotional, and historical Christian works, and a variety of tracts and treatises on theological subjects. Subsequently, the two theories have joined into one set of values for the contemporary church; yet, when examined separately, their unique details can be discovered, as well as their similarities in ideals. In the early 1770s, John Wesley, aided by the theological writings of John William Fletcher, emphasized Arminian doctrines in his controversy with the Calvinistic wing of the evangelicals in England. Then, in 1778, he founded a theological journal which he titled the Arminian Magazine. This period, during the Calvinist‚ÄìArminian debate, was influential in forming a lasting link between Arminian and Wesleyan theology. Historically, Calvinists have feared that Wesleyans have strayed too close to Pelagianism. On the other hand, Wesleyans have charged that Calvinists have strayed too close to antinomianism. Justification by faith is pivotal for both traditions. Although free will is an issue, in many respects the two traditions are not that far apart. For example, Wesley stated that he and Calvin were but a hair's breadth apart on justification. Sanctification, not free will, draws the clearest line of distinction. Good theology, for Wesley, was balance without compromise. This balance is most evident in Wesley's understanding of faith and works, justification and sanctification.  Wesleyan tradition  In the broad sense of the term, the Wesleyan tradition identifies the theological impetus for those movements and denominations who trace their roots to a theological tradition finding its initial focus in John Wesley. Although its primary legacy remains within the various Methodist denominations (the Wesleyan Methodist, the Free Methodist, the African Methodist Episcopal, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion, the Christian Methodist Episcopal, the United Methodist, the Free Methodist Church of North America, The Church of the Nazarene, The Wesleyan Church, and others), the Wesleyan tradition has been refined and reinterpreted as catalyst for other movements and denominations as well, e.g., Charles Finney and the holiness movement; William J. Seymour and the Pentecostal movement; Phineas Bresee and the Church of the Nazarene. =Wesleyan distinctives= New Birth In Wesleyan theology, the \\"new birth is necessary for salvation because it marks the move toward holiness. That comes with faith.\\" John Wesley, founder of the Methodist Church, held that the New Birth \\"is that great change which God works in the soul when he brings it into life, when he raises it from the death of sin to the life of righteousness\\" (Works, vol. 2, pp. 193‚Äì194). In the life of a Christian, the new birth is considered the first work of grace. The Articles of Religion, in Article XVII‚ÄîOf Baptism, state that baptism is a \\"sign of regeneration or the new birth.\\" The Methodist Visitor in describing this doctrine, admonishes individuals: \\"'Ye must be born again.' Yield to God that He may perform this work in and for you. Admit Him to your heart. 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.'\\" Christian perfection Wesleyan theology teaches that there were two distinct phases in the Christian experience. In the first work of grace, the new birth, the believer received forgiveness and became a Christian. During the second work of grace, entire sanctification, the believer was purified and made holy. Wesley taught both that sanctification could be an instantaneous experience, and that it could be a gradual process. Salvation The Wesleyan tradition seeks to establish justification by faith as the gateway to sanctification or \\"scriptural holiness.\\" Wesley insisted that imputed righteousness must become imparted righteousness. He believed that one could progress in love until love became devoid of self-interest at the moment of entire sanctification. With regard to good works, A Catechism on the Christian Religion: The Doctrines of Christianity with Special Emphasis on Wesleyan Concepts teaches: The Methodist Churches affirm the doctrine of justification by faith, but in Wesleyan theology, justification refers to \\"pardon, the forgiveness of sins\\", rather than \\"being made actually just and righteous\\", which Methodists believe is accomplished through sanctification. John Wesley taught that the keeping of the moral law contained in the Ten Commandments, as well as engaging in the works of piety and the works of mercy, were \\"indispensable for our sanctification\\". Methodist soteriology emphasize the importance of the pursuit of holiness in salvation. Thus, for Methodists, \\"true faith...cannot subsist without works\\". Bishop Scott J. Jones in United Methodist Doctrine writes that in Methodist theology: Bishop Jones concludes that \\"United Methodist doctrine thus understands true, saving faith to be the kind that, give time and opportunity, will result in good works. Any supposed faith that does not in fact lead to such behaviors is not genuine, saving faith.\\" Methodist evangelist Phoebe Palmer stated that \\"justification would have ended with me had I refused to be holy.\\" While \\"faith is essential for a meaningful relationship with God, our relationship with God also takes shape through our care for people, the community, and creation itself.\\" Methodism, inclusive of the holiness movement, thus teaches that \\"justification [is made] conditional on obedience and progress in sanctification\\" emphasizing \\"a deep reliance upon Christ not only in coming to faith, but in remaining in the faith.\\" Richard P. Bucher, contrasts this position with the Lutheran one, discussing an analogy put forth by John Wesley: With regard to the fate of the unlearned, Willard Francis Mallalieu, a Methodist bishop, wrote in Some Things That Methodism Stands For: Conditional preservation of the saints Covenant theology Methodism maintains the superstructure of classical covenant theology, but being Arminian in soteriology, it discards the \\"predestinarian template of Reformed theology that was part and parcel of its historical development.\\" The main difference between Wesleyan covenant theology and classical covenant theology is as follows: As such, in the traditional Wesleyan view, only Adam and Eve were under the covenant of works, while on the other hand, all of their progeny are under the covenant of grace. With Mosaic Law belonging to the covenant of grace, all of humanity is brought \\"within the reach of the provisions of that covenant.\\" This belief is reflected in John Wesley's sermon Righteousness of Faith: \\"The Apostle does not here oppose the covenant given by Moses, to the covenant given by Christ. ... But it is the covenant of grace, which God, through Christ, hath established with men in all ages\\". The covenant of grace was therefore administered through \\"promises, prophecies, sacrifices, and at last by circumcision\\" during the patriarchal ages and through \\"the paschal lamb, the scape goat, [and] the priesthood of Aaron\\" under Mosaic Law. Under the Gospel, the covenant of grace is mediated through the greater sacraments, baptism and the Lord's Supper. Ecclesiology new birth and entire sanctification to the public at events such as tent revivals and camp meetings, which they believe is the reason that God raised them up into existence. Methodists affirm belief in \\"the one true Church, Apostolic and Universal\\", viewing their Churches as constituting a \\"privileged branch of this true church\\". With regard to the position of Methodism within Christendom, the founder of the movement \\"John Wesley once noted that what God had achieved in the development of Methodism was no mere human endeavor but the work of God. As such it would be preserved by God so long as history remained.\\" Calling it \\"the grand depositum\\" of the Methodist faith, Wesley specifically taught that the propagation of the doctrine of entire sanctification was the reason that God raised up the Methodists in the world. Four sources of theological authority The Wesleyan tradition's defense has normally exercised four sources of authority: scripture, reason, tradition, and experience. Atonement Methodism falls squarely in the tradition of substitutionary atonement, though it is linked with Christus Victor and moral influence theories. John Wesley, reflecting on , connects penal substitution with victory over Satan in his Explanatory Notes Upon the New Testament: \\"the voluntary passion of our Lord appeased the Father's wrath, obtained pardon and acceptance for us, and consequently, dissolved the dominion and power which Satan had over us through our sins.\\" In elucidating , Wesley says that Christ manifesting Himself in the hearts of humans destroys the work of Satan, thus making Christus Victor imagery \\"one part of the framework of substitutionary atonement.\\" The Methodist divine Charles Wesley's hymns \\"Sinners, Turn, Why Will You Die\\" and \\"And Can It be That I Should Gain\\" concurrently demonstrate that Christ's sacrifice is the example of supreme love, while also convicting the Christian believer of his/her sins, thus using the moral influence theory within the structure of penal substitution in accordance with the Augustinian theology of illumination. Methodism also emphasizes a participatory nature in atonement, in which the Methodist believer spiritually dies with Christ and He dies for humanity; this is reflected in the words of the following Methodist hymn (122): The Christian believer, in Methodist theology, mystically draws himself/herself into the scene of the crucifixion in order to experience the power of salvation that it possesses. In the Eucharist, the Methodist especially experiences the participatory nature of substitutionary atonement as \\"the sacrament sets before our eyes Christ's death and suffering whereby we are transported into an experience of the crucifixion.\\" Four Last Things With respect to the four last things, Wesleyan theology affirms the belief in Hades, \\"the intermediate state of souls between death and the general resurrection,\\" which is divided into Paradise (for the righteous) and Gehenna (for the wicked). After the general judgment, Hades will be abolished. John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, \\"made a distinction between hell (the receptacle of the damned) and Hades (the receptacle of all separate spirits), and also between paradise (the antechamber of heaven) and heaven itself.\\" The dead will remain in Hades \\"until the Day of Judgment when we will all be bodily resurrected and stand before Christ as our Judge. After the Judgment, the Righteous will go to their eternal reward in Heaven and the Accursed will depart to Hell (see ).\\" Wesley stated that: \\"I believe it to be a duty to observe, to pray for the Faithful Departed\\". He \\"taught the propriety of Praying for the Dead, practised it himself, provided Forms that others might.\\" In a joint statement with the Catholic Church in England and Wales, the Methodist Church of Great Britain affirmed that \\"Methodists who pray for the dead thereby commend them to the continuing mercy of God.\\" Sacraments and Rites =Holy Baptism= A baptistry in a Methodist church The Methodist Articles of Religion, with regard to baptism, teach: While baptism imparts regenerating grace, its permanence is contingent upon repentance and a personal commitment to Jesus Christ. Wesleyan theology holds that baptism is a sacrament of initiation into the visible Church. Wesleyan covenant theology further teaches that baptism is a sign and a seal of the covenant of grace: Methodists recognize three modes of baptism as being valid‚Äîimmersion, aspersion or affusion‚Äîin the name of the Holy Trinity. =Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist= The followers of John Wesley have typically affirmed that the sacrament of Holy Communion is an instrumental Means of Grace through which the real presence of Christ is communicated to the believer, but have otherwise allowed the details to remain a mystery. In particular, Methodists reject the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation (see \\"Article XVIII\\" of the Articles of Religion); the Primitive Methodist Church, in its Discipline also rejects the Lollardist doctrine of consubstantiation. In 2004, the United Methodist Church affirmed its view of the sacrament and its belief in the real presence in an official document entitled This Holy Mystery: A United Methodist Understanding of Holy Communion. Of particular note here is the church's unequivocal recognition of the anamnesis as more than just a memorial but, rather, a re-presentation of Christ Jesus and His Love. :Holy Communion is remembrance, commemoration, and memorial, but this remembrance is much more than simply intellectual recalling. \\"Do this in remembrance of me\\" (Luke 22:19; 1 Corinthians 11:24‚Äì25) is anamnesis (the biblical Greek word). This dynamic action becomes re- presentation of past gracious acts of God in the present, so powerfully as to make them truly present now. Christ is risen and is alive here and now, not just remembered for what was done in the past. A United Methodist minister consecrates the elements This affirmation of real presence can be seen clearly illustrated in the language of the United Methodist Eucharistic Liturgyfor example, where, in the epiclesis of the Great Thanksgiving, the celebrating minister prays over the elements: :Pour out your Holy Spirit on us gathered here, and on these gifts of bread and wine. Make them be for us the body and blood of Christ, that we may be for the world the body of Christ, redeemed by his blood. Methodists assert that Jesus is truly present, and that the means of His presence is a \\"Holy Mystery\\". A celebrating minister will pray for the Holy Spirit to make the elements \\"be for us the body and blood of Christ\\", and the congregation can even sing, as in the third stanza of Charles Wesley's hymn Come Sinners to the Gospel Feast: :Come and partake the gospel feast, :be saved from sin, in Jesus rest; :O taste the goodness of our God, :and eat his flesh and drink his blood. The distinctive feature of the Methodist doctrine of the real presence is that the way Christ manifests His presence in the Eucharist is a sacred mystery‚Äîthe focus is that Christ is truly present in the sacrament. The Discipline of the Free Methodist Church thus teaches: =Confession= =Confirmation= =Holy Matrimony= =Lovefeast= In Wesleyan theology, Lovefeasts (in which bread and the loving-cup is shared between members of the congregation) are a 'means of grace' and 'converting ordinance' that John Wesley believed to be an apostolic institution. One account from July 1776 expounded on the fact that people experienced the new birth and entire sanctification at a Lovefeast: =Validity of Holy Orders= John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist tradition, believed that the offices of bishop and presbyter constituted one order, citing an ancient opinion from the Church of Alexandria; Jerome, a Church Father, wrote: \\"For even at Alexandria from the time of Mark the Evangelist until the episcopates of Heraclas and Dionysius the presbyters always named as bishop one of their own number chosen by themselves and set in a more exalted position, just as an army elects a general, or as deacons appoint one of themselves whom they know to be diligent and call him archdeacon. For what function, excepting ordination, belongs to a bishop that does not also belong to a presbyter?\\" (Letter CXLVI). John Wesley thus argued that for two centuries the succession of bishops in the Church of Alexandria, which was founded by Mark the Evangelist, was preserved through ordination by presbyters alone and was considered valid by that ancient Church. Since the Bishop of London refused to ordain ministers in the British American colonies, this constituted an emergency and as a result, on 2 September 1784, Wesley, along with a priest from the Anglican Church and two other elders, operating under the ancient Alexandrian habitude, ordained Thomas Coke a superintendent, although Coke embraced the title bishop. Today, the United Methodist Church follows this ancient Alexandrian practice as bishops are elected from the presbyterate: the Discipline of the Methodist Church, in ¬∂303, affirms that \\"ordination to this ministry is a gift from God to the Church. In ordination, the Church affirms and continues the apostolic ministry through persons empowered by the Holy Spirit.\\" It also uses sacred scripture in support of this practice, namely, 1 Timothy 4:14, which states: The Methodist Church also buttresses this argument with the leg of sacred tradition of the Wesleyan Quadrilateral by citing the Church Fathers, many of whom concur with this view. In addition to the aforementioned arguments, in 1937 the annual Conference of the British Methodist Church located the \\"true continuity\\" with the Church of past ages in \\"the continuity of Christian experience, the fellowship in the gift of the one Spirit; in the continuity in the allegiance to one Lord, the continued proclamation of the message; the continued acceptance of the mission;...\\" [through a long chain which goes back to] \\"the first disciples in the company of the Lord Himself ... This is our doctrine of apostolic succession\\" [which neither depends on, nor is secured by,] \\"an official succession of ministers, whether bishops or presbyters, from apostolic times, but rather by fidelity to apostolic truth\\".Jay, Eric G. The Church: its changing image through twenty centuries. John Knox Press: 1980, p.228f Canonical hours The Order of Saint Luke, a Methodist religious order Early Methodism was known for its \\"almost monastic rigors, its living by rule, [and] its canonical hours of prayer\\". It inherited from its Anglican patrimony the rubrics of reciting the Daily Office, which Methodist Christians were expected to pray. The first prayer book of Methodism, The Sunday Service of the Methodists with other occasional Services thus included the canonical hours of both Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer; these two fixed prayer times were observed everyday in early Christianity, individually on weekdays and corporately on the Lord's Day. Later Methodist liturgical books, such as The Methodist Worship Book (1999) provide for Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer to be prayed daily; the United Methodist Church encourages its communicants to pray the canonical hours as \\"one of the essential practices\\" of being a disciple of Jesus. Some Methodist religious orders publish the Daily Office to be used for that community, for example, The Book of Offices and Services of The Order of Saint Luke contains the canonical hours to be prayed traditionally at seven fixed prayer times: Lauds (6 am), Terce (9 am), Sext (12 pm), None (3 pm), Vespers (6 pm), Compline (9 pm) and Vigil (12 am). Outward Holiness Early Methodists wore plain dress, with Methodist clergy condemning \\"high headdresses, ruffles, laces, gold, and 'costly apparel' in general\\". John Wesley recommended that Methodists annually read his thoughts On Dress;Journals of Wesley, Nehemiah Curnock, ed., London: Epworth Press 1938, p. 468. in that sermon, John Wesley expressed his desire for Methodists: \\"Let me see, before I die, a Methodist congregation, full as plain dressed as a Quaker congregation\\". The 1858 Discipline of the Wesleyan Methodist Connection thus stated that \\"we would ... enjoin on all who fear God plain dress\\". Peter Cartwright, a Methodist revivalist, stated that in addition to wearing plain dress, the early Methodists distinguished themselves from other members of society by fasting once a week, abstaining from alcohol, and devoutly observing the Sabbath. Methodist circuit riders were known for practicing the spiritual discipline of mortifying the flesh as they \\"arose well before dawn for solitary prayer; they remained on their knees without food or drink or physical comforts sometimes for hours on end\\". The early Methodists did not participate in, and condemned, \\"worldly habits\\" including \\"playing cards, racing horses, gambling, attending the theater, dancing (both in frolics and balls), and cockfighting\\". Over time, many of these practices were gradually relaxed in mainline Methodism, although practices such as teetotalism and fasting are still very much encouraged, in addition to the current prohibition of gambling; denominations of the conservative holiness movement, such as the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection and Evangelical Wesleyan Church, continue to reflect the spirit of the historic Methodist practice of wearing plain dress, encouraging members in \\"abstaining from the wearing of extravagant hairstyles, jewelry‚Äîto include rings, and expensive clothing for any reason\\". The General Rules of the Methodist Church in America, which are among the doctrinal standards of many Methodist Churches, promote first-day Sabbatarianism as they require \\"attending upon all the ordinances of God\\" including \\"the public worship of God\\" and prohibit \\"profaning the day of the Lord, either by doing ordinary work therein or by buying or selling\\". Law and Gospel John Wesley admonished Methodist preachers to emphasize both the Law and the Gospel: Methodism makes a distinction between the ceremonial law and the moral law that is the Ten Commandments given to Moses. In Methodist Christianity, the moral law is the \\"fundamental ontological principle of the universe\\" and \\"is grounded in eternity\\", being \\"engraved on human hearts by the finger of God.\\" In contradistinction to the teaching of the Lutheran Churches, the Methodist Churches bring the Law and the Gospel together in a profound sense: \\"the law is grace and through it we discover the good news of the way life is intended to be lived.\\" John Wesley, the father of the Methodist tradition taught: Sunday Sabbatarianism A monument of the Ten Commandments at the Texas State Capitol The first Methodists, who were Arminian in theology, were known for \\"religiously keeping the Sabbath day\\". They regarded \\"keeping the Lord's Day as a duty, a delight, and a means of grace\\". The General Rules of the Methodist Church require \\"attending upon all the ordinances of God\\" including \\"the public worship of God\\" and prohibit \\"profaning the day of the Lord, either by doing ordinary work therein or by buying or selling\\". The Sunday Sabbatarian practices of the earlier Wesleyan Methodist Church in Great Britain are described by Jonathan Crowther in A Portraiture of Methodism:  Churches upholding Wesleyan theology  Grace Wesleyan Methodist Church is a parish church of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection and is located in Akron, Ohio. The Methodist movement began as a reform within the Church of England, and, for a while, it remained as such. The movement separated itself from its \\"mother church\\" and became known as the Methodist Episcopal Church in America and the Wesleyan Methodist Church in Britain. Many divisions occurred within the Methodist Episcopal Church in the nineteenth century, mostly over, first, the slavery question and later, over the inclusion of African- Americans. Some of these schisms healed in the early twentieth century, and many of the splinter Methodist groups came together by 1939 to form The Methodist Church. In 1968, the Methodist Church joined with the Pietist Evangelical United Brethren Church to form The United Methodist Church, the largest Methodist church in America. Other groups include the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, the Congregational Methodist Church, the Evangelical Church of North America, the Evangelical Congregational Church, the Evangelical Methodist Church, the Free Methodist Church of North America, and the Southern Methodist Church. In nineteenth-century America, a dissension arose over the nature of sanctification. Those who emphasized the gradual nature sanctification remained within the mainline Methodist Churches; others, however, believed in instantaneous sanctification that could be perfected. Those who followed the latter line of thought began the various holiness churches, including the Church of God (Holiness), the Church of God (Anderson), the Churches of Christ in Christian Union, and the Wesleyan Methodist Church, which later merged with the Pilgrim Holiness Church to form the Wesleyan Church, which is present today. Other holiness groups, which also rejected the competing Pentecostal movement, merged to form the Church of the Nazarene. The Salvation Army is another Wesleyan-Holiness group which traces its roots to early Methodism. The Salvation Army's founders Catherine and William Booth founded the organization to stress evangelism and social action when William was a minister in the Methodist Reform Church. The conservative holiness movement, including denominations such as the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection, Bible Methodist Connection of Churches, Evangelical Wesleyan Church and Primitive Methodist Church, emerged in the 19th and 20th centuries to herald many of the strict standards of primitive Methodism, including outward holiness, plain dress, and temperance.

The novel takes the form of memoirs written by Justa Black, the illegitimate daughter of Peter Justice Black, a general of the fictional Pan- Polarian Empire. Plot Map of the world described in the novel. The Pan- Polarian Empire is delineated in red, with territories mentioned as tributaries in maroon. The approximate locations of the Empire's primary rivals, Persia and China, are indicated in green and yellow, respectively. As with his previous work Fitzpatrick's War, The Martian General's Daughter borrows heavily from classical history; in this case, the setting is reminiscent of the Roman Empire during the reign of Marcus Aurelius and his son, Commodus. Unlike Fitzpatrick's War, Judson provides little background to explain how the world evolved into the shape set forth in the novel. The story takes place in the late twenty-third century, in which much of the Northern Hemisphere, as well as extraplanetary colonies on Mars and Jupiter, are dominated by the Pan-Polarian Empire, which is implicitly descended from the United States of America (though this is never expressly stated, references are made to the \\"old capital\\" near Maryland.) Pan-Polarian society is based on that of Imperial Rome, including an imperial cult and a variety of polytheistic and monolatric religions that have largely replaced the major religions of our time, including the cults of \\"El Bis\\" and the goddess Marilyn. The Empire's primary rivals are Persia and China, but which also fights against a number of enemies in Africa and South America. A nano- engineered plague has been released by one of the warring parties which causes metal to corrode and become useless; as a result, advanced technology is beginning to fail and the world is quickly degenerating to pre-industrial technology. The setting alternates between chronicling the career of General Black (and his daughter's career as his aide-de-camp) during the 2270s and 2280s and his attempt to seize the Imperial throne in the 2290s during a multi-party struggle resembling the Year of the Four Emperors and the Crisis of the Third Century. General Black makes his career fighting under philosopher-emperor Mathias the Glistening, who perishes when his cybernetic implants become infected with the nano-plague. Mathias is succeeded by his sociopathic son, Luke Anthony, whose behavior becomes increasingly erratic over time.In one scene, Mathias reveals that he believes the empire to be totally irredeemable, and has made his son his successor in order to bring about its ruin; a similar motivation is ascribed to Claudius in Robert Graves's Claudius the God when Claudius names Nero his successor, citing Aesop's fable of \\"The Frogs Who Desired a King\\" as his inspiration. Justa relates the excesses of Luke's regime, including his execution of perceived enemies, financial corruption, sexual perversion, etc.Luke's character is based on that of Commodus, though elements of other \\"mad emperors\\" of Rome are interwoven into the story, such as Caligula's self-deification, Elagabalus's changes to the state religion, and Caracalla's granting citizenship to all free men in the Empire to increase the tax rolls. General Black is made governor of Anatolia but is periodically recalled to provide various services to Luke. As a result of personally witnessing the Emperor's madness, General Black becomes more and more disillusioned and his health begins to suffer. Ultimately Luke is murdered and a struggle ensues between various short- reigned barracks emperors. By this time General Black and Justa are stationed on Mars, but when one of Black's political rivals seizes power, kills Black's family on Earth and infects Mars with the metal-eating nanoplague, Black's troops (many of them Boers, who are described as largely nomadic in the twenty-third century) declare him emperor and he leads an invasion force back to Earth. Although victorious in battle, the nanoplague renders the conflict moot as technology will no longer support an empire as large as the Pan- Polarian state, which crumbles into a myriad of ethnic and regional successor states. Ultimately, Justa and her father settle in Amsterdam, which has regained the prominence it enjoyed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and is the center of a prosperous successor state, where Justa marries, has children, and assiduously avoids politics.

Neutralization of the charge of the phosphate linkages by (specific) methylation resulted in methylphosphotriester DNAs with very exclusive (bio)chemical properties.European Patent entitled Poly(deoxyribonucleotides), pharmaceutical compositions, use and preparation of the poly(deoxyribonucleotides) M√ºnchen 09-06-1993, Patent NO. 0358657 The introduction of chirality at phosphorus appeared of importance for intra- and intermolecular dynamics. These modified DNAs mimicked the behavior of natural DNA in the absence of stabilizing factors as salts, proteins, and medium factors. In fact a high site-specific hybridization affinity was obtained with complementary natural DNA. In dependence of the bases, parallel DNA could be synthesized for pyrimidine bases in which the chirality of phosphorus was decisive.Koole, L.H. et al. (1987) \\"A parallel right-handed duplex of the hexamer d(TPTPTPTPTPT) with phosphate triester linkages\\",Journal of the American Chemical Society, Vol. 109, pp. 3916-3921 Phosphate methylation also gave the possibility to synthesize a self-complementary left-handed Z-DNA mini duplex. After a publication in Science about the inhibition of HIV-1 replication had to be retracted, because it was based on flawed research, he accepted early retirement in 1990.Buck, H.M. e.a. (1990) \\"Phosphate-Methylated DNA Aimed at HIV-1 RNA Loops and Integrated DNA Inhibits Viral Infectivity\\", Science, 13 April 1990: Vol. 248. no. 4952, pp. 208 - 212.Moody, H.M. e.a. (1990) \\"Inhibition of HIV-1 Infectivity by Phosphate-Methylated DNA: Retraction\\", Science, Vol. 250, pp. 125-126. (see The Buck-Goudsmit controversy) At home without any academic support he wrote several articles based on quantum chemical calculations focused on the dynamics of organic reactions, electron spin resonance of organophosphorus radicals and the hybridization affinity of methylphosphotriester DNA and RNA. The latter subject is published as review articles in Nucleosides, Nucleotides & Nucleic Acids. In these reviews he gives also a description and explanation of the chemical and corresponding biochemical results of the methylphosphotriester DNA, RNA and related systems. This contribution that is mainly based on the work at Eindhoven also consists of new insights in solid-phase synthesis, B-Z transition, and methyl transfer reactions connected with replicational and transcriptional silencing. Special attention is given to the effect of phosphate shielding on duplex stability. Models based on molecular mechanics calculations and recent density functional ab initio calculations support the impact of phosphate shielding at the various levels of stability of the DNA duplex. =The Buck-Goudsmit controversy= In the mid-80s Henk Buck focused his research on the use of antisense DNA as an inhibitor of virus replication. Paul C. Zamecnik is generally regarded as the founder of this technique,Zamecnik P.C. e.a. (1978) \\"Inhibition of Rous sarcoma virus replication and cell transformation by a specific oligodeoxynucleotide.\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America January;75(1)pp. 280-4 but already in 1971 Paul S. Miller created short phosphate methylated DNA-fragments, and considered the possibility of using this as a means of influencing DNA-replication.Miller P.S. e.a (1971) \\"Syntheses and properties of adenine and thymine nucleoside alkyl phosphotriesters, the neutral analogs of dinucleoside monophosphates.\\" Journal of the American Chemical Society. Vol 93, pp. 6657-65 Bucks research group focused on the use of this phosphate methylated DNA, in particular because of its neutral electrical properties. In several publications the selectivity and duplex forming were reported. The strong growth of HIV-infections in those days, commercial interests and patent rights led to the decision to cooperate with the virologist Jaap Goudsmit of the Academic Medical Center of Amsterdam University. Jaap Goudsmit required longer DNA-strands, though, than the ones Buck was testing so far, so a new synthesis route was developed. Jaap Goudsmit tested the new strands on samples of HIV and reported the inhibition of the virus replication. The results were published in Science on April 13, 1990. On the eve of the publication, the University of Eindhoven made the news public. It resulted in excited media attention in the Netherlands, and under the pressure Buck publicly stated that he assumed that AIDS would be of the past in a couple of years, although it was agreed not to make such claims. Afterwards he explained, he deliberately had said this to raise more funds for his research, although much later he defended himself by saying that he was provoked by the reporter. Doubts raised immediately after the article appeared in Science. The next day, the Leiden University professor Van Boom, expert in the field of DNA synthesis, said in a leading Dutch newspaper, that pure phosphate methylated DNA is very difficult to produce, and easily contaminated. Six days after the publication internal criticism came to the surface. Buck colleague, professor Van Boeckel, also an expert in this field, had already criticized Bucks research a year before, and resigned because his warnings were not taken seriously. Van Boeckel had also been working on synthesis of phosphate methylated DNA, and knew how difficult it was to make such DNA-strands. A year before Bucks downfall, he came to the conclusion that Bucks longer strands could not be pure, because Van Boeckels research- assistant Kuijpers noticed that even a short phosphate methylated DNA wasn't stable.Kuijpers, W.H.A. e.a. (1990) \\"Synthesis of well-defined phosphate- methylated DNA fragments: the application of potassium carbonate in methanol as deprotecting agent\\", Nucleic Acids Research, Vol. 18, pp. 5197-5205 In May 1989 he invited one of Bucks research assistants to test their material on HPLC equipment in the lab of Organon, a Dutch pharmaceutical company. The measurement showed that the test material was not at all pure, but Buck refused to accept this fact. When Van Boeckel showed Buck a draft of the publication of his own research at the end of 1989, it resulted in a confrontation in which the University chose Bucks side. Van Boeckel and Kuijpers were ordered to stop their research, because \\"it was too expensive and not productive\\".Hagendijk (1993) p.401 The doubts and criticism following the publication in Science led to a heated public debate in several Dutch newspapers and science magazines, and the University eventually acknowledged that the purity of the phosphate methylated DNA was still to be investigated. A committee was formed to investigate the proceedings and their conclusion (30 August 1990) was, that no phosphate methylated DNA could be traced. Also the committee reproached Buck for not paying attention to criticism from within his faculty. As a result Buck was dismissed as dean of the faculty. Goudsmit was requested to test the antisense material once again, but his enthusiasm had cooled, and Buck could not produce the pure phosphate methylated DNA in time. The publication in Science therefore had to be retracted. A second investigating committee reported at the end of the year that the presentation of the results in Science bordered on fraud. The report also said that Bucks behaviour in his group was impermissibly harsh at times. The committee concluded that it disqualified him as a research leader. As a result, Buck accepted early retirement. Although Jaap Goudsmit generally was regarded as a victim in the affair, half a year later a journalist of a leading newspaper questioned his role in the d√©b√¢cle. Goudsmit had reported the inhibition of HIV-replication, which was questionable, given the fact that the phosphate methylated DNA was not pure enough. Therefore a third committee investigated the work of Goudsmit and his group as well. The committee concluded that Goudsmit had not checked the quality of Bucks material. Also they saw shortcomings in the interpretation and presentation of the results. The committee concluded that Goudsmits research had been scientifically inadequate. Goudsmit did not go in appeal and could continue his work. Henk Buck never accepted the outcome of this controversy. Up to this day he persists in his opinion that he could produce sufficiently pure phosphate methylated DNA. In several interviews he said that he feels that he has been pilloried for making a sincere mistake. He published two articles in the scientific magazine Nucleosides, Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids Buck, H.M. (2004) \\"The Chemical and Biochemical Properties of Methylphosphotriester DNA\\", Nucleosides, Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids, Vol. 23, pp. 1833 - 1847. Buck, H.M. (2007) \\"The Chemical and Biochemical Properties of Methylphosphotriester DNA and RNA in Comparison with their Corresponding Methylphosphonates. A Dynamic Model Description\\", Nucleosides, Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids, Vol. 26, pp. 205-222. in which he tries to retrace what happened, and he goes as far as to claim that the investigating committees were wrong. To this day, however, nobody produced pure phosphate methylated DNA strands in the quality Goudsmit required. All the efforts from Miller, Van Boeckel and Buck resulted in short instable fragments. Recent researches in this field are based on methyl phosphonate or phosphorothioate DNA. At present (2008) only one antisense medication exists, based on phosphorothioate oligonucleotide: Fomivirsen.

The group's sound ranged from radio- friendly pop to keyboard-driven new wave to pop country. The group members were keyboardist Loyd Boldman, drummer Dave Workman, guitarist Rick Fields and bassist Mike Wilson. Boldman, Workman and Fields would trade off lead vocalist duties depending on the track. Boldman generally handled the rock-oriented tracks, while Workman and Fields split the more pop- and new wave-focused material. Loyd Boldman died in 2014. Career Prodigal‚Äôs self-titled debut album Prodigal was released in 1982. It was named Album of the Year in 1982 by Group magazine (along with Amy Grant‚Äôs Age to Age and Petra‚Äôs More Power to Ya). Electric Eye, the group‚Äôs second album, was published in 1984. It received Best of the Year honors in 1984 from both Contemporary Christian Music magazine (CCM) and Campus Life magazine. A computer program for the Commodore 64 was mastered into a \\"stop-groove\\" at the end of the vinyl record. The short BASIC program shows a static screen containing a lightly paraphrased quotation from Albert Einstein and a Biblical verse (John 14:27). The video for the song, \\"Boxes\\" (written by Workman and directed by Boldman), won the first Gospel Music Association (GMA) Dove Award for music videos (\\"Best Visual Song\\"). The music video for the song \\"Fast Forward\\" was named Video of the Year by the National Federation of Local Cable Programmers (now the Alliance for Community Media). Just Like Real Life was the group's third and last album, appearing in 1985. The Christian Music Archive said \\"This is an excellent album by one of the early new wave/rock hybrid bands of the early to mid-eighties, using equal parts keyboards and rock guitar. Sadly the band didn't get the recognition they so richly deserved, as this was a cut above most Christian albums of the time with instantly memorable songs and lyrics so intelligently written as to be in a class of their own. If they had been a secular band, they would have been early MTV stars. An essential album.\\" Prodigal had success on Christian radio with the songs \\"Invisible Man\\" (from Prodigal), the No. 1 single \\"Scene of the Crime\\" and \\"Emerald City\\" (from Electric Eye) and \\"Jump Cut\\" from Just Like Real Life. The band also created a number of promotional music videos for Electric Eye and Just Like Real Life. The Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music says, \\"Prodigal was in tune with the sounds and spirit of the early ‚Äò80's...while writing songs that expanded the boundaries of the worship and evangelism fare that typified contemporary Christian music at the time.\\" After Prodigal Prodigal disbanded in 1986. Its members went on to various musical and religious activities: Loyd Boldman released a solo album Sleep Without Dreams on Outbound Records in 1988. He created three music videos for the album, including one for the title track which won Best Video from the Florida Motion Picture and Television Association (FMPTA). He later co-founded a creative media firm in Winter Park, Florida. Boldman was part of the worship team at Northland Church in Longwood, Florida, since 1989. Loyd Boldman died in April 2014 after a long illness. Dave Workman is a regional leader for Vineyard USA and served as worship leader and later senior pastor at Vineyard Community Church in Cincinnati, Ohio. Workman was involved in The Healing Center, the church's initiative to help the needy and in a project that drilled wells in Nigeria to provide clean water. He is the author of The Outward-Focused Life: Becoming a Servant in a Serve-Me World. Rick Fields released an album of instrumentals in 1999 titled Finishing School with songwriter Jim Wilson as The Perkolaters. In 2009, The Perkolaters released a pop/rock single titled On Top of the World. Fields has performed with Cincinnati artists including Janet Pressley, Danny Frazier, David Wolfenberger, and Signs Of Life: The Essence Of Pink Floyd. Mike Wilson leads worship at Word of Life Church in Highland Heights, Kentucky.

Popes have encouraged it, while also taking steps to reform some manifestations of it.For example, on March 12, 1969, Pope Paul VI reduced and rearranged the number of Marian feast days in Sanctitas clarior. Several of his predecessors did similarly. The Holy See has insisted on the importance of distinguishing \\"true from false devotion, and authentic doctrine from its deformations by excess or defect\\". There are significantly more titles, feasts, and venerative Marian practices among Roman Catholics than in other Western Christian traditions. The term hyperdulia indicates the special veneration due to Mary, greater than the ordinary dulia for other saints, but utterly unlike the latria due only to God. Belief in the incarnation of God the Son through Mary is the basis for calling her the Mother of God, which was declared a dogma at the Council of Ephesus in 431. At the Second Vatican Council and in Pope John Paul II's encyclical Redemptoris mater, she is spoken of also as Mother of the Church. Growth of Roman Catholic veneration of Mary and Mariology has often come not from official declarations, but from Marian writings of the saints, popular devotion, and at times reported Marian apparitions. The Holy See approves only a select few as worthy of belief, the most recent being the 2008 approval of certain apparitions from 1665. Further pious veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary encouraged by Popes are exhibited in the canonical coronations granted to popular Marian images venerated in a particular locality all over the world, while Marian movements and societies with millions of members have arisen from belief in events such as Guadalupe, Lourdes, F√°tima, Akita, and other reasons. From Christ to Mary in the Roman Catholic tradition In Roman Catholic teachings, the veneration of Mary is a natural consequence of Christology: Jesus and Mary are son and mother, redeemer and redeemed. This sentiment was expressed by Pope John Paul II in his encyclical Redemptoris mater: \\"At the centre of this mystery, in the midst of this wonderment of faith, stands Mary. As the loving Mother of the Redeemer, she was the first to experience it: 'To the wonderment of nature you bore your Creator'!\\" In the Roman Catholic tradition Mariology is seen as Christology developed to its full potential.See Pope Pius XII, Mystici corporis Christi; John Henry Cardinal Newman: Mariology is always christocentric, in Michael Testa, Mary: The Virgin Mary in the Life and Writings of John Henry Newman (2001); and Mariology Is Christology in Vittorio Messori, \\"The Mary Hypothesis\\" (Rome, 2005). Mary is seen as contributing to a fuller understanding of the life of Jesus. In this view, a Christology without Mary is not based on the total revelation of the Bible. Traces of this parallel interpretation go back to the early days of Christianity and numerous saints have since focused on it. The development of this approach continued into the 20th century. In his 1946 publication Compendium Mariologiae, Mariologist Gabriel Roschini explained that Mary not only participated in the birth of the physical Jesus, but, with conception, she entered with him into a spiritual union. The divine salvation plan, being not only material, includes a permanent spiritual unity with Christ. Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) wrote: \\"It is necessary to go back to Mary if we want to return to that 'truth about Jesus Christ,' 'truth about the Church' and 'truth about man' that John Paul II proposed as a program to all of Christianity,\\" in order to ensure an authentic approach to Christology via a return to the \\"whole truth about Mary\\". From veneration to theology It is possible that the practice of invoking the aid of the Mother of Christ had become more familiar to the faithful some time before any expression of it in the writings of the Early Church Fathers. Christians' love for Mary intuited, frequently in anticipation, certain aspects of the mystery of the Blessed Virgin, calling the attention of theologians and pastors to them. Venerative and devotional practices have often preceded formal theological declarations by the Magisterium. The veneration of the Blessed Virgin takes place in various ways. Marian prayers and hymns usually begin with veneration (honor) of her, followed by petitions. The number of Marian titles continued to grow as of the 3rd century, and many titles existed by the 5th century, growing especially during the Middle Ages.Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, Volume 2 by Andr√© Vauchez et al 2001 page 919 =Theological basis for the veneration of Mary= Veneration for Mary is based on the reference in the Gospel of Luke to Mary as the selected handmaid of the Lord who is greeted and praised by both Elizabeth and the angel Gabriel. God's work is further illuminated in the Marian dogmas of the Roman Catholic Church such as the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption, and are, in the Roman Catholic view, part of the apostolic tradition and divine revelation.McNally, Terrence, What Every Catholic Should Know about Mary p. 132B√§umer, 597 Catholics distinguish veneration from worship. =Mary's role in salvation and redemption= The Virgin Mary from the Ghent Altarpiece, 1432 One of the components of the Catholic veneration of Mary is the focus on her participation in the processes of salvation and redemption.Haffner, Paul. The mystery of Mary, 2004 p. 198 This has been explored by such writers as Edward Schillebeeckx and Adrienne von Speyr.Schillebeeckx, Edward. Mary, mother of the redemption, 1964, ASIN B003KW30VG pp. 82‚Äì84Von Speyr, Adrienne, Mary in the Redemption, 2003 pp. 2‚Äì7 John's Gospel records her presence at the beginning and end of his public life. Particularly significant is Mary's presence at the Cross, when she received from her dying Son the charge to be mother to the beloved disciple. Catholics interpret that through the disciple, Christ is giving care of Mary to all Christians. The Acts of the Apostles expressly numbers the Mother of Jesus among the women of the first community awaiting Pentecost. John Eudes wrote that: \\"The Virgin Mary began to cooperate in the plan of salvation, from the moment she gave her consent to the Incarnation of the Son of God\\".Spiritual Theology by Jordan Aumann 1980 pp. 62‚Äì67 Lumen gentium, the 1964 Dogmatic Constitution of the Church recognized, \\"...all the salvific influence of the Blessed Virgin on men originates, not from some inner necessity, but from the divine pleasure. It flows forth from the superabundance of the merits of Christ, rests on His mediation, depends entirely on it and draws all its power from it.\\"Pope Paul VI. Lumen gentium, ¬ß60, 21 November 1964 In a singular way she cooperated by her obedience, faith, hope, and burning charity in the work of the Savior in giving back supernatural life to souls. \\"Wherefore she is our mother in the order of grace.\\" One of the first scholars to offer theological foundations on the subject of the Immaculate Conception was the Franciscan Duns Scotus who developed the concept that Mary was preserved from sin by the redemptive virtue of Jesus.Summa Theologiae: Volume 51, Our Lady: 3a. 27‚Äì30 by Thomas Aquinas, Thomas R. Heath 2006 page 114Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi by Karl Rahner 2004 pages 896‚Äì898 The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3 by Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley 2003 page 407 Devotions to and the veneration of the Virgin Mary continued to spread, as she came to be seen as the helpful mother of Christians, and by the 15th century these practices had oriented many Catholic devotions.Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, Volume 2 by Andr√© Vauchez, Richard Barrie Dobson, Adrian Walford, Michael Lapidge 2001 page 919 Saint Veronica Giuliani expressed how Mary's suffering in Calvary united her heart with that of Jesus as she suffered each torment along with him.Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons by Raymond Burke et al. 2008 pages 372‚Äì373 The joint devotion to the hearts was formalized by Jean Eudes who organized the scriptural and theological foundations and developed its liturgical themes.Arthur Calkins, The Theology of the Alliance of the Two Hearts, Missio Immaculatae (English Edition) Year III, N¬∞ 4 (May to December 2007) The venerative aspects of the united nature of the two hearts continued through the centuries and in 1985 Pope John Paul II coined the term Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary, and in 1986 addressed the international conference on that topic held at F√°tima, Portugal.Proceedings of the International Theological Symposium on the Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary, September 1986, Fatima, Portugal By the 18th century, the continued growth of Marian veneration had emphasized the role of the Virgin Mary in salvation. The Catholic focus on the role of Mary in salvation and redemption continued with Pope John Paul II's 1987 encyclical Redemptoris mater =Mary as the masterwork of God= The Catechism of the Catholic Church, in paragraphs 721-726, claims that Mary is the first dwelling-place of God in salvation history. As such, she is the masterwork of God and the start of God bringing mankind into communion with Jesus. In Mary's womb, Jesus is the manifestation of God's wonders, the fulfillment of God's plan of loving goodness, and the definitive theophany. As such, Mary is typified by the burning bush in the Book of Exodus and by wisdom in the Book of Proverbs.CCC 721-726 =Mary as protectress and intercessor= The Virgin of Mercy protecting a group of nuns under her mantle. Sano di Pietro, 15th century. It was through Mary's intercession, through compassion for the hosts, at the marriage feast of Cana, that Jesus worked his first miracle. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states: \\"From the most ancient times the Blessed Virgin has been honored with the title of 'Mother of God,' to whose protection the faithful fly in all their dangers and needs.\\" The Eastern Catholic Churches observe the feast of the Intercession of the Theotokos in October. Roman Catholic views of the Virgin Mary as refuge and advocate of sinners, protector from dangers and powerful intercessor with her Son, Jesus are expressed in prayers, artistic depictions, theology, and popular and devotional writings, as well as in the use of religious articles and images.Bunson, Matthew. Our Sunday Visitor's Catholic Almanac, 2009 p. 122Laughlin, Corinna and Lee, Sara McGinnis. The Catholic Handbook for Visiting the Sick and Homebound2010 p. 4 The earliest known prayer to Mary, the Sub tuum praesidium, (\\"Under your protection\\") dates from about the 3rd century. The artistic depictions of the Virgin of Mercy portray the role of Mary as the protector of Christians, as she shelters them under her mantle. The Virgin of Mercy depictions sometimes include arrows raining from above, with the Virgin's cloak protecting the people.Hall, James. 1983, A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art page 222 Catholics have continued to seek the protection of Mary as the Mother of Sorrows and relied on her intercession as the Queen of Heaven since the Middle Ages.Campbell, James P., Mary and the Saints: Companions on the Journey, 2001 pp. 41‚Äì45 Building on that sentiment, popes have entrusted specific causes to the protection of the Virgin Mary. Pope Benedict XV entrusted the protection of the world through the intercession of Mary Queen of Peace during the First World War .Sri, Edward P., and Hahn, Scott. Queen Mother: A Biblical Theology of Mary's Queenship, 2005 p. 13 The Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy, also known as the order of Our Lady of Ransom or Order of Captives began in the 13th century in the Kingdom of Aragon (Spain) to ransom captive Christians (slaves) held in Muslim hands. The order now focuses on the role of the Virgin Mary as the protector of captives and prisoners.by Joseph, Chandlery Peter. Mary's Praise on Every Tongue: A Record of Homage Paid to Our Blessed Lady, 2009 p. 181 The depictions of Our Lady of Navigators arose from the prayers and devotions of Portuguese navigators, who saw the Virgin Mary as their protector during storms and other hazards. Prayers to Our Lady of Navigators are well known in South America, specially Brazil, where its February 2 feast is an official holiday.Goucher, Candice Lee. 2007 World history: journeys from past to present p. 102del Rio, Vicente.

Emiliano Zapata 1995 p. 68 In 1979 ceremony Pope John Paul II placed Mexico under the protection of the Virgin of Guadalupe.Norman, Edward R., The Roman Catholic Church: an illustrated history ISBN p. 127 The prayer, the Memorare begins: \\"Remember O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to Thy protection, implored Thy help or sought Thy intercession, was left unaided.\\"Foster, David. Catholic Prayerbook: From Downside Abbey, (2001), p. 153. Saint Louis de Montfort taught that God appointed Mary as \\"the dispenser of grace\\", and to receive grace from God, one can receive it through the hands of the Blessed Virgin, as a child receives from a mother. Lumen gentium states: \\"This, however, is to be so understood that it neither takes away from nor adds anything to the dignity and efficaciousness of Christ the one Mediator.\\" Pope Francis has said that her \\"entire life was contained in her song of praise\\" of the greatness of the Lord. Francis goes on to confide that at Marian shrines he likes to > spend time looking at the Blessed Mother and letting her look at me. I pray > for a childlike trust, the trust of the poor and simple who know that their > mother is there, and that they have a place in her heart. And in looking at > her, to hear once more, like the Indian Juan Diego: ‚ÄúMy youngest son, what > is the matter? Do not let it disturb your heart. Am I not here, I who have > the honour to be your mother?\\" =Development of Marian doctrines= The theological development of devotion to Mary begins with Justin Martyr (100‚Äì165) who articulated Mary‚Äôs role in salvation history as the Second Eve.Spivey Ellington, Donna. review of Mother of God: A History of the Virgin Mary, Reviews in History, (review no. 820) This was followed up by Iren√¶us, whom Herbert Thurston calls \\"the first theologian of the Virgin Mother\\". The Church's magisterium has identified four teachings about Mary as dogmas of faith. These include belief in her virginal conception of Jesus, taught by the First Council of Nicaea in 325. The Council of Ephesus in 431 applied to her the description \\"Mother of God\\", (Theotokos). The perpetual virginity of Mary was taught by the ecumenical Second Council of Constantinople in 553, which described her as \\"ever virgin\\", and was expressed also, by the Lateran synod of October 649,Denzinger, 256 (old numbering), 503 (new numbering) The doctrine of the Immaculate Conception states that from the first moment of her existence Mary was without original sin.Holweck, Frederick. \\"Immaculate Conception.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 4 April 2016 This doctrine was proclaimed a dogma ex cathedra by Pope Pius IX in 1854. The dogma of the Assumption of Mary, defined by Pope Pius XII in 1950, states that, at the end of her earthly life, her body did not suffer corruption but was assumed into heaven and became a heavenly body, =Liturgical aspects= In the first three centuries the emphasis was on the veneration of martyrs, as a continuation of the yearly celebrations of their death, e.g. as noted in the early Christian text on the Martyrdom of Polycarp.A brief history of saints by Lawrence Cunningham 2005 pages 16‚Äì19 In the Eastern traditions Mariology developed through liturgical veneration within the framework of the feasts relative to the Incarnation.Samaha, John M., \\"Mary in Byzantine Liturgy\\", The Homiletic & Pastoral Review, 1999 In the early part of the 3rd century, Hippolytus of Rome recorded the first liturgical reference to the Virgin Mary, as part of the ordination rite of a bishop. Marian feasts appeared in the 4th century, and the feast of the \\"Memory of Mary, Mother of God\\" was celebrated on August 15 in Jerusalem by the year 350.Adolf Adam, Liturgie, 1985, p.291 The Roman Catholic liturgy is one of the most important elements of Marian devotions. Many Marian feasts are superior to the feast days of the saints. The liturgical texts of the Marian feast days all link Mary to Jesus Christ. History =Early veneration= Earliest fresco of the Virgin Mary, Catacomb of Priscilla, 2nd century.Vladimir Lossky, 1982 The Meaning of Icons page 173 Mary, as the mother of Jesus, is documented in Roman catacombs: paintings from the first half of the 2nd century show her holding the Christ Child. Excavations in the crypt of St Peter's Basilica uncovered a very early fresco of Mary together with Saint Peter.M Guarducci Maria nelle epigrafi paleocristiane di Roma 1963, 248 The Roman Priscilla catacombs depict the oldest Marian paintings from the middle of the 2nd century:I Daoust, Marie dans les catacombes, 1983 Mary is shown with Jesus on her lap; they are next to a man in a tunic, his left hand holding a book and his right hand pointing to a star over his head, the latter being an Old Testament symbol of messiahs and/or the Messiah. These catacombs also have a depiction of the Annunciation. The Edict of Milan (AD 313) allowed Christians to worship openly. This new freedom also permitted literary development of the veneration of Mary, Hippolytus of Rome being an early example.B√§umer 520 Saint Ambrose, who lived in Rome before going to Milan as its bishop, venerated Mary as an example of Christian life and is credited with starting a Marian cult of virginity in the 4th century.A new history of ecclesiastical writers, Volumes 1‚Äì2' by Louis Ellies Du Pin et al 2010 page 212 Marian veneration was theologically sanctioned with the adoption of the title Theotokos at the Council of Ephesus in 431. The earliest known churches dedicated to Mary were built shortly after that date, among these the Church of the Seat of Mary (Kathisma) near Mar Elias Monastery, between Jerusalem and Bethlehem. The first Marian churches in Rome date from the 5th and 6th centuries: Santa Maria in Trastevere, Santa Maria Antiqua and Santa Maria Maggiore. However, the very earliest church dedicated to the Virgin Mary still dates to the late 4th century in Syria, where an inscription dedicating it to the Theotokos (Mother of God) was found among the ruins.Butler's lives of the saints, Volume 1 by Alban Butler, David Hugh Farmer, Paul Burns 2000 p. 3 =Growth of Marian culture= Santa Maria Maggiore, the first Marian church in Rome, originally built between 430 and 440.Rome by Yvonne Labande-Mailfert et al, 1961 ASIN: B0007E741C page 115 In the early Middle Ages, veneration of Mary was particularly expressed in monasteries, especially those of the Benedictines. Chants such as Ave Maris Stella and the Salve Regina emerged and became staples of monastic plainsong.Osborne, John L. \\"Early Medieval Painting in San Clemente, Rome: The Madonna and Child in the Niche\\" Gesta 20.2 (1981:299‚Äì310) and (note 9) referencing T. Klauser, Rom under der Kult des Gottesmutter Maria, Jahrbuch f√ºr der Antike und Christentum 15 (1972:120‚Äì135). In the 8th century, The Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary developed from the monks' practice of praying the Canonical hours. The Carolingians encouraged Marian piety by the celebration of Marian feast days and the dedication of churches in her honor. Devotional practices grew in number. The Romanesque period saw the construction of major Marian churches, such as Speyer Cathedral (also known as the Mariendom) in Speyer, Germany, and Our Lady of Flanders Cathedral in Tournai, Belgium. From the year 1000 onward more and more churches, including many of Europe's greatest cathedrals were dedicated to Mary. Gothic cathedrals, such as Notre Dame de Paris as well as Our Lady of Chartres near Paris, were major masterworks of the time. Construction of Santa Maria Assunta Cathedral in Siena, Italy and Notre-Dame Cathedral, Luxembourg increased the number of churches devoted to the Virgin Mary. The 12th and 13th centuries saw an extraordinary growth of the cult of the Virgin in Western Europe, inspired in part by the writings of theologians such as Bernard of Clairvaux. The movement found its grandest expression in the French cathedrals, often dedicated to ‚ÄúOur Lady\\", such as Notre-Dame de Paris and Notre-Dame de Bayeux among others. Walsingham and other places of Marian pilgrimage developed large popular followings. At the height of the pilgrimage movement in the 11th and 12th centuries, hundreds of people were traveling almost constantly from one Marian shrine to the next.Renaissance and Reformation by William Roscoe Estep 1986 , page 7. By the 14th century, Mary had become greatly popular as a compassionate intercessor and protector of humanity, and during the great plagues (such as the Black Death) her help was sought against the just judgment of God.Daily life during the Black Death by Joseph Patrick Byrne 2006 , page 86. The Renaissance witnessed a dramatic growth in venerative Marian art.Mary in Western art by Timothy Verdon, Filippo Rossi 2005 , page 203. By the 16th century, the Protestant Reformation had introduced a tide against Marian venerations in Europe.Renaissance and Reformation by William Roscoe Estep 1986 pages 140‚Äì144 However, at the same time new Marian devotions were starting in Latin America based on Saint Juan Diego's 1531 reported vision of Our Lady of Guadalupe. The ensuing Marian pilgrimages have continued to date and the Marian Basilica on Tepeyac Hill remains the most visited Catholic shrine in the world. In the 17th and 18th centuries writings by the saints, coupled with papal encouragements, increased the growth of Marian devotions, and gave rise to the definition and declaration of new Marian doctrines.The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3 by Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley 2003 pages 406‚Äì409 Marian culture continues to develop within the Catholic Church. In 1974, after 4 years of preparation, Pope Paul VI issued the Apostolic Letter Marialis Cultus. In this document, (which was subtitled For the Right Ordering and Development of Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary) Paul VI not only discussed the history of Marian devotions but also overviewed their rationale and provided suggestions for their future direction, their theological and pastoral value. He called for \\"preventing any tendency (as has happened at times in certain forms of popular piety) to separate devotion to the Blessed Virgin from its necessary point of reference-Christ\\"(MC, 4). This followed the turn of events at the Second Vatican Council, which followed a century of increased emphasis on devotion to Mary. The Council document Sacrosanctum Concilium, sought to give guidance on the place of devotions in Christian piety: It decreed that \\"Devotions should be so drawn up that they harmonize with the liturgical seasons, accord with the sacred liturgy, are in some fashion derived from it, and lead the people to it, since, in fact, the liturgy by its very nature far surpasses any of them\\" (SC, 13). Catholic saints and veneration of Mary Roman Catholic devotions have relied on the writings of numerous saints throughout history who have attested to the central role of Mary in God's plan of salvation.Butler, Alban Lives of the saints, Volume 1 2007 p. 429 Early saints included Irenaeus of Lyons in the 2nd century who was perhaps the earliest of the Church Fathers to write systematically about the Virgin Mary, and he set out a forthright account of her role in the economy of salvation.Osborn, Eric Francis. Irenaeus of Lyons 2001 p. 112Tertullian, De Carne Christi 17Ambrose of Milan (339‚Äì397) based the veneration of Mary not only on her virginity but also on her extraordinary courage.Neumann, Charles William. The Virgin Mary in the works of Saint Ambrose, 1962 ASIN: B0007J9CX0 p. 264Ambrose, CSEL 32, 505, and De inst. Virginum 49 In the Middle Ages, Bernhard of Clairvaux highlighted her virginity and humility as the basis for her veneration.Sch√§fer, Peter. Mirror of His beauty, 2002 p. 157Schmaus, Michael. Mariologie, Katholische Dogmatik, M√ºnchen Vol V, 1955207 p. 207 A particularly significant contribution to Mariology came from John Duns Scotus who in the 13th century defended the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.Wolter, Allan B. and O'Neill, Blane. John Duns Scotus: Mary's Architect, Franciscan Press, Illinois, 1983, p.1 Scotus identified the key theological foundations which led to the declaration of the dogma of Immaculate Conception centuries later. In the 16th century, Saint Ignatius of Loyola instructed the Jesuits to preserve Madonna della Strada, which was later enshrined in the Church of the Gesu in Rome.Waldrop, Gregory. \\"Object of Devotion: The story of a dramatic restoration\\". America, October 2010 Filippo Neri, a contemporary of Ignatius, is credited with the innovation of daily Marian devotions during the month of May.Venturoli, A., S. Filippo Neri, Roma, 1988, p. 117 In his classic book The Glories of Mary, Alphonsus Liguori explained how God gave Mary to mankind as the \\"Gate of Heaven\\", quoting Saint Bonaventure, \\"No one can enter Heaven unless by Mary, as though through a door.\\"Liguori, Alphonsus. The Glories of Mary, Liguori Publications, 1868, p. 623 Louis de Montfort's book True Devotion to Mary synthesized many of the writings of earlier saints. His approach of \\"total consecration to Jesus Christ through Mary\\" had a strong impact on Marian devotion both in popular piety and in the spirituality of religious institutes. Feast days The earliest Christian feasts that relate to Mary grew out of the cycle of feasts that celebrated the Nativity of Jesus. By the 7th century a feast dedicated to Mary was celebrated just before Christmas in the churches of Milan and Ravenna in Italy.The Cult of the Virgin Mary in Anglo-Saxon England by Mary Clayton 2003 pages 26‚Äì37 Over time, the number of feasts (and the associated titles of Mary) and the venerative practices that accompany them increased and today the Catholic Church has more Marian feasts, titles, and venerative practices than any other Christian body. Marian feasts have continued to be developed in the Catholic Church, e.g. the feast of the Queenship of Mary was declared in the 1954 in the papal encyclical Ad Caeli Reginam by pope Pius XII. A Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary procession during October in Bergamo, Italy Catherine of Siena, adopted the custom of dedicating Saturday to Mary. The month of October was established as the \\"month of the Rosary\\" by Pope Leo XIII, who recommended daily Rosary devotions in October.The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 4 by Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley 2005 page 575 During the month of May, May devotions to the Blessed Virgin Mary take place in many Catholic regions. These may include the singing of Marian anthems, crowning of statues of Mary with floral wreaths, readings from scriptures, a sermon, and or presentation by local choirs.Maiden and Mother: Prayers, Hymns, Devotions, and Songs to the Beloved Beloved Virgin Mary Throughout the Year by M. M. Miles, Margaret R. Miles 2001 pageHandbook of Prayers by James Soc√≠as 2006 page 483 The month is also associated with reflection on the Virgin Mary's role as the ideal disciple who sheds light on the Christian way of life, and theologian Karl Rahner stated: \\"When we are involved in our May Devotions, we are engaged in a Christian understanding of the human situation.\\"Truly Our Sister: A Theology of Mary in the Communion of Saints by Elizabeth A. Johnson 2006 page 97 Feast of Our Lady of Andacollo procession in Chile, 1838 The Roman Catholic Church celebrates three Marian solemnities which are also holy days of obligation in many countries during the liturgical year (in liturgical order): * December 8 Feast of the Immaculate Conception * January 1 Mary, Mother of God * August 15 The Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Among the other prominent Marian feast days and memorials in the General Roman Calendar of the Catholic Church are: * December 12 Our Lady of Guadalupe * February 11 Our Lady of Lourdes * May 13 Our Lady of F√°tima * May 31 Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary * Immaculate Heart of Mary (Saturday after Sacred Heart of Jesus) * August 22 Queenship of Mary * September 8 Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Titles The Blessed Virgin Mary depicted as mother, holding the Child Jesus. Archdiocesan Museum, Wroc≈Çaw. A large number of titles to honor Mary or ask for her intercession are used by Roman Catholics.Encyclopedia of Catholicism by Frank K. Flinn, J. Gordon Melton 2007 pages 443‚Äì444 While Mater Dei (i.e. \\"Mother of God\\" as confirmed by the First Council of Ephesus, 431) is common in Latin, a large number of other titles have been used by Roman Catholics ‚Äì far more than any other Christians.The Christian theology reader by Alister E. McGrath 2006 page 273 Titles used to refer to the Virgin Mary throughout history, at times reflect the changing attitudes towards her. Domina (lady), Regina (queen) and Stella Maris (star of the sea) are some of the early titles of Mary, of which Regina is the earliest. Domina and Sella Maris are found in Jerome who perhaps originated the etymology of Mary as Stella Maris in the 5th century. While the early emphasis in Stella Maris was on Mary as the Star that bore Christ, by the 9th century, the attention had focused on Mary herself, as indicated in the hymn Ave Maris Stella. By the 11th century, Mary herself had emerged as the star that acted as a guiding light.The Cult of the Virgin Mary in Anglo- Saxon England by Mary Clayton 2003 pages 249‚Äì252 By the 13th century, as Mariology was growing, Saint Anthony of Padua had composed Mary Our Queen.The greatest Marian prayers: their history, meaning, and usage by Anthony M. Buono 1999 page 124 Titles continue to be interpreted, e.g. Queen of Heaven was further elaborated in 1954 in the papal encyclical Ad Caeli Reginam by pope Pius XII. Among the most prominent Roman Catholic Marian titles are:Legends of the Madonna by Anna Jameson 2009 1406853380 page 50 * Mary, Mother of God * Mary, the Immaculate Conception * Mary, Queen of Heaven * Queen of the Angels * Queen of Peace * Star of the Sea (Stella Maris) * Mother of All Sorrows Music =Antiphons= The Liturgy of the Hours includes several offices to be sung, including Compline. At the close of this office, one of four Marian antiphons is sung. These songs, Alma redemptoris mater, Ave Regina caelorum, Regina caeli, and Salve Regina, have been described as \\"among the most beautiful creations of the late Middle Ages\\".Willi Apel, Gregorian Chant 1958 p. 404.Music In Western Civilisation by Craig M. Wright, Bryan R. Simm 2005 page 137 One of the earliest Marian compositions is the popular Salve Regina in Latin from a Benedictine monk, which exists in several Gregorian versions. Hermann of Reichenau (July 18, 1013 ‚Äì September 24, 1054), composed the Alma redemptoris mater and hymns to Mary became part of daily life at monasteries such as the Benedictine Abbey of Cluny in France.:The Tradition of Catholic Prayer by Christian Raab, Harry Hagan 2007 page 234 While the date of the composition of Ave Regina caelorum is uncertain, conjecture that it antedates the fourth century seems to be without any warrant of external or internal evidence. It is found in the St. Alban's Book of the twelfth century.Henry, Hugh. \\"Ave Regina.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 11 October 2016 The Regina Caeli has been traced back to the twelfth century.Henry, Hugh. \\"Regina Coeli (Queen of Heaven).\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12.

Over the centuries, Marian master pieces have continued to appear, e.g. Mozart's Coronation Mass.Catholic Music Through the Ages by Edward Schaefer 2008 page 100 The list of compositions by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina includes numerous Marian masses: Salve Regina, Alma Redemptoris, Assumpta est Maria, Regina caeli, de beata Virgine, Ave Regina caelorum, Descendit Angelus Domini, and O Virgo simul et Mater.Harvard dictionary of music by Willi Apel 1944 pages 29 and 66 Joseph Haydn wrote several Marian compositions including two famous Marian Masses.Missa in honorem Beatissimae Virginis Mariae, No. 5 in E flat major, also known as the Grosse Orgelmesse (Great Organ Mass) (H. 22/4) (1766) and Missa Cellensis in honorem Beatissimae Virginis Mariae No. 3 in C major, (H. 22/5) (1766‚Äì73) Marian hymns include O Mary, we Crown Thee With Blossoms Today, Hail Queen of Heaven, the Regina Caeli, and the Ave Maria.Geoghegan.

Some of the best poetry written in honor of the Blessed virgin comes from this period of the Middle Ages.Maiden and Mother: Prayers, Hymns, Devotions, and Songs to the Beloved Virgin Mary Throughout the Year by Margaret R. Miles 2001 pages vii‚Äìx \\"Because of Mary's singular cooperation with the action of the Holy Spirit, the Church loves to pray in communion with the Virgin Mary, to magnify with her the great things the Lord has done for her, and to entrust supplications and praises to her. The earliest known Marian prayer is the Sub tuum praesidium, or Beneath Thy Protection, a text for which was rediscovered in 1917 on a papyrus in Egypt dated to c. 250.Burke, Raymond L.; et al. (2008). Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons page 178Mary for evangelicals by Tim S. Perry, William J. Abraham 2006 page 142 The papyrus contains the prayer in Greek and is the earliest known reference to the title Theotokos (confirmed by the Council of Ephesus in 431):The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3 by Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley 2003 page 406 > Beneath your compassion, We take refuge, O Mother of God: do not despise our > petitions in time of trouble: but rescue us from dangers, only pure, only > blessed one. The Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary probably originated as a monastic devotion around the middle of the eighth century.Toke, Leslie. \\"Little Office of Our Lady.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 1 October 2012 It is a variation of the Common of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Liturgy of the Hours (Divine Office). It may have originally been put together to be prayed in connection with the Votive Masses of Our Lady on Saturday, which were written by Alcuin, the liturgical master of Charlemagne‚Äôs court. The Little Office did not come into general use before the tenth century. During the 11th century, as the number of monasteries grew, so did Marian prayers. There is little or no trace of the Hail Mary as an accepted devotional formula before about 1050. All the evidence suggests that it took its rise from certain versicles and responsories occurring in the Little Office or Cursus of the Blessed Virgin which just at that time was coming into favour among the monastic orders. Two Anglo-Saxon manuscripts at the British Museum, one of which may be as old as the year 1030, show that the words \\"Ave Maria\\" etc. and \\"benedicta tu in mulieribus et benedictus fructus ventris tui\\" occurred in almost every part of the Cursus, and though it is not clear that these clauses were at first joined together so as to make one prayer, there is conclusive evidence that this had come to pass only a very little later.Thurston, Herbert. \\"The Hail Mary\\" The Month, Nov., 1901, pp. 486-8 As regards the addition of the word \\"Jesus,\\" it is commonly said that this was due to the initiative of Pope Urban IV (1261) although the evidence does not seem sufficiently clear to warrant positive statement on the point. This was the prayer as known to Thomas Aquinas when he gave a Lenten sermon on the \\"Salutation of the Blessed Virgin\\" in 1273.Thomas Aquinas. The Three Greatest Prayers, (Laurence Shapcote, trans.) Burns, Oates & Washburn, Ltd. (London 1937) By the fourteenth century it was not uncommon to conclude with an appeal for sinners and especially for help at the hour of death. Official recognition of the Ave Maria in its complete form was finally given in the Roman Breviary of 1568. The Angelus, 1857-1859, Jean-Fran√ßois Millet Three Hail Marys is a traditional Roman Catholic devotional practice of reciting three Hail Marys as a petition for purity and other virtues. The practice of saying three Hail Marys in the evening somewhere about sunset had become general throughout Europe in the first half of the fourteenth century and it was recommended by Pope John XXII in 1318. The practice was observed by Franciscans and eventually developed into the Angelus prayer. The Angelus is a prayer commemorating the Incarnation. It originated with the 11th-century monastic custom of reciting three Hail Marys during the evening, or Compline bell. It was traditionally recited in Roman Catholic churches, convents, and monasteries three times daily: 6:00 am, noon, and 6:00 pm and is usually accompanied by the ringing of the Angelus bell, which is a call to prayer.Thurston, Herbert. \\"Angelus.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 13 October 2016 In the 12th century Bernard of Clairvaux gave sermons (De duodecim stellis), from which an extract has been taken by the Roman Catholic Church and used in the Offices of the Compassion and of the Seven Dolours. Saint Bernard wrote: \\"Take away Mary, this star of the sea, the sea truly great and wide: what is left but enveloping darkness and the shadow of death and the densest blackness?\\" There are pious meditations on the Ave Maria and the Salve Regina, usually attributed either to St. Anselm of Lucca (d. 1080) or St. Bernard; and also in the large book \\"De laudibus B. Mariae Virginis\\" (Douai, 1625) by Richard de Saint-Laurent. Other famous Marian prayers include the Magnificat, and the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The mostly anonymous Middle English Lyrics of the Later Middle Ages show passionate forms of personal worship, known as affective devotion. The lyrics, reflecting the theology, depict Mary as not just the woman but also the ideal that all humanity should strive for. Mary‚Äôs humility is one of the qualities highlighted by in the Middle English Lyrics. The lyric ‚ÄúGabriel, from heven√´ king/ sent to the maid√´ swet√´‚Äù is an excellent example of Mary‚Äôs humility. The lyric‚Äôs author builds upon this theme throughout the lyric. The second stanza ‚ÄúMild√´liche him gan answere/ The midl√´ maiden thann√´.\\" The theme of humity is fully developed in the third stanza; > When the maiden understood/ And th‚Äôangles word√´s herd√´,/ Mild√´liche with > mild√´ mod/ To th‚Äôangel she answerd√´:/ ‚ÄòOur Lord√´s thew-maiden i-wis/ Ich am, > that her-aboven is./ Anent√´s me/ Fulforth√´d be/ Thy, saw√´;/ That Ich, sithe > His wil is,/ Maiden, withouten law√´,/ Of moder have the blis.

Devotions Rosary and scapular The term \\"devotions\\" is commonly understood to refer to those external practices of piety by which the faith of an individual finds expression. Such prayers or acts may be accompanied by specific requests for Mary's intercession with God.Marmion, Columba. Christ, the Ideal of the Priest, 2006 p. 332Burke, Raymond L.; et al. (2008). Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons pages 667-679 Devotion to the Virgin Mary does not, however, amount to worship ‚Äì which is reserved for God. A wide range of Marian devotions are followed by Catholics ranging from simple Rosary recitations to formalized, multi-day Novenas to activities which do not involve any prayers, such the wearing of scapulars or maintaining a Mary garden.Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices pages 11 and 341 Two well known Marian devotions are the Rosary recitation and the wearing of the Brown Scapular. Following their joint growth in the 18th and 19th centuries, by the early 20th century the Rosary and the devotional Scapular had gained such a strong following among Catholics worldwide that the Catholic Encyclopedia of 1914 stated: \\"Like the Rosary, the Brown Scapular has become the badge of the devout Catholic.\\" In his encyclical Rosarium Virginis Mariae Pope John Paul II emphasized the importance of the Rosary. The Mariological basis of the Scapular devotion is effectively the same as Marian consecration, as discussed in the dogmatic constitution Lumen gentium of the Second Vatican Council, namely the role of the Virgin Mary as \\"the mother to us in the order of grace\\" which allows her to intercede for \\"the gift of eternal salvation\\".Vatican website: Lumen gentium No 61 and No 62 The same Council decree clarified that the many ways in which Mary can encourage and assist us \\"neither takes away from nor adds anything to the dignity and efficaciousness of Christ the one Mediator.\\"Lumen gentium 62 Roman Catholic tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as Acts of Reparation to the Virgin Mary for insults that she suffers. The Raccolta Roman Catholic prayer book (approved by a Decree of 1854, and published by the Holy See in 1898) includes a number of such prayers. These prayers do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to repair the sins of others against the Virgin Mary.Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices Joseph P. Christopher et al., 2003 The Raccolta St Athanasius Press =Consecration and entrustment to Mary= For centuries, Marian devotions among Roman Catholics have included many examples of personal or collective acts of consecration and entrustment to the Virgin Mary; the Latin terms oblatio, servitus, commendatio, and dedicatio were used in this context. Consecration is an act by which a person is dedicated to a sacred service, or an act which separates an object, location or region from a common and profane mode to one for sacred use.Mary's Immaculate Heart by John F. Murphy 2007 pages 96‚Äì103 The Catholic Church makes it clear that \\"...the faithful should be carefully instructed about the practice of consecration to the Blessed Virgin Mary...it is, in reality, only analogously a 'consecration to God,' and should be expressed in a correct liturgical manner: to the Father, through Christ in the Holy Spirit, imploring the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, to whom we entrust ourselves completely, so as to keep our baptismal commitments and live as her children.\\" Individuals declaring their \\"entrustment\\" to Mary seek her intercession before God through her son Jesus Christ, for she herself has no divine power. In Catholic teachings, consecration to Mary does not diminish or substitute the love of God, but enhances it, for all consecration is ultimately made to God.The Catholicism Answer Book by John Trigilio, Kenneth Brighenti 2007 page 325 In modern times, Pope John Paul II clarified consecration to Mary in his 1987 encyclical, Redemptoris mater, in which he stated, \\"Mary's motherhood...is a gift which Christ himself makes personally to every individual.\\" Catholic view of Marian apparitions Many Marian apparition have been reported by believers, including Our Lady of Lourdes, Our Lady of Guadalupe, and Our Lady of Fatima.Michael Freze, 1993, Voices, Visions, and Apparitions, OSV Publishing pages 257‚Äì265Short Biography of Padre Pio http://www.padrepiodevotions.org/index.asp?pagename=biography The book Mother Maria Pierina by Maria Rigamonti http://www.cenacle.co.uk/products.asp?partno=B0532 In some cases (e.g. Saint Padre Pio or Sister Maria Pierina De Micheli) these have involved visions of Jesus and Mary and sometimes include a spoken element. The official position of the Holy See is that while the Holy Office has approved a few apparitions of the Virgin Mary, Roman Catholics at large are not required to believe them. However, many Catholics express belief in Marian apparitions.Habits of Devotion by James M. O'Toole 2005 page 121 This has included popes, e.g. four popes, i.e. Pope Pius XII, Pope John XXIII, Pope Paul VI, and Pope John Paul II have supported the Our Lady of F√°tima apparition as supernatural. Pope John Paul II was particularly attached to F√°tima and credited Our Lady of F√°tima with saving his life after he was shot in Rome on the Feast Day of Our Lady of F√°tima in May 1981. He donated the bullet that wounded him on that day to the Roman Catholic sanctuary at F√°tima Portugal.McNally, Terrence, What Every Catholic Should Know about Mary page 166 As a historical pattern, Vatican approval seems to have followed general acceptance of a vision by well over a century in most cases. According to Father Salvatore M. Perrella of the Mariunum Pontifical Institute in Rome, of the 295 reported apparitions studied by the Holy See through the centuries only 12 have been approved, the latest being in May 2008.Vatican News on Benoite Rencurel http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/avantgo/new.php?n=12546 Catholic News on Benoite Rencurel http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=27848 Veneration through Marian art The Glorification of the Virgin ( 1490‚Äì1495) by Geertgen tot Sint Jans The tradition of honoring Mary by venerating images of her goes back to 3rd-century Christianity.Catholic Customs and Traditions: A Popular Guide by Greg Dues 1993 page 126. Also, the Roman Pontifical assumes that Marian images were venerated in the time of Empress Saint Helena in the late third century. Following the period of iconoclasm, the position of the Church with respect to the veneration of images was formalized at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787. A summary of the doctrine is included in the current Catechism of the Catholic Church. > The Christian veneration of images is not contrary to the first commandment > which proscribes idols. Indeed, \\"the honour rendered to an image passes to > its prototype,\\" and \\"whoever venerates an image venerates the person > portrayed in it.\\" The honour paid to sacred images is a \\"respectful > veneration,\\" not the adoration due to God alone: Religious worship is not > directed to images in themselves, considered as mere things, but under their > distinctive aspect as images leading us on to God Incarnate. The movement > toward the image does not terminate in it as image, but tends towards that > whose image it is. No other image (in either the Western or the Eastern Church) permeates Christian art as much as the image of Madonna and Child.The Celebration of Faith: The Virgin Mary by Alexander Schmemann 2001 page 11 The images of the Virgin Mary have become central icons of Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodox Christianity where Mary remains a central artistic topic.Merriam- Webster's encyclopedia of world religions by Wendy Doniger, 1999 page 696 Byzantine images of the Theotokos were adopted in the West, where Byzantine models became widely distributed in by the 7th century. The Virgin Mary has been one of the major subjects of Christian Art, Catholic Art and Western Art since Early Christian art and she has been very widely portrayed in iconic \\"portraits\\", often known as Madonnas, with the infant Jesus in the Madonna and Child, and in a number of narrative scenes from her life known as the Life of the Virgin, as well as scenes illustrating particular doctrines or beliefs: from masters such as Michelangelo, Raphael, Murillo and Botticelli to folk art.Grieving with Mary: Finding Comfort and Healing in Devotion to the Mother of God by Mary K. Doyle 2009 page 42Mary in Western art by Timothy Verdon, Filippo Rossi 2005 page 11 Some Marian art subjects include: * Annunciation * Adoration of the Magi * Adoration of the shepherds * The Assumption in Art * Coronation of the Virgin * Christ taking leave of his mother * Immaculate Conception * Piet√† Marian art enjoys a significant level of diversity, e.g. with distinct styles of statues of the Virgin Mary present on different continents (as depicted in the galleries in Roman Catholic Marian art). These depictions are not restricted to European art, and also appear in South American paintings.The Virgin, saints, and angels: South American paintings 1600‚Äì1825 by Suzanne L. Stratton-Pruitt 2006 pages 34 The South American tradition of Marian veneration through art dates back to the 16th century, with the Virgin of Copacabana gaining fame in 1582.Donahue-Wallace, Kelly (2008). Art and Architecture of Viceregal Latin America, 1521‚Äì1821. Di√°logos (Albuquerque, N.M.). Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press. p. 143. Marian movements and societies Throughout the centuries the devotion to and the veneration of the Virgin Mary by Roman Catholics has both led to, and been influenced by a number of Roman Catholic Marian Movements and Societies. These societies form part of the fabric of Roman Catholic Mariology.Early modern confraternities in Europe and the Americas by Christopher F. Black, Pamela Gravestock 2006 page 11 As early as the 16th century, the Holy See endorsed the Sodality of Our Lady and Pope Gregory XIII issued a Papal Bull commending it and granting it indulgences and establishing it as the mother sodality, and other sodalities were formed thereafter.The Sodality of Our Lady: historical sketches by P.J. Kenedy & sons, 1916 ISBN page 37History of the sodalities of the blessed virgin Mary by Louis Delplace 1884 page 211Maiden and Mother: Prayers, Hymns, Devotions, and Songs to the Beloved Virgin Mary Throughout the Year by Margaret M. Miles 2001 page 125 The 18th and 19th centuries saw a number of missionary Marian organizations such as Company of Mary, the Marianists, the Marist Fathers, and the Marist Brothers. Some of these missionaries, e.g. Saint Peter Chanel, were martyred as they travelled to new lands. The 20th century witnessed the formation of Marian organizations with millions of members, e.g. the Legion of Mary and Blue Army of Our Lady of Fatima.Joan Carroll Cruz, Saintly Men of Modern Times (2003) pages 117‚Äì118Thomas McGonigle, 1996, A History of the Christian Tradition Paulist Press page 222A pilgrim's handbook to Fatima by Leo Madigan 2001 page 207Catholic Dictionary by Peter M. J. Stravinskas 2002 page 141 Marian shrines and patronages Our Lady of Aparecida, Brazil, the largest church in the Americas.Religions of the World by J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann 2003 pages 308-309 Pe√±afrancia Basilica Minore in Naga City, Philippines In the Roman Catholic Church a shrine is a church or sacred place which receives many faithful pilgrims for a specific pious reason. The local ordinary must approve the shrine.New commentary on the Code of Canon Law by John P. Beal, James A. Coriden, Thomas J. Green 2002 page 1437 (Canon 1230) Marian shrines account for major veneration centers and pilgrimage sites for Roman Catholics. According to Bishop Francesco Giogia, at the end of the 20th century, the most visited Catholic shrine in the world was that of the Virgin of Guadalupe in Mexico City. In third place was Our Lady of Aparecida in Brazil, with the non- Marian shrine of San Giovanni Rotondo in second place. The visual effect of Marian pilgrimages can be dramatic, e.g. on May 13 and October 13 of each year close to one million Catholic pilgrims walk the country road that leads to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of F√°tima.Trudy Ring, 1996, International Dictionary of Historic Places, page 245 Around 2 million pilgrims journey up Tepeyac hill on December 12 each year to visit the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe.Pilgrimage: from the Ganges to Graceland : an encyclopedia, Volume 1 by Linda Kay Davidson, David Martin Gitlitz 2002 page 213 While in 1968 Aparecida had about four million pilgrims,Brazil rediscovered by Roberta C. Wigder 1977 page 235 the number has since reached eight million pilgrims per year.Pilgrimage: from the Ganges to Graceland : an encyclopedia, Volume 1 by Linda Kay Davidson, David Martin Gitlitz 2002 page 38 Major Marian shrines include: * The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in Lourdes, France * The Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City, Mexico * The Sanctuary of Our Lady of F√°tima in F√°tima, Portugal * The Basilica of Our Lady of Good Health in Vailankanni, India * The Basilica of the Our Lady of Pe√±afrancia in Naga City, Philippines * The Basilica of the Holy House in Loreto, Italy * The Shrine of Black Madonna of Czƒôstochowa in Czƒôstochowa, Poland * The Basilica of Our Lady, Queen of Ireland in Knock, Ireland * The Basilica of Our Lady of Ta' Pinu in Gozo, Malta. There are other Marian pilgrimage sites such as Medjugorje, which is not considered a shrine by the Holy See, but yet receives a large number of pilgrims every year. The number of pilgrims who visit some of the approved shrines every year can be significant. E.g. Lourdes with a population of around 15,000 people, receives about 5,000,000 pilgrims every year.Sacred worlds: an introduction to geography and religion by Chris C. Park 1994 page 283 In 1881 a French priest, Julien Gouyet, led by the visions of Jesus and Mary of the Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich (Klemens Brentano, 1852) discovered the House of the Virgin Mary near Ephesus in Turkey.The Ancient Traditions of the Virgin Mary's Dormition and Assumption by Stephen J. Shoemaker 2006 page 76Chronicle of the living Christ: the life and ministry of Jesus Christ by Robert A. Powell 1996 page 12 A number of countries, cities, and professions consider the Blessed Virgin their patron saint. For a list, see Patronage of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Cultural adaptations Echoing the Byzantine depiction of Christ Pantocrator, the Eastern Church portrayed Mary as the regal Queen of Heaven. As this theme spread to the West, prayers such as the Regina caeli, Ave Regina caelorum, and Salve Regina were composed. An example of the cultural adaptation of perspective include the view of the Virgin Mary as a mother with humility (rather than a heavenly queen) as the Franciscans began to preach in China, and its similarity to the local Chinese motherly and merciful figure of Kuanyin, which was much admired in south China.Lauren Arnold, 1999 Princely Gifts & Papal Treasures: The Franciscan Mission to China by page 151Lauren Arnold in Atlantic Monthly, September 2007The great encounter of China and the West by David E.

The clothing of the Virgin of Guadalupe image has been identified as that of an Aztec princess.Mujer del maiz by Angel Vigil 1994 pages 16‚Äì19Empire of the Aztecs by Barbara A.

Like other areas of finance, intangible asset finance is concerned with the interdependence of value, risk, and time.  Basic principles  In 2003, one estimate put the economic equilibrium of intangible assets in the U.S. economy at $5 trillion, which represented over one-third or more of the value of U.S. domestic corporations in the first quarter of 2001.\\"A Trillion Dollars A Year In Intangible Investment,\\" Leonard Nakamura in Intangible Assets: Values, Measures and Risks at 28, Hand & Lev, Oxford University Press (2003). One of the goals of people working in this field is to unlock the \\"hidden value\\" found in intangible assets through the techniques of finance. Another goal is to measure how firm performance correlates with intangible asset management. Intangible assets include business processes, Intellectual Property (IP) such as patents, trademarks, reputations for ethics and integrity, quality, safety, sustainability, security, and resilience. Today, these intangibles drive cash flow and are the primary sources of risk. Intangible asset information, management, risk forecasting and risk transfer are growing services as the economic base divests itself of physical assets. Rights to tangible and intangible assets are intangible, and can be traded globally.Gio Wiederhold; Valuing intangible Capital, Multinationals and Taxhavens; Springer Verlag, 2013.  Business models  A number of intangible asset business models have evolved over the years. *Patent Licensing & Enforcement Companies (\\"P-LECs\\"): These are firms that acquire patents for the sole purpose of securing licenses and/or damages awards from infringing parties. Perhaps the most famous P-LEC is NTP, Inc., which has successfully asserted patents related to email push technology. Another name for a P-LEC is \\"patent troll,\\" although this is viewed as a pejorative reference. Recently, hedge funds have raised capital for the specific purpose of investing in patent litigation. One such hedge fund is Altitude Capital Partners, which is based in New York City. *Royalty stream securitizers: These are firms that are engaged in the buying and selling of what are essentially specialized asset- backed securities. The assets that are securitized are typically intellectual properties, such as patents, that have been bearing royalties for a period of time. Royalty Pharma is a well known firm that uses this business model, and which has done by far the largest and most high-profile deals in this space.\\"A seller's market,\\" The Deal, September 5, 2008 Royalty Pharma handled what many consider to be the first pharmaceutical patent-backed securitization to be rated by Standard and Poors, which involved a patent on the HIV drug Zerit.\\"Avoiding Transaction Peril,\\" Heller et al., in From Ideas to Assets: Investing Wisely in Intellectual Property at 487, Bruce Berman, John Wiley & Sons, 2002 The other parties involved in the Zerit transaction were Yale (the owner of the patent) and Bristol Myers Squibb. *Reinsurers: These are firms that use the techniques of reinsurance to mitigate intangible asset risks. In the same way that some firms issue cat bonds to mitigate the risks associated with extreme weather, earthquakes, or other natural disasters, firms exposed to substantial intangible risk can issue \\"intangible asset risk-linked securities\\" that transfer intangible risk to hedge funds and other players in the capital markets with a sufficient appetite for risk. Steel City Re, which is based in Pittsburgh, is a thought leader regarding the use of risk transfer techniques to protect and recover intangible asset value. *Market makers: Firms that are working to provide more liquidity to the market for intellectual property. Early market makers offered on-line intellectual property exchanges where buyers and sellers could exchange rights in licensed intellectual property, usually patents. On April 22, 2008, Ocean Tomo reportedOcean Tomo Press Release April 22, 2008 that it had transacted approximately $70 million in its IP auctions across Europe and the United States. In 2009, The Intellectual Property Exchange International (IPXI), headquartered in Chicago, will begin operations as the world's first stock exchange with an intellectual property focus. *Investment Research Firms: Companies that provide specific advice to investors on intellectual property issues. Recently, hedge fund managers have been hiring patent attorneys to follow and handicap outcomes in high-stakes patent cases.  Significant transactions  *1997: David Bowie securitizes the future royalty revenues earned from his pre-1990 music catalogue by issuing Bowie Bonds. *2000: BioPharma Royalty Trust completes the $115 million securitization of a single Yale patent with claims covering Stavudine, which is a reverse transcriptase inhibitor and the active ingredient in the drug Zerit. This was the first publicly rated patent securitization in the U.S. At the time of the deal, Bristol Myers Squibb had the exclusive rights to distribute Zerit in the U.S. Not long after closing slow sales of Zerit along with an accounting scandal at Bristol Myers Squibb triggered the accelerated and premature amortization of the transaction. Many observers believe that this deal was ultimately unsuccessful because of a lack of diversification as it involved a single patent and a single licensee. *2005: UCC Capital Corporation securitization of BCBG Max Azria's royalty receivables generated from worldwide intellectual property rights worth $53 million. This transaction is recognized as the first \\"whole company securitization\\" involving primarily intangible assets. UCC Capital Corporation was founded by Robert W. D'Loren, and was acquired by NexCen Brands, Inc. in 2006. NexCen sold substantially all of its assets to Levine Leichtman Capital Partners in 2010.NexCen Press Release, May 13, 2010 *2005: Ocean Tomo holds its first live IP auction. Although proceeds from the first auction were unremarkable, the relative success of the Ocean Tomo auctions that followed showed that the live auction is a reasonably viable business model for monetizing intellectual property. *2006: Marvel Entertainment's film rights securitization in conjunction with Ambac Financial Group to provide a triple-A financial guarantee on a credit facility for Marvel backed by a slate of 10 films to be produced by Marvel Studios and intellectual property related to some of Marvel's most popular comic book characters.  Government, societies, think tanks, and other non-profits  On June 23, 2008, the United States National Academies hosted a one-day conference in Washington, D.C. entitled \\"Intangible Assets: Measuring and Enhancing Their Contribution to Corporate Value and Economic Growth.\\" The Intangible Asset Finance Society provides a forum for finance, innovation, legal and management professionals to discover better ways to create, capture and preserve the value of intangible assets. The Athena Alliance is a non- profit organization dedicated to public education and research on the emerging global information economy. On April 16, 2008 it published a widely circulated working paper on the topic of intangible asset finance.

The alluvial valley lies just northwest of Death Valley and borders the southeast, and central- northeast flank of the massif of the White Mountains of California. The valley's southern end lies in eastern Inyo County, California. The valley is sparsely populated with ranchers and indigenous Paiute. Business services are located in the valley's only town, Dyer. Description Fish Lake Valley is a slightly southwest-northeast trending valley, in its northern and central section. It borders the White Mountains on the southwest and receives water from Cottonwood Creek and other small, permanent mountain streams. The extension of the mountains southeasterly provides a feeder valley with some small dry lakes and salt pans. The major section of the valley contains a borax mixed salt pan for 10 mi of the valley. State Historical Marker No. 133. A small dry lake is in the center, approximately 1.5 mi long. It is fed from the White Mountains, and the small subvalley southeastwards. Alluvial fans are west of the dry lake, with Nevada State Route 264 in the hills to the northwest that also feed southeast and eastwards. To the east and southeast, the Silver Peak Range borders the valley with no alluvial fans, and is the smaller massif probably block faulted from the White Mountains, and thru block faulting creating the smaller feeder valley on the White Mountains' southeast, (the Furnace Creek Fault Zone). The center-north of the valley has very narrow fans, and broken salt flats, that end at the valley's central dry lake. Lower elevation hills and peaks at the north of the Silver Peak Range are the east and northeast border. Coaldale, Nevada on east-west U.S. Route 6 in Nevada is located at the northern border of the Fish Lake Valley. Route access Nevada State Route 264 enters the valley's center west at the foothills of the White Mountains and at Dyer turns southeast at the feeder valley and foothills of the mountains; its terminus point is Oasis, Mono County, California. Nevada State Route 773 intercepts Route 264 in the hills on the Fish Lake Valley northwest border. U.S. Route 6 at Coaldale, Nevada is in the hills adjacent the valley's north border.

Located on the Arendal Line, it is served by the Go-Ahead Norge. The station opened as the terminus of the Grimstad Line in 1907; the following year it became a transfer station to the Arendal Line. It then received a station building designed by Paul Armin Due. In 1935 and 1936, the lines were converted from narrow gauge to standard gauge, although for a year the station served as a break-of-gauge station. The Grimstad Line closed in 1961 and in 1983 the station was unmanned. Facilities and service Located at above mean sea level, the station is from Arendal Station and was from Grimstad Station, and from Oslo Central Station. The station is owned by the Norwegian National Rail Administration; it has parking for 15 cars, is unmanned and lacks a ticket machine. The station is served by the Norwegian State Railway's feeder service on the Arendal Line with up to five daily services per direction. Travel time to Arendal is 10 minutes while travel time to Nelaug is 25 minutes. History The station opened on 14 September 1907 as the terminus of the private Grimstad‚ÄìFroland Line (GFB) which ran to Grimstad. The station was from the opening owned by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB), who were in the process of building the Arendal‚Äì√Ömli Line. GFB therefore had to pay rent to NSB until 1912, when NSB took over the Grimstad Line. Originally, the station consisted of temporary platform, a roundhouse, a turntable with a diameter and a coal shed.Bjerke & Tov√•s (1989): 139 NSB built a station building designed by Paul Armin Due. It was of the Flikkeid-type, as it was a duplicate of Flikkeid Station on the Flekkefjord Line and was the same as was built at Froland Station on the Arendal Line. It was in Art Nouveau style with a goods room built as an extension. The outhouse was the same type as had been built at Flikkeid and at Urdland Station and has three places and a wood storage. Also the water tower was the same type as at Flikkeid. The station also received a guard residence and a small shed. The line from Treungen came from the north-west, while the lines from Arendal and Grimstad game from the south- east, with the Grimstad Line south of the Arendal Line. Track 1 had a side platform which it shared with the station building, while Track 2 and 3 had a shared island platform. Eastwards, Track 1 was only connected to the Arendal Line, while Track 3 and 4 was only connected to the Grimstad Line. All four were connected towards Treungen. Rise was originally a transfer station between the Arendal Line and the Grimstad Line. Trains were normally coordinated so there would be a train to Arendal at Track 1, a train to Treungen at Track 2 and a train to Grimstad at Track 3.Bjerke & Tov√•s (1989): 141 The Arendal Line was converted to standard gauge in 1935, and Rise Station temporarily became a station on the S√∏rland Line from 9 November.Bjerke & Tov√•s (1989): 64 This caused a break-of-gauge at Rise, causing transshipment of all passengers and freight. This caused a break-of-gauge at Rise, causing transshipment of all passengers and freight.Bjerke & Tov√•s (1989): 66 In 1936, the Grimstad Line was converted to standard gauge and the turntable replaced with one with a diameter. The last train to run on the Grimstad Line was on 31 August 1961.Bjerke & Tov√•s (1989): 90 The passenger service was replaced by bus; the service from Grimstad to Rykene was extended to Rise, where there was transfer with the train.Bjerke & Tov√•s (1989): 92 Later, the bus service was moved to transfer to the Grimstad bus was made in Arendal. Demolition of the line started on 19 September and lasted until 21 November, when all but the last from Rise Station had been removed. The level crossing east of the station was subsequently replaced with an overpass.Bjerke & Tov√•s (1989): 93 As the roundtable was no longer needed, it was removed, although the pit remains. Scheduled train remained at Rise until 1979. From 1 November 1983, the station was unmanned. In 1985, the guard house and outhouse were sold. The line took electric traction into use on 15 June 1995. From 20 October, the service was terminated on the Arendal Line and the Bratsberg Line. NSB had a large shortage of motormen, and chose to close operations on the lines with least traffic to allocate sufficient personnel to areas with higher ridership. Traffic resumed on 24 June 2001.

His main scholarly interest was Muslim theology, which led him to the study of the One Thousand and One Nights, as he believed that the Nights stories reflected the Muslim popular piety. MacDonald was the second Western scholar to investigate the manuscripts of the Nights, after Hermann Zotenberg, and he began to publish his results in 1908. The Arabic MSS of Ali Baba he discovered at the Bodleian Library was later found to be counterfeited. But he did successfully prove that the ‚ÄòTunisian MSS‚Äô which Maximilian Habicht claimed to find and use for his Breslau Nights edition was a fake. MacDonald planned to prepare a critical edition of the only extensively surviving medieval manuscript of the Nights, the three-volume Galland Manuscript. However, nothing came out of it, and this critical edition was produced by Muhsin Mahdi (with reference to MacDonald's notes) only in 1984. MacDonald also did important work on Arab magic and superstition, and Muslim-Christian relations. The Macdonald Center for the Study of Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations at the Hartford Theological Seminary is named after him.

The Roman Rite of the Latin or Western Church of the Catholic Church is the most widely celebrated of the scores of Catholic liturgical rites. The titles of some of these books contain the adjective \\"Roman\\", e.g. the \\"Roman Missal\\", to distinguish them from the liturgical books for the other rites of the Church, . Classification These liturgical books have been classified as seven: the Missal, the Pontifical, the Liturgy of the Hours (in earlier editions called the Breviary), the Ritual, the Martyrology, the Gradual, and the Antiphonary.Virginia Tech Multimedia Music Dictionary: Liturgical books Another sevenfold list indicates, instead of the last two, the C√¶remoniale Episcoporum, and the Memoriale Rituum.Catholic Encyclopedia (1910): Liturgical Books In reality, the number is not fixed. Some names, such as the Ritual and the Pontifical, refer not to a single volume but to a collection of books that fit within the same category.ICEL: Liturgical books Official liturgical books that appear in neither of the above lists also exist, such as the Lectionary and the Evangeliary or Gospel Book. The 28 March 2001 Fifth Instruction for the Right Implementation of the Constitution on the Liturgy of the Second Vatican Council listed several more.Fifth Instruction, section 110 Liturgical books exist also for rare occasions, such as the Order of Rites for the Conclave and the Order of the Rites for the Beginning of the Petrine Ministry of the Bishop of Rome, issued in 2005. Other liturgical books that no longer exist today, were in use in the past, such as the Epistolary and the Sacramentary (in the proper sense of this word). The catalogue of the illuminated manuscripts of the British Library indicates how varied were the classes of liturgical books for the celebration of Mass and the Liturgy of the Hours. To avoid confusion between different ways of naming and classifying liturgical books, the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions has drawn up a List of Uniform Titles for Liturgical Works of the Latin Rites of the Catholic Church The Caeremoniale Episcoporum, though listed above as a liturgical book, has also been described as \\"not a liturgical book in the proper sense, since it is not used in liturgical celebrations\\".Rita Thiron, Preparing Parish Liturgies: A Guide to Resources (Liturgical Press, 2004 , ), p. 122 The contents of the liturgical books vary over the centuries. The prayers and rubrics are modified, new rites are added to the books, others are dropped, sometimes long after they have fallen into disuse. For instance the Roman Pontifical continued to have until the Second Vatican Council a ceremony for the first shaving of a cleric's beard. Earliest Christian liturgical books In early Christianity (until perhaps the fourth century) there were no books except the Bible, from which lessons were read and psalms were sung. Nothing in the liturgy was written, because nothing was fixed. Even after certain forms had become so stereotyped as to make already what we should call a more or less fixed liturgy, it does not seem that there was at first any idea that they should be written down. Habit and memory made the celebrant repeat more or less the same forms each Sunday; the people answered his prayers with the accustomed acclamations and responses - all without books. Adrian Fortescue, in his article on liturgical books in the 1910 Catholic Encyclopedia, quotes one writer who argued that there were liturgical books back to the time of the Apostolic Fathers, and another who claimed that there were no liturgical books even by the end of the fourth century. He himself concludes that they were certainly in existence by the fourth century. Earliest Roman liturgical books In the Roman Rite the first complete books known are the Sacramentaries. A Sacramentary is not the same thing as a Missal. It is the book for the priest celebrating Mass. It contains all and only the prayers that he says. At that time he did not repeat at the altar the parts that were chanted by the ministers or choir, as became the custom in the period of the Tridentine Mass Thus Sacramentaries contain no Readings, Introits, Graduals, Communion Antiphons and the like, but only the Collects, the Eucharistic Prayer with its Prefaces, all that is strictly the priest's part at Mass. On the other hand, they provide for occasions other than Mass, with prayers for use at ordinations and at the consecration of a church and altar, and many exorcisms, blessings, and consecrations that were later inserted in the Roman Pontifical and the Roman Ritual. Many Sacramentaries now extant are more or less fragmentary, and do not contain all of these elements. Another name for the Sacramentary (in Latin Sacramentarium) was Liber Sacramentorum (Book of Sacraments), but \\"Sacrament\\" in this case means the Mass. At the same time as the Sacramentaries, books for the readers and choir were being arranged. Gradually the Comes or Liber Comicus, a book that indicated the texts of the Bible to be read developed into the Evangelarium (Gospel Book) and Lectionarium (Lectionary). The homilies of Fathers to be read were collected in Homilaria, the Acts of the martyrs, read on their feasts, in Martyrologia. The book of Psalms was written separately for singing, then arranged in the order in which the psalms were sung in the Psalterium (Psalter). The parts of the Mass sung by the choir (Introit, Gradual, Offertory, Communion) were arranged in the Liber Antiphonarius or Gradualis (Antiphonary or Gradual), while the Antiphons and Responsories in the Office formed the Liber Responsalis (Responsory Book) or Antiphonarius Officii (Antiphonary of the Office), as distinct from the Antiphonarius Missae (Antiphonary of the Mass). Hymns (in our sense) were introduced into the Roman Rite about the fifth or sixth century. Those of the Mass were written in the Gradual, those of the Divine Office at first in the Psalter or Antiphonary. But there were also separate collections of hymns, called Hymnaria, and Libri Sequentiales or Troponarii containing the sequences and additions (farcing) to the Kyrie and Gloria, etc. Other services, the Sacraments (Baptism, Confirmation, Penance, Marriage, Extreme Unction), the Visitation of the Sick, the Burial Service, all manner of blessings, were written in a very loose collection of little books, predecessors of the Roman Ritual, called by such names as Liber Agendorum, Agenda, Manuale, Benedictionale, Pastorale, Sacerdotale, Rituale. Finally there remained the rubrics, the directions not about what to say but what to do. This matter would be one of the latest to be written down. Long after the more or less complicated prayers had to be written and read, tradition would still be a sufficient guide for the actions. The books of prayers (Sacramentaries, Antiphonaries, etc.) contained a few words of direction for the most important and salient things to be done - elementary rubrics. For instance the Gregorian Sacramentary tells priests (as distinct from bishops) not to say the Gloria except on Easter Day; the celebrant chants the preface excelsa voce (in a loud voice), and so on. In time, however, the growing elaborateness of the papal functions, the more complicated ceremonial of the Roman Court, made it necessary to draw up rules of what custom and etiquette demanded. These rules are contained in the \\"Ordines\\" - precursors of the C√¶remoniale Episcoporum. The first of them was probably drawn up about the year 770 in the reign of Pope Stephen III (768-72), but is founded on a similar \\"Ordo\\" of the time of Pope Gregory I (590-604). The \\"Ordines\\" contain no prayers, except that, where necessary, the first words are given to indicate what is meant. They supplement the Sacramentary and choir-books with careful directions about the ritual.  Middle Ages  During the Middle Ages these books were rearranged for greater convenience. The custom of Low Mass changed the Sacramentary into a Missal. At Low Mass the celebrant had to supplement personally what was normally chanted by the deacon and subdeacon or sung by the choir. This then reacted upon High Mass, so that here too the celebrant began to say himself in a low voice what was sung by some one else. For this purpose he needed texts that were not in the old Sacramentary. That book was therefore enlarged by the addition of Readings (Epistle and Gospel, etc.) and the chants of the choir (Introit, Gradual, etc.). So it becomes a Missale plenarium, containing all the text of the Mass. Isolated cases of such Missals occur as early as the sixth century. By about the twelfth century they have completely replaced the old Sacramentaries. But Lectionaries and Graduals (with the music) are still written for the readers and choir. In the same way, but rather later, compilations are made of the various books used for saying the Divine Office. Here too the same motive was at work. The Office was meant to be sung in choir. But there were isolated priests, small country churches without a choir, that could not afford the library of books required for saying it. For their convenience compendiums were made since the eleventh century. Pope Gregory VII (1073‚Äì85) issued a compendium of this kind that became very popular. First we hear of Libri nocturnales or matutinales, containing all the lessons and responses for Matins. To these are added later the antiphons and psalms, then the collects and all that is wanted for the other canonical hours too. At the same time epitomes are made for people who recite the Office without the chant. In these the Psalter is often left out; the clergy are supposed to know it by heart. The antiphons, versicles, responsories, even the lessons are indicated only by their first words. The whole is really a kind of concise index to the Office, but sufficient for people who said it day after day and almost knew it by heart. Such little books are called by various names ‚Äì Epitomata, Portiforia, and then especially Breviaria divini officii (Abbreviations of the Divine Office). They were used mostly by priests on journeys. The parts of these Breviaries were filled up eventually so as to leave nothing to memory, but the convenient arrangement and the name have been kept. It is curious that the word Breviary, which originally meant only a handy epitome for use on journeys and such occasions, came to be the usual name for the Divine Office itself. A priest \\"said his breviary\\" that is, recited the canonical hours. The development of the other books took place in much the same way. The Missals now contained only the Mass and a few morning services intimately connected with it. Daily Mass was the custom for every priest; there was no object in including all the rites used only by a bishop in each Missal. So these rites apart formed the Pontifical. The other non- Eucharistic elements of the old Sacramentary combined with the Libri Agendarum to form the later Ritual.  Council of Trent and after  The Council of Trent (1545‚Äì63) considered the question of uniformity in the liturgical books and appointed a commission to examine the question. But the commission found the work of unifying so many and so varied books impossible at the time, and so left it to be done gradually by the popes. The reformed Breviary was promulgated by Pope Pius V with the Apostolic Constitution Quod a nobis of 9 July 1568, and the Roman Missal soon afterward, with the Apostolic Constitution Quo primum of 14 July 1570. The Roman Martyrology was produced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1584. The Roman Pontifical appeared in 1596. The Caeremoniale Episcoporum was issued by Pope Clement VIII in 1600. The Roman Ritual was published in 1614. All the books have been constantly revised and re-edited with additions and revisions down to our own time, and more information may be found in the articles dedicated to the individual books.

In 1808, following Napoleon's invasion of Spain, the criollos of Santo Domingo revolted against French rule and their struggle culminated in 1809 with a return to the Spanish colonial rule for a period commonly termed Espa√±a Boba. Battle of Palo Hincado The first battle took place in Palo Hincado on November 7, 1808, when Gen. Juan S√°nchez Ram√≠rez, leading an army of local and Puerto Rican soldiers, attacked by surprise a garrison of the French Army under the command of Governor Marie-Louis Ferrand, who committed suicide later after. Gen. Joseph-David de Barquier heard the news and garrisoned 2000 soldiers in Santo Domingo. Battle for Santo Domingo The Siege of Santo Domingo of 1808 was the second and final major battle and was fought between November 7, 1808 and July 11, 1809 at Santo Domingo, Colony of Santo Domingo. A force of Dominican and Puerto-Rican of 1850 troops led by Gen. Juan S√°nchez Ram√≠rez, with a naval blockade by British Commander Hugh Lyle Carmichael, besieged and captured the city of Santo Domingo after an 8 months siege of the 2000 troops of the French Army led by Gen. Barquier. British involvement British Major General Hugh Lyle Carmichael departed Jamaica with the 2nd West Indian, 54th, 55th, and Royal Irish regiments to aid Britain‚Äôs new found Spanish allies in reducing the isolated French garrison besieged in south-eastern Hispaniola. His convoy was escorted by Capt. William Price Cumby‚Äôs HMS Polyphemus, Aurora, Tweed, Sparrow, Thrush, Griffin, , , , and . Carmichael disembarked at Palenque ( west of Santo Domingo) on 28 June, hastening ahead of his army to confer with his Spanish counterpart‚Äî General Juan S√°nchez Ram√≠rez, commander of a Puerto Rican regiment and numerous local guerrillas‚Äîwho for the past eight months had been investing the 1,200-man French garrison commanded by Brig. Gen. Joseph-David de Barquier. Despite 400 of the 600 Spanish regulars being sick, they advanced on 30 June at Carmichael‚Äôs behest to seize San Carlos Church on the outskirts of the capital and cut off communication between Santo Domingo and Fort San Jer√≥nimo west, while simultaneously securing a beach for Cumby‚Äôs supporting squadron. The demoralized French defenders had already requested an armistice and been rebuffed, repeating the suggestion on 1 July as the first British troops arrived overland (hampered by torrential rains). As negotiations progressed Carmichael maintained pressure by installing heavy siege batteries around the city and massing his forces for an assault. French surrender On 6 July the capitulation was finalized, de Barquier pointedly surrendering to the British rather than to the Spaniards. The next day British troops occupied the city and Fort San Jer√≥nimo, the French defenders being transported directly to Port Royal, Jamaica without loss of life on either side.

In June‚ÄìJuly 1987, Valtellina witnessed an exceptionally high rainfall accompanied with rapid glacier melting due to relatively high altitude of the 0 degree isotherm. As a result, the Val Pola Creek significantly eroded its valley flanks, including the area of debris accumulation of post-glacial landslides. This resulted in a fracture which detached an estimated volume 35‚Äì45 million cubic metres of old debris from the Northern slope of the Mount Zandila (Eastern side of Pizzo Coppetto \\"Vatellina 2007\\", a civil protection national exercise ) first detected on July 25. On July 26 evacuations of local villages started. The fracture eventually produced a rapid rock avalanche with subsequent shallow landslides of the Val Pola sides and a debris flow along the Val Pola thalweg. The flow entrained estimated 5‚Äì8 million cubic meters of debris. The created alluvial fan dammed the Adda River and created a lake. The mass ran about 1.5 km downstream and generated an upstream mud wave 35m high which traveled about 2.7 km. Twenty-two people were killed by the main landslide, which created a huge wave in the temporary lake caused by a previous, smaller landslide. \\"Val Pola Rock avalanche of July 28, 1987\\" The landslide resulted in 35 m deepening of the Val Pola canyon. The debris from the Val Pola rock avalanche and landslide impounded on the Adda River creating a lake with 6 million cubic meters of water.

Efforts to mitigate the threat included evacuation of about 25,000 people downstream, works to stabilize the debris tongue to prevent spill-over with subsequent dam breach, and works to drain the lake in controllable manner.Costa, J.

The site is in the present-day Dominican Republic, on the island of Hispaniola in the Caribbean. The battle was fought on November 7, 1808, at Palo Hincado savanna, near El Seibo in the colony of Santo Domingo. A force of 1,800 Spanish Dominican troops, led by General Juan S√°nchez Ram√≠rez, defeated a force of 500 troops of French Army of Napoleon, led by Governor General Marie-Louis Ferrand. Preparations In 1808 General Ram√≠rez was the commander in the east of Hispaniola, while Ciriaco Ram√≠rez and Crist√≥bal Huber Franco were the commanders in the south and Capt. Diego Polanco was the commander of Santiago de los Caballeros and the Cibao/North region. The \\"Milicias Espa√±olas\\" (Spanish Army) was under the command of Capt Tom√°s Ram√≠rez Carvajal. They were backed by the Spanish Royal Governor of colonial Puerto Rico, General Toribio Montes. Ram√≠rez sent a letter via a Spanish ship anchored in Samana on September 17 to Governor Montes. On November 28 the Spanish schooner \\"Monserrate\\" arrived in Puerto Rico from Macao with the news that the supply aid requested by Ram√≠rez would soon reach Montes. With this encouragement General Ram√≠rez redoubled efforts‚Äîwhile French Governor General Ferrand was preparing to quell the impending rebellion. It was easy for Ram√≠rez take possession of the town of El Seibo on Oct. 26, 1808. Won by the fervor of the Reconquista, as some Haitian French forces were serving in the Napoleonic Wars in eastern France. With their positions quickly forming, twenty nine soldiers, including General Ram√≠rez, reached the port at the mouth of the river at Boca de Yuma to receive the military aid sent from Puerto Rico by Governor Montes. The war materials had been shipped in a brig and a schooner‚Äîand consisted of a gunboat, four rifles with bayonets, a hundred sabers, and corresponding ammunition. In addition, two hundred volunteers arrived, mostly Creole emigrants. The brig, named \\"Frederick\\", and the schooner, named \\"Render\\", then left the Port of Higuey to return to Puerto Rico. At that time General Ram√≠rez received the news that Governor General Ferrand was directed towards El Seibo with a respectable force, and determined to master the revolt. The timing was bad for the revolutionaries. He urged taking the French garrison at Saman√° (Sabana de la Mar) for making a stronghold, because without the possession of this port the Reconquista forces could fail. Then General Ram√≠rez noted the presence of their British allies' warships off the Santo Domingo coast, and contacted Commander Dashwood of the British frigate La Franchise. Dashwood agreed to take charge of attacking the French garrison at Saman√°. He also said the Spanish leader could count on the cooperation of the Commander of Arms for Saman√°, Diego de Lira, committed to the Reconquista cause. Of those who landed in Boca de Yuma/Port of Higuey from Puerto Rico, the only true military leader among them was Lieutenant Francisco Diaz. He joined the forces of General Ram√≠rez. As one of the few reconquistadores that had knowledge of war tactics, Ram√≠rez was entrusted to direct the transfer of weapons and baggage to El Seibo from the port. Then Diaz was in charge of organizing the conflict's meeting site, the enlistment of weapons, and choosing the most advantageous position to wait out the approaching enemy. After a study of the whole area, Diaz chose the site of Magar√≠n. On the morning of November 3 Lieutenant Diaz began organizing and distributing arms and ammunition to his forces at the Port of Higuey in Boca de Yuma. Very early the troops gathered in front of the Shrine of Our Lady of Altagracia and heard mass. After the ceremony they received the news that Governor Ferrand and the French were very close to El Seibo. General Ram√≠rez gave the order to march westward to meet the enemy. November 5 dawned on Lieutenant Diaz in El Seibo. Here he continued organizing and incorporating the new volunteers into his Spanish 'makeshift army.' The preparation and distribution of arms and ammunition was also in charge of Lieutenant Diaz. That night General Ram√≠rez had \\"a terrible vision of French Governor General Ferrand's emissary\\", who it was announced that the battle would go overwhelmingly in favor of the French in El Seibo on the 7th. Through Ferrand's envisioned emissary, Ramirez 'replied,' letting him know his forces were prepared to measure their strength against the French. \\"To the emissary of Napoleon's forces these intentions sounded like a bluff, and the envisioned Ferrand could not help but smile.\\" The weapons and tactical superiority of the French forces looked to easily beat the Spanish, who were untrained and poorly armed. Ferrand ignored the real warnings that Ram√≠rez's forces were not to be underestimated, especially in their deft handling of the knife, and happily prepared to give battle. Battle of Palo Hincado On November 6 General Ram√≠rez and the troops moved up to the strategic position of Magar√≠n, well chosen by Lieutenant D√≠az. Here a temporary hut held the few tough firearms and ammunition at their disposal. The site at Palo Hincado savanna was half a league west of the town of El Seibo. General Ram√≠rez issued orders to wait for the enemy advance. Lieutenant D√≠az resolved to take on preparatory measures himself on the night of November 6, before the morning date announced by Governor General Ferrand for French entry into El Seibo. The rain did not stop during the night, with adverse consequences. In the early morning of November 7 it cleared however. General Ram√≠rez and Lieutenant D√≠az provided guns with dry amunicionar ammunition and bayonets, for the foot and horsemen troops. They were all reconquistadores ready \\"to fight with fury and rage Napoleon's infesting the 'Prime of the Indies' for the infamy of the Spanish Crown.\\" The reconquistadores reached Palo Hincado between nine and ten o'clock. Lieutenant Francisco D√≠az was in position at the top of the savanna, in front of the nearly three hundred soldiers carrying rifles. Located in the center of his army, on the eminence above, General Ram√≠rez distributing orders to his troops. He placed on his right Manuel Carvajal, and his left Pedro V√°squez. Miguel Febles served as adjutant. The \\"Milicias Espa√±olas\\" (Spanish Army) was under the command of Capt Tom√°s Ram√≠rez Carvajal. From the eminence above General Ram√≠rez gave a speech to the troops. He warned that their action would be decisive, since coming to the front of the French enemy with their governor's cream of the forces at his disposal, whose defeat would mean the triumph of the Reconquista campaign. Ram√≠rez recommended assault with their knives after the first shot was spent, to avoid the response of the best tactical rifle the French used. He ended the speech announcing that he ordered the death penalty, to shoot any retreating Spanish soldier, even himself. In this way everyone was forced to realize that it was better to die fighting than by being dishonorably shot. His final exclamation was \\"long live Fernando VII, a Prince personified in those moments the best Spanish hopes.\\" The General's speech was followed by tense moments of silence and attention. The French advanced and opened fire at about noon. A Gallic horse line pounced left to cut the Spanish forces off. Riders led by Captain Antonio Sosa wasted no time and ran to meet them, forcing the attackers to pull in the flanges. Among many other provisions, Jos√© de la Rosa was to ambush thirty riflemen at the rear of the enemy to distract attention after the fire broke out front. De la Rosa was one of those who came to Boca de Yuma on October 29 from Puerto Rico. The first shock was bloody melee. General Ram√≠rez gave the cavalry of his right wing, led by Captain Vicente Mercedes, the order to advance, an operation that was executed very quickly, overwhelming the French enemy. Ten minutes of fighting enough for the field covered with corpses remain. The tactic of Spanish forces was to quickly capture the distance of duel shot in combat. They executed with such alacrity and boldness that they lost only seven, while the French casualties were heavy. Among the Spanish who died were the two cavalry units leaders, Cpt. Antonio Sosa and Cpt. Vicente Mercedes. They are both buried in El Seibo. The Battle of Palo Hincado concluded on November 7, 1808‚Äîwith a Spanish victory over the Napoleonic French. Aftermath With the displayed waste of their battalions, French Governor General Ferrand ordered a hasty return to the city of Santo Domingo with a group of surviving officers. They were chased by a squadron commanded by Spanish Colonel Pedro Santana, namesake of the future leader of the Republic. The French escaped by crossing a torrential river, that the squadron was unable to follow. The French stopped to rest in Glen Guaiqu√≠a. Meanwhile, it was here the unhappy Governor Ferrand, dominated by depression, took his own life with a pistol shot to the head. The Assembly of Bondillo (\\"La Junta de Bondillo), presided by commander of Santiago de los Caballeros and Cibao troops Capt. Don Diego Polanco, was formed to appoint as acting governor Sanchez Ramirez and to recognize King Ferdinand VII as sovereign of the colony conquered. ;Symbolism \\"This became the third major war event symbolizing \\"the triumph of Dominican will.\\" The first had been the siege in 1655, and the second had been the Battle of the Sabana Real in 1691.\\"Troncoso Sanchez, Pedro; \\"The drama of the national idea in Santo Domingo and its relationship with Puerto Rico\\"; Academy of Sciences of the Dominican Republic. 1977.

Life Wickham was born in Cape Town, and was the great-grandson of William Ewart Gladstone. He was educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford. In 1941 he played the title role in Hamlet for the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS), directed by Nevill Coghill. In 1942‚Äì1946, interrupting his undergraduate studies, he served as a navigator in the RAF. He returned to New College in 1946, and became the first postwar president of OUDS. In 1948 Coghill chose him to direct a \\"complex\\" production of a masque to celebrate the visit of the then Princess Elizabeth to Oxford. He was awarded a DPhil in 1951 based on postgraduate research into the evolution of Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre from its medieval beginnings. This work formed the basis for his later work Early English Stages, published in five volumes between 1959 and 2002. Appointed in 1948 to the department of drama at Bristol University (the UK's first such department), he convened a 1951 symposium on \\"the responsibility of universities to the theatre\\" to endorse the policy of studying drama in the context of theatre and a 1954 symposium on \\"the relationship between universities and radio, film, and television\\". He also did the groundwork for the university's theatre collection in 1951 (which now has museum status and is a major archive). In 1954 he married Hesel Mudford with whom he had two sons and one daughter. In 1955, he was made the department's head and in 1960 took up its chair of drama, the first such in the UK. He also helped to set up a playwriting fellowship in the department, attracting young playwrights like John Arden, and premiered Harold Pinter's first play, The Room in 1957. At his death he was the department's professor emeritus. Wickham served as president of the American Society for Theatre Research from 1976 to 1999. In 1970 his advice was sought by Sam Wanamaker on the setting up of Shakespeare's Globe. In 1999 he was awarded the Sam Wanamaker Prize.

Religion in Istanbul covers the issue of religion in the city of Istanbul, Turkey. According to the 2000 census, there were 2691 active mosques, 123 active churches and 20 active synagogues in Istanbul; as well as 109 Muslim cemeteries and 57 non-Muslim cemeteries. Religious minorities include Greek Orthodox Christians, Armenian Christians, Catholic Levantines and Sephardic Jews. Some neighbourhoods have been known with their sizeable populations of these ethnic groups, such as the Kumkapƒ± neighbourhood, which had a significant Armenian population, the Balat neighbourhood, which used to have a sizeable Jewish population, the Fener neighbourhood with a large Greek population, and some neighbourhoods in Ni≈üanta≈üƒ± and Pera, which had sizeable Levantine populations. In some quarters, such as Ortak√∂y or Kuzguncuk, an Armenian church sits next to a synagogue, and on the other side of the road a Greek Orthodox church is found beside a mosque. Istanbul was the final seat of the Islamic Caliphate, from 1517 to 1924, when the Caliphate was dissolved and its powers were handed over to the Turkish Parliament. The seat of the Patriarch of Constantinople, spiritual leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church since the 4th century AD, is located in the Fener (Phanar) district. Also based in Istanbul are the archbishop of the Turkish Orthodox Church, the Armenian Patriarchate, and the Turkish Chief Rabbi (Hahambasi). Istanbul was formerly also the seat of the Bulgarian Exarchate, before its autocephaly was recognized by other Orthodox churches. Islam Sultan Ahmed Mosque in Istanbul. Sancaklar Mosque is a contemporary mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. The urban landscape of Istanbul is shaped by many communities. The most populous major religion is Islam. The first mosque in Istanbul was built in Kadƒ±k√∂y (ancient Chalcedon) on the Asian side of the city, which was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1353, a full century before the conquest of Constantinople across the Bosphorus, on the European side. The first mosque on the European side of Istanbul was built inside the Rumelian Castle in 1452. The first grand mosque which was built in the city proper is the Ey√ºp Sultan Mosque (1458), while the first imperial mosque inside the city walls was the Fatih Mosque (1470) which was built on the site of the Church of the Holy Apostles, an important Byzantine church which was originally edificed in the time of Constantine the Great. Many other imperial mosques were built in the following centuries, such as the famous S√ºleymaniye Mosque (1557) which was ordered by Suleiman the Magnificent and designed by the great Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan, and the famous Sultan Ahmed Mosque (1616) which is also known as the \\"Blue Mosque\\" for the blue tiles which adorn its interior. Istanbul was the seat of the Islamic Caliphate, between 1517 and 1924. Some of the personal belongings of Muhammad and the earliest caliphs who followed him are today preserved in the Topkapƒ± Palace, the Ey√ºp Sultan Mosque and in several other prominent mosques of Istanbul. The conquest of the Byzantine capital of Constantinople in 1453 enabled the Ottomans to consolidate their empire in Anatolia and Thrace. The Ottomans later revived the title of caliph during the reign of Sultan Selim. Despite the absence of a formal institutional structure, Sunni religious functionaries played an important political role. Justice was dispensed by religious courts; in theory, the codified system of sharia regulated all aspects of life, at least for the Muslim subjects of the empire. The head of the judiciary ranked directly below the sultan and was second in power only to the grand vizier. Early in the Ottoman period, the office of grand mufti of Istanbul evolved into that of Sheikh ul-Islam (shaykh, or leader of Islam), which had ultimate jurisdiction over all the courts in the empire and consequently exercised authority over the interpretation and application of sharia. Legal opinions pronounced by the Sheikh were considered definitive interpretations. Christianity Pammakaristos Church has the largest amount of Byzantine mosaics in Istanbul after the Hagia Sophia and Chora Church Orthodox Church in Constantinople around 1875, by Fabius Brest Church of St. Anthony of Padua, Istanbul built in Istanbul during Ottoman Empire. Bulgarian St. Stephen Church built in Istanbul during Ottoman Empire. The city has been the seat of the Ecumenical Patriarchate since the 4th century AD, and continues to serve as the seat of some other Orthodox churches, such as the Turkish Orthodox Church and the Armenian Patriarchate. The city was formerly also the seat of the Bulgarian Exarchate, before its autocephaly was recognized by other Orthodox churches. Following the Turkish conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II established the Millet System, according to which the different ethnic groups within Constantinople and the rest of the Ottoman Empire were to be governed by a group of institutions based on faith. For this purpose, Mehmed II also founded previously non-existent religious authorities such as the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople in 1461. Earlier, the Byzantines considered the Armenian Church as heretic and did not allow the Armenians to have churches inside the walls of Constantinople. Several Armenian saints, such as Saint Narses, were exiled and imprisoned in the Princes' Islands near Constantinople, in the Sea of Marmara. With the Millet System, a great deal of the internal affairs regarding these communities were assigned to the administration of these religious authorities; such as the Ecumenical Patriarchate for the affairs of all Orthodox Christians, the Armenian Patriarchate for the affairs of the Armenian (and for some time also the Syriac) Christians, and later the Chief Rabbi for the affairs of the Jews. The everyday life of the Christians, particularly the Greeks and Armenians, living in Istanbul changed significantly following the bitter conflicts between these ethnic groups and the Turks during the Decline of the Ottoman Empire, which began in the 1820s and continued for a century. The conflicts reached their culmination in the decade between 1912 and 1922; during the Balkan Wars, the First World War and the Turkish War of Independence. The city's Greek Orthodox community was exempted from the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923 following the establishment of the Turkish Republic. However, a series of special restrictions and taxes during the years of the Second World War (see, e.g., the wealth tax Varlƒ±k Vergisi), and the Istanbul Pogrom of 1955 which caused the deaths of 15 Greeks and the injury of 32 others, greatly increased emigration from Istanbul to Greece. In 1964, all Greeks without Turkish citizenship residing in Turkey (around 12,000The European Union and Border Conflicts: The EU and Cultural Change in Greek-Turkish Relations) were deported. Today, most of Turkey's remaining Greek and Armenian minorities live in or near Istanbul. The number of the Armenians in Istanbul today amount to approximately 40,000, while the Greek community amounted to slightly more than 2,000 at the beginning of the 21st century. Beside the mostly Catholic Levantines, who are the descendants of European (Genoese, Venetian and French) traders who established trading outposts during the Byzantine and Ottoman periods, there is also a small, scattered number of Bosphorus Germans. A number of places reflect past movements of different communities into Istanbul, most notably Arnavutk√∂y (Albanian village), Polonezk√∂y (Polish village) and Yenibosna (New Bosnia). There were more than 40,000 Catholic Italians in Istanbul at the turn of the 20th century, a figure which not only included the descendants of the local Genoese and Venetian merchants who lived here since the Byzantine and early Ottoman periods, but also the numerous Italian workers and artisans who came to the city from Italy during the 19th century. Giuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Mazzini came to Constantinople in 1832, and again in 1833. Garibaldi lived in Beyoƒülu and taught Italian, French and Mathematics in the foreign schools of this district. Garibaldi also established the Societ√† Operaia Italiana di Mutuo Soccorso on May 17, 1863, in Beyoƒülu, and became its first President (Mazzini was the second President).Turchia Oggi: Societ√† Operaia Italiana di Mutuo Soccorso The Societ√† Operaia Italiana di Mutuo Soccorso is still active and is located in its original site, on a side street of ƒ∞stiklal Avenue. The number of Istanbul's Italians decreased after the end of the Ottoman Empire for several reasons. The Turkish Republic no longer recognized the trade privileges that were given to the descendants of the Genoese and Venetian merchants, and foreigners were no longer allowed to work in Turkey in a wide number of sectors, including many artisanships, in which numerous Istanbulite Italians used to work. The Varlƒ±k Vergisi (Wealth Tax) of the World War II years, which imposed higher tariffs on non-Muslims and foreigners in Turkey, also played an important role in the migration of Istanbul's Italians to Italy--who still live in the city, but in far fewer numbers when compared with the early 20th century. The influence of the Italian community of Istanbul, however, is still visible in the architecture of many quarters, particularly Galata, Beyoƒülu and Ni≈üanta≈üƒ±. Judaism Dome of the Istanbul Ashkenazi Synagogue The Sephardic Jews have lived in the city for over 500 years, see the history of the Jews in Turkey. The Sephardic Jews contributed much to the rising power of the Ottoman Empire by introducing new ideas, methods and craftsmanship. The first Gutenberg press in Istanbul was established by the Sephardic Jews in 1493, who excelled in many areas, particularly medicine, trade and banking. The Camondo family was highly influential in the Ottoman banking sector. The famous Camondo Stairs on the Bankalar Caddesi (Banks Street) in Karak√∂y (Galata) was built by them. More than 20,000 Sephardic Jews still remain in Istanbul today. Romaniotes and Ashkenazi Jews resided in Istanbul even before the Sephardim, but their proportion has since dwindled; today, just of Istanbul's Jews are Ashkenazi. The Avusturya Sinagogu (Austrian Synagogue), also known as the A≈ükenaz Sinagogu (Ashkenazi Synagogue) is one of the most famous synagogues in Istanbul and stands out with its interesting architecture. A wave of Ashkenazi Jews came to Istanbul during the 1930s and 1940s following the rise of Nazism in Germany which persecuted the Ashkenazi Jews of central and eastern Europe. Today, a total of 20 active synagogues are to be found in the city, the most important of them being the Neve Shalom Synagogue inaugurated in 1951, in the Beyoƒülu quarter. The Turkish Grand Rabbi in Istanbul (currently Ishak Haleva) presides over community affairs. A decrease in the population of the city's Jewish community occurred after the independence of the State of Israel in 1948, but the Turkish Jews who migrated to that country helped to establish strong relationships between Turkey and Israel. The founders of the State of Israel and prominent Israeli politicians such as David Ben-Gurion, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi and Moshe Shertok had all studied in the leading Turkish schools of Istanbul in their youth, namely Galatasaray High School and Istanbul University. Irreligion It is estimated that about 5-15% of the population in Istanbul has no religion, most of them are under 35 years old.

It serves students in preschool through grade 12 and is accredited by the Virginia Association of Independent Schools. History In the summer of 1964, ground work was laid to organize a segregation academy in Wakefield as part of Virginia's campaign of massive resistance against the integration of public schools required by the United States Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education. Successful efforts and plans to keep a high school in town were realized when the first Board of Directors, and administration, faculty and staff for Tidewater Academy were chosen that year. On March 24, 1964, under the provisions of Chapter 2 of Title 13.1 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, Tidewater Academy became incorporated. The school was one of a network of segregated private schools established by the Virginia Education Fund in response the racial integration of public schools. As defined in 1964, the goals of Tidewater Academy were to \\"provide a thorough academic education with emphasis on preparation for college; to build an understanding of local cultural heritage and respect for learning; and to create in each student a sense of responsibility for effective leadership, good moral character, and an appreciation of spiritual values.\\" In the second academic year, a lower school program was added to provide a system of twelve grades. In the early years, classes were housed wherever space was available. Subsequently, buildings were completed by volunteers at what is now the Upper School Campus on Church Street in Wakefield. In 1977 facilities for students in kindergarten through grade six were provided. Since the completion of the new lower school building, all grades are now located at the Wakefield campus. Tidewater Academy is a member school of the Virginia Association of Independent Schools.

After the opening of the Pier in 1870, the line was extended with an additional railway station opened by the pier. The Pier station closed first; and the original Portishead station closed in 1954, with a new Portishead station opened nearer the town. The 1954 station closed in 1964 when passenger services were withdrawn from the line. A resited new station is due to be opened to passenger traffic as part of MetroWest, a scheme to increase rail services in the Bristol area. This will be built about east of the town centre. History Portishead railway station was opened by the Bristol and Portishead Pier and Railway on 18 April 1867; it was approximately beyond the village of Portishead and handled both passengers and goods.Butt (1995), p.189.Crowhurst, Ken (2001).RCH (1904), p.80. The Pier was opened in 1870 and line was extended to the pier, with an additional railway station opened by the pier. By 1904, this was listed as a goods-only station, known as \\"Portishead Dock\\". In the 1920s, the coal-fired Portishead power station was built adjacent to Portishead railway station; and the power station was extended in 1948 to increase its capacity. In 1949, building work also started on an additional power station, Portishead B power station. This led to the closure and demolition of the original Portishead railway station. It was replaced on the same day, 4 January 1954, by a new station nearer the centre of Portishead and Bristol to the designs of the Western Region Assistant Architect, Ian J. Campbell. The 1954 station was closed by the \\"Beeching Axe\\" on 7 September 1964, when passenger services ceased on the line. Freight services continued on the line until the early 1980s.  Future  In April 2019 the Department for Transport committed ¬£31.9m to cover the shortfall in finance for MetroWest Phase 1, meaning that funding for the new station and reopened line has now been secured. In November 2019 North Somerset Council submitted a Development Consent Order (DCO) application to the Planning Inspectorate, which seeks powers to build and operate the disused section of railway from Portishead to Pill, gain environmental consent to undertake works to the existing freight railway through the Avon Gorge and obtain powers for the compulsory acquisition of land. The Secretary of State for Transport is expected to make a decision within 18 months. Subject to final business case approval, construction work is expected to start on the line in December 2021 and then take around two years to complete.

He was born 29 September 1947, in the village of Sotuma Sere in the Upper River Division of The Republic of Gambia, West Africa. The Susso family represents a dynasty of traditional oral historians and praise singers. His father taught him to play the kora, a 21-stringed, lute-like instrument, when he was five years old. Papa Susso's ancestors were instrumental in the creation, as well as the development of the instrument for over two centuries. Education and public service career Susso attended Bakadaji Primary School from 1953 to 1960 and enrolled at the Armitage High School, Georgetown, The Gambia, from 1960‚Äì1965, where he graduated with honors. Thereafter, he received an appointment as Agricultural Assistant in the Ministry of Agricultural and Natural Resources. Upon receiving a scholarship to Cuttington University, Suacoco, Liberia, he quit that post. He received a bachelor of arts degree in business administration in 1969. Returning to The Gambia, Susso embarked on a career in the civil service, receiving an appointment as Senior Accountant in the Ministry of Work and Communications. Other posts included Financial Attach√© and Liaison Officer for The Gambia Embassy in Freetown, Sierra Leone; he was accreditedt as well to the Republic of Liberia, Guinea and The Ivory Coast. Performing career Susso ended his civil service career in order to resume his traditional role, becoming the chief kora player of The Gambia National Cultural Troupe under the Ministry of Education and Culture. In 1974, he left that position, founding his own cultural organization: The Manding Music and Dance Limited. The new organization sought to conduct research on Manding history, traditions and ethnomusicology, while providing assistance, particularly in business management, for traditional Manding performers. More generally, MMDL sought to revive, preserve and disseminate knowledge and appreciation of traditional Manding musical arts. His signature performances include selections from the traditional epic in celebration of Sundiata Keita, founder of the Mali Empire and an original composition in honor of the Apollo XI astronauts. Susso, now based equally in the Bronx and in the Gambia, travels widely, and has been a premier performer in the \\"American Classic African Portraits\\" by Hannibal Peterson. He performed at New York City's Carnegie Hall twice, for the Baltimore, Detroit, Kalamazoo, San Antonio, St. Louis and Chicago Symphonies, the Louisiana Philharmonic of New Orleans, and Kazumi Watanabe Opera, Tokyo, Japan. Most of his time is spent giving performances in schools, from elementary through university levels, and discussing his art with students and faculty, giving both classroom presentations and formal concert performances. Susso has also been appointed as Regents' Lecturer in ethnomusicology in 1991 at the University of California, Santa Barbara, He appears alone with his kora or with his ensemble that includes singer/dancer Tapa Demba, balafonist Bala Kouyate and his son, Alhassan Susso, on second kora.

Project staff in 2011 comprised a group of volunteers, mostly from art museums, including the Guggenheim Museum, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, as well as Archives & Museum Informatics. In a folksonomy users tag content for the purposes of later retrieval. It allows the public to introduce new search- terms, in the form of tags, to the formal library catalog that art and cataloging professionals themselves might not have included. It also allows curators and other museum professionals to see what the public sees in works of art. These terms will enrich the catalog and increase the likelihood that searchers of all levels will find what they are looking for. In the end, it is hoped that museum collections will be fully searchable by keywords rather than just by name or artist. Early results from the project found that a number of tags were applied often, while others were applied just once per work of art. The project received a $1 million grant from the US Institute of Museum and Library Services, from which the Indianapolis Museum of Art is working to apply folksonomy to its collection, and is one of a number of related projects currently working to make art more accessible and to find its role in the digital age.

Its main office in Alberta is located at Suite 700 - 333 11th Avenue SW, Calgary, Alberta T2R 1L9. Purpose The Law Society is created and governed by the Legal Profession Act (Alberta). As a law society, the Law Society is much more than a professional association and every lawyer who practices in Alberta must belong to it. The Society's mandate is to regulate the legal profession in the public interest. The Society is primarily concerned with the admission and discipline of lawyer members, making sure trust accounts are properly managed, educating the public, and preventing the unauthorized practice of law. The Law Society of Alberta also has a program for First Nations. It is meant to connect law firms in Alberta with first nation students. They are also committed to respond to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission‚Äôs Call to Action. Governance structure The Law Society is governed by members of the profession elected by its membership to serve as benchers. In addition to elected Benchers, there are four lay benchers (non-lawyers) appointed by the Minister of Justice. There are 24 benchers in total (including the four lay benchers), each expected to serve three-year terms. The Society has passed The Rules of the Law Society of Alberta to govern the Society, to exercise the Society's powers and duties, and for the management and conducts of its business and affairs. The Society is a member of the Federation of Law Societies of Canada. Admission To practice law in the Province of Alberta, a person must be admitted to the bar and a member of the Society. The Society sets its own educational admission requirements. These include a Bachelor of Laws degree (which in turn requires preliminary university study), completion of a twelve-month period of apprenticeship with an experienced practitioner called articling, and completion of bar admission exams. Bar admission exams in Alberta are more akin to assignments that test practical application of the law instead of pure legal knowledge. In addition to these academic requirements, the Legal Profession Act requires that a candidate be of \\"good character and reputation.\\"http://www.qp.alberta.ca/574.cfm?page=l08.cfm‚ãö_type=Acts&isbncln;=9780779742592Legal Profession Act, R.S.A. 2000, s. 41. The Alberta Bar is one of the few that still admits its members one at a time in a very personalized ceremony. Once admitted, lawyers in Alberta, as in other common-law Canadian provinces but unlike England, are both barristers and solicitors. Members of the Society (and judges of the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta and the Court of Appeal of Alberta) are also notaries public pursuant to section 3 of the Notaries Public Act, but unlike those who become notaries public through an appointment, members of the Society do not have an appointment expiration date. Discipline The Law Society has supervisory and disciplinary functions over its members. This responsibility includes the task of enforcing the rules of the Law Society, and to discipline offending lawyers. To aid in this task, the Society has passed a Code of Professional Conduct which is in essence a written code of ethics to which all lawyers must abide. The ultimate sanction the Society could impose is disbarment. A lawyer that has been disbarred is no longer legally able to practice law in Alberta. Lawyers can also be fined or suspended.

CPI, also known as force-placed insurance and lender placed insurance, may be classified as single-interest insurance if it protects the interest of the lender, a single party, or as dual-interest insurance coverage if it protects the interest of both the lender and the borrower. Upon signing a loan agreement, the borrower typically agrees to purchase and maintain insurance (that must include comprehensive and collision coverage for automobiles, and hazard, flood, and wind coverage for homes), and list the lending institution as the lienholder. If the borrower fails to purchase such coverage, the lender is left vulnerable to losses, and the lender turns to a CPI provider to protect its interests against loss.Insurance Research Council, ‚ÄúUninsured Motorists‚Äî2011 Edition,‚Äù April 2011. Lenders purchase CPI in order to manage their risk of loss by transferring the risk to an insurance company. Unlike other forms of insurance available to lenders, such as blanket insurance that impacts borrowers that have already purchased insurance, CPI affects only uninsured borrowers or lender-owned collaterals, such as auto repossession and home foreclosure. Additionally, depending upon the structure of the CPI policy chosen by the lender, the uninsured borrower may also be protected in several ways. For instance, a policy may provide that if collateral is damaged, it can be repaired and retained by the borrower. If the collateral is damaged beyond repair, CPI insurance can pay off the loan.  How CPI works  When a borrower takes out a loan for a home or vehicle at a lending institution, he or she signs an agreement to maintain dual-interest insurance, protecting both the borrower and the lender with comprehensive and collision coverage on the vehicle or hazard, wind, and flood on the home throughout the life of the loan. The borrower provides proof of insurance to the lender, which is verified by the CPI provider, which also acts on behalf of the loan servicer as an insurance-tracking company. If proof of insurance is not received by the CPI provider, notices are sent to borrowers in the name of the loan servicer, prompting them to obtain required coverage. If responses to notices are not received, the lending institution may choose to have CPI coverage ‚Äúforce- placed‚Äù on the borrower‚Äôs loan to protect its interest from damage or loss, leaving the borrower empty-handed. The lending institution passes the premium charge on to the borrower by adding the premium to the loan principal and increasing the loan payments. If the borrower subsequently provides proof of insurance, a refund is issued, otherwise, the premiums are rolled into the loan. Throughout the life of a loan, the CPI provider monitors proof of insurance to ensure that policies remain in force. If policies lapse, notices are sent in accordance with the procedure outlined above, and CPI is backdated to fill in any coverage gaps.  Past problems  Interest in collateral protection insurance increased in the late 1980s when, in response to a bank crisis, regulators recommended that assets securing loans be insured and, if borrowers did not obtain insurance, that lenders obtain CPI. The rise in CPI activity generated by this recommendation also coincided with a number of consumer complaints, including suits from borrowers.Class Action Dilemmas: Pursuing Public Goals for Private Gain, Deborah R. Hensler, Nicholas M. Pace, Institute for Civil Justice (U.S.), Beth Giddens, Erik Moller, Jennifer Gross. Published 2000 by Rand Corporation. Borrower lawsuits were often prompted by lenders‚Äô providing inadequate disclosure regarding the right to force-place CPI policies, force-placing policies with unnecessary coverages, and not disclosing they might be making a commission on the transaction. Additionally, some CPI providers had administrative problems with their programs, including the inability to receive and process insurance documents in a timely manner and ineffective tracking technology, and the inability of some providers to reamortize the loan payments resulting in the \\"stacking\\" of CPI premiums. These problems resulted in sending unnecessary letters to borrowers, issuing policies to borrowers who were in fact insured, and delays in processing premium refunds when proof of insurance was received, all of which served to exacerbate borrower complaints. In July, 2017 a class action law suit was filed against Wells Fargo, and its CPI vendor, National General. The lawsuit alleged, among other things, that the CPI Policies they placed were duplicative, unnecessary, and overpriced. Wells Fargo and National General denied each and all of the claims and allegations of wrongdoing. However, a settlement was granted preliminary approval by the Court on August 5, 2019. http://www.wellsfargocpisettlement.com/en  Market response and current state  In automobile CPI, lenders improved their contract language to address the disclosure problems that existed in the past. Additionally, the practices and supporting technologies of the automobile CPI market have evolved since the 1980s. Today, leading automobile CPI providers provide online tracking systems that are updated in real time and are used by providers, borrowers, and lenders to communicate and coordinate on insurance-related issues. Automobile CPI providers have also implemented electronic data interchange (EDI) with borrowers‚Äô private insurance carriers in order to maintain current information on required insurance. Because of the improvements made in automobile CPI administration, interest in automobile CPI insurance again increased through the early 2000s to the present day. Additionally, a driving factor behind the growth in the automobile CPI marketplace has been in the longer duration of loans and higher financed amounts. For instance, by 2014 the average length of a new auto loan had reached 66 months, and the average amount financed for a new vehicle is $27,612, up $964 from 2013.Experian Automotive, ‚ÄúState of the Automotive Finance Market Q1 2014,‚Äù June 2014. The longer the term of a loan and the higher the amount financed, the more likely it is that a borrower will be in a negative-equity, or ‚Äúupside-down,‚Äù situation. Borrowers who are upside down are also more likely to default on loan payments, resulting in more repossessions for lenders who then must deal with uninsured damage to repossessed vehicles.  Mortgage protection insurance controversy  Collateral Protection Insurance on mortgage properties, otherwise known as Mortgage Protection Insurance (MPI) has been under scrutiny in the United States. After the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 and the rise in foreclosures, lender purchased \\"force-placed\\" or \\"lender-placed\\" insurance became more prominent. Controversy has arisen over the price of this insurance, as well as loss ratio discrepancies, agent fees, and the relationships between the banking institutions and the insurance companies, which resulted in a regulatory investigation and settlement in the state of New York in 2013,N.Y.

The news service was produced and broadcast from Thames TV's headquarters at Euston Road in north-west London and, during its last few years in operation, from district newsrooms in Dartford in Kent, Guildford in Surrey and Watford in Hertfordshire. History =Today & launch of Thames News= Prior to Thames News, the station opted not to provide a conventional local news service in spite of requests from the Independent Television Authority to improve on Rediffusion's scant levels of regional output. Instead, Thames produced Today, a local magazine show presented chiefly on alternating nights by Bob Holness, Eamonn Andrews and Bill Grundy. The programme was axed in the summer of 1977, several months after Grundy's infamous on-air interview with The Sex Pistols. Today was replaced on Monday, 12 September 1977 by Thames at Six, a more conventional news magazine programme, presented by former ITN newscaster Andrew Gardner. The following year saw Thames establish a full strength newsroom, enabling daily coverage of London-specific news for the first time in ITV's history. A lunchtime Thames News bulletin, presented by Robin Houston, was launched on Tuesday, 5 September 1978 ‚Äì a late night bulletin, broadcast after News at Ten and also to be presented by Robin Houston, was due to launch on the same day, but was held back until Monday, 28 April 1980 because of union problems. During 1979, the main evening programme was renamed as Thames News.Thames at Six titles 1977., youtube.com, 4 December 2013. =Thames Weekend News= On New Year's Day ‚Äì Friday, 1 January 1982 ‚Äì Thames and its weekend counterpart London Weekend Television (LWT) began new franchise periods, and at the same time, the weekly handover from Thames to LWT was brought forward from 7pm to 5.15pm on Friday nights. Prior to the change, Thames aired a full Friday evening edition of Thames News at 6pm, followed by Thames Sport at 6:30pm, but after the franchise renewals, LWT was reluctant to start a weekend news service, despite pressure from the Independent Broadcasting Authority, which had also suggested introducing a single seven-day service co-produced by both companies. LWT director of programmes, Michael Grade, described the idea as impractical for various reasons. Therefore, Thames produced special Thames Weekend News bulletins for broadcast on Friday evenings, including a 15-minute round-up during LWT's light-hearted magazine programme The Six O'Clock Show. LWT paid Thames a reported ¬£500,000 a year to provide 16 minutes of local news on Friday evenings. The arrangement ended in January 1988 when LWT launched a full strength local news service, provided by Screen News and later, Chrysalis Television. =Goodbye from Thames News= On Wednesday, 16 October 1991, Thames Television learned it would lose its ITV franchise to serve London during the weekdays to Carlton Television, which joined up with London Weekend Television to form London News Network, a new seven-day news service for the capital. Thames News produced its final full-length programme on Wednesday, 23 December 1992, presented by Steve Clarke (a former presenter of the BBC's rival London Plus programme) and Gytha Hutton (a reporter based in Thames' Guildford newsroom). The very last bulletin was broadcast on New Year's Eve, Thursday, 31 December 1992 and presented by regular sports anchor Graham Miller.

It is a partial sequel of Hardy's previous film The Wicker Man (1973), dealing with many of the same themes and ideas, namely the clash between paganism and Christianity.https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/07/wicker_man_2/ There are also similarities with the plot of Harvest Home by Thomas Tryon. The book's plot revolves around two young Americans, Beth and Steve, who are members of a fundamentalist Protestant Christian group in their home of Texas, U.S.A. Travelling to Scotland in order to preach, they arrive at Tressock, where they are welcomed by the local aristocrat, Sir Lachlan Morrison and his wife, Delia Morrison. What they fail to realise is that the Morrisons and many of the locals are members of a contemporary Pagan religion devoted to the worship of the goddess Sulis, and that they plan to sacrifice the Texan couple on May Day. Plot Beth is a successful pop music singer and a devout Protestant Christian from Texas, United States. She and her boyfriend Steve both belong to a group known as the \\"Cowboys for Christ\\", who travel to \\"heathen areas\\" of the world to preach Christianity. They travel to Glasgow, Scotland, hoping to save some souls once there. However, they are shocked when they receive a very negative reception, Beth even being set upon by a large dog. After performing a concert at a local cathedral, the duo are approached by Lord Lachlan and his wife Delia, aristocrats from the small village of Tressock in the Scottish lowlands. They invite Beth and Steve to come back with them to Tressock in order to preach. Meanwhile, Detective Orlando is sent to Tressock, posing as the local police officer, in order to secretly investigate reports of a pagan cult. Beth and Steve decide that they shall begin their preaching at the May Day celebrations in the village. Meanwhile, Orlando discovers that the people of the village worship the ancient Celtic goddess Sulis. In an attempt to impress the locals, Steve and Beth agree to becoming the local Queen of the May and the Laddie for the festival. In this role, they must split up for the day, and it is during this that the Laddie is devoured by the locals on an island in the middle of the river Sulis. Beth discovers this, and tries to escape, but is captured and embalmed. Film adaptation Cowboys for Christ provided the basis for the 2011 film, The Wicker Tree.

Explorers arrived and camped on the banks of a small river. The climate was mild, there was abundant water, and the lands were fertile. But the site had one defect: it was infested by clouds of a blood-sucking mosquito called Mutuca. For this reason the river and the lands nearby were given the name \\"Mutuca\\". 1792 is the first date known in an authentic document referring to the existence of the town. The first settlement of Mutuca changed its name to Esp√≠rito Santo da Mutuca, later Esp√≠rito Santo do Pontal, and later reducing the name to Pontal. In 1911 it got its municipal emancipation from Varginha. The name, Pontal, was changed to Eloy Mendes in honor of Major Joaquim Eloy Mendes (1827‚Äì1913), who was an important local figure and a baron in the Empire of Brazil with the title of Baron of Varginha.

The central retinal vein is the venous equivalent of the central retinal artery and both may become occluded.Ophthalmology at a Glance, Jane Olver & Lorraine Cassidy, Blackwell Science 2005. Since the central retinal artery and vein are the sole source of blood supply and drainage for the retina, such occlusion can lead to severe damage to the retina and blindness, due to ischemia (restriction in blood supply) and edema (swelling). CRVO can cause ocular ischemic syndrome. Nonischemic CRVO is the milder form of the disease. It may progress to the more severe ischemic type. CRVO can also cause glaucoma. Diagnosis Despite the role of thrombosis in the development of CRVO, a systematic review found no increased prevalence of thrombophilia (an inherent propensity to thrombosis) in patients with retinal vascular occlusion. Treatment Treatment consists of Anti-VEGF drugs like Lucentis or intravitreal steroid implant (Ozurdex) and Pan-Retinal Laser Photocoagulation usually. Underlying conditions also require treatment. CRVO without ischemia has better visual prognosis than ischemic CRVO. A systematic review studied the effectiveness of the anti-VEGF drugs ranibizumab and pagatanib sodium for patients suffering from non-ischemic CRVO. Though there was a limited sample size, participants in both treatment groups showed improved visual acuity over 6 month periods, with no safety concerns.

It is situated in the northwestern highlands of Montenegro, bordering the Republika Srpska. The Piva river flows through the region. Regional center is the town of Plu≈æine. History =Ottoman period= Piva was a nahiya of the Ottoman Empire, mentioned in the 1476‚Äì78 defter. It was earlier mentioned in the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja (ca. 1300‚Äì10) as one of ten counties in the province of Podgorje, and in the St. Stephen Chrysobull of Serbian king Stefan Milutin (r. 1282‚Äì1321). It was part of Sanjak of Herzegovina during Ottoman rule. The Serbian Orthodox Piva Monastery has been standing in Piva since the 16th century. It has produced four Patriarchs of the Serbian Orthodox Church. =Modern= Under Prince Nicholas I of Montenegro and the Congress of Berlin recognition, in 1878 the Piva together with the Serb Herzegovinian tribes of Banjani, Nik≈°iƒái, ≈†aranci, Drobnjaci and a large number of the Rudinjani formed the Old Herzegovina region of the new Montenegrin state. During the Second World War, people of the region fought in both the Serbian royalist Chetnik and communist Partisan resistance movements, which fought against each other. The tribe has since the arrest of Radovan Karad≈æiƒá, the wartime Bosnian Serb president and member of the neighbourly Drobnjak tribe of Petnjica (from which also the Serbian language reformer Vuk Karad≈æiƒá descends), petitioned for Tadiƒá's excommunication from the tribe because of Karad≈æiƒá's arrest. The arrest is seen as directly bad behavior against the Serbian people and from the Piva against the Drobnjak tribe, who had never before had any problems, and it is because of this Tadiƒá's actions have been condemned.

The crisis was linked to the push for Georgia to receive a NATO Membership Action Plan and, indirectly, the unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo. Increasing tensions led to the outbreak of the Russo- Georgian War in 2008. After the war, a number of incidents occurred in both conflict zones, and tensions between the belligerents remained high. Prelude to war =Lifting of CIS sanctions= During the meeting with the presidents of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in February 2008, the Russian official declared Moscow should \\"reshape its relations with self-proclaimed republics\\". Russia's Duma called a session for 13 March to discuss the issue of recognition of the unrecognized republics in the former Soviet Union. On 6 March 2008, Russia lifted Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) sanctions imposed on Abkhazia in 1996, and declared them outdated, \\"hindering the implementation of economic and social programs in the region and is causing unjustified hardship for the people of Abkhazia.\\" The Russian decision was met with protests from Tbilisi and lack of support from the other CIS countries. Shalva Natelashvili, leader of the Georgian Labour Party, warned Russia's lifting of economic sanctions on Abkhazia meant Georgia would lose Abkhazia. Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel said the European Union was concerned by this development. Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt, raised concerns about the dropping of trade restrictions saying, \\"That could look like a de facto annexation and that would be a matter of great concern if it were the case.\\" =Increased involvement of Russia with breakaway republics in Georgia= On 1 March 2008, Russian General Vasily Lunev, former Deputy Commander of Siberian Military District was appointed as defence minister of South Ossetia. Abkhazia and South Ossetia both submitted formal requests for recognition of their independence to Russia, and international community, citing the precedent of the recognition of Kosovo. European Commissioner for External Relations Benita Ferrero-Waldner said that there was \\"a growing preoccupation and anxiety that Russia may be paving the way for recognition of Abkhazia,\\" and stated the EU's support for Georgia's territorial integrity. Russia's ambassador to NATO warned that a move by Georgia to join NATO could bolster the recognition of the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, arguing that since the NATO referendum held in Georgia did not include the breakaway states, it showed Georgia intended to join NATO without them. The Duma Committee for CIS on 13 March, following a hearing on the unrecognized republics, recommended a deepening of links with Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria. Other recommendations included the establishment of diplomatic missions in the regions (with the foreign ministry to decide whether they would be consulates or another type of mission), a removal of import duties on goods created by businesses with Russian shareholders in the regions, and increased humanitarian and economic assistance for Russian passport holders in the regions. The Nezavisimaya Gazeta daily described the hearing as \\"the launch of a procedure of recognition.\\" On 21 March 2008, Russian State Duma adopted a resolution, in which it called on Russian president and the government to consider the recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. On 3 April 2008, when the NATO summit was being held in Bucharest, President Putin sent a letter to the leaders of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, addressing them as \\"presidents\\" and promising Russian support that would be \\"practical, not declaratory\\" in nature. Five days later, the Georgian Ministry of Justice received a letter from its Russian counterpart; the letter said Russia would upgrade its direct relations with the two separatist regions, and featured language such as \\"closely cooperate, hold talks and make legal-related decisions with the Abkhaz authorities\\". On 16 April 2008, Vladimir Putin announced that Russia was going to recognise some documents issued by the separatist authorities and cooperate with them on trade and other issues. Putin also instructed his government to recognise businesses and organisations registered under Abkhaz and South Ossetian law, and to look at providing consular services to residents in the two regions. Georgian Foreign Minister David Bakradze said Russia's move amounted to a \\"legalisation of the de facto annexation process\\" being conducted by Russia and NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer urged Russia to reverse the move. This decision was linked to the push for Georgia to receive a NATO Membership Action Plan and, indirectly, the unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo. Anonymous Russian diplomat had told Nezavisimaya Gazeta that the draft decree was aimed at de facto annexation rather than recognition. Direct dealings between Russia and Abkhazia on the transfer of Russian citizens from Abkhaz prisons raised concern from Secretary General of the Council of Europe Terry Davis since the dealings were done without seeking the permission of the Georgian government. Russia's state-owned Gazprom was reported to be planning oil and gas exploration in Abkhazia beginning 1 July 2008. In addition, Abkhazia said international airline flights from Russia could use Sukhumi airport through the International Civil Aviation Organization had said such flights would be unacceptable. Officials from Gazprom said there were no plans for oil exploration in Abkhazia, but did say there was a proposal being considered to build a gas pipeline to Abkhazia. Responding to Russian media reports that sea links between Sochi in Russia and Gagra in Abkhazia would be resumed, Georgia threatened to appeal to international marine organizations over the use of \\"illegal\\" routes.  Post-War  = Separation = Between 1918 and 1921 Georgia was briefly independent from the Russian empire. After a couple of years, Georgia and another former Russian state became Soviet Socialist Republics. During the transition to the Soviet Socialist Republic, in 1922 South Ossetia was created within the new Georgian republic than a few years later in 1931 the Abkhazia republic was downgraded to being an Oblast republic in Georgia. A year later in 1990, South Ossetia declared independence from Georgia. A year later Georgia declared independence from the Soviet Union which leads to future Georgian conflicts. From 1991‚Äì1992 there were armed conflicts between Georgia, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia; during this conflict, Zviad Gamsakhurdia was disposed of as the president. After 1992 the two territories try to claim independence bit it always resulted in an armed conflict with Georgia. Up until the Abkhazian separatist forces defeated the Georgian military in 1993; after that in October 1993 Georgia joins the Commonwealth of Independent States. After a couple of years of fighting, a cease-fire was declared and signed in 1994 between the Georgian forces and the Abkhazia separatists; during the ceasefire Russian Peace troops were dispatched in the conflicted area. = Russian peacekeepers = After the armed conflict between Georgia and the South Ossetia region, both sides agreed and signed the involvement of Russia and Russia peacekeepers.  Russian tactics  As the conflict between Georgia and Russia raged on in August 2008, Georgian forces began to realize that is was not a coincidence and that the Russian forces seemed prepared to fight. When Russian forces began to move south into Georgia, they would pick advantageous points and use aircraft to knock out television towers. Russia began to build illegal fences around the South Ossetia territory. Russia's actions included \\"constructing illegal fencing and earthen barriers to separate communities and further divide the Georgian population‚Äù The West and Georgia feared Russia was trying to slowly annex Georgia and divide the country. Over time, Russia installed 19 military bases in South Ossetia which made the West very concerned for the future of Georgia and the region.  Russia-Georgia relations in 2013  Five years after the 2008 Russia Georgia conflict, the Georgian government showed support for restoring relations with Russia. Russia continued to maintain a military presence, \\"Russian troops [were] stationed in 20% of the country's territory.\\" Russia was in talks about lifting sanctions off of Georgia and relaxing travel restrictions; Georgia wanted to continue its path toward membership in the European Union and NATO. During the conflict, many Georgians were asked what their views were on Russia. Many claimed to love the people of Russia, but one interviewee claimed to only dislike Vladimir Putin. The relationship between Russia and Georgia was improving very slowly as both sides talked about the future of the relationship between the two and the future of Georgia.  Impact on Georgia and South Ossetia  The Russia-Georgian conflict came to an end with a ceasefire that was implemented 12 August 2008. Georgia ended with conflict without the South Ossetia territory, which Russia recognized their independence, but Georgia still viewed it as part of Georgia. Ossetia's split from Georgia caused its domestic economy to collapse. After the conflict, South Ossetia \\"totally rely on funding from Russia, but because of corruption\\". This pushed Georgia to sign an association agreement with the European Union, but they had yet to submit for membership. After the conflict political unrest in Georgia caused people to look at each other negatively if they said anything negative about Saakashvili's government during the conflict. Many saw it as being against Georgia when they were trying to defend themselves some even go as far as being a Russian supporter or agent.  War crimes  At the end of the conflict between Russia and Georgia, Georgia went to the European court of human rights to provide evidence that Russia committed war crimes during the conflict. During the hearing Georgia claimed, \\"Russian planes carried out more than 100 attacks on Georgian targets‚Äù These Russian bombing lead to many Georgians losing their homes and being killed. Communities and villages were destroyed, and many Georgians were forced by Russian troops to leave their homes. Georgia also claimed that when the conflict first broke out in 2008, Russia had approximately 30,000 troops that were distributed in South Ossetia and Abkhazia provinces. These Russian troops along with Ossetia forces began \\"sealing off entrances and exits... then systematically burned down Georgian homes and entire villages... adding that they carried out summary executions and threaten individuals that would not leave‚Äù. The verdict for the case is supposed to be given and it may find Russia guilty for some of these cries, but the Kremlin threatens to hold funding from the court and to withdraw from the court entirely.  Weapons of war  Given the history and connection of Russia and Georgia, they both used different types of weapons during the conflict. By Georgia is a former state of the Soviet Union, it was expected for them to use Soviet-era weaponry. Many of the Russian weapons were Soviet era and many soldiers had a hard time using them during the conflict. It was \\"estimated that some 80 percent of Russian weaponry had not been refurbished since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991‚Äù The Soviet-era weapons set Russia back a little during the conflict while Georgia was using more efficient and updated weaponry. Before the conflict, Georgia had many of its tanks and infantry vehicles updated by western firms. Reports also claimed, \\"Georgian aircraft tended to have superior communication, avionics, and weapon-control system‚Äù compared to the Russian aircraft. Russian soldiers at one point during the conflict had to strip dead Georgian soldiers of their armor to increase their protection. Most of the Russian's military equipment was ineffective against the Georgian forces. = Georgia drone-downing incidents = On 20 April 2008 a Georgian unarmed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was shot down over the Abkhaz conflict zone. Russia's Air Force denied Georgian claims that a MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter, from the Gudauta military base, was involved in the incident. Abkhazia's separatist administration said earlier that they had shot down the drone at 6 a.m. GMT, but Georgians denied this. Abkhazia said that they were defending their airspace. The Abkhaz Defense Ministry identified the drone as an Israeli-made Hermes 450. Garry Kupalba, deputy defence minister of the Republic of Abkhazia, told reporters the drone was shot down by an \\"L-39 aircraft of the Abkhaz Air Force\\". However, Georgia's defence ministry released video the next day showing what appears to be a Russian MiG-29 shooting down the unarmed Georgian drone. The video, shot from the drone, shows a jet launching a missile over what appears to be the Black Sea. Moscow denied Georgia's accusation and stressed that none of its planes were in the region at the time. Furthermore, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement accusing Georgia of violating the 1994 Moscow agreement and United Nations resolutions on Abkhazia by deploying without authorisation a UAV which also can be used for adjusting of fire. On 23 April 2008, a closed meeting of the UN Security Council was held in New York. After a closed-door UN Security Council emergency session, the U.S., the United Kingdom, France and Germany issued a joint statement expressing their concern over Russia's actions in Abkhazia and calling on Moscow to reverse or not to implement its decision to deepen ties with Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The Permanent Representative of Russia to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin called the demand by the Western states \\"a tall order\\" and stressed that Russia had no intention of reversing its plans. The Ambassador of Russia to NATO, Dmitry Rogozin, suggested that a MiG-29 belonging to a NATO member might have downed the Georgian spy plane. NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer reportedly remarked that \\"he'd eat his tie if it turned out that a NATO MiG-29 had magically appeared in Abkhazia and shot down a Georgian drone.\\" Early in May 2008, both Russian and Abkhaz sides claimed that two more Georgian reconnaissance drones were shot over Abkhazia. Georgia denied these allegations, stating that it was \\"a provocation\\" aimed at \\"information-propagandistic support of Russia's military intervention.\\" On 26 May 2008, the U.N. mission released the conclusion of its independent investigation into the 20 April incident. It confirmed that the Georgian video footage and radar data were authentic and the jet which destroyed the drone was indeed Russian. The conclusion report said that the jet flew towards the Russian territory after the incident, but it was unclear where the attacker took off, naming the Gudauta base as a possible locality. Georgia hailed the report, but Russia dismissed it. According to Der Spiegel, after the incident President Saakashvili deployed 12,000 Georgian troops to Senaki in May 2008. Georgia had officially suspended drone flights over Abkhazia in early June, but Abkhazia accused Georgia of continuing to fly drones in the region. = Military buildup in Abkhazia = In late April 2008, Russia said that Georgia was amassing 1,500 soldiers and police in the upper Kodori Gorge area and planning to invade Abkhazia. President Saakashvili, in his televised address, pledged to pursue only a peaceful line in the conflict areas and called upon the Abkhaz and Ossetians to unite with Georgia in defying attempts by \\"outrageous and irresponsible\\" external force to trigger bloodshed. Russia accused Georgia of trying to solve the Abkhazia problem by force and of sending its troops in the Georgian-controlled upper Kodori Valley in Abkhazia. Russia announced it would increase its military in the region and threatened to \\"retaliate\\" militarily to Georgia's efforts. The Georgian Prime Minister Lado Gurgenidze said Georgia would treat any additional troops in Abkhazia as aggressors. The European Union also urged caution, saying to increase troop numbers would be \\"unwise\\". The United States called on Russia \\"to reconsider\\" \\"some provocative steps\\" it had taken in respect of Abkhazia. Georgia suspended Russia's admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Russian Cossacks and North Caucasian volunteers declared their readiness to fight Georgia in the case of a renewed confrontation in Abkhazia. On 6 May 2008, the Georgian state minister for reintegration Temur Iakobashvili said Georgia was on the verge of war with Russia. UN Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) said on 8 May that its monitors had \\"not reported any buildup of security forces\\" either in Kodori Gorge, or at the administrative Abkhaz border. Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that the chief UN observer \\"agreed that actions by the Russian side do not contradict basic agreements on the conduct of the peacekeeping operation\\", but the mission later responded to this statement, declaring that it \\"has no authority to pronounce on the conformity between the CIS peacekeeping operation in the Zone of the Georgian- Abkhaz Conflict and CIS rules.\\" According to the statement of the Russian Ministry of Defense issued on 8 May, it had increased the number of its peacekeepers in Abkhazia to 2,542 peacekeepers, which was 458 short of the 3,000 limit set by agreement. Georgia showed video footage to the BBC allegedly proving that Russian troops used military hardware in Abkhazia and were a fighting force, rather than peacekeepers; Russia denied the accusations. Sergei Bagapsh, Abkhazia's separatist president, said he was in favor of Russia establishing a military base in Abkhazia and called for the signing of a military cooperation agreement with Russia modeled on the Taiwan Relations Act. Alexander Zelin, commander of the Russian Air Forces said if such a decision was made it would \\"promote the implementation of air defense tasks\\" and noted Russia had similar cooperation with Armenia. On 16 May 2008, Yuri Baluevsky, chief of general staff of the Russian Armed Forces denied Russia had any plans to build a military base in Abkhazia. On 18 May 2008, Georgia detained five Russian peacekeepers along the administrative border with the Abkhazia region saying that their armoured personnel carrier collided with a Georgian woman's car, in the town of Zugdidi. The peacekeepers were later released. Alexander Diordiev, a Russian peacekeeping official, confirmed the detention of the Russian soldiers but said there was no collision and instead that Georgians provoked the peacekeepers in an attempt to discredit the Russians. According to Diordiev, peacekeepers were redeploying hardware near the village of Urta on the night of 17‚Äì18 May when Georgian law- enforcement officers blocked the road to the peacekeepers' armored personnel carrier and fuel tanker truck. Then a damaged Volga car approached the scene and the Georgian police claimed that the car had been damaged by the Russian peacekeepers. Diordiev said that force was used against the peacekeepers. A statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry issued on 19 May 2008 compared the Georgians' actions to those of \\"true street bandits\\" saying the Georgians used \\"crude physical force,\\" striking one peacekeeper in the head and taking two to the police station. According to the statement, only after the intervention of the Collective Forces for the Support of Peace command and the UN observation mission, were the Russian peacekeepers released. Diordiev stated that the Georgians were informed in advance that the equipment would be moved. On 19 May 2008, Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported that over the weekend Moscow's military leadership authorized peacekeepers to conduct armed operations on their own behalf if necessary. Sergei Shamba, the Abkhaz foreign minister, said the report was \\"credible.\\" On 21 May 2008 heavy gunfire was reported near the Abkhaz administrative border. A Georgian interior ministry official said two buses of passengers going to vote in the Georgian elections were fired upon. Some reports said the bridge, connecting Abkhazia and Georgian region of Mingrelia, was blocked by Abkhaz separatists during the elections in Georgia. Georgian officials accused Abkhazia of the attacks and preventing Georgians from voting in the legislative elections. Abkhaz president Sergei Bagapsh denied these allegations, instead saying that the attack occurred on the Georgian territory and Georgians living in Abkhazia were not interested in voting. Abkhazia said Russian peacekeepers were sent to the border to prevent further violence. Georgia's Foreign Ministry sent a protest note to the CIS secretariat demanding illegal Russian troops and armaments to be immediately withdrawn from Abkhazia, saying that according to the UN, an airborne battalion, 50 BMD-2 airborne combat vehicles, and two artillery batteries had been deployed in Abkhazia. The ministry said this deployment contradicted a 1995 resolution of the CIS presidents' council. On 15 June 2008, media reports said that Russia had set up a military base near the village of Agubedia in Abkhazia's Ochamchira District and had deployed heavy armor there. Russia's Defense Ministry denied the report. The Georgian-backed Abkhaz government-in- exile said on 17 June, that Russia refused to allow UN observers in the area. On 17 June 2008, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman warned that Tbilisi's proposal to review the status of the peacekeeping operation in the Georgia- Abkhazia conflict zone could \\"unfreeze\\" the conflict, while the situation in the Caucasus as a whole could \\"slip out of control.\\" On 17 June 2008, Georgia detained four Russian peacekeepers and a military truck in the conflict zone between Georgia proper and Abkhazia. Georgia's Interior Ministry said that the peacekeepers were transporting 35 crates of ammunition, including guided missiles and anti-tank mines, thus violating the existing agreements. Russia's Defense Ministry said the arrest was \\"in violation of all regulatory norms in the buffer zone.\\" The peacekeepers were released after nine hours of interrogation. Lieutenant General Alexander Burutin, a deputy head of the General Staff, on 19 June compared the detention to \\"a bandit attack\\", saying Russian peacekeepers had every right to use their weapons. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Russia would not tolerate such actions against peacekeepers. A Russian military expert, Pavel Felgenhauer, commenting on the situation in the conflict zone predicted war between Georgia and Abkhazia if provocations didn't stop. Felgenhauer said that Vladimir Putin had already decided to start a war against Georgia in Abkhazia and South Ossetia supposedly in late August 2008. Provocations against Georgia would begin in the Upper Abkhazia and South Ossetia, then the war would spread to the rest of Georgia. On 23 June 2008, Georgian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigol Vashadze met with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin. The sides discussed a broad spectrum of bilateral relations, including the situation in Abkhazia. On 30 June, Abkhaz separatist government claimed Georgian special services were responsible for the terrorism in Abkhazia. There was one blast in Sukhumi and two were in Gagra. These blasts wounded two in Sukhumi and six in Gagra. Abkhazia threatened to close the border with Georgia in response to the bombing. = May and June events in South Ossetia = Georgia's foreign minister, Eka Tkeshelashvili, said on 15 May 2008 that Georgia would regard any increase in Russian peacekeepers in South Ossetia as a \\"gross encroachment on Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity\\". In late May 2008, there were about 1,000 Russian peacekeepers in South Ossetia. In South Ossetia three explosions occurred near the administrative border. A bomb exploded meters away from a line of Georgian military vehicles. Georgian and South Ossetian authorities called the blasts a \\"provocation\\". Georgian Deputy Defense Minister Batu Kutelia accused the South Ossetian administration of being responsible, saying they had taken up \\"tactics of terrorism.\\" On 20 May 2008, Taymuraz Mamsurov, president of the Russian Republic of North Ossetia, asked foreign ambassadors for their support in uniting the province with South Ossetia. Georgian Ambassador to Russia Erosi Kitsmarishvili said such unification would contravene international law. South Ossetia's President Eduard Kokoity hailed Mamsurov's pronouncement saying \\"South Ossetia's main goal is unification with North Ossetia in the Russian Federation. We make no secret of this in front of the international community.\\" Kokoity and Dmitry Medoyev suggested an interim period where South Ossetia would be recognized as independent and then formally incorporated into Russia through a referendum. On the night of 14‚Äì15 June 2008, mortar fire and an exchange of fire broke out between South Ossetian and Georgian forces. South Ossetia claimed that mortar fire was launched from Georgian-controlled villages on Tskhinvali, the South Ossetian capital, and that their forces were responding to fire from Georgian forces on the outskirts of the capital. South Ossetian interior minister, Mikhail Mindzaev, said that the exchange of fire lasted for about four hours. Georgia denied firing the first shot, saying instead that South Ossetia had attacked the Georgian-controlled villages of Ergneti, Nikozi and Prisi. One person was killed and four injured in the clashes, and several houses were reportedly damaged. In a separate incident, a 14-year-old boy was injured by a land mine near Ergneti; he later died of his injuries. According to South Ossetia, five people were wounded during the violence and one of them died later. Russian, Georgian, and North Ossetian peacekeepers as well as Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe monitors went to the site of the clashes. They came under fire near Ergneti, with no injuries. The fire exchange began on the night of 15 June at 11:38 PM and lasted for half an hour. Automatic firearms and grenade launchers were used. Aleksandr Dugin, leader of the International Eurasian movement, who was known for his strong ties with the Russian military and intelligence, visited South Ossetia in late June 2008. On 30 June he said at a press conference: \\"Russia has practically decided to recognize [Abkhazia and South Ossetia], and you have perfectly prepared everything for this. [...] If Russia recognizes independence of South Ossetia and deploys there not peacemaking but Russian border troops, the issue of Georgia joining NATO either will be removed from the agenda for a long time, or this will mean direct conflict with the United States. [...] So, we must recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia before December.\\" = Russian spy accusation = On 16 May 2008 it was reported that Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed to have intercepted a Chechen spy working for Georgia who was trying to help rebels in the North Caucasus. The alleged agent was identified as Ramzan Turkoshvili, a Georgian-born Russian citizen, who the unnamed FSB official said was recruited by Georgian intelligence officers working with Zelimkhan Khangashvili. Khangashvili's group was accused of being involved in a 2004 attack in the Russian Republic of Ingushetia that left nearly 100 people dead, many of them policemen. An unidentified FSB official also claimed Georgian intelligence paid Turkoshvili to establish contacts with militants in the North Caucasus and help Georgia finance them. The detention was cast as proof that confirmed that Georgia's security service was \\"participating in disruptive terrorist activities in the North Caucasus.\\" The spokesman for Georgian Interior Ministry, Shota Utiashvili denied the accusations and called it \\"a continuation of Russia's policy of provocation toward Georgia, which has taken a particularly acute form recently.\\" = Russian railway troops in Abkhazia = On 31 May 2008, Russia sent its railway troops to repair a railway line in Abkhazia. The Russian defence ministry claimed they were unarmed. Georgia condemned the move as an \\"aggressive\\" step aimed against the territorial integrity of Georgia. The US Department of State also said that it was \\"dismayed\\" by the deployment. Temur Mzhavia, chairman of the exiled Supreme Council of Abkhazia, claimed that Russia planned to recognize Abkhazia on 27 September, when the Abkhaz celebrate an \\"independence day\\", but Vyacheslav Kovalenko, Russia's ambassador to Georgia, dismissed such claims as \\"fabrications\\". The new Russian troops' arrival in Abkhazia preceded by a few days a planned meeting between the presidents Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia and Dmitry Medvedev of Russia on the sidelines of a CIS summit in Saint Petersburg on 6‚Äì7 June. It was reported that Saakashvili would hold a phone conversation with Medvedev on 3 June to discuss the deployment of Russian engineering units in Abkhazia. On 3 June, NATO's secretary general Jaap de Hoop Scheffer accused Russia of breaching Georgia's sovereignty by sending in military railway personnel and demanded their withdrawal. On 7 June 2008, the Russian defense minister Anatoliy Serdyukov said the railroad troops would leave within two months after they would have finished work on the railroad. Moscow claimed to have found an anti-tank mine on 13 June on the section of the Abkhaz railway, which was being repaired by the Russian Railway Forces. Russia claimed this was an attempt at carrying out a \\"subversive- terrorist act\\" against the Russian Federation's Railway Forces. On 18 June 2008, a military official announced the security of the Russian railway troops had been increased, following two blasts on the railway near Sukhumi. Abkhaz police suspected the bombings were targeted at Russian railway forces. Malkhaz Akishbaya, chairman of the Georgian-backed Abkhaz government in exile, claimed the blast was a next provocation aimed at discrediting Georgia. He also said it was directed at legalizing the presence of Russian railway troops. On 23 June 2008 Sergei Bagapsh said the railways repaired by the Russian railway troops would be used to transport construction material for a sports complex to be used in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. On 24 July 2008 the Russian Defense Ministry said Russian railroad troops had almost finished repair work on the railway in Abkhazia and would withdraw in early August. A spokesman for the Defense Ministry said there would be a ceremony for resuming the operation of the fixed section at the end of July, and the troops would return to their bases in Russia after taking part in the ceremony. Russian railroad troops began pulling out of Abkhazia on 30 July 2008. After the war broke out, a part of the 9,000 Russian troops who went into Georgia from Abkhazia travelled with their hardware via the repaired railway. = New peace efforts = On 5 March 2008, Georgia withdrew from Joint Control Commission for Georgian‚ÄìOssetian Conflict Resolution. Georgia proposed a format which also envisaged active roles for the EU, OSCE and the Sanakoyev administration. Russian special envoy Yuri Popov said that it was too early to include Sanakoyev in the JCC negotiations. On 28 March 2008, the President of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, speaking at an international conference \\"The Role of Non- Governmental Organisations in the Processes of Reintegration in Georgia\\" organised by the Office of the Georgian State Minister for Reintegration, unveiled a series of new proposals designed to resolve the Abkhaz conflict. These initiatives included a joint free economic zone, Abkhaz representation in the central government with an Abkhaz vice-president, the right to veto all Abkhaz-related decisions, unlimited autonomy and various security guarantees. However, when United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia delivered the proposals to Abkhaz separatists, they refused. On 15 May 2008, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution in which it recognized the right of return of all refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) to Abkhazia. The resolution stressed the importance of retaining the property rights of the refugees and IDPs and underlined the need for a timetable to ensure the voluntary return of all refugees and IDPs. Russia voted against the Georgian- sponsored resolution. The Russian Foreign Ministry said that Georgia's submission of the draft was \\"a counterproductive step\\". On 5 June 2008, the European Parliament adopted a resolution expressing its concern at the escalation of the situation in Abkhazia. The resolution deplored deployment of Russian forces to Abkhazia to restore the rail and road infrastructure and supported Georgia's territorial integrity. The resolution called on the Russian Federation to withdraw its additional troops from Abkhazia immediately. The EP declared that the Russian peacekeepers had lost their neutrality and the present peacekeeping format must be revised, with a deeper European involvement in the conflicts. On 7 June 2008, fifteen EU ambassadors headed by EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Javier Solana completed a two-day visit to Abkhazia. After meeting with Solana, Abkhaz president Sergei Bagapsh said: \\"There is no alternative to the Russian peacekeepers in the region. Their replacement with any other troops will not be discussed with anyone... If Georgia wants them out of its territory, we will do everything for them to remain in Abkhazia.\\" Solana said that the conflict could not be resolved without Russia and Russia was a key player in the peace process. Giorgi Baramidze, the Georgian deputy prime minister and minister on European and Euro-Atlantic integration said: \\"Georgia is ready to sign a ceasefire agreement with Abkhazia if it is guaranteed by the European Union.\\" Baramidze said that earlier agreements without an effective guarantor had resulted in the loss of Gagra, Sukhumi and the main part of Abkhazia for Georgia. He added, \\"We are ready for constructive dialogue both with the Russians and the separatists. We want to carry out our peace plan, which primarily entails the introduction of neutral and genuinely peace-oriented European and international peacekeepers, and decent, safe and unconditional return of refugees.\\" On 28 June 2008, the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE supported the preservation of Georgia's territorial integrity. \\"We want to find a compromise and a peaceful resolution of this issue,\\" OSCE PA President G√∂ran Lennmarker said. In late June-early July 2008, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier presented his three-stage peace plan to a United Nations group of experts on Abkhazia in the Foreign Ministry in Berlin. Phase one of the plan envisaged a year of trust-building measures and the return of around 250,000 refugees to Abkhazia. The second phase would see the beginning of reconstruction work. The third phase would involve finding a political solution to the conflict. Steinmeier's plan was met with the approval of U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, as well as Georgian president Saakashvili. On 8 July 2008, the United States Department of State called on the central Georgian government and the Abkhaz de facto authorities to resume direct talks. The Department of State also called for International Police Force presence in Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone. The State Department spokesman also spoke about visit of Condoleezza Rice to Georgia, who would encourage a peaceful resolution of the Abkhaz and South Ossetian conflicts. However, Abkhaz leader Sergei Bagapsh ruled out the possibility of replacing the Russian peacekeepers with an international police force. On 14 July 2008, the Abkhaz leader Sergei Bagapsh met with Hans-Dieter Lukas, special envoy of the German Foreign Ministry for Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Caucasus, who briefed the Abkhaz side about the peace plan. On the same day EU Special Representative for the South Caucasus Peter Semneby met with Abkhaz leader Sergei Bagapsh in Sukhumi. Bagapsh said that he studied a draft plan on the settlement of the Georgian- Abkhaz conflict that was worked out by the U.N. Secretary-General's Group of Friends. However he added, \\"We can‚Äôt discuss it in the form that it has been presented today.\\" Bagapsh stressed that the main condition for resuming the dialogue with Georgia was \\"the withdrawal of all armed units from the Kodori gorge and the signing of an agreement on non-use of force\\". He also said, \\"However, we are not going to discuss Abkhazia‚Äôs status with anyone. We are building an independent, democratic state.\\" Peter Semneby also met with Prime minister Alexander Ankvab and foreign minister Sergei Shamba. Sergei Shamba said that the plan needed \\"more preparation.\\" On 14 July, the U.S. Department of State said in a statement it was \\"deeply troubled\\" by Russia's acknowledgement that Russian military aircraft flew over South Ossetia. \\"Such actions raise questions about Russia's role as peacekeeper and facilitator of the negotiations and threaten stability throughout the entire region,\\" said the statement. That day, the OSCE Permanent Council held a special meeting underscoring the urgency of the resumption of dialogue between Georgian and South Ossetian authorities to de-escalate tensions. On 15 July 2008, NATO said it was troubled by Russian military overflights of Georgian territory and called into question Moscow's role as a peacekeeper and facilitator of talks between Georgia and separatists. \\"These actions raise questions about Russia's role as peacekeeper and facilitator of negotiations,\\" spokesman James Appathurai said on behalf of Jaap De Hoop Scheffer. On 16 July 2008, Georgian National Security Council Secretary Aleksandre Lomaia said that the new plan had \\"positive elements,\\" but still required \\"polishing.\\" Lomaia also said that the repatriation process of IDPs could not start until the Russian peacekeeping force was withdrawn. David Bakradze, Georgian parliament's speaker, said that if a German plan for resolving the conflict did not get wide support, Georgia would be forced to \\"unilaterally bring an influence to bear on the deployment of armed forces in Abkhazia.\\" On 17 July 2008, German Foreign Minister Steinmeier met with his Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili in Tbilisi. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the return of refugees to Abkhazia was \\"entirely unrealistic at this stage.\\" He said \\"the situation first needs to be improved and trust restored.\\" On the evening of the same day, Steinmeier met with Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili in Batumi. Saakashvili said at a briefing that Tbilisi had no intention of using force to retake Abkhazia. Steinmeier said that Germany supported the territorial integrity of Georgia and considered Abkhazia to be Georgia's inalienable part. On 18 July, Steinmeier met with Abkhaz leader Sergei Bagapsh in Gali. After his meeting with Steinmeier, Bagapsh said that Abkhazia still would not discuss German peace proposal. Bagapsh also said he planned to submit his own counterproposal. On the same day, Frank-Walter Steinmeier met with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. Lavrov called for an internationally developed \\"road map\\" to resolve the tensions over Abkhazia. However, Lavrov said the German plan was flawed because it called for the return of Georgian refugees as part of the first phase instead of at the end of the process. Steinmeier also met with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. On 23 July 2008, Daniel Fried, Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, said that it was time to stop violence in the conflict zones and to continue negotiations. He said that refugees must return to Abkhazia. He approved the German plan. On 25 July 2008, the South Ossetian separatists rejected proposal by the OSCE chairman-in-office Alexander Stubb to hold Georgia-South Ossetia meeting in Helsinki. The separatists had previously refused to participate in talks in Brussels arranged by EU on 22 July. On 25 July, the Abkhaz separatists met with Matthew Bryza, the U.S. deputy assistance secretary of state. Bryza attempted to convince the Abkhaz side to participate in talks in Berlin the following week without any preconditions. However, Abkhaz officials rejected the talks. Later on that day, Abkhaz leader Sergey Bagapsh did not rule out Sukhumi's possible participation in a meeting of the Group of Friends in Berlin. Abkhaz foreign minister Sergey Shamba also said that Sukhumi was not \\"in principle\\" against the Berlin meeting, but that did not mean the resumption of direct talks with Tbilisi. Russian ambassador to UN Vitaly Churkin said that Russia was against immediately summoning a meeting of the UN Secretary General's Group of Friends on Georgia to discuss the Abkhaz conflict. The availability of a peace plan from an unbiased Western actor would steer the process away from the Russian-controlled formats, so Russia had encouraged Sukhumi to thwart the German-proposed consultations. On 30 July 2008, a German Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Germany was closely involved in attempts to arrange high-level talks between the Georgian and Abkhaz sides. A previous proposal to hold a meeting in Berlin on 30‚Äì31 July failed to materialise as the Abkhaz separatists refused to attend. On 31 July 2008, Abkhaz president Sergei Bagapsh said the talks in Berlin would be between Georgia and the Group of UN Secretary General's Friends on Georgia (the U.K., Germany, Russia, U.S. and France) and between Abkhazia and the Group. Bagapsh also said, \\"The meeting was initially planned for July 28‚Äì29. However, this didn't suit us. We have settled on August 15‚Äì20 for the meeting.\\" On 3 August, president Sergei Bagapsh declared that the Abkhaz representatives would not meet with the U.N. Secretary-General's Group of Friends. Bagapsh cited the events in the Georgian-South Ossetian conflict zone as reason for this, claiming Georgia was pursuing \\"a policy of genocide\\". That day, a phone conversation was held between Georgian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Vashadze and Russian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Karasin. The Georgian side stressed that the complicated situation in the South Ossetian conflict zone was caused by ineffective format of negotiations and peacekeeping operation. Vashadze said that the Georgian side was ready for direct negotiations. = July 2008 events = The overall situation in South Ossetia seriously deteriorated in early July 2008. A South Ossetian police official was killed in a bomb attack on 3 July 2008 and that was followed by an intense exchange of gun fire. Later, a convoy carrying Dmitry Sanakoyev, the head of the Tbilisi-backed South Ossetian provisional administration was attacked and three of his security guards were injured. On 4 July 2008 two people were killed as a result of shelling and shooting in Tskhinvali and some villages in South Ossetia. The South Ossetian Press and Information Committee reported that a South Ossetian militiaman had been killed and another injured in an attack on a police post in the village of Ubiat and this was followed by the shelling of Tskhinvali, which resulted in the death of one man. According to South Ossetia, the shelling involved the use of mortars and grenade launchers. Georgia said it had opened fire in response to the shelling by South Ossetian militiamen of Georgian-controlled villages. South Ossetia called up military reservists and put its security forces on alert in response to the clashes. The head of Russia's peacekeeping troops in the region was quoted as saying extra soldiers could be deployed if the stand-off worsened. South Ossetia warned it would move heavy weaponry into the conflict zone with Georgia if attacks on the republic were not stopped. On 6 July 2008 a bomb in Gali, Abkhazia killed four people and injured six. Abkhaz authorities claimed that the chain of bombings was done by Georgian spies. Abkhazia called on G8 countries, the UN and the OSCE to stop a \\"terror threat from Georgia.\\" Abkhazia also cut off all contact with Georgia in response to the bombing. Georgia condemned the bombings and blamed them on Russia, claiming the attacks were being done in the interest of a prolonged presence of Russian armed forces in Georgia. The Georgian Ministry of Defense said on 7 July that a group of up to ten militiamen were apparently prevented from placing mines on a Georgian-controlled by-pass road linking the Georgian villages in the north of Tskhinvali with the rest of Georgia. The Georgian side opened fire and the group was forced to retreat towards the nearby South Ossetian-controlled village. On 8 July 2008 South Ossetia reported that it had detained four \\"officers from the artillery brigade of the Georgian Ministry of Defense\\" close to the village of Okona in the Znauri district at the administrative border the night before. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili told police to prepare an operation to free the four soldiers. Russian military jets flew over South Ossetia on 8 July 2008. On 9 July, the deputy commander of Georgia's air force, Colonel Zurab Pochkua said: \\"For almost 40 minutes, four Russian planes were circling over the territory north of Tskhinvali.\\" In turn Russia accused Georgia of \\"a serious breach\\" of the flight ban, with a spokesman for Russian peacekeepers in South Ossetia saying two Georgian Su-25 fighter jets flew over the region. On 10 July, the Russian authorities confirmed the flight and said, in an official statement, the fighters were sent to \\"let hot heads in Tbilisi cool down.\\" This was Russia's first admission in a decade that its air force had flown over Georgian territory without permission. Moscow had always denied earlier overflights. The Russian overflight was ordered less than 24 hours before the U.S. Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, was due to arrive in Georgia. In response, Georgia recalled its ambassador to Moscow \\"for consultations\\", stating that it was \\"outraged by Russia's aggressive policies.\\" On 8 July 2008, the U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice before her arrival in Tbilisi said that granting NATO Membership Action Plan to Georgia would help resolve the Abkhaz and South Ossetian problems. The statement caused a negative outcry in Moscow: the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov responded, during his meeting with the de facto Abkhaz president Sergei Bagapsh, that Georgia's NATO integration process \\"may undermine the conflict resolution\\" process. Rice arrived in Georgia on 9 July. \\"Frankly, some of the things that Russia did over the last couple of months added to tensions in the region,\\" she said in Tbilisi. \\"Georgia is an independent state. It has to be treated like one. We have said that both Georgia and Russia need to avoid provocative behavior.\\" On 11 July 2008 Deputy Foreign Minister Grigol Vashadze called for an urgent UN Security Council meeting on the conflict zones. The U.N. Security Council discussed the overflights at a closed meeting on 21 July, however no decision was reached. Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin denounced the \\"pro-Georgian bias\\" of some Security Council members. On 10 July 2008, Colonel General Sergey Makarov, the commander of the North Caucasus Military District (SKVO), said \\"The major tasks for SKVO in the event of an escalation or the launch of combat action between the conflicting sides are: the provision of assistance to the peacekeeping troops so as to separate the forces of the conflicting sides; the provision of humanitarian assistance to the population residing in the conflict zones.\\" A South Ossetian envoy on 11 July 2008 declared that South Ossetia was capable of repelling any attack by Georgia without help from Russia and also said the mainly Russian peacekeeping contingent in the Georgian-South Ossetian conflict zone should be increased. That day the Russian Ministry of Defense said in a statement that measures had been taken \\"to increase the combat readiness\\" of the Russian peacekeeping forces stationed in Abkhazia. It also said that security had been tightened at the Russian peacekeepers' base camps, observation posts and checkpoints, and \\"additional training\\" of the peacekeeping personnel had been conducted \\"to explain regulations governing the use of firearms while on duty.\\" Nika Rurua, Deputy Head of the Parliament's Security and Defense Committee, warned Georgia would shoot down Russia's military aircraft should they appear in its airspace again. The initiative was considered to this effect. But Georgian lawmakers decided instead to appeal to the world community on the matter. Media reports published information about Russia's alleged plans to seize the Kodori Gorge specifying that the details of the operation were worked out by Russian high- ranking military officials, with Abkhazia's President Sergei Bagapsh. In response to Georgia's summoning of a special UNSC session, the sources of Kommersant with the Russian Foreign Office claimed that Russia would reveal the details of a planned military invasion of South Ossetia by Georgia to release the detained Georgian officers. On 14 July 2008 Georgia's deputy defense minister Batu Kutelia said Georgia planned to expand its military more than 15 percent to 37,000 soldiers to counter Russian aggression. The additional manpower would be used to defend Georgia's airspace and the Black Sea coast. Also on 15 July, Abkhazia and South Ossetia were said to be planning to join the Union of Russia and Belarus. A spokesman for the Union said both regions had talked about joining the Union, but that they would need to be recognized as independent and become observers before they could join the Union as members. According to media reports, on 19 July 2008 a Georgian police post was attacked by Abkhaz militias using grenades; one Abkhaz militiaman died from a grenade exploding accidentally. Abkhaz officials denied attack on the Georgian police post. Georgian media also reported on 19 July that a battalion of Russian troops had moved into the lower Kodori Gorge. Georgia's Defense Ministry claimed Russian troops encroached on strategic passes of the Main Caucasus Ridge and were in the combat alert. Commenting on alleged Russian deployment to the Kodori Gorge, Abkhazia's Foreign Minister said no new troops were brought in to Abkhazia over the quota. On 20 July 2008, South Ossetian official media concluded its news report by saying that \\"But the fact that events in the Georgian-Ossetian conflict zone continue to be one of the most interesting topics for discussion even at the international level, is a good sign that allows us to hope for a positive solution of the issue of freedom and independence of the Republic of South Ossetia in the near future.\\" A U.N. report issued on 23 July 2008 covering the period between April and July 2008 noted discrepancies with the Georgian account of a shooting in Khurcha on the day of Georgian elections. In particular the report noted the way the incident was filmed suggested the attack was anticipated. The report said reconnaissance flights by Georgia were a violation of the ceasefire, but said the shooting down of those fights also constituted a breach of the ceasefire. Concerning a military buildup by Georgia the UN report said it found no evidence of a buildup but noted observers were denied access to certain areas of Abkhazia controlled by Georgia, including the Kvabchara Valley. On 25 July 2008, one person was killed from a bomb blast in Tskhinvali. On 28 July 2008, the Russian command of the Joint Peacekeeping Forces said South Ossetian forces had blocked peacekeepers and OSCE observers from the village of Cholibauri which was close to where Georgia said South Ossetia was building fortifications. South Ossetian armed militias fired at the peacekeepers and OSCE observers. Georgian media reported that Georgian posts on the Sarabuki heights were attacked by South Ossetian forces overnight and early on 29 July, with no injuries reported. The Georgian village of Sveri was shelled with small arms and rocket-propelled grenades by the South Ossetians on the morning of 29 July. The peacekeepers and OSCE observers visited the area to investigate an exchange of fire, however they were fired upon at 10 AM. On the late evening of the same day, South Ossetia said two South Ossetian villages had been fired on by Georgian forces in response to South Ossetia reinforcing its positions on the perimeter of the conflict zone. According to the South Ossetian Press and Information Committee, one person was injured. At the end of July South Ossetia confirmed it had been setting up military fortifications in the conflict zone and acknowledged this violated previous agreements, but claimed it was in response to similar actions by the Georgian side. According to Colonel Wolfgang Richter, a military adviser to the German Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) mission, Georgia concentrated troops along the South Ossetian border in July. =Military exercises= According to anonymous European diplomat, Russia's defense chief talked to a group of his NATO counterparts in April 2008 and warned them of an invasion of Georgia later in 2008. In early July 2008, OSInform Information Agency published several articles where the participation of the Russian army in the future \\"peace enforcement\\" operation in Georgia was discussed. One of the articles said that the planned Russian exercises were not accidental and this suggested a military operation on the foreign soil. On 5 July 2008, the Russians began military exercises, dubbed Caucasus Frontier 2008, in the North Caucasus. On 15 July 2008 the U.S. and Russia both began exercises in the Caucasus though Russia denied the timing was intentional. The Russian exercises, dubbed Caucasus 2008 involved units of the North Caucasus Military District, mainly the 58th Army, the 4th Air Force Army, Interior Ministry troops, and border guards. The exercises included training to support peacekeepers in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. A Russian army spokesman Igor Konashenkov said that around 700 pieces of military hardware would be used during the exercises. Georgia said the exercises were a manifestation of Russian aggression against it. The Georgian Foreign Ministry said in a statement: \\"Not a single document on conflict resolution authorises Russian armed forces to carry out any kind of activity on the territory of Georgia.\\" During exercises a leaflet entitled \\"Soldier! Know your probable enemy!\\" (that described the Georgian Armed Forces) was circulated among the Russian participants. The Russian exercises ended on 2 August. Russian troops remained near the Georgian border after the end of their exercise, instead of returning to their bases. The US exercises were called \\"Immediate Response 2008\\" and included forces from the United States, Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Armenia. 127 U.S. trainers participated in the exercises. The Georgian 4th Brigade (which later participated in the war) took part in the Georgian exercise with 1,000 American troops, and Russia accused the United States of aiding Georgian attack preparations. Joint exercises focused on counterinsurgency operations and a Georgian brigade was prepared for duty in Iraq. The joint exercises of the US and Georgian Armed Forces ended on 31 July. On 6 August the Georgian Defense Ministry announced a two-week exercise, \\"Georgian Express 2008\\", would take place with 180 British military personnel, starting in September. War In the first week of August 2008, a number of confrontations took place in South Ossetia after Ossetian separatists attacked Georgian positions. The crisis gave rise on 7 August 2008, when South Ossetian separatists began shelling Georgian villages several hours after President Saakashvili had called for a cease-fire and resumption of peace talks. Georgia launched a large-scale military operation against South Ossetia. Post-war events in 2008 On 26 August 2008, Russia officially recognized both South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states. In response to Russia's recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the Georgian government announced that the country had cut all diplomatic relations with Russia. On 28 August 2008, South Ossetian representative Mikhail Mindzaev claimed that Georgian pilotless aerial vehicle was shot down during the night. In the beginning of September 2008, the White House announced a $1 billion program of economic aid for Georgia, with about half going to Georgia before President Bush would leave office. On 10 September 2008, a Georgian policeman was killed allegedly by Russian soldiers in a village north of Gori. The shooting happened several hundred meters from a Russian checkpoint in Karaleti, twelve miles from South Ossetia. Russian officials denied responsibility, saying that it may have been perpetrated by South Ossetians. On 13 September 2008, a Georgian policeman was killed in Ganmukhuri on the administrative border between Abkhazia and Georgia. On 21 September 2008, a Georgian policeman was killed and three wounded on the administrative border between Abkhazia and Georgia. Georgian authorities stated the incident occurred at the time when shots were fired \\"from the direction of the [nearby] Russian army checkpoint\\", with the following exchange of fire between Georgian police and Abkhaz-controlled territory lasting for several minutes. On 22 September 2008, two Georgian policemen were wounded by a mine on the administrative border between Abkhazia and Georgia. On 24 September 2008, Georgian police detained a Russian military truck near the village of Odzisi in the Mtskheta Municipality. The truck contained ammunitions and explosives. The Russian driver said he had lost his way. He was handed over to OSCE observers. On 25 September 2008, a 13-year-old South Ossetian resident was killed when an explosive device blew up on the outskirts of Tskhinvali. On 3 October 2008, seven Russian soldiers were killed and another seven wounded by a car bomb that exploded near the Russian military base. Among them was Colonel Ivan Petrik, the peacekeeper's Chief of Staff. The Russians accused the Georgians of orchestrating the \\"terrorist attack\\", claiming that just before the blast, the Russians arrested two cars, four Georgians and seized light firearms and two grenades. \\"The cars and the detained people were escorted to Tskhinvali. During the search of one of the cars, an explosive device equivalent to some 20 kg of TNT went off,\\" a military spokesman told Interfax. The South Ossetian leader accused Georgia of \\"state terrorism\\". \\"The latest terrorist attacks in South Ossetia prove that Georgia has not renounced its policy of state terrorism,\\" he said. \\"We have no doubt that these terrorist acts are the work of Georgia special forces.\\" The Georgian government blamed Russia for the incident. \\"If provocations and tensions are in the interest of anyone, it's the Russians,\\" the Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili told the Reuters news agency, \\"They are doing everything not to pull troops out within the set term\\". Georgia also said it would have had to find Ossetians to take the car into the Russian- controlled area. \\"I don't understand the logic. How could the Georgian secret service plan that the Ossetians would steal the car and that the Russians would take it to their base. Are we geniuses or what?\\" Utiashvili said. The French Presidency of the European Union condemned the attack. On 6 October 2008, an Abkhaz border guard was shot and killed near the administrative border between Abkhazia and Georgia. On 18 October 2008, Georgian media reported that a bridge in the Adzva village in the Gori district was partially blown up by allegedly Ossetians. On 21 October 2008, the police car was blown up by a mine near the village of Avnevi and one policeman was injured. In mid- October 2008, South Ossetian police were given orders to return fire should they be on the receiving end of a firing from the Georgian side. This was seen as directive that could increase the threat of new violence. South Ossetia's top police official issued this order in response to a police post coming under automatic weapons fire from an ethnic Georgian village. The acting Interior Minister Mikhail Mindzayev said nobody was hurt by the gunfire, although he did refer to it as a series of provocations by Georgians forces. On 25 October 2008, a bomb exploded in the Georgian town of Mujava near the administrative border with Abkhazia killing a villager and the governor of the Tsalenjikha district of Georgia, Giorgi Mebonia. In early November 2008, a parliamentary investigation in Ukraine found that the country supplied weapons to Georgia prior to the war. One MP even claimed that Ukraine still continued to arm Georgia. On 9 November 2008, in the morning two Georgian policemen were killed and three injured after the police car was exploded by a mine on the road near the village of Dvani. In late November 2008, an official in the Russian Ministry of Defence told Gazeta Daily that construction of the Russian military bases in Abkhazia and South Ossetia would cost around $US 400 million. The bases in South Ossetia would cost more than $US 200 million and building bases in Abkhazia would cost a little less, because the Soviet military infrastructure remained there. Relations in 2009 On 19 January 2009, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed a law making it illegal to sell, supply, or transfer military production to Georgia, and prohibiting the use of Russian railways, waters, and airspace for military co-operation with Georgia. According to RIA Novosti, countries or individuals found to be in breach of these regulations would face economic and financial sanctions. The sanctions were to last until December 2011. Russia had earlier tried to have an international arms embargo on Georgia imposed, but the initiative failed to meet widespread international support. Georgia declared the decree \\"inadequate\\". Georgian military experts claimed that it would influence illegal arms supplies. Georgia also claimed that Russian arms being used by its military would soon be replaced by European hardware. On 19 and 21 January, Russia requested that Georgia allow its experts access to Georgian military installations for evaluation and verification checks in accordance with a 1999 Vienna OSCE document on confidence and security-building measures. Georgia rejected these requests. On 23 January 2009, Russia expressed concern over \\"Georgia's expanding military presence on the borders of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.\\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had said, \\"EU monitors working in areas adjacent to South Ossetia and Abkhazia have been reporting a buildup of Georgian military units and special forces near the borders with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and our 'technical devices' have also recorded this. Provocations also occur sporadically. We are concerned by this.\\" On 26 January 2009, Russian junior sergeant Alexander Glukhov appeared in Tbilisi. He gave press interviews at McDonald's in the presence of Georgian Interior Ministry officials. The 21-year-old claimed that bad living conditions and problems with his superior forced him to desert: \\"I had very bad relations with my commander. He didn't like anything I did and that was why I left.\\" According to Georgian interior ministry sources, he appealed for permission to remain in Georgia. On 28 January the soldier announced on Georgian TV that he asked for political asylum in Georgia. The same day Russia demanded his release, claiming that he was captured in the Akhalgori district of South Ossetia and taken to Tbilisi and that he might be tortured: \\"Aleksandr Glukhov was captured by the Georgian military in South Ossetia and taken to Tbilisi. It is another information provocation by the Georgian authorities. Under physical or psychological pressure or threats, he could have said anything,\\" said Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Aleksandr Drobyshevsky. The soldier's mother was quoted as saying: \\"We periodically talk on the phone and I have an impression that he cannot speak freely as somebody is next to him\\". On 13 February 2009 members of the pro-Kremlin youth movement Nashi gathered near the Georgian embassy demanding the return of Glukhov. On 2 February 2009, at a meeting with EU envoys, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko expressed concern over the build-up of Georgian troops on the border with South Ossetia. \\"Grushko expressed concern in connection with the build-up of a Georgian military presence on South Ossetia's borders,\\" the Foreign Ministry declared in a statement. \\"The increased activity of their [Georgian] special units has been reported on the eastern part of the South Ossetian border.\\" On 6 February 2009, Georgia submitted the application against Russia to the European Court of Human Rights, to continue the process that started on 11 August 2008. In February 2009, Pavel Felgenhauer, a military analyst, claimed that Russia planned to invade Georgia from South Ossetia in order to topple the Saakashvili government. On 2 March 2009, deputy chief of Russia's General Staff Anatoly Nogovitsyn issued the statement that the human remains that Georgia had returned, belonged to the pilot of a TU-22 reconnaissance bomber shot down during the war. On 22 April 2009, shooting took place on the administrative border between Georgia and South Ossetia. Both sides reported automatic weapons fire, and blamed each other for the incident. In May 2009, former U.S. Ambassadors to Georgia William Courtney and Kenneth Yalowitz, and the former European Commission ambassador to Georgia, Denis Corboy, called on the United States to lead efforts at preventing a \\"new tragedy\\" in Georgia. They cited Russia's military buildup in the country and Moscow's resentment over the \\"unfinished business\\" of the August 2008 Russo-Georgian War. By 1 August 2009, at least 28 Georgian policemen patrolling the South Ossetian administrative boundary had been killed by sniper fire or mines during the first year after the end of the war. On 1 August 2009, Russian Defense Ministry said that Georgia had previously opened fire on the South Ossetian territory several times in the past few days. The EU Monitoring Mission in Georgia (EUMM) said its patrols on the ground did not see any evidence to confirm that any firing had taken place. Earlier, the spokesman for EUMM had said that four explosions took place on the South Ossetian side of the administrative border, but causes were not known. The EU Monitoring Mission in Georgia also said that its unarmed patrols were blocked from entering South Ossetia and EUMM needed access to areas \\"where the incidents are purported to have taken place\\" in order to make a \\"more complete assessment of the situation on the ground.\\" On 3 August 2009, South Ossetian separatists threw grenades into Georgian and Russian checkpoints. The next day, South Ossetia accused Georgia of opening fire on 3 August. On 3 August 2009, RIA Novosti published an interview with South Ossetian president Eduard Kokoity. Kokoity said that he ruled out a new \\"Georgian aggression\\". He said he would demand ceding of the Truso Gorge (part of the Georgian administrative unit of Mtskheta-Mtianeti) to South Ossetia. He also talked about Georgian president Saakashvili: \\"As for that lover of wars and bellicose slogans, that international criminal, I would advise him to be careful. Considering his behavior, Georgia has a shortage of mental hospitals.\\" On 4 August 2009, it was reported that tensions were rising before the war's first anniversary. The European Union urged \\"all sides to refrain from any statement or action that may lead to increased tensions at this particularly sensitive time.\\" Georgia's Foreign Ministry condemned Russia's \\"deliberate attempts\\" to escalate the situation. Mikheil Saakashvili urged the US and EU to defuse the tensions. On 5 August 2009, Russia claimed that the United States continued to deliver large amounts of weapons to Georgia. Yulia Latynina wrote in The Moscow Times that events in South Ossetia were unfolding according to last year's scenario. As soon as the U.S. Vice President Joe Biden had announced that the United States would not provide arms to Georgia, the South Ossetian president Eduard Kokoity claimed that Tskhinvali had come under fire from the Georgian village of Nikozi. Latynina argued: \\"Considering the fact that South Ossetian forces had already wiped Nikozi off the map, his statement sounded a bit strange.\\" It would be impossible to repeat last year's scenario again, because in 2008 the world didn't pay attention to the fact that before the war started, South Ossetian forces were shelling Georgian territory while declaring their readiness to launch a \\"counterstrike\\" against Georgian cities. Latynina concluded that if the conflict was renewed, nobody would believe that Kokoity had started the war; everyone would conclude that it had been Putin. Close to the one year anniversary of the start of the war, internet attacks occurred that targeted one Georgian user. The Twitter account of a Georgian blogger, Cyxymu came under attack, leading to a several-hour-long downtime of the entire service. On 14 August 2009, Shota Utiashvili, Georgia's Interior Ministry representative said that the South Ossetian side had confessed to shelling of the Georgian villages. In late September 2009, the explosion occurred with no casualties on a road near the village of Ergneti, south of Tskhinvali, when a police car drove over it. The explosion happened 40 minutes before a meeting between the Georgian, South Ossetian, and Russian sides to discuss the situation in the region and ways to implement a mechanism for incident prevention. In October 2009, Ukrainian MP Valery Kovaluk claimed that Ukraine was continuing to deliver the newest military hardware to Georgia. He said that \\"Over four years, the sale of arms was worth 2.5 billion dollars, and only 200 million dollars made it to the budget.\\" In November 2009, Russian General Staff claimed that NATO countries supplied Georgia with small arms and ammunition, while Israel supplied it with unmanned aerial vehicles, and Ukraine supplied tanks and air defense. Russia also claimed that the United States was training Georgian personnel.

Located at the confluence of the Fish and Saint John Rivers, it includes Fort Kent, the only surviving American fortification built during border tensions with neighboring New Brunswick known as the Aroostook War. The park features an original log blockhouse, which is open for visits in the summer. The fort was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969 and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1973. Description Fort Kent stands on a slight rise overlooking the Saint John River, just west of the mouth of the Fish River. The Saint John is in this area part of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, and the region on both sides of the river was until the 1842 Webster-Ashburton Treaty territory disputed by both the United States and the United Kingdom, of which New Brunswick was then a colonial province. All that remains of Fort Kent is a blockhouse, two stories in height, measuring square. It is built out of hand-hewn cedar timbers, and has an overhanging second story and a pyramidal roof. Each side of the roof is pierced by a gabled dormer. The main entrance faces west, and is flanked by four rifle ports on the first floor, and there are twelve rifle ports on the first floor of each of the other three sides. On the second floor, which hangs over the first, there are eleven rifle ports on the east and west sides, and fifteen on the north and south sides. There are two cannon ports on the first floor north and south sides. The interior has been modestly disturbed to install heating and plumbing, and to provide for museum displays. History The boundary between Maine and New Brunswick was a recurring subject of disagreement following the 1783 Treaty of Paris, in which Great Britain recognized the United States. Part of the eastern border was fixed after the Jay Treaty of 1797, but the upper Saint John River area remained disputed. Both Maine and New Brunswick pressed development of the area to solidify their claims, but this consequently raised tensions beginning in the 1820s, with authorities from each government acting against the other's settlers and agents. Construction of Fort Kent, named for Governor Edward Kent, was begun 1838 as tensions reached their height. It was one of a series of forts built by the state along the southern banks of the Saint John River, and is the only one surviving. (The blockhouse at Fort Fairfield is a 20th-century reconstruction.) In 1839 the arrest of a US government agent in New Brunswick prompted Congress to authorize 50,000 federal troops for assignment to northern Maine. At this time the fort was enlarged to include barracks officers' quarters, and other buildings. General Winfield Scott was sent to the area with power to negotiate a settlement. Scott and New Brunswick Lieutenant Governor John Harvey, who had a long-established friendship, were able to successfully reduce tensions until the Webster-Ashburton Treaty was negotiated in 1842. United States troops remained at the fort to 1845. After the crisis passed, the fort was sold into private hands. In 1891 the property was sold to the state of Maine for the purpose of establishing a park. The state did no substantive work on the site until 1959, when the historic site was formally established. The museum is now maintained by the Fort Kent Historical Society. Vandalism Fort Kent has been subject to numerous incidents of vandalism in recent history. Most notably in 1977 when the fort was almost burned down when an unidentified individual etched the phrase \\"Jeano was Here\\" into the exterior of the upper terrace using a portable torch. Although no arrests were made, officials believed it was a resident of the nearby town of Fort Kent. In 2010 the National Park Services removed over 500 lbs of shredded paper that vandals used to fill the interior of the Fort. This resulted in the fort being closed to the public for almost a month.

The church, on Fifth Avenue at 7 West 55th Street in Midtown Manhattan, has approximately 2,200 members and is one of the larger PCUSA congregations. The church, founded in 1808 as the Cedar Street Presbyterian Church, has been at this site since 1875. Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church (FAPC) has long been noted for its high standards in preaching and music and has been at the forefront of many movements, from the development of the Sunday school in the 19th century to its current leadership in homeless advocacy. In 2001, the church successfully sued the City of New York for the right to shelter homeless individuals on its front steps. In 1884, the joint funerals of the mother of President Theodore Roosevelt and of his first wife, Alice, were held here. In 1910, the church's historic sanctuary was the site of the wedding of TR's son, Theodore Roosevelt Jr., an event attended by the former President, and 500 of his former Rough Riders. It was also the site of the 1965 recording of A Concert of Sacred Music by Duke Ellington and his orchestra, broadcast nationally by CBS television in 1966, and of dance legend Frankie Manning's \\"rollicking three-hour memorial service\\" in 2009. Architecturally and historically, ‚ÄúFifth Avenue Presbyterian Church is famed for its sloping auditorium, its fine acoustics, its old gas brackets and reflectors. Instrumental in founding Princeton Theological Seminary, Presbyterian Hospital (now New York Presbyterian Hospital) and many a mission church, this grand house of God is often called the Cathedral of Presbyterianism.‚Äù History The congregation now known as Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church began on November 6, 1808, on the north side of Cedar Street between Nassau and William Streets in lower Manhattan. Its first name was The Presbyterian Church in Cedar Street. In 1836, the congregation moved north to the corner of Duane and Church Streets and was renamed The Presbyterian Church in Duane Street. In 1852, the congregation again moved northward, naming itself the Presbyterian Church in the Fifth Avenue at the Corner of Nineteenth Street. It moved to its current location, at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 55th Street, in 1875, when it assumed its current name. Notable early members of the congregation included Oliver Wolcott, Jr., former Secretary of the Treasury and son of a signer of the Declaration of Independence; Archibald Gracie, whose Gracie Mansion is now the residence of the mayor of New York City; and Betsey Jackson, an African American household slave. Church member Joanna Bethune (1770‚Äì1860) was a co-founder of the first benevolence association to aid poor women and children. Bethune is regarded as ‚Äúthe mother of the American Sunday School‚Äù for her work founding the first Sabbath schools for disadvantaged children. Among the first officers of the church was Richard Varick, an aide to George Washington and former mayor of New York City. The church was instrumental in founding such organizations as the New York Bible Society, the American Bible Society, Princeton Theological Seminary, and various interdenominational mission boards. In 1815, members of the congregation established the first free schools, which later were expanded into the New York Public School System. =Pastoral leadership= The congregation has called 17 senior pastors since its founding in 1808. The first, the Rev. Dr. John B. Romeyn, was 28 years old when he was called to the Cedar Street church. The son of a Dutch Reformed minister, Romeyn attended Union College in Schenectady and received a degree from Columbia College at age 18. The fourth senior pastor, the Rev. Dr. James Waddel Alexander, served two terms, from 1844 to 1849, and 1851 to 1859. During his pastorate, the church relocated from Duane Street to Nineteenth Street, where it installed a pipe organ and pioneered congregational hymn singing (a change from the formal quartets typical at other Presbyterian churches of the period). Under his leadership, the church became a leader in establishing mission chapels and Sunday schools. In 1867, a young Irish preacher, the Rev. Dr. John Hall, impressed the elders of the Nineteenth Street Church during a speaking tour of the US. The church issued a unanimous call, and Hall was installed that same year. Within five years, membership rose 50 percent, and Hall spearheaded the effort to construct a new church building (the current location on Fifth Avenue and 55th Street). The New York Times reported Hall's ‚Äúpowerful preaching and wise churchmanship made the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church one of the great religious powers in the city.‚Äù Hall led the church until his death in 1898. The Rev. J. Ross Stevenson, later President of Princeton Theological Seminary, served as pastor from 1902 to 1909. The Rev. Dr. John Henry Jowett, the renowned English preacher and writer, was pastor from 1911 to 1918. Under his pastorate, it was not uncommon for the church to have to turn away as many as 1,000 would-be worshippers on a given Sunday. The Rev. Dr. John Bonnell served as senior pastor from 1935 to 1962. Bonnell was a nationally recognized author and religious broadcaster on the ABC radio network as host of the series \\"National Vespers\\", which reached 3 million listeners weekly from 1936 until 1961. In 1956, he introduced Dial-a-Prayer, which continued as a ministry of the church for half a century. Bonnell played a leading role in the movement to strengthen ties between Protestants and Roman Catholics and was presented with a silver medal for ecumenical services by Pope Paul VI in 1966. He also served as co-chair of the National Conference of Christians and Jews. The Rev. Dr. Bryant Kirkland served as senior pastor from 1962 until 1987. Kirkland was named Clergyman of the Year in 1975 by the Religious Heritage of America. The David B. Skinner Shelter, a shelter for homeless men the church has operated since 1986, began during his pastorate. Dr. Kirkland‚Äôs term was followed by the short but tumultuous pastorate of the Rev. Dr. R. Maurice Boyd, a charismatic figure whose ministerial style alienated a large faction of the congregation and who resigned under protest in 1992. In the wake of this dissension, many of his supporters left Fifth Avenue Presbyterian to join Dr. Boyd at the City Church of New York, which he founded. After his abrupt departure, a prot√©g√© of Kirkland's, the Rev. Dr. Thomas K. Tewell, was called as senior pastor in 1994. Under Tewell's leadership, the church completed an extensive renovation of the Sanctuary and church house, and the excavation and construction of the LaDane Williamson Christian Education Center, which is home to a vibrant Family Ministries program. The current senior pastor, installed in 2008, is the Rev. Dr. Scott Black Johnston. A former professor of homiletics at Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary, he is the author of a blog about faith in New York entitled Sharp About Your Prayers. Architecture Interior in 2019 Organist playing the church's organ In 1873, the congregation purchased the undeveloped site at Fifth Avenue and 55th Street for $350,000 for construction of a new sanctuary. Church leaders believed that the recently established Central Park would be a natural barrier against business and factory expansion. With its steeple rising 286 feet high, the church was the tallest building in Manhattan when it was dedicated in 1875. Eleven architects were considered to design the new church, with the choice eventually between the renowned George B. Post, architect of the New York Stock Exchange building and the former Vanderbilt mansion on Fifth Avenue, and Carl Pfeiffer (1834‚Äì88), a little-known, 37-year- old German √©migr√©. Pfeiffer's only other prominent building in New York was the Metropolitan Savings Bank Building, designed in 1867. Remarkably, Pfeiffer got the nod. Pfeiffer's engineering skills are evident in the technological innovations he introduced in the sanctuary. Wooden louvers installed beneath the pews allowed warm air to rise into the sanctuary from steam pipes in the basement. On warm days, enormous blocks of ice were delivered to the basement, where fans blew cooling air upward. The Sanctuary did not have modern air conditioning until 2003. The church is built of New Jersey red sandstone. The clock tower employs the original clockworks installed in 1875. The clock is not electrified and must be wound once a week by hand. There are no bells or chimes in the tower; when the church was built, St. Luke's Hospital was housed in what is now the Hotel Peninsula (across 55th Street), and there was a concern church bells might disturb the patients. With a capacity of nearly 2,000, Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church is the largest Presbyterian sanctuary in Manhattan. Designed in the Victorian Gothic style, the Sanctuary interior follows strict, Reformed Protestant precepts‚Äîthe most important being the emphasis on the spoken word. The pulpit is the focal point of the Sanctuary, with the choir loft and organ above and communion table below. There are no Biblical figures or saints depicted in the Sanctuary, reflecting an iconoclastic austerity prevalent among 19th-century Presbyterians, who believed no one should be venerated other than God. One exception is the woodcarving on the front of the pulpit (above), which features the symbols of the four Gospel authors‚ÄîMatthew (angel), Mark (lion), Luke (ox) and John (eagle). Unlike most Gothic churches, the interior of the sanctuary has no right angles. The floor slopes, the pews fan outward, and the balcony surrounds all that is below, bringing the entire congregation within clear sight and hearing range of the preaching and music ministry. Most of the carved woodwork in the Sanctuary is original. The New York firm of Kimbel and Cabus designed the woodwork using ash, a durable, light-colored wood that has taken on a darker patina over time. The stained glass windows were designed and executed by John C. Spence of Montreal. Above the Fifth Avenue entrance is a mosaic of Venetian glass by the American artist Eugene Savage (1883‚Äì1978). The mosaic, depicting iconic images from the Hebrew scriptures, was added during a renovation in the early 1960s. The current chapel and church house were added to the church grounds in 1925. Both were designed by the New York architect James Gamble Rogers (1867‚Äì1947). Rogers was the favored architect of New York philanthropist Edward Harkness, who provided the funds for the project. Kirkland Chapel, named for former senior pastor Bryant M. Kirkland, offers a distinct contrast in design philosophy to the Sanctuary. All is rigidly organized in a long and narrow rectangular space from back to front, where there is a semi-circular apse with a raised pulpit off to one side and a lectern on the other. In a pre-Reformation church, the center of the apse would contain an altar, where the priest would celebrate the Eucharist. Following Reformed precepts, however, seats for the ministers replace the altar. The design accentuates the Word rather than the Eucharist as the central act of worship. Another obvious difference between the Chapel and the Sanctuary is the stained glass that shows Biblical stories and figures. (Iconoclastic sentiment was beginning to wane by the early 20th century.) The window above the ministers‚Äô seats depicts the apostles and the four evangelists. The most exquisite window in the church is above the balcony in the rear of the Chapel. It depicts Christ surrounded by seven archangels. The hardstone surfaces of the interior, with its resultant echo, make the Chapel superb for the performance of organ and choral music. Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church underwent a major renovation and expansion project beginning in 2003. The project resulted in a new Christian Education Center, carved from the unused space below the Sanctuary, and a complete renovation of the church house, including air-conditioning and fire proofing systems. Beginning in summer 2015, FAPC conducted extensive repair work to the brownstone exterior and renovated the music loft in the sanctuary. This work has been completed.

The album's lead single was successful by topping the Oricon charts for the first time. EMI released the album using CCCD at first. Then, the CCCD version was stopped producing, and the CD-DA version was newly released on July 2, 2008. The vinyl record version which is a double album was released on May 27, 2003, and contains the bonus track . The short film which expresses the world view of the album was put on the market on January 22, 2003 prior to releasing the album.  Background and recording  The album is a follow-up to Ringo Sheena‚Äôs successful second album Sh≈çso Strip (2000) and cover album Utaite My≈çri: Sono Ichi (2002). The album was due to be entitled at first.In an interview that was played in the special program for the album by Space Shower TV, Sheena revealed that \\"Kalk\\" was \\"Wonder\\", \\"Semen\\" was \\"Vulgar\\" and \\"Chestnut Flower\\" was \\"Eccentric\\". However, Sheena decided to change the title because she overheard the male staff's chats and she thought their story to be interesting. They told that the smell of semen resembled the smell of chlorine, or the smell of the chestnut flowers. She thought that the nuance of word \\"semen\\" was beautiful, and adopted it as the title. The 2001 single was to have been included on this album along with one of the single's b-sides, . However, plans were changed after it was deemed they did not match the album. It was the first time for Sheena to produce her own album herself. The album was produced in about one year longer than the period of production of the past two albums. Sheena didn‚Äôt record a band all at once as had been done in her previous albums, but recorded one instrument at a time using overdubbing and multitracking. She used not only the rock band ensemble but also the various musical instruments such as folk instruments from Japan and other regions, string instruments, wind instruments, percussion instruments, as well as music sequencer and orchestra. In order to reduce budgets, she used her own Macintosh computer and cheap recording equipment, and composed and edited the songs herself using computer software, while sometimes exchanging the arranged songs with Uni Inoue. She recorded one musical instrument in one room of her house while recording the ensemble parts (string section, etc.) in another room. Seiji Kameda who had been involved in the production and arrangement of her previous two studio albums did not participate in this work. Instead, Sheena arranged this album with audio engineer Uni Inoue. Toshiyuki Mori orchestrated each of the recorded songs and arranged the whole \\"Yattsuke Shigoto\\". In 2003, musician Takao Tajima of the band Original Love covered the song \\"Okonomi de\\" on his tour \\"Odoru Taiyo\\" Tour. Reception Kalk Samen Kuri no Hana was ranked second in CNN International Asia's list of \\"the 2000s' most under-appreciated Japanese music of the last decade\\" on December 22, 2009. Sheena also received a mention in The Guardian as one of Japan's artists who \\"deserve to be seen and heard in the west\\" in 2010. By May 2020, the album was ranked 7th overall by a Japanese artist and ranked 504th overall in the all-time album list on Rate Your Music.

The trading post was built in 1628 and lies on the Kennebec River. It is adjacent to Fort Western, an 18th-century stockade fort around which the city of Augusta grew. The site is significant as it provides a window into trading, living, and construction practices in the early period of colonial settlement in New England. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1993. Description and history The English Plymouth Colony was established at present-day Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1620 by religious dissidents and English adventurers. In order to repay the investors in the colonization effort, the colonists engaged in a number of ventures, one of which was trading with the local Native American population for furs. Pursuant to this business, the colonists in 1628 established a trading post on the Kennebec River at the site of what is now Augusta, Maine, which the Plymouth colonists called \\"Cushnoc\\". Magazine of the Fort Western Museum. The Plymouth colonists were not the only colonists trading on that river, and the Plymouth colonists are known to have operated at at least one other site in the area. They are known to have abandoned their trading on the Kennebec in 1661. In 1754 Fort Western, also a National Historic Landmark, was built \\"at a place called Cushenoc[sic] Near The Spot where one hundred years ago the late Plymouth Colony had a Garrison.\\" The Cushnoc site was identified and excavated between 1984 and 1987. It is located on the eastern bank of the Kennebec River, just south of Fort Western, on land that is partly owned by a local church. The excavation outlined the boundaries of the trading post's palisaded wall, as well as postholes of earthfast buildings erected at the site. These and other finds at the site were found beneath the surface level plow zone in sandy soil. Artifacts found were consistent with those found at other sites dating to the mid-17th century, including tobacco pipes, glass beads, utilitarian ceramics, French and Spanish earthenwares, and many hand-forged nails. The data uncovered thus far and new excavations are expected to shed light on the relationships between (and among) the English traders, the Native population, and the nearby French Acadian settlements.

The island was named \\"La Espa√±ola\\" (Hispaniola) by Christopher Columbus. In 1511, the courts of the colony were placed under the jurisdiction of the Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo. The Captaincy General of Santo Domingo had an important role in the establishment of Latin American colonies in the Western Hemisphere. It was the headquarters for Spanish conquistadors on their way to the conquest of the mainland due to its strategic location. It is the site of the first city in the Americas with the oldest castle, fortress, cathedral, and monastery in the region. The colony was a military stronghold of the Spanish Empire for over a century, being a base upon which military expeditions were launched elsewhere. In the early 17th century French pirates took over part of the west coast and French settlers arrived soon thereafter. After decades of armed conflicts, Spain finally ceded the western third of Hispaniola to France in the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697, thus establishing the basis for the later national divisions between the Dominican Republic and Haiti. 1492‚Äì1539: arrival of the Spanish Ciudad Colonial historical marker Prior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus and the Spanish in 1492, the native Ta√≠no people populated the island which they called Quisqueya (mother of all lands) and Ayiti (land of high mountains), and which the Spanish later named Hispaniola. At the time, the island's territory consisted of five chiefdoms: Mari√©n, Magu√°, Maguana, Jaragua, and Hig√ºey. These were ruled respectively by caciques (chiefs) Guacanagarix, Guarionex, Caonabo, Bohech√≠o, and Cayacoa. In 1493, Columbus came back to the island on his second voyage and founded the first Spanish colony in the New World, the city of Isabella. In 1496, his brother Bartholomew Columbus established the settlement of Santo Domingo de Guzm√°n on the southern coast, which became the new capital. An estimated 400,000 Tainos living on the island were soon enslaved to work in gold mines. By 1508, their numbers had decreased to around 60,000 because of forced labor, hunger, disease, and mass killings. By 1535, only a few dozen were still alive. Dating from 1496, when the Spanish settled on the island, and officially from 5 August 1498, Santo Domingo became the first European city in the Americas. Bartholomew Columbus founded the settlement and named it La Nueva Isabela, after an earlier settlement in the north named after the Queen of Spain Isabella I. In 1495 it was renamed \\"Santo Domingo\\", in honor of Saint Dominic. Santo Domingo came to be known as the \\"Gateway to the Caribbean\\" and the chief town in Hispaniola from then on. Spanish Expeditions which led to Ponce de Le√≥n's colonization of Puerto Rico, Diego Vel√°zquez de Cu√©llar's colonization of Cuba, Hernando Cortes' conquest of Mexico, and Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa's discovery of the Pacific Ocean were all launched from Santo Domingo. In June 1502, Santo Domingo was destroyed by a major hurricane, and the new Governor Nicol√°s de Ovando had it rebuilt on a different site on the other side of the Ozama River.Meining 1986:9 The original layout of the city and a large portion of its defensive wall can still be appreciated today throughout the Colonial Zone, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Diego Colon arrived in 1509, assuming the powers of Viceroy and admiral. In 1512, Ferdinand established a Real Audiencia with Juan Ortiz de Matienzo, Marcelo de Villalobos, and Lucas Vazquez de Ayllon appointed as judges of appeal. In 1514, Pedro Ibanez de Ibarra arrived with the Laws of Burgos. Rodrigo de Alburquerque was named repartidor de indios and soon named visitadores to enforce the laws. During this period, the colony's Spanish leadership changed several times. When Columbus departed on another exploration, Francisco de Bobadilla became governor. Settlers' allegations of mismanagement by Columbus helped create a tumultuous political situation. In 1502, Nicol√°s de Ovando replaced de Bobadilla as governor, with an ambitious plan to expand Spanish influence in the region. It was he who dealt most brutally with the Ta√≠no people. One rebel, however, successfully fought back. Enriquillo led a group who fled to the mountains and attacked the Spanish repeatedly for fourteen years. The Spanish ultimately offered him a peace treaty and gave Enriquillo and his followers their own city in 1534. The city lasted only a few years. Rebellious slaves burned it to the ground and killed all who stayed behind. In 1501, the Spanish monarchs, Ferdinand I and Isabella, first granted permission to the colonists of the Caribbean to import African slaves, which began arriving to the island in 1503. In 1510, the first sizable shipment, consisting of 250 Black Ladinos, arrived in Hispaniola from Spain. Eight years later African- born slaves arrived in the West Indies. Sugar cane was introduced to Hispaniola from the Canary Islands, and the first sugar mill in the New World was established in 1516. The need for a labor force to meet the growing demands of sugar cane cultivation led to an exponential increase in the importation of slaves over the following two decades. The sugar mill owners soon formed a new colonial elite, and initially convinced the Spanish king to allow them to elect the members of the Real Audiencia from their ranks. Poorer colonists subsisted by hunting the herds of wild cattle that roamed throughout the island and selling their hides. The enslaved population numbered between 20,000 and 30,000 in the mid-sixteenth century and included mine, plantation, cattle ranch, and domestic laborers. A small Spanish ruling class of about 1,200 monopolized political and economic power, and it used ordenanzas (laws) and violence to control the population of color. The first major slave revolt in the Americas occurred in Santo Domingo during 1522, when enslaved Muslims of the Wolof nation led an uprising in the sugar plantation of admiral Don Diego Colon, son of Christopher Columbus. Many of these insurgents managed to escape to the mountains where they formed independent maroon communities. By the 1530s, maroon bands had become so numerous that in rural areas the Spaniards could only safely travel outside their plantations in large armed groups. By 1545, there were an estimated 7,000 maroons beyond Spanish control on Hispaniola. The Bahoruco Mountains were their main area of concentration, although Africans had escaped to other areas of the island as well. From their refuges, they descended to attack the Spanish. One preeminent leader of slave revolts was Sebasti√°n Lemba. By directing a strategy of mobile, hit-and-run warfare, Lemba succeeded in resisting and evading the colonial forces for all of 15 years. Burning and sacking their way from Hig√ºey to Yaguana, Lemba's group of guerrilleros negros evaded the Spanish authorities until 1547, the year in which the troops captured and executed the rebel leader, hanging his severed head from a gateway as an example to others who would dare disobey their white masters. Slave insurrections continued through the mid-century. As accounts indicate, slave revolts in the colony of Santo Domingo anticipated Saint-Domingue's uprisings by some 267 years. 1540‚Äì1795 Casa del Cordon, Colonial Santo Domingo. By the 1540s, the Caribbean Sea had become overrun with French pirates. In 1541, Spain authorized the construction of Santo Domingo's fortified wall, and decided to restrict sea travel to enormous, well-armed convoys. In another move, which would destroy Hispaniola's sugar industry, Havana, more strategically located in relation to the Gulf Stream, was selected as the designated stopping point for the merchant flotas, which had a royal monopoly on commerce with the Americas. With the conquest of the Spanish Main, Hispaniola slowly declined. Many Spanish colonists left for the silver-mines of the American mainland, while new immigrants from Spain bypassed the island. Agriculture dwindled, new imports of slaves ceased, and white colonists, free blacks and slaves alike lived in poverty, weakening the racial hierarchy and aiding miscegenation, which resulted in a population of predominantly mixed Spaniard, African, and Taino descent. Except for the city of Santo Domingo, which managed to maintain some legal exports, Dominican ports were forced to rely on contraband trade, which, along with livestock, became the sole source of livelihood for the island dwellers. In 1586, Francis Drake captured the city and held it for ransom. Drake's invasion signaled the decline of Spanish dominion over Hispaniola, which was accentuated in the early 17th century by policies that resulted in the depopulation of most of the island outside of the capital. An expedition sent by Oliver Cromwell in 1655 attacked the city of Santo Domingo, but was defeated. The English troops withdrew and took the less guarded colony of Jamaica, instead. In 1697, the Treaty of Ryswick included the acknowledgement by Spain of France's dominion over the Western third of the island, now Haiti. In 1605, Spain, unhappy that Santo Domingo was facilitating trade between its other colonies and other European powers, attacked vast parts of the colony's northern and western regions, forcibly resettling their inhabitants closer to the city of Santo Domingo. This action, known as the devastaciones de Osorio, proved disastrous; more than half of the resettled colonists died of starvation or disease. The city of Santo Domingo was subjected to a smallpox epidemic, cacao blight, and hurricane in 1666; another storm two years later; a second epidemic in 1669; a third hurricane in September 1672; plus an earthquake in May 1673 that killed two dozen residents. San Jos√© de Ocoa, the best-known maroon settlement in Santo Domingo, was subjugated by the Spanish in 1666. In the 17th century, the French began occupying the unpopulated western third of Hispaniola. Intermittent clashes between French and Spanish colonists followed, even after the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick recognized the de facto occupations of France and Spain around the globe. Periodic confrontations also continued despite a 1731 agreement that partially defined a border between the two colonies along the Massacre and Pedernales rivers. In 1777, the Treaty of Aranjuez established a definitive border between what Spain called Santo Domingo and what the French named Saint-Domingue, thus ending 150 years of local conflicts and imperial ambitions to extend control over the island. The House of Bourbon replaced the House of Habsburg in Spain in 1700 and introduced economic reforms that gradually began to revive trade in Santo Domingo. The crown progressively relaxed the rigid controls and restrictions on commerce between Spain and the colonies and among the colonies. The last flotas sailed in 1737; the monopoly port system was abolished shortly thereafter. Many Spaniards and Hispaniola- born Creoles also then became pirates and privateers. By the middle of the century, the population was bolstered by emigration from the Canary Islands, resettling the northern part of the colony and planting tobacco in the Cibao Valley, and importation of slaves was renewed. Santo Domingo's exports soared and the island's agricultural productivity rose. This progress in the Spanish part was assisted too by the war that broke out in 1762 between Britain and her ally Portugal against France and Spain, for the Dominican Spaniards hastened to resort to a calling with which they were by this time well familiarised, and their privateers soon waged injurious war upon the commerce of the British in the West Indian waters, the prizes they took being carried to Santo Domingo, where cargoes were sold to the inhabitants, or to foreign merchants doing business there. The slave population of the Spanish part by this means was also much increased, as many prisoners were taken from the slavers in those waters. The author of Idea del valor de la Isla Espa√±ola emphasizes the name of Captain Lorenzo Daniel (Lorenc√≠n), and notes that ‚Äúhe was the scourge of the British, whom he deprived of more than 60 ships, those used for trade as well as war.‚Äù The population of Santo Domingo grew from about 6,000 in 1737 to approximately 125,000 in 1790. Of this number, about 40,000 were white landowners, about 25,000 were black or mulatto freedmen, and some 60,000 were slaves. However, it remained poor and neglected, particularly in contrast with neighboring French Saint-Domingue, which became the wealthiest colony in the New World. As restrictions on colonial trade were relaxed, the colonial elites of St. Domingue offered the principal market for Santo Domingo's exports of beef, hides, mahogany and tobacco. With the outbreak of the Haitian Revolution, the rich urban families linked to the colonial bureaucracy fled the island, while most of the rural (cattle ranchers) remained, even though they lost their principal market. Spain saw in the unrest an opportunity to seize all, or part, of the western region of the island in an alliance of convenience with the rebellious slaves. The Spanish governor of Santo Domingo purchased the allegiance of important black leaders and their personal armies. In July 1793, Spanish forces, including former slaves, crossed the border and pushed back the disheveled French forces before them. Although the Spanish had had much their own way in northern Saint- Domingue, such had not been the case in Europe, and on July 22, 1795, the French Republic and Spanish crown signed the Treaty of Basle. Frenchmen were to return to their side of the Pyrenees in Europe and Santo Domingo was to be ceded to France. This period called the Era de Francia, lasted until 1809 until being recaptured by Spain.

It is a Spain-based tech company, that focuses on providing a cloud experience through its own application and its website to their customers. Originally, Tuenti was created in 2006 as a social networking service becoming the most popular social network among young people in Spain between 2009 and 2012, with over 15 million registered users,A huge thank you to our 10 million active users and 15 million registered users! thus referred to as the \\"Spanish Facebook\\". Currently, in Spain, Tuenti offers mobile telephone services accessible anywhere in any device by making it accessible through the cloud. In Latin America, Tuenti ships its brand through Telef√≥nica branches in those countries, exploiting the young market by offering simple and affordable plans among other services common to mobile carriers, Tuenti offers free VoIP calls and instant messaging through its own messaging app.  Company history  Founder Zaryn Dentzel in 2008 Tuenti was founded as a Social networking service in 2006 by a group of friends in Spain. Zaryn Dentzel, Felix Ruiz Hernandez, Kenny Bentley, Adeyemi Ajao and Joaqu√≠n Ayuso de P√°ul were the key people who worked together to bring Tuenti to life. Dentzel's first experience in Spain was on a students exchange program that took him to Cabeza del Buey (Badajoz). Bentley, the lead programmer, came to Spain after having worked in social networking in the United States. In the beginning, the project was aimed to university students, but due to its success, they opened to everyone, although it was only possible to register with an invitation. Years later the register was opened to everyone, in an attempt to make it available globally, with the only extra requirement of giving a phone number. Zaryn Dentzel has chronicled the story of Tuenti in a book called El futuro lo decides t√∫. Although the name sounds similar to the English word twenty, it actually comes from \\"tu [id]enti[dad]\\", meaning \\"your identity\\". The service was originally targeted at the Spanish market, but in 2012 they made it globally available. The organization has reached more than 250 employees from more than 21 countries around the world. Google Zeitgeist's 2009 listed Tuenti as the third fastest-rising global search. Google's 2008 Zeitgeist report listed Tuenti as the year's fourth fastest-rising global search term,Ahmed, Murad. \\"Palin beats Obama in Google's 'zeitgeist' rankings\\". The Times. 2008-12-09. and during 2010, Alexa Internet ranks the site as the sixth most visited in Spain. In 2011, it was estimated that more than 15% of the web traffic in Spain was on Tuenti, which at that time in Spain meant more traffic than Google and Facebook together.http://zenware.net/blog/?p=183http://www.trecebits.com/2011/10/05/el-15-del- trafico-web-en-espana-pasa-por-tuenti/ On August 4, 2010 the major telecommunications group Telef√≥nica acquired 85% of tuenti's shares for a total of 70 million euro, becoming its largest shareholder. In that same year, tuenti started the development of a light virtual mobile network operator which worked completely under the Movistar (Telef√≥nica) infrastructure. Later, in December, the service, still in a developing state, is released to the users of the social network under the brand \\"Tu\\". On the 11th of July 2012, tuenti announced a big renovation of its social network platform. It featured a new focus on mobile devices, availability in 12 new languages, and was called Tuenti Social Messenger, though, its attempt to become a global social network by officially supporting registers out of Spain was a failure. After a massive loss of active users, a big change on the company's drift occurred and its virtual mobile operator became the main focus. On the 6th of November 2013, Telef√≥nica owned 100% of the company after an agreement with the remaining shareholders. Tuenti launched its mobile operator brand in Mexico, Peru and Argentina in 2014. After this move, the brand was present in four countries, offering competitive data bundles and started developing a cloud- based strategy. Tuenti has completely transformed its business from a social network to a mobile telecommunications provider. During 2014, the company reported that their mobile operator represented 98% of the income. The company attained a global turnover of 21 million euro, 25% more than the previous year. Although it was still not positive, this year's financial report was the best since the launching of their mobile business and the acquisition by Telef√≥nica. In 2015, Sebastian Muriel is appointed as the new CEO of the company. He was already part of the mobile operator team for a long time before. During this year and 2016, Tuenti went through a rebranding and the company reaffirmed its commitment with the mobile market by completely renewing their website, which got rid of all the remaining social elements and functions. This year, Telef√≥nica also started to make important changes in the management team: Sebastian Muriel, along with the social network team became part of Telef√≥nica's I+D team, a division of the company in charge for innovation and new products, while Pablo Ledesma became the new director.  Mobile operator (in Spain)  = History =  Pre-launch phase  Tuenti launched Tu as a developing project in 2010 supported by Telef√≥nica, which was the largest shareholder back then, aiming to have influence in the young market that the social network had at that time. Signing up for Tu was free of charge during the initial launching, but it had certain limitations: it was only accessible by invitation (an invitation from a social network user who already had signed up was a requirement, the company sent invitations to random users with this purpose), once an invitation was received users could only sign up for a new number, number portability from another provider was not possible, also, the service was only available on prepaid. The provisioned SIM card was posted nationwide free of charge. During the pre-launch phase offered plans changed a couple times. First plans launched consisted in weekly, 14 days long or monthly plans which were focused in calls and SMS, as well as free access to the social network after recharging and free TuentiSMS usage. Almost a year later postpaid plans were first launched. Offered plans changed multiple times during this phase and just before the final launch their main focus became bigger data plans.  Final launching  On 15 February 2012 the company left behind the pre-launch phase of the project and launched Tuenti M√≥vil for social network users, dropping the name Tu used for the pre-release phase. This official launch came accompanied by brand new plans including competitive data bundles, invitation system was no longer required to access the service and a new advertising campaign within the social network to promote the service. Just a month later new postpaid plans were launched. One year later, Tuenti announced a better integration between Tuenti M√≥vil and the social network thanks to its mobile application which included the ability to manage various of the MVNO services and the release of new plans that came with free (unmetered) usage of the social network, making chatting, sharing and doing VoIP calls within the platform totally free of charge or data quota consumption. This new feature was named \\"ZEROL√çMITES\\". This proposal aimed to make the whole brand more attractive for current and potential customers and social network users. By that time, the social networking platform experienced an important decrease on active users that presumably migrated to other brand new social platforms. 2014 was an intensive year for the company: this year the company started in Spain the deployment of their own mobile core-network, therefore gaining on independence and enabling them to develop brand new functionalities. At the same time, they also gained presence as a mobile operator on ITU. \\"VozDigital\\" was also launched on July, it is a serviced that takes advantage of the current application VoIP functionalities to give customers the possibility to make phone calls using their current phone number and a plan that includes VozDigital minutes. Later, it also became possible to receive calls and make international calls without extra cost.  Mobile operator (overseas)  Supported by Telef√≥nica and taking benefit of new telecommunications regulations, the brand Tuenti was launched in some Latin-American countries, starting by Mexico. The brand was promoted as a whole-new mobile operator to hit the market, although it works completely based on the Movistar (Telef√≥nica) infrastructure. From the beginning, the offer aimed to a young market: by releasing simple plans (called \\"Combos\\") at competitive rates. Both, strategy and offers are slightly different in Latin-American countries to Spain due to technical limits, among other reasons. Even though it might differ at strategy and operational level from Spain, overseas customers can still take advantage of the mobile application to manage their mobile accounts. From this approach, the philosophy remains the same: offering control for all your services, instant messages and calls for users of the app, VozDigital calls (availability in some countries, call destinations and some functionalities might vary). = Mexico = June 26, 2014 was the key date for the first official announcement of the international launch: The brand Tuenti started its operations in Mexico. There was a celebration at Campus Party Mexico, giving away for free 2,500 SIM cards for users to provide feedback. Two years after the brand release, in July 2016 the brand quietly ceases its activity. Customers are migrated automatically to Movistar and Tuenti's social media profiles for Mexico are removed. Sebastian Muriel, CEO of Tuenti, claimed in an interview that the results of the brand in Mexico were not as good as expected due to the monopolistic situation of telephony market. = Argentina = Tuenti replaced the brand \\"Quam\\", also owned by Telef√≥nica on November 18, 2014. Plus, from that moment, users would be able to access Tuenti's mobile application to watch and manage their services. = Peru = On October, 2014, Peru became the third country in which the brand was released. Peru was also the first country apart from Spain in which VozDigital was launched, enabling customers to make calls (but not to receive them) to any national fixed line or mobile destination through almost any device and just an internet connection. = Ecuador = The brand was launched on May 29, 2015, with an advertising campaign named \\"Lib√©rate\\" (free yourself). = Guatemala = Brand was launched on June 22, 2017, with a massive media campaign called \\"Sin Pajas\\" and were using #SinPajas as principal hashtag campaign.  Social network  Tuenti was the most popular social network of Spain and it featured all the tools common to social-networking sites. It allowed users to set up a profile, upload photos and videos, connect and communicate with friends. Many other utilities, such as a chat application, the ability to create events and tagging locations and places were also offered in the beginning. Unlike similar social networking sites which feature banner advertisements, Tuenti opted out of these traditional forms of obstructive and invasive advertising, in order to respect the privacy of the user.  Social network cease  After users leaving the social platform, the removal of some essential functions of the social network and have made a strategy refocus in a different industry, keeping the social platform alive made no sense. On February 1, 2016 confidential information was leaked from old employees of the company who claimed that social network closure was imminent. Just a month later, the company launched an update to their mobile application and website that removed all the remaining social networking features, except the chat platform. It also enabled users to download their data for certain period of time, inviting users to download and try the new features such as VozDigital, using their own current phone number to make free calls.

He was a Fellow of Jesus College, Oxford, an advocate at Doctors' Commons and Chancellor of the diocese of Hereford.  Life  Wynne was part of the Wynn family from Bodewryd, Anglesey. He was the younger son of Edward Wynn, who was rector of Llantrisant, Anglesey at the time of his son's birth in 1681, and his wife Margaret, who was the eldest daughter of Robert Morgan, Bishop of Bangor. Wynne's elder brother, John, died in infancy. Wynne was educated at Jesus College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 18 December 1698, aged 17. He obtained various degrees thereafter: Bachelor of Arts (1702), Master of Arts (1705), Bachelor of Civil Law and Doctor of Civil Law (both 1711). He was appointed to a Fellowship of the college in 1703, retaining this position until 1711. His uncle, Humphrey Humphreys, became Bishop of Hereford in 1701, and Humphreys appointed Wynne as chancellor of the diocese of Hereford in 1707. Wynne became an advocate in Doctors' Commons in 1712, his career being helped by the fact that his mother lived on the family estate at Bodewryd and managed matters there until her death in 1723. Wynne held the position of chancellor of the diocese for many years, only leaving office a year before his death in 1755. In 1748, he endowed an annual sermon to be preached on the birthday of Bishop Humphries (24 November). He was regarded as a devoted servant of the diocese, with an interest in its history and administration. He was also noted as being a progressive landowner, bringing advances in agricultural matters from Herefordshire to his estate on Anglesey. In particular, he was said to have been the first landowner on Anglesey to grow turnips, which he did in 1714. He has been described as \\"undoubtedly, one of the chief men of Anglesey in the first half of the 18th century.\\" Wynne was a patron of the Anglesey-born poet and cleric Goronwy Owen in Owen's youth, and it is known that Owen transcribed some documents for Wynne in 1739, when Owen was 16. Wynne had married Anne Lloyd, heiress of John Lloyd from the Vale of Clwyd. However, none of their children survived infancy. They were estranged for some time, but reconciled before Anne's death on 29 July 1739. Wynne himself died on 30 June 1755, and was buried on 4 July 1755. As Wynne had no children of his own who could inherit, the family estate passed to his sister's granddaughter, Margaret Owen, who married Sir John Stanley, 6th Baronet, in 1763.

The missile was fired at USA-193, a reconnaissance satellite which failed shortly after launch in December 2006. Acting as an anti-satellite weapon, the SM-3 was successful in destroying the satellite, by rupturing its hydrazine tank. Officially, the United States Government stated that they destroyed the satellite to prevent it falling over a populated area, however it was claimed that there were political motivations, such as proving that the United States had the capability to destroy a satellite in low Earth orbit, or to prevent the satellite from falling into the wrong hands, should it come down in a country not allied to the United States. =TEXUS-45= TEXUS-45, the 45th TEXUS microgravity research mission, was launched from Esrange in Sweden at 06:15 UTC on 21 February. A Brazilian VSB-30 rocket was used for the mission, which was conducted by the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) and the Swedish Space Corporation on behalf of the European Space Agency. =K-15 Test= On 26 February, at 07:28 UTC, India test-fired a K-15 submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) from the INS Kalinga, in the first K-15 test launch to be conducted underwater.

April =GT-196GM= Glory Trip 196GM (GT-196GM) was the first test of a Minuteman III missile to be conducted for nearly a year, due to a series of delays. The launch, from LF-09 at the Vandenberg Air Force Base occurred at 08:01 UTC on 2 April. It was conducted by the United States Air Force. =SEE= SEE was an Ultraviolet Astronomy mission launched from LC-36 at the White Sands Missile Range, using a Black Brant IX rocket. The serial number of the rocket was 36.240. Launch occurred at 16:58 UTC on 14 April. The launch was conducted by NASA for the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics of the University of Colorado. =Blue Sparrow test= On 15 April, an Israeli Blue Sparrow missile was test launched. The missile was fired from an F-15 aircraft, and flew a trajectory designed to imitate that flown by Iranian Shahab missiles. Later launches will be used to test Arrow missiles, designed to shoot down enemy missiles. =Shaheen-II tests= On 19 and 21 April, two Pakistani Shaheen-II missiles were launched from an undisclosed launch site, believed to be Sonmiani. May =Black Brant X-ray astronomy mission= At 05:30 UTC on 1 May a Black Brant IX, serial number 36.223 was launched by NASA, from LC-36 at the White Sands Missile Range, on an x-ray astronomy mission for the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. =First Mesquito launch= On 6 May, between 18:00 and 20:00 UTC, the maiden flight of the Mesquito rocket, serial number 12.065, was conducted by NASA from LC-2 at the Wallops Flight Facility.

His killing was one of many such politically motivated murders perpetrated against democratic opposition by the Communist regime of Poland (see: Martial law in Poland). Beating and death Przemyk's mother, Barbara Sadowska, a poet and a member of Workers' Defence Committee, was frequently arrested and questioned by the S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa for her activities in opposition movement. On several occasions officers questioning her made various threats, including suggestions that her only son, Grzegorz, may be hurt in an accident. The last time she was questioned before the incident was at the end of April 1983. 12 May 1983 was the day of Grzegorz graduation from a high school, as well as the anniversary of death of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, a statesman and leader of Second Polish Republic, considered by communist authorities as a class enemy. Celebration of this date was illegal in Poland and always a cause for concern by the police and S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa. Around 3pm, Grzegorz Przemyk and friends, Cezary Filozof, :pl:Piotr Kadlƒçik, Igor Bieli≈Ñski, and Kuba Kota≈Ñski, left together to celebrate their graduation at the Castle Square in Warsaw Old Town. There at around 5pm, Filozof and Przemyk were stopped by policeman Ireneusz Ko≈õciuk, who demanded their identity documents. As they dined, Ko≈õciuk called for a police car and forced them inside while beating them with a rubber baton. Kuba and Piotr, who witnessed the events from distance, separated. Piotr ran home to notify Przemyk's mother, while Kota≈Ñski followed the car to a nearby police station. Standing outside, he heard Przemyk howling in pain as he was being beaten. Filozof was with Przemyk the whole time and witnessed two policemen, Ko≈õciuk and Krzysztof Dalmata, beating him with a baton. Arkadiusz Denkiewicz, who was the duty officer at the time, came to the room and complained about the noise, instructing them to beat Przemyk more quietly, preferably in the stomach. Dalmata then held Przemyk's arms behind his back, while Bogus≈Çaw Bielec struck him in the stomach with his elbow until Przemyk fell unconscious. The policemen called an ambulance, reporting a \\"drug-addict\\" required treatment at psychiatric hospital. The driver, Micha≈Ç Wysocki, could see that Przemyk was not drugged, but crouched, holding his stomach and unable to walk. Together with paramedic Jacek Szyzdek, they moved him into the ambulance and transported him to a hospital at Ho≈ºa street. By that time, Filozof had arrived at the hospital on foot from the police station. Psychiatrist Pawe≈Ç Willmann then referred the barely conscious Przemyk to a psychiatric hospital for further investigation, explaining a gastric lavage would be performed and he would \\"soon get better\\". Przemyk's mother arrived and insisted on taking him home, fearing abuse known to be typical at the psychiatric facilities at that time. At home, Przemyk, feeling better, relayed how he was beaten by the policemen, while an officer advised to \\"beat in the stomach to leave no traces\\". On 13 May, Przemyk again started feeling poorly and was seen by two doctors. The second one suspected liver injury and called for immediate transport to Solec hospital for surgery. By 11pm, Przemyk was still conscious and explained to the surgeon he was \\"beaten in the stomach until he lost consciousness\\" and that it happened at a police station. He was operated on during the night, only to confirm severe and irreversible gastrointestinal perforation. Przemyk died in an intensive care unit at 1pm on 14 May. The news about his death quickly spread, and by the evening, Sadowska's house was already guarded by a number of policemen, preventing friends arriving with condolences from entering. On 15 May, the information reached underground and international media (BBC, RFE, Voice of America), but was not reported in the Polish media. An opposition writer and poet Wiktor Woroszylski wrote an open letter to the prime minister Mieczys≈Çaw Rakowski calling for a fair and transparent investigation. Rakowski noted in his private diary that, taking into account the activities of Sadowska, the security service might have \\"taught her son a lesson\\". The opinion that the incident was SB's revenge on Sadowska was also widespread in opposition circles at that time. On 17 May, a state newspaper, ≈ªycie Warszawy, published a short note about \\"two drunk and aggressive men\\" met by police officers at the Square who required an ambulance as they \\"had injuries\\". The note did not mention their arrest and detention at the police station. Cezary Filozof went into hiding, as it became obvious the investigation would be manipulated and he was the most important witness to the beating. Grave of Grzegorz Przemyk at PowƒÖzki Cemetery in Warsaw. Przemyk's funeral on 19 May, which took place at the PowƒÖzki Cemetery, and which was celebrated by Jerzy Popie≈Çuszko, turned into a spontaneous demonstration against the Communist regime, attended by 20,000-60,000 people marching in silence. Cover-up operation On 20 May, at Ministry of Internal Affairs, the minister Czes≈Çaw Kiszczak held a closed meeting to plan the government's response to the scandal. One of the officers, Romuald Zajkowski, presented results of an internal investigation concluding that this is \\"a purely criminal case rather than a political one\\", which may lead to \\"conviction of a few sadists in the police force\\" at worst, suggesting a regular investigation by law enforcement institutions. This was however fiercely protested by general J√≥zef Beim, head of the police, who did not agree to \\"sacrifice his men\\". Shortly after, Kiszczak decided that the investigation must be controlled and lead to conviction of the paramedics, while policemen should not even appear as suspects. Prosecutor general Franciszek Rusak, however, published a note in ≈ªycie Warszawy mentioning the start of an investigation to \\"determine the mechanism of injuries\\" Przemyk suffered. This caused a very aggressive reaction from Kiszczak and his deputy W≈Çadys≈Çaw Ciasto≈Ñ, who threatened Rusak and requested that their version be presented from the very beginning. Having read the note, Cezary Filozof reported himself to the prosecutor's office on 23 May and produced a detailed witness statement, which was fully consistent with the forensic pathology reports already received by Rusak. On 24 May a meeting was held at the Polish United Workers' Party central with the prime minister, ministers and other key figures where a strategy of dealing with the upcoming scandal was discussed. Jerzy Urban advised the case needed to be carefully handled to avoid turning Przemyk into a \\"martyr\\". He suggested covering it up with publication of possibly compromising wiretaps of Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa thus weakening the strong opinions about police brutality, and by promoting the doctors' possible culpability. He also suggested suspending the two policemen responsible, so as to calm the situation. This was again met with a very aggressive response from Kiszczak. Eventually, the Party issued a statement \\"fully supporting\\" the Interior Ministry in the rise of \\"opposition's unprecedented attacks\\". Wojciech Jaruzelski explained to Rakowski that Przemyk was a drug-addict. Over the coming months the police and S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa rolled out a full-scale operation involving pressuring witnesses as well as prosecutors, collecting and publishing compromising information about Przemyk, his family and friends, using wiretaps, active measures, harassment, silent calls, confidential informers etc. These steps were suggested by two professors, W≈Çodzimierz Szewczuk and J√≥zef Borgosz, who consulted for the security service. They also invented a karate fight between Przemyk and Filozof, which was promoted for a while to compromise the statement of Kuba Kota≈Ñski, implying the agonized screams of Przemyk where really \\"karate screams\\". On 30 June, the prosecution, after completing most medical analyses and witness interviews, planned to reveal indictments against the two policemen, Ireneusz Ko≈õciuk and Arkadiusz Denkiewicz (beating to death) and two doctors Bronis≈Çaw Jasicki and Pawe≈Ç Willmann (medical negligence). Paramedics Micha≈Ç Wysocki and Jacek Szyzdek were also suspected of possibly beating Przemyk in the ambulance or lift, but on 4 July these versions were determined to be impossible after an investigation. In none of the locations was there sufficient space to apply sufficient force to cause the injuries suffered by Przemyk, and there were no witnesses of any misconduct by the paramedics. On 6 July, S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa succeeded in transferring the investigation from the district prosecutor's office to the regional office, where prosecutor Anna Jackowska was assigned and supervised by :pl:Wies≈Çawa Bardonowa, well known for her compliance with SB needs in political trials and anti-opposition bias. Deputy prosecutor general Henryk Pracki, however, still wanted to include witness statement by Cezary Filozof as it considered it to be logical and consistent with other evidence. Pressure from Kiszczak on Pracki continued during numerous other high-level meetings with the Party leadership. Selecting the paramedics' misconduct as primary cover-up version, S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa launched a country-wide campaign against general ambulance personnel and paramedics, highlighting real and invented cases of negligence or petty theft against patients. This prepared the ground for arrest of Wysocki and Szyzdek. At the same time SB intensified pressure on the family of Cezary Filozof, threatening his parents and relatives with tax-evasion investigations, termination of employment and closing their small businesses. As part of the pressure, :pl:Maciej Bednarkiewicz, the lawyer representing Sadowska, was arrested in unrelated and fabricated case. SB also forced early retirement of another lawyer involved, :pl:W≈Çadys≈Çaw Si≈Ça-Nowicki, as well as the prosecutor Henryk Pracki. SB also cooperated with Ministry of Defence to force conscription of Cezary Filozof with the intent to isolate him from the investigation and possibly silence him with an accident during military training. Filozof was under permanent surveillance with over 240 officers involved in discrediting him. The group operated on the orders of chief of police general J√≥zef Beim, coordinated by captain Zdzis≈Çaw Chwaszcz. 12 friends and relatives of Filozof were recruited as informants. Similar measures were applied to Barbara Sadowska. Both, however, held to their witness statements. Paramedics Wysocki and Szyzdek were eventually arrested for fabricated crimes and SB continued to pressure them into confession while in detention. SB officer Jacek Zi√≥≈Çkowski, personally Wysocki's friend, manipulated him into confession, threatening his children. In November, another forensic pathology opinion is produced by professor Zdzis≈Çaw Marek which confirmed, in spite of pressure from SB, that Przemyk could have been beaten only at the police station, which further weakened the version of events promoted by the authorities. Their witness statements also barely confirmed any use of force by paramedics or doctors and Wysocki's behavior while interviewed by the prosecutor gave reason to believe the confession was extorted, as it is completely inconsistent with forensic evidence. Trial In December, the indictment was ready to be passed to the court for trial. SB, however, disputed it and managed to soften some of the claims, criticising the prosecution for \\"still believing that Przemyk was beaten at the police station\\". In April 1984, prosecutor Rusek was replaced by J√≥zef ≈ªyta, who vigorously proceeded to remove traces of Ko≈õciuk and Denkiewicz from the indictment. To that end, officer Stanis≈Çaw Wyciszczak was assigned to devise every possible argument to present the most damning witness statements of Filozof and Kota≈Ñski as unreliable. The forensic evidence, however, was still there, as the experts refused to modify it to suit the police's version. Kiszczak made one more attempt to pressure prosecutor Gonciarz to remove the policemen from the indictment, which he refused to do and resigned from his position in protest. As result, the indictment was left unsigned, and thus formally incomplete. As a workaround, an unrelated prosecutor Anna Jackowska signed it after changing the qualification of policemen's actions to simple \\"beating\\" while the paramedics were indicted of the much more serious \\"fatal beating\\". The two doctors were previously indicted for \\"negligence\\". The trial started on 31 May and attracted broad attention of international media, but was only briefly reported on Polish TV. On the first day Barbara Sadowska resigned from her role of subsidiary prosecutor in protest of the biased indictment. Wysocki withdrew his previous confession during the trial, but Szyzdek maintained it. Ko≈õciuk and Denkiewicz pleaded not guilty and refused any further explanations. Witnesses Filozof and Kota≈Ñski held their statements of the beating they had witnessed at the police station. Forensic expert Zdzis≈Çaw Marek also held his opinion that Przemyk acquired his fatal injuries at the police station. A number of witnesses, including doctors, paramedics, and Przemyk's friends independently confirmed that immediately after the incident Przemyk said he was beaten by policemen. Each of these was however \\"balanced\\" by statements of large number of policemen, both related and unrelated to the case, repeating identical statements about \\"karate screams\\" and \\"suspect behavior\\" of Przemyk's group at the Square. Two unrelated prison doctors, J√≥zef Mielczarek and Stanis≈Çaw Krzak, were called to testify as medical experts and presented fantastic theories about mental disorders Przemyk must have suffered which, as they claimed, were proven by the fact that he initially denied giving his documents to policemen when ordered. As noted by many witnesses, during the whole trial prosecutor Bardonowa behaved in a way that has been described as \\"being the most dedicated defender of the suspected policemen, while taking any attempt to prosecute the victims\\". On 9 July, Szyzdek unexpectedly withdrew his confession about Wysocki beating Przemyk. Nevertheless, on 10 July, prosecutor Bardonowa delivered her final speech, repeating all the statements supporting official versions, withdrawn or otherwise, and ignoring witness statements by Filozof, Kota≈Ñski and the forensic experts. On 16 July, Judges Janusz Jankowski, Andrzej Lewandowski and Ewa Gutowska-Sawczuk acquitted Ko≈õciuk and Denkiewicz. The doctors Jasicki and Willman were considered guilty of non-intentional negligence, and remitted. The paramedics were the only ones convicted to 2 years in prison for the \\"brutal treatment of the patient\\". But after about a month, they were silently amnestied and released. They lost their jobs, however, and suffered from depression in the aftermath. Their convictions were rendered invalid in 1989 after the fall of communist regime Relationship with Popie≈Çuszko murder Shortly after, in October 1984, a priest Jerzy Popie≈Çuszko was murdered by Grzegorz Piotrowski, an officer of S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa. Mieczys≈Çaw Rakowski made a note in his personal diary on that subject that the acquittal of the policemen \\"might have only encouraged Piotrowski and his friends\\". Repeated investigations and trial at The Institute of National Remembrance Przemyk's investigation was restarted in 1993 after the fall of communism with his father Leopold Przemyk as subsidiary prosecutor. The case against the policemen dragged on for years and in 2010, after a number of appeals, it was eventually remitted due to expiration, leaving Arkadiusz Denkiewicz as the only convict. Leopold Przemyk filed a case then with European Court of Human Rights, which in 2013 decided that none of the Poland's investigations in this case were intentionally delayed. In 1998, another investigation against Czes≈Çaw Kiszczak was started by the Institute of National Remembrance for interfering with the original investigation from 1983. This prosecution collected a large amount of evidence, but the case was also eventually remitted in 2012 after years of legal battles. On May 3, 2008, Przemyk was posthumously awarded the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta, by the late President of Poland Lech Kaczy≈Ñski. The song \\"Over My Dead Body\\" from the 1984 album \\"Meltdown\\" from Christian recording artist Steve Taylor was dedicated to the memory of Grzegorz Przemyk.

It was described by Walter gross in 1968 based on scales found in the Hemse limestone in Sweden. It is placed in the monogeneric family Andreolepididae and is generally regarded as a primitive member of the class ActinopterygiiThe Paleobiology Database based on its ganoid scale structure; however some new research regards it as a stem group of osteichthyans. Researchers have used microremains of an Andreolepsis to determine its origins and found that it dated back to the late Silurian. Andreolepsis was capable of shedding its teeth by basal resorption, which is considered a rather primitive mode of tooth replacement.This makes it informative about the evolution of teeth. Fossil remains are mostly limited to scales, platelets and fragmented bones. At first only the species A. hedei was described. Scales, platelets and a spine from the Central Urals in Russia have thereafter been assigned to a new species, A. petri, due to differences in fossil morphology. Remains have been found in Russia, and A. hedei fossils have also been uncovered in Sweden, Estonia, Latvia.and Great Britain, the former of which it was originally described from. Andreolepis fossils have also recently been recovered from Western Australia and were identified as Andreolepis sp. aff. A. petri due to the resemblance to A. petri scales.  Environment  Fossils of Andreolepis have been found in marine sediment, indicating that this fish lived in a marine environment, in both shallow and deeper waters. Remains of acanthodians, anaspids, heterostracans, osteostracans, thelodonts and bivalves have also been found in the same sediment layers. Examples of encountered vertebrate genera are Gomphonchus, Nostolepis, Archegonaspis, Thyestes, Paralogania, Phlebolepis and Thelodus.  Phylogeny  The exact position in the phylogenetic tree is debated. Andreolepis has been considered a primitive actinopterygian, partly based on scale characteristics and the presence of ganoine, a homologue to true enamel, which was thought to be limited to actinopterygians whereas true enamel is limited to sarcopterygians. It has also been suggested to be a basal osteichthyan. For example, the teeth lack enamel and have a broad tooth field, well-developed dental organization is absent and tooth production is extraosseous, which are indications that Andreolepis is located at the base of the osteichthyes. Gross has formerly placed Andreolepis in the family Lophosteidae, but considering the distinct differences between the genera Lophosteus and Andreolepis, the latter was placed in the new family Andreolepididae. These two genera form the oldest and most basal osteichthyans that are known thus far.  Evolutionary significance  = Squamation and scale characteristics = The scales of Andreolepis have a rhombic shape and contain a thin monolayer of ganoine. The squamation pattern has been divided into ten morphotypes, each presumably covering a distinct section of the body. However, some variation in scale morphology might be due to different developmental stages and different species, as no distinction was made between A. hedei and A. petri when reconstructing the squamation. Peg-and-socket articulation of the scales is already present in this basal fish genus and its scales are reminiscent of those of actinopterygian scales in early developmental stages, which indicates that developmental heterochrony might have been a mechanism by which differences in scale morphology evolved. = Tooth replacement and evolution of enamel = Previously it was thought that the dentary of Andreolepis did not contain true teeth, but instead harbored denticles. The lack of teeth and the recognition of initial denticle organisation suggested a basal phylogenetic position within the osteichthyes. It was even argued that the presumed dentary fossil of A. hedei is uninformative of dental evolution, as the fossil did not represent dental development, but rather development of the dermal skeleton. This would mean the tooth-like structures of Andreolepis neither match with teeth of chondrichthyans nor with those of osteichthyans and are more similar to the development of structures in dermal scales. Recently it was shown that A. hedei did have functional teeth that were shed by basal-resorption, something that was overlooked during previous research efforts due to methodological limitations. The location of the resorption cups, places where resorption of the tooth base took place, and newly formed teeth are not perfectly aligned, which suggests a flexible form of tooth replacement. Nonetheless, some form of patterning can be recognised in the teeth. Multiple layers of resorption cups have been found, which means shedding by resorption could take place multiple times. The presence of a primitive form of tooth development in the most basal osteichthyans sheds light on the manner by which this has evolved. Fossils including those of Andreolepis together with genetic inferences also helped to elucidate the evolution of enamel. The scales of Andreolepis contain the enamel homologue ganoine, but the dermal bones and teeth don‚Äôt. Moving up in the phylogenetic tree, more derived extinct and extant species show a shift of enamel-containing structures from the scales, to the dermal plate and eventually the teeth, with enamel lost in dermal teeth-like structures and in some cases even in the teeth of the most derived groups of tetrapods and teleosts. This might indicate that enamel first evolved on dermal tissues like scales and only later in teeth.

The lock is in the full-cock position. The dog has been automatically pushed out of the notch in the back of the cock and is lying back horizontally.Godwin, Brian C., Cooper, John S., Spencer, Michael G. The English Flintlock: its Origins and Development. Apollo Magazine, Catalogue of the 20th Anniversary London Park Lane Arms Fair, 2003. A doglock is a type of lock for firearms that preceded the 'true' flintlock in rifles, muskets, and pistols in the 17th century. Commonly used throughout Europe in the late seventeenth century, it gained popular favor in the British and Dutch military. A doglock carbine was the principal weapon of the harquebusier, the most numerous type of cavalry in the armies of the Thirty Years' War and English Civil War era. Like the snaphance, it was largely supplanted by the flintlock. Much like the later flintlock devices, it contained the flint, frizzen, and pan, yet had an external catch as a half-cock safety, known as the \\"dog\\". This type of lock had no internal, half-cock loading position as the later flintlock mechanism contained. To load a firearm with a dog lock, the cock was secured with the external dog, preventing it from moving forward to strike the frizzen and begin the firing sequence. The user could then safely load the musket or pistol. To fire, the cock was moved to the full-cock position, which caused the dog to fall backward and no longer prevent the lock from firing. A pull of the trigger would then fire the piece. This fell out of favor with the British before 1720. Later flintlocks would contain no such catch, as the half-cock position had been created with the internal parts of the lock.Blackmore, Howard L. British Military Firearms, 1650-1850.

Unlike norepinephrine, droxidopa is capable of crossing the protective blood‚Äìbrain barrier (BBB). Indications * Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (NOH) dopamine beta hydrolase deficiency, as well as NOH associated with multiple system atrophy (MSA), familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), pure autonomic failure (PAF). * Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) or hemodialysis-induced hypotension. * Freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease (off-label) History Droxidopa was developed by Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of hypotension, including NOH, and NOH associated with various disorders such as MSA, FAP, and PD, as well as IDH. The drug has been used in Japan and some surrounding Asian areas for these indications since 1989. Following a merger with Dainippon Pharmaceuticals in 2006, Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma licensed droxidopa to Chelsea Therapeutics to develop and market it worldwide except in Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan. In February 2014, the Food and Drug Administration approved droxidopa for the treatment of symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. =Clinical trials= A systematic review and meta-analysis conducted on clinical trials comparing the clinical use of droxidopa and midodrine have found that midodrine was more likely to cause supine hypertension than droxidopa in patients with NOH. Midodrine was also found to be slightly more effective at raising blood pressure but not statistically significantly so. Chelsea Therapeutics obtained orphan drug status (ODS) for droxidopa in the US for NOH, and that of which associated with PD, PAF, and MSA. In 2014, Chelsea Therapeutics was acquired by Lundbeck along with the rights to droxidopa which was launched in the US in Sept 2014. Pharmacology Droxidopa is a prodrug of norepinephrine used to increase the concentrations of these neurotransmitters in the body and brain. It is metabolized by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD), also known as DOPA decarboxylase (DDC). Patients with NOH have depleted levels of norepinephrine which leads to decreased blood pressure or hypotension upon orthostatic challenge. Droxidopa works by increasing the levels of norepinephrine in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), thus enabling the body to maintain blood flow upon and while standing. Droxidopa can also cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier (BBB) where it is converted to norepinephrine from within the brain. Increased levels of norepinephrine in the central nervous system (CNS) may be beneficial to patients in a wide range of indications. Droxidopa can be coupled with a peripheral aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor (AAADI) or DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor (DDC) such as carbidopa (Lodosyn) to increase central norepinephrine concentrations while minimizing increases of peripheral levels. Side effects With over 20 years on the market, droxidopa has proven to have few side effects of which most are mild. The most common side effects reported in clinical trials include headache, dizziness, nausea, hypertension and fatigue.

The works of the group were influenced by abstract expressionism and action painting.Douglas Crow in Ernst Grabovszki, James N. Hardin, Literature in Vienna at the Turn of the Centuries, Boydell and Brewer, 2003, p166. In 1951 Lassnig traveled to Paris with Arnulf Rainer where they organized the exhibition Junge unifigurative Malerei at the K√§rnten Art Association.\\"Rain, Arnulf Rainer\\" Tate, Retrieved 16 April 2014. In Paris she also met the surrealist artist Andr√© Breton and the poets Paul Celan and Benjamin P√©ret.Moyer, Carrie. \\"Maria Lassnig: The Pitiless Eye\\" Art in America, Retrieved 16 April 2014. Though Lassnig began her career painting abstract works, she always created self-portraits. One of her earliest was Expressive Self-Portrait (1945), which she painted only weeks after leaving Vienna.Lane, Mary \\"MoMA PS1 Shows 'Body Awareness'\\" The Wall Street Journal, Retrieved 17 April 2014. In 1948 Lassnig coined the term \\"body consciousness\\" (K√∂rpergef√ºhlmalerei in her native German) to describe her practice. In this style, Lassnig only depicted the parts of her body that she actually felt as she worked. As such, many of her self-portraits depict figures that are missing body parts or use unnatural colours. The shading of the grotesque forms then become a code for interpreting her \\"K√∂rpergef√ºhlmalerei.\\" For example, red often acts as the most significant color in her paintings, sometimes suggesting pain but often just intense feeling or strain. By the 1960s Lassnig turned away from abstract painting altogether and began to focus more wholly on the human body and psyche.Roberta Smith (22 November 2002), Art in review; Maria Lassnig The New York Times. Since that time she created hundreds of self-portraits. Most of her work in the 1970s and 1980s paired her own image with objects, animals or other people, frequently with a blocked out or averted gaze, suggesting interiority. From 1968 to 1980, Lassnig lived in New York City.Woeller, Marcus. \\"Having Won Venice's Golden Lion, Maria Lassnig Gets Her Due in Hamburg\\" ArtInfo, Retrieved 16 April 2014. From 1970 to 1972 she studied animated film at the School of Visual Arts in New York City. During this time she made six short films, including Selfportrait (1971) and Couples (1972).\\"Maria Lassnig Master CV\\" Petzel Gallery, Retrieved 17 April 2014. Her most famous film, however, Kantate (also known as The Ballad of Maria Lassnig), was produced in 1992 when she was seventy-three years old.\\"Maria Lassnig\\" Art Films, Retrieved 17 April 2014. Kantate (1992) depicts a filmic self-portrait of the artist set to songs and music. In 1980, she returned to become a professor at the Vienna University of Applied Arts, becoming the first female professor of painting in a German-speaking country. She was a chair at the University until 1997. In 1997 she also published a book of her drawings entitled Die Feder ist die Schwester des Pinsels (or The Pen is the Sister of the Paintbrush). She continued to paint, and in 2008 made her provocative self-portrait, You or Me, which exemplifies the often confrontational nature of her works. In 2013 Lassnig received the Golden Lion Award for lifetime achievement at the 55th Venice Biennale. Exhibitions Well into her sixties and late in her career, Lassnig began to receive widespread recognition, especially in Europe. She represented Austria at the Venice Biennale with Valie Export in 1980.bka.gv.at In 1996 a retrospective of her work was held at the Centre Georges Pompidou. She participated in documenta in both 1982 and 1997. For the 2005/2006 season at the Vienna State Opera she designed the large-scale (176 m¬≤) Breakfast with Ear for the ongoing series \\"Safety curtain\\", conceived by museum in progress. In 2008 an exhibition of her recent paintings was shown at the Serpentine GalleryLaura Cumming, A stunning body of work, The Observer, 27 April 2008 which also travelled to the Contemporary Arts Center in the Lois & Richard Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art in Cincinnati (2009).

MoMA PS1 held a major exhibition in 2014 of works, many of which that had not previously been seen in the United States before including 50 paintings, filmic works and a selection of watercolors. They have continued to show her films, as in the 2018 exhibition Maria Lassnig: New York Films 1970-1980. Since 2014, the year of her death, her work was shown at the Fondacio Tapies in Barcelona (2015), Tate Liverpool (2016), and the Albertina, Vienna (2017), the National Gallery in Prague (2018), Kunstmuseum Basel (2018), and Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (2019).

The Golden Flash was the first model in the BSA A10 series. It was available in black and chrome; but it was the distinctive golden paint scheme that gave The Golden Flash its name. Production continued until 1963, when it was superseded by the BSA A65 Star. Development =Background and development= Bert Hopwood served an apprenticeship under designer Val Page at Ariel. In 1936, Hopwood moved to Triumph, where he worked under Edward Turner to develop the 1937 Triumph Speed Twin. The innovative Speed Twin became the exemplar of the parallel twin engine layout for British motorcycles in the 1950s and 1960s. In April 1947 Hopwood joined Norton to design the Norton Dominator engine. BSA, then the largest UK motorcycle manufacturer, was falling behind in the parallel-twin race. Although BSA had a parallel-twin, the BSA A7, they needed to develop the bike to remain competitive. In May 1948, the factory enticed Hopwood after only a year at Norton, and he was commissioned to create a competitive BSA parallel-twin. Launched in October 1949, Hopwood's A10 Golden Flash drew heavily from the A7 design by Page and Bert Perkins. Early Golden Flash A10s had frames with either no rear suspension, or plungers, and had a semi-unit engine and gearbox, with the gearbox bolted to the rear of the engine The A10 was increased to , with a revised alloy rocker box and cast-iron cylinder head, plus an integral manifold for the single Amal carburettor. A semi-unit gearbox meant the primary chain was adjustable via a slipper tensioner within the primary chain case. The frame was available in rear rigid format, but the more common option was plunger suspension, adopted for the export market. The A10 featured a hinged rear mudguard to ease rear wheel removal. The A10 was so closely based on the A7 that it used many of its well-proven components, and this large carry-over of parts from the A7 promised greater reliability, with minimal risk of new technical problems. Early cast Golden Flash tank badge =Production= The BSA Golden Flash was launched in a new gold colour, and 80% of production was destined for the United States. This resulted in long delivery times for British customers, who were offered the model only in black. Although never designed as a sport motorcycle, the Golden Flash was nonetheless fast for its time and competitive with the Triumph Tiger 100, achieving over in tests in 1950, and covering a standing quarter mile (400 m) in under 16 seconds.Real Classic BSA A10 (accessed 2008-05-13) Its gold colour proved a marketing success, outselling Triumph's Speed Twin and 6T Thunderbird. BSA were concerned that wear in the plunger suspension was leading to uncertain handling. In 1954 the factory adopted a swinging arm, and the hinged mudguard was deleted. In a seemingly backwards step, the semi-unit gearbox was abandoned for a separate \\"pre-unit\\" item. The new design had a different primary chain adjustment, a modified clutch, and new gearbox internals. A tuned version. the Super Flash was available in the US in 1963 - 1964. Following requests for a more powerful version from the US, the engine was turned with parts from the competition department. This was an interim measure whilst sports bike version of the A10, the Road Rocket was being developed. Late Golden Flash A10s, ca. 1961, had swinging arm frames and had a separate engine and gearbox In 1957 an improved clutch was introduced , using 4 springs instead of six and improved friction material. For better reliability, the Golden Flash was upgraded in 1958 to the \\"thick flange\\" cylinders (base flange increased from 3/8\\" to 1/2\\") and larger big ends originally fitted to the Road Rocket. For 1960 the model was fitted with the 356 sports camshaft and a larger (1 1/8\\" bore) 389 Monobloc carburettor. It was renamed the \\"Royal Tourist\\" in the US. An alternator was offered as an alternative to the dynamo from 1961 to 1963, the last three years of production. In the late 1950s, motorcycle electrical component manufacturer Lucas decided to switch production from magneto/dynamo systems to alternators/coil systems. This forced British motorcycle manufacturers to completely redesign their engines. With the launch of the new unit construction (combined engine/gearbox) BSA A50 and BSA A65, the A7 and A10 were discontinued in 1963.
