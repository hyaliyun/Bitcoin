It is the successor institution of the former St. John's University and St. Mary's Hall in Shanghai, two well-known education institutions founded in 1879 and 1918, respectively, by Bishop John Schereschewsky of the American Episcopal Church.

In response to the loss of the school's identity, a group of distinguished alumni in Taiwan resolved to restore their alma mater in Taipei. In 1961, with the approval of the American Episcopal Church in Taiwan, the alumni of St. John's University, in conjunction with the alumnae of the former St. Mary's Hall of Shanghai, enthusiastically donated money to purchase land in the town of Tamsui in Taipei County for the school campus.St. John's University St. John's University (SJU), Taiwan In 1967, The Ministry of Education authorized the school to open as a five-year junior college of Industry and named it after its location, Hsin-pu (Êñ∞Âüî). Nonetheless, its English name‚ÄîSt. John's & St. Mary's Institute of Technology‚Äîcontinued to honor the history and traditions of the alumni's two illustrious alma maters. In 1993, the school was accredited as an Institute of Business and Industry; and then, because of its excellent educational reputation, upgraded its status to an Institute of Technology in 1999. After decades of work to fulfill the aspirations of its alumni at home and abroad, the school's official Chinese name was changed on October 10, 2003, from Êñ∞ÂüîÊäÄË°ìÂ≠∏Èô¢ (Hsinpu Institute of Technology) to ËÅñÁ¥ÑÁø∞ÊäÄË°ìÂ≠∏Èô¢ (St. John's & St. Mary's Institute of Technology). On August 1, 2005, after constant and collective efforts, the school was officially upgraded to a University of Science and Technology, and was able to restore its original school name, St. John's University (SJU). The founder of the school was Dr. James C. L. Wong, the first Chinese Bishop of the Taiwan Episcopal Church. Dr. Vivien Yen was the school's first president, and Bishop James C. L. Wong was its first board chairman. The succeeding chairpersons have been Dr. George K. C. Yeh( Acting Chair); Bishop James T. M. Pong; and, since 1972, Dr. Cecilia Koo. Past presidents, in addition to Dr. Yen, were Bishop James Pong, Professor William Yue-Jen Hsia, Dr. Yeh Chi-Tung, and Dr. Andrew C. Chang. Dr. Peter Tuen-Ho Yang has served as president since August 1, 2002.

He was bred in Florida by Arthur I. Appleton and although he raced under the green Blahut Stables silks he was majority owned by Allen, Josh, Angie and Renee Tepper of Tepper Racing. He finished racing with a record of 6-1-1 in 8 starts and earnings of $1,843,750. Southern Image was best known for his 2004 wins in the grade one Pimlico Special and the grade one Santa Anita Handicap which made him the third ever to win both prestigious races on separate coasts of the United States. The others were Farma Way and Seabiscuit.Pedigree Online, Thoroughbred Database;. He also won the Florida/California Sunshine Millions Classic and the grade 1 Malibu Stakes.  Two-year-old season  Southern Image was sold as a two-year-old for $300,000, the second-highest-priced horse at the Ocala Breeders' Sale in March 2003 two-year-old in training sale. He raced only once late in his two year season and won a maiden special weight race at six and a half furlongs at Santa Anita Park by three lengths. He earned $28,800.  Three-year-old season  At age three, Southern Image started the season with a third-place finish in a Triple Crown prep race to Breeders' Cup Juvenile runner-up Kafwain in the $150,000 grade two San Vicente Stakes at Santa Anita. During that race, he sustained a slight injury and had to be rested over the next five months. He came back to the track and won an allowance race in August 2003 at eight and a half furlongs at Del Mar Racetrack. In December, Southern Image scored his biggest victory of the year in the $250,000 grade two Malibu Stakes at seven furlongs at Santa Anita over Midas Eyes. He finished the year with a record of (3): 2-0-1 and earnings of $202,800. Thoroughbred Times Stallion Directory;  Four-year-old season  In January 2004, Southern Image won the $1,000,000 stakes called the Sunshine Millions Classic at nine furlongs at Santa Anita by three lengths over Excess Summer and The Judge Sez Who. In March, he won the $1,000,000 grade one Santa Anita Handicap at ten furlongs at Santa Anita Park in a time of 2:01.64 over Island Fashion and Saint Buddy. In May, Southern Image was shipped 3,000 miles east to run in the $600,000 grade one Pimlico Special at \\"Old Hilltop\\" in Baltimore, Maryland. He came into the Special off four straight victories at Santa Anita. The field was depleted on race day by the scratch of dual classic winner Funny Cide. The race also included the Preakness Stakes runner-up Midway Road, grade one winner Evening Attire, graded stakes winner Bowman's Band, and Dynever, who finished third in the prior year's Breeders' Cup Classic. Southern Image went off as the favorite at 9-5 because of his \\"Big Cap\\" score. He broke well and assumed the lead passing the stands for the first time. Going around the famous club house turn at Pimlico Race Course, jockey Victor Espinoza took hold. Throughout the backstretch and around the far turn in a 1/2 mile of :47, Southern Image sat back in second just off the right rear flank of leader Midway Road. At the top of the lane, he fought back a challenge from Bowman's Band and wore down the leader. He recorded a Beyer speed figure of 119 and a #1 on the Ragozian sheets and finished the mile and 3/16 race on dirt in 1:55.4, defeating runner-up Midway Road by 1-1/2 lengths, with third-place finisher Bowman's Band another 2 1/2 lengths behind them. One month later, Southern Image finished second in the $800,000 grade one Stephen Foster Handicap at Churchill Downs. He lost to Colonial Colony by a nose and defeated multiple graded stakes winner Perfect Drift. He concluded his four-year-old season in 2004 with a record of (4): 3-1-0 and earnings of $1,612,150.  Retirement  Southern Image stands at Taylor Made Farm in Nicholasville, Kentucky. He is also standing during the Southern Hemisphere season at Widden Stud, Australia, beginning in 2006.

Lineage Rigdzin Kumaradza was a senior disciple of Melong Dorje (1243‚Äì1303). Kumaradza studied with the grand master Orgyenpa (1230‚Äì1309), who conveyed teachings of \\"Vimalamitra's Seminal Heart\\" () upon him.

These are the last testaments of the early vidyadharas: Garab Dorje, Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´mitra, Sri Singha and Jnanasutra. These testaments are post- humous as they were delivered by the vidhyadhara to their senior disciple from within a thigle of the Five Pure Lights in their rainbow body. In this tradition, the thigle is understood to be comparable to a pure land or mandala. These were first compiled by Vimalamitra in his five series (which consisted of the series of: Golden Letters, Copper Letters, Variegated Letters, Conch Shell Letters and Turquoise Letters).

Located at 2700 W 6th Street, the hospital opened in 1879, after the Osawatomie State Hospital, once thought to be sufficient, became overcrowded with mentally-ill patients. The first buildings in both Topeka and Osawatomie were designed by John G. Haskell who was among the architects of the Kansas State Capitol, and the hospital was designed in according to the Kirkbride Plan. As of 2010, the majority of the hospital had been demolished, and in June of that year, the center building was also demolished. Hummer Sports Park now occupies its space. History=Patient treatment In the early 1900s, there were rumors of patients being abused, neglected, or raped. Patients were often left confined or chained for long periods of time. In the 1940s, reforms at the hospital changed conditions for the better. The hospital received further criticism for treatment of patients when, in 1951, it was discovered that patient John Crabb, a fifty-nine-year-old immigrant from Denmark, was in fact not clinically insane, and had been wrongfully incarcerated at the hospital. Forced sterilizations In 1913, the Kansas legislature passed the first sterilization law in the state. Many felt that the law was problematic, and thus its enforcement was less than stellar. In an attempt to make the process of the law easier, a second law was passed in 1917, which eliminated some of the work for the institutions. The 1913 law was directed at ‚Äúhabitual criminals, idiots, epileptics, imbeciles, and insane‚Äù. The 1917 law targeted the same groups, but eliminated the courts‚Äô approval from the decision. After the passage of the sterilization law in 1913, 54 sterilizations occurred over the next seven years. Because there was still a great deal of doubt and uncertainty regarding the laws, sterilizations occurred at a relatively slow rate up until 1921. However, with the passage of new laws and a new widespread acceptance, sterilizations began to increase rapidly until 1950. The rate of sterilization decreased steadily until 1961, when they ceased altogether. The rate of sterilizations per 100,000 residents per year during the peak period of sterilizations, in the mid 1930s, was about 10. At least early on, most of Kansas' forced sterilizations took place in the State Hospital in Topeka.  Murder of Stephanie Uhlrig  Stephanie Uhlrig worked as a music and activity therapist in the general hospital population. One of the patients at Topeka State Hospital was Kenneth D. Waddell, who had been placed in the custody of state mental health authorities after having been found not guilty by reason of insanity for the charge of aggravated battery. Waddell was initially placed in the Larned State Security Hospital, but on April 1, 1987, he was transferred to the Topeka State Hospital where he was placed in the Adult Forensic Ward (referred to as the \\"AWL unit\\"), which was a special unit secluded from the other units because it contained higher risk patients. This unit was closed due to budgetary constraints, and Waddell was eventually moved into the general population. On February 23, 1992, Uhlrig and another therapist took Waddell and other patients off grounds to watch a movie. Upon returning to the hospital and dropping off the other patients, Waddell attacked and killed Uhlrig, and her body was found in the bathroom in one of the buildings on the grounds. The United States Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit, decided on Aug. 30, 1995 that \\"While Uhlrig's murder was undeniably tragic, it was not the result of reckless and \\"conscience shocking\\" conduct by the state mental health administrators sued in the instant case,\\" thus affirming the district court's grant of Defendants' motion for summary judgment.  Turnbull v. Topeka State Hospital and the State of Kansas  In 2001, Cynthia Turnbull, a psychologist at the Topeka State Hospital, sued her employer and the state for sexual harassment after she was sexually assaulted by a patient. The jury found a sexually hostile work environment existed at TSH, but it split over whether TSH should be held legally responsible for that environment. After learning of the jury's inability to decide, the district court granted an earlier defense motion for judgment as a matter of law. The sole issue on appeal was whether that ruling was proper. They held that it was not, and remanded the case for further proceedings.  Closure  In 1988, the hospital lost its accreditation to receive federal Medicare and Medicaid payments. The Health Care Financing Administration determined that the State had omitted two patients from its inspection of care review at the hospital, which appealed and lost. By the 1990s, the mental health movement was away from the hospital model and toward community-based programs. Partly because the community-based model appeared effective but mostly because it was cheaper, the Kansas Legislature decided to close one of its three mental hospitals. TSH was chosen for closing and went out of business May 17, 1997. The historic center building and several others were demolished in June 2010. Cemetery The cemetery occupies a 2.8-acre plot on the northeast corner of the old Topeka State Hospital grounds; it contains the bodies of patients buried there over a 75-year period. The cemetery, which measures about 150 yards by 50 yards and is about 100 yards west of the 100 block of N.W. MacVicar, was assigned to the Kansas Department of Administration after the hospital closed. Of the 1,157 graves there, only 16 have headstones. The 2000 Kansas Legislature authorized construction of a memorial for people buried in the cemetery, including a plaque identifying the memorial, fencing to go around the cemetery and the inscription of the names of the dead.

He served as a director of the Mechanics National Bank in 1873, was chairman of the Committee on Instruction at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts from 1883 to 1890, and held the position of Academy president from 1890 to 1906. Biography Florence Earle Coates, Philadelphia poet. He was the son of Joseph Potts Hornor Coates and Eliza Henri Troth, a family of Quakers. An 1864 graduate of Haverford College, he married (first) Ella May Potts in 1872, who died on 9 May 1874 at the age of 22. He married (second) Florence Earle Coates in 1879, the daughter of prominent Philadelphia lawyer George H. Earle Sr. This was also a second marriage for Florence, her first husband - William Nicholson - died in 1877 after only five years of marriage. Coates would eventually adopt Florence's daughter from her first marriage, Alice Earle Nicholson. Florence and Edward had one child together in 1881, but the baby, Josephine Wisner Coates, died in infancy. The family had a city house at 1018 Spruce Street and a suburban house ‚Äî \\"Willing Terrace\\" ‚Äî in the Germantown section of Philadelphia. A frequent guest was literary and social critic Matthew Arnold, whom they would host during his stays in Philadelphia. Mrs. Coates was both inspired and encouraged by Mr. Arnold to pursue her interest in writing poetry. This would eventually lead to the publishing of nearly three hundred poems in the leading magazines of her day, as well as five volumes of collected verse.Bohm, Sonja N., comp. The Published Works of Florence Earle Coates (Magazines). 2009. Print. The family spent the summer months in the Adirondacks, where they owned \\"Camp Elsinore,\\" a summer retreat by Upper St. Regis Lake. There they entertained, rested, and escaped the humidity of Philadelphia summers. Many of Mrs. Coates' nature poems were inspired by the flora and fauna of the Adirondacks. About 1908, the couple moved to a city house at 2024 Spruce Street, near Rittenhouse Square, where they resided for the remainder of their lives. Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts Painter John McLure Hamilton, in a chapter about Coates from his book Men I Have Painted (1921),Hamilton, John McLure. Men I Have Painted. London: T. Fisher Unwin Ltd., 1921; p. 176-180 describes Coates' tenure at PAFA: > The reign of Mr. Coates at the Academy marked the period of its greatest > prosperity.

Portrait of Edward Hornor Coates, 10th President P.A.F.A. (1912) by John McLure Hamilton, private collection. Thomas Eakins became director of the school at PAFA in 1882, and Coates became chairman of instruction (and Eakins' superior) the following year. Coates commissioned The Swimming Hole from Eakins in 1884 as a work to be added to PAFA's permanent collection, only later to exchange it for the artist's Singing the Pathetic Song (1881).Directors and Members of the Mechanics National Bank The nudity of the men in The Swimming Hole was unlikely to have bothered Coates, he and Eakins served as PAFA's representatives overseeing Eadweard Muybridge's photographic studies of the human body in motion.Muybridge's Animal Locomotion Study , from University of Pennsylvania Archives. But most of the men in Eakins' painting were PAFA students, and having students pose nude for an instructor was contrary to PAFA policy. In January 1886, when Eakins had a male model remove his loincloth before either a female class or a mixed male-and-female class - also contrary to PAFA policy - Coates wrote him a letter of reprimand. But the incident soon snowballed into a full-blown scandal, with accusations of sexual impropriety (and even incest) against Eakins.Henry Adams, Eakins Revealed (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 60. Coates requested and received his resignation. Although their friendship was strained, Coates remained a supporter of the artist. When an Eakins client balked at paying for the bas- relief panels Knitting and Spinning, Coates bought them and donated them to PAFA. On 24 January 1890, Coates addressed the Art Club of Philadelphia on \\"The Academy of the Fine Arts and Its Future,\\" urging that \\"what the Academy now needs more than all else,‚Äîand it is worthy an eloquent and convincing plea,‚Äîis the intelligent interest and sympathetic co-operation of every citizen.\\" Pennsylvania politics In 1890, Coates was among the signatories of the \\"Independent Republicans of Pennsylvania\\" who backed the Democratic nominee Robert E. Pattison for Governor over the Republican nominee, George W. Delamater. A vote for Delamater, they stressed, would mean \\"the public indorsement\\" of the corrupt Matthew Stanley Quay, then the junior U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania.\\"Against Quay and Delamater\\" (New York Times, 8 September 1890) Pattison would go on to win the Governorship. In 1894, Coates joined the ranks of the \\"Quaker City Rebels\\" in the continued fight against Quay and corrupt \\"bossism\\" politics.\\"The Quaker City Rebels\\" (New York Times, 30 December 1894) Death and legacy Edward Hornor Coates died on 23 December 1921. A funeral service was held at his Spruce Street house three days later, and he was buried at the Church of the Redeemer (Episcopal) churchyard in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. The inscription on Coates' headstone - \\"High thought seated in a heart of courtesy\\" - was Sir Phillip Sydney's description of an honorable man and gentleman.

Pebble motion problems occur in domains such as multi-robot motion planning (in which the pebbles are robots) and network routing (in which the pebbles are packets of data). The best-known example of a pebble motion problem is the famous 15 puzzle where a disordered group of fifteen tiles must be rearranged within a 4x4 grid by sliding one tile at a time. Theoretical formulation The general form of the pebble motion problem is Pebble Motion on Graphs formulated as follows: Let G = (V,E) be a graph with n vertices. Let P = {1,\\\\ldots,k} be a set of pebbles with k < n. An arrangement of pebbles is a mapping S : P \\\\rightarrow V such that S(i) eq S(j) for i eq j. A move m = (p, u, v) consists of transferring pebble p from vertex u to adjacent unoccupied vertex v. The Pebble Motion on Graphs problem is to decide, given two arrangements S_0 and S_+, whether there is a sequence of moves that transforms S_0 into S_+. Variations Common variations on the problem limit the structure of the graph to be: * a tree * a square grid, * a bi-connected graph. Another set of variations consider the case in which some or all of the pebbles are unlabeled and interchangeable. Other versions of the problem seek not only to prove reachability but to find a (potentially optimal) sequence of moves (i.e. a plan) which performs the transformation. Complexity Finding the shortest path in the pebble motion on graphs problem (with labeled pebbles) is known to be NP-hard and APX-hard. The unlabeled problem can be solved in polynomial time when using the cost metric mentioned above (minimizing the total number of moves to adjacent vertices), but is NP-hard for other natural cost metrics.

Early life and career A native of Boston, Massachusetts, Durgin served in the U.S. Air Force before launching his radio career in Europe in 1964. Upon his return, he worked as news director for KTOK in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In 1989, he began working at WHP (AM) in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. There, his radio show became \\"consistently popular\\" and was credited for increasing WHP (AM) to second place in its market. He was named the \\"Reader's Choice\\" best local talk show host in the Harrisburg area by Harrisburg Magazine. The Bob Durgin Show He is known for wearing a Stetson hat and cowboy boots and for his catchphrases \\"Shut Up and Pay Your Taxes\\" and ‚ÄúGive Me a Physical Break!‚Äù His personality has been described as \\"rowdy\\" and his political leanings are \\"conservative.\\" His radio show was the center of several political events and controversies. During the 1996 election for Pennsylvania Treasurer, Republican Barbara Hafer called Durgin's show to respond to comments by incumbent Democratic Treasurer Catherine Baker Knoll saying that Hafer had misused public funds. Hafer told Durgin on air that Knoll and her daughter, Mina Baker Knoll who was running for the Democratic nomination to succeed her mother, were \\"lying through their teeth. They are lying scumbags. I'm telling you, they are lying. They are outrageous.\\" Pressed by Durgin, Hafer added \\"Scumbags, that is exactly what they were. And I'll tell you, if we were in Western Pennsylvania I'd do a South Side salute, and Cathy knows exactly what that is.\\" In a later interview, Hafer did not retract her comments but noted that she might have \\"second thoughts\\" about her language. In 2004, State Representative Tom Creighton introduced legislation that would delay sheriff sales after hearing a segment on Durgin's show about an elderly woman whose home was sold for $15,000 because she hadn't paid $300 in property taxes. On July 8, 2013, Bob Durgin announced his retirement. ‚ÄúI feel as though, not only am I giving up a career, which is a lot, but I‚Äôm giving up a way of life,‚Äù Bob Durgin, age 70, said on his show. His last show was broadcast on August 2, 2013. Political activism Durgin led protests against the 1995 Pennsylvania General Assembly pay raise, both on his radio program and as a leader of large-scale protests like \\"The Rotunda Roundup\\" rally at the Pennsylvania State Capitol. Following the 2005 legislative pay raise, Durgin's show became \\"ground zero in Central Pennsylvania for public outrage over the raise.\\" Legislators, including Roy Baldwin, noticed increases in the volume of critical emails and phone calls about the pay raise when Durgin did shows about the pay raise. Journalist Tom Barnes noted that Durgin \\"complains about the raise nearly every day on his show.\\" During the summer legislative recess, Durgin collected over 129,000 signatures that he presented to legislators during a \\"Rock the Capitol\\" event upon their return to the Pennsylvania State Capitol. He unveiled the petitions by carpeting the steps of the State Capitol, before leading 100 supporters through the halls looking to lobby their legislators to repeal the pay raise. To avoid a confrontation with the protesters, the Pennsylvania Senate recessed for private caucus meetings Aides to John Perzel denied access to his office because of size concerns. In 2007, he was presented with an honor from a reform group protesting the Pennsylvania Society by holding a potluck dinner in the state capitol.

Starring Dileep, Samyuktha Varma, Kavya Madhavan, Lal, Biju Menon, Jagadish, and Innocent. The music was composed by Vidyasagar. Plot The movie starts with Mukundan (Dileep) as a cab driver in Mysuru, Karnataka. He meets Hema (Samyuktha Varma) during a trip arranged when Hema, who works as a drama artist, got held up midway in late night due to the troupe bus breaking down. A friendship grows between them. Later Mukundan shifts his residence to the area where Hema lives due to his roommate's bad behaviour. One day when Mukundan reaches to pick a trip from a lodge he finds his client (Biju Menon) in a serious condition after a suicide attempt and Mukundan save his life by the prompt action of calling emergency medical services. There he meets the family of Biju Menon which reflects a wonder in him and finally goes through a flashback in which Mukudan's (Dileep) past as a Bank Field Officer in a remote Karnataka village is narrated. Through a series of events he meets and falls in love with Radha (Kavya Madhavan) and plans to get married. But her brother (Lal) without knowing the relationship, plans for marriage of Radha with Biju Menon, who is her Lecturer in College. Mukundan falls in a trap conspired by a local goon and money lender, Mukundan's bose (who is on suspension for misappropriation of bank money) and Radha's father gets arrested by the police on charges of cheating the bank. Without knowing the truth and the fact that Mukundan is innocent, Radha is forced to marry Biju Menon. In a fight, it occcured that Mukundan comes back to the village when he gets bail, the local goon, Thimmaiah, (acted by Meghanathan) is killed and Radha's brother goes to jail taking the responsibility. Mukundan loses his job and works as a cab driver for a living. We meet Radha again at hospital as a guilt-stricken wife who cannot transform as a wife in full and true sense as she still longs for Mukundan deeply. Due to this negligent behaviour of Radha, Biju Menon tries to commit suicide and is brought back to life by Mukundan during the start of the movie. Coming to know the miserable condition of Biju Menon, Mukundan decides to fake a marriage with Hema and asks Radha to forget him and start a new life as a responsible wife admitting the change in their lives made by fate. A heartbroken Radha understands the situation and goes into the arms of Biju Menon. After Radha's parting, Mukundan asks Hema to give back the Thali (nuptial pendant), Hema becomes emotional and Mukundan and Hema decide to enter into family life and walk down the temple on a hilltop where the marriage was set as a drama, which turned to a real commitment, hand in hand.

Everett was begun in 1907, completed in 1908, and dedicated on the congregation's ninth anniversary, May 29, 1908. An adjacent Temple Center opened in 1924, housing a religion school and other organizations; a wing was added in 1951. This temple building was demolished in 1993 after an unsuccessful attempt to work out a way to repurpose it as an arts venue. That effort did, however, end up salvaging a different former religious building: Seattle's Fourth Church of Christ, Scientist, now Town Hall Seattle. The current sanctuary at 16th Avenue and Pike Street‚Äîthe opposite corner of the same block as the old temple‚Äîwas completed in 1960. That current building was designed by B. Marcus Priteca, John Detlie, and John Peck. Priteca was a noted theater architect: he designed all of Alexander Pantages' theaters between 1910 and 1929, as well as the landmark Seattle synagogue, Chevra Bikur Cholim (1912), now the Langston Hughes Performing Arts Center.B.

Remains of the old temple (2008) Schwabacher the gift of his mother\\". A Ladies Auxiliary (now the Women of Reform Judaism) was formed within months of the congregation's founding; a Temple Men's Club (now the Men of Reform Judaism) followed in 1920. The first rabbi of Temple De Hirsch was Theodore Joseph from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. His successor, Samuel Koch, was senior rabbi from 1906 to 1942. During Koch's time, Temple De Hirsch solidified its position as an important and steadily expanding congregation, with a religion school attended not only by children of the congregation but by some whose parents were not Reform Jews. In 1909, Koch established a newsletter, Temple Tidings, initially a weekly and later a monthly (currently bi-monthly) publication. Upon Koch's retirement, he was succeeded by Raphael H. Levine, who served as senior rabbi from 1942 to 1970. Levine was a devoted ecumenicist, co-hosting a television program called Challenge with a Catholic priest and a Protestant minister. Challenge aired for 14 years, first on KOMO-TV and later on KING-TV, both in Seattle. Rabbi Levine also founded the Pacific Association of Reform Rabbis, the ecumenical Camp Brotherhood, a religious, educational, and cultural center for Christians and Jews, and co-founded Camp Swig, an educational and recreational camp for Jewish youth, and played a significant role in the expansion of Children's Orthopedic Hospital, now Seattle Children's. Rabbi Levine's successor, Earl S. Starr, was senior rabbi from 1970. He saw through the merger of congregations and remained senior rabbi of Temple De Hirsch Sinai until 2001. Like all of his predecessors at Temple De Hirsch, he carried on a long tradition of community service and outreach. Temple De Hirsch has at least two claims to fame in the history of music. Samuel E. Goldfarb, co-composer of the Hanukkah song \\"I Have a Little Dreidel\\" was music director of Temple De Hirsch from 1930 to 1968. Using a farm system that allowed youth to \\"graduate\\" from one level of choir to another, he created one of the country's finest temple choirs. Perhaps more unusually, Jimi Hendrix played his first professional gig as a musician in the Temple De Hirsch basement; he was fired mid-performance for his wild playing.Charles R.

Queen Anne Hill, Seattle, Washington. Temple De Hirsch Sinai retained both the Temple De Hirsch facility (its \\"Seattle Campus\\") and the Temple Sinai facility (its \\"Bellevue campus\\"). The original Bellevue facility was sold in 2001, when a new facility was constructed in the Eastgate area of Bellevue. Rabbi Starr served as senior rabbi until his retirement in July 2001, when he was succeeded by Daniel A. Weiner, who currently holds the position. The Seattle building shares facilities with a local private school, the Seattle Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Bellevue facility shares facilities with the Emerald Heights Academy. Temple De Hirsch Sinai Library The Temple De Hirsch Sinai Libraries were founded in 1908 and continue to provide a wealth of information for the congregation and community. In both Seattle and Bellevue sites, it currently contains over 10,000 books, periodicals and CDs. It specializes in materials on Judaism, History, Culture, Holiday and the Holocaust. The Benjamin Zukor Children's Library composes about one third of the total library collection and is spread over both library sites. It contains fiction and non-fiction for children and teens.

The chancery is located at Kristianiagade 5 in Indre √òsterbro, Copenhagen, and is a heritage listed building.  History  In 1897, Otto M√∏nsted, a Danish entrepreneur and margarine magnate, purchased three parcels of land in √òsterbro, Copenhagen and commissioned architect Vilhelm Dahlerup to design a villa on the site. Dahlerup, who specialised in Italian Renaissance style design had previously designed the Hotel D‚ÄôAngleterre, the Jesus Church in Valby, the National Gallery, and the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, amongst others. Completed in 1899, the building of the mansion cost M√∏nsted half a million krone. The entrance was decorated with a monogram with the initials AOM (for Anna-Otto-M√∏nsted). The M√∏nsteds kept a large staff in their mansion, with gardeners creating a large garden, and in the garage M√∏nsted kept Copenhagen's most expensive car. The M√∏nsteds also bred Scottish hunting dogs and kept race horses in the barn. In 1934, Anna M√∏nsted sold the mansion for 265,000 kroner to Countess Musse Scheel, a Danish actress, who became the last private owner of the mansion. Scheel, an animal lover, who was widely regarded as being eccentric, kept a hen house in the yard and sold eggs to her neighbours. During the occupation of Denmark by Nazi Germany, the mansion was the headquarters of the Northern Society which promoted cultural co-operation between Nazi Germany and the Nordic countries. In 1950, the Soviet Union signed a contract leasing the mansion for 20,000 kroner per year. In 1982, the mansion, as well as Kristianiagade 3 (consulate) and Bergensgade 11 (embassy school), were granted to the Soviets, on the basis of reciprocity, free of charge for the purpose of embassy requirements for a period of 70 years, until 31 December 2051.

It was produced from 2001‚Äì2004, with a total of 31 episodes. Each episode runs for approximately 48 minutes including the credits and opening titles.  Format  Episodes of Built For The Kill cover a topic or habitat for predatory animals, such as \\"Coral Reef\\" or \\"Packs\\". If the episode is the name of a Habitat (Coral Reef), the episode will feature predators from that environment. If the episode's name is something like \\"Jaws\\" or \\"Packs\\", it will feature predators who utilize the name of the episode. Built For The Kill uses a graphical approach to catch the audiences attention, often showing inner workings of the predatory animals (e.g. showing a snake's \\"Jacobson Organ\\" inside its mouth) by using diagrams. Some effects seen are used to show the audience what they can't really see, but is there (such as the electricity coming from an Electric Ray or the sound waves used in Echo Location). This graphical approach to nature is meant to make the documentary more interesting to watch. Built for the Kills classic opening was a montage of creatures featured in the first 7 episodes (Desert, Coral Reef, Rainforest, Grassland, Miniature, Swamp and Ocean) with a catchy theme song. This opening was changed further into the series to one that shows the National Geographic logo in various parts. The theme song stayed the same however. In 2011 National Geographic Channel resurrect the show with four new episodes. However, the four episodes were presented with a slightly different style than the original. The following four episodes are (lion, great white shark, polar bear, and crocodile) and is expected to be continued.

Several AV Idols worked for Try-Heart in the 1990s including Ky≈çko Kazama who starred in Super Breasts on the Pink Drug label in 1996, Haruki Mizuno who made her debut on the Sexia label in 1997, and Azumi Kawashima who debuted with Sexia in 1998.

He was among the first Indian revolutionaries who lit the torch of freedom movement against British rule. Much before Mohandas K. Gandhi initiated the Satyagrah movement, Pathik experimented during the Bijolia‚Äôs Kisan agitation. His real name was Bhoop Singh Gurjar, but after being implicated in the Lahore conspiracy case in 1915, he changed his name to Vijay Singh Pathik. His grandfather's sacrifice in the struggle of 1857 in Bulandshahr district, affected him deeply to be freedom fighter and rovolutionis. His descendants now live in Delhi.

His father Hamir singh took active part in the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 and got arrested many times. The name of his grand father was Inder Singh, who was Prime Minister (Diwan) of Malagarh principality (Riyasat) who was killed while fighting against the British.

It was Pathikji who fought for the cause of united Rajasthan and had taken up the issue with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel. He was jailed for having led the Kisan agitation in Bijoliya and kept at special jail created in the Tehsil building of Todgarh. The Kisan Panchayat, Mahila Mandal and Yuvak Mandal invited Pathik to come and lead them. Women of Mewar started to get respect from their folk men. Pathik made people feel that women and men equality is necessary to develop a prosperous society. Pathik was a great patriot and freedom fighter.

He was married to Florence Jane Jones (9 May 1886 - 8 February 1973) on 21 March 1917. Bassett-Lowke was actively interested in modern design, notably becoming a patron of the architect and designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh, who remodelled Basset-Lowke's home at 78 Derngate, Northampton. Now a Grade II* listed building, the house (which has been fully restored) is now open as a museum and visitor attraction. He also employed the services of the stained glass artist E.W. Twining to provide much of his company's graphic identity. His close contacts with German toy manufacturers, particularly Gebruder Bing, introduced him to the very advanced state of design in Germany and organisations such as the Deutscher Werkbund. He was quick to join its British equivalent, The Design and Industries Association, founded at the opening of the Great War. It is notable that in 1925-6 Lowke commissioned the German architect-designer Peter Behrens to design his house 'New Ways' in Northampton (now considered the first modernist building in the UK) rather than any UK architect. Lowke professed to Fabian socialist politics, serving on the executive of the Fabian Society from 1922 until 1924. He greatly admired George Bernard Shaw, to the extent of having him modelled as an '0' scale railway platform accessory. He supported Stephan Bing and other members of the family when, as Jews, they fled Nazi Germany to the UK in 1933. Although Bassett-Lowke left school at thirteen, he absorbed many new ideas from his travelling and contact with people from all walks of life. He went on fact-finding missions to Germany and Holland. He was also keen to ensure that the outside world appreciated the benefits of Northampton. In 1932, he was instrumental in producing a film showing Northampton‚Äôs history and current attractions. Despite his incessant travel, Bassett-Lowke never thought of leaving Northampton. He was a member of many societies, including the Rotary Club, of which he was a founder. His work on the Northampton Council gave him most opportunity to influence the future of the town. He was also a founder Director of the Northampton Repertory Theatre in 1926. In January 2011 it was announced that W.J Bassett-Lowke would be commemorated with a steel sculpture placed alongside the River Nene near a cycle route which runs from Beckets Park towards Upton in Northampton. Bassett-Lowke was the winning choice following a public vote in Northamptonshire in which several potential 'local icons' were nominated. Charles Rennie Mackintosh and poet John Clare will also be commemorated as part of the same project, having received the second and third highest number of votes respectively.

The island lies off Shaw Island near the entrance to Blind Bay and is part of San Juan Islands National Monument. It has about of saltwater shoreline and is part of the Cascadia Marine Trail, with all campsites restricted to visitors arriving in non-motorized watercraft. It became a state park in 1970 under lease from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and is cooperatively managed by the BLM and Washington State Parks. In the late 1800s, a man named John Fox homesteaded the island https://parks.state.wa.us/477/Blind-Island and built a small house and storage sheds on Blind Island. Fox was an immigrant from Germany, where he had made his living as a fisherman. After his divorce from Katherine Fox Dickman, he moved to the island where he lived as a fisherman and tilled a small garden spot, evidence of which still remains today. Fox's son, also named John Fox, died around 1960 after living alone on the island. The Foxes dug several holes into the rock, evidently to be used as cisterns. The elder Fox is buried on the island. There is a small spring, around which a concrete retainer was built that is still in place. The water is unsafe to drink. All buildings were removed in 1972 due to their unsafe conditions.

He was active in the Central Travancore area in the present-day Kerala, India. He is said to have stolen from the rich and given to the poor. Legends on his life are part of the folklore of Kerala, in which he is depicted as a heroic outlaw.Where a legendary Robin Hood played his tricks , Deccan Herald, 27 July 2008. His stories are often associated with his friend and fellow outlaw Ithikkara Pakki. There is a Hindu shrine in Kerala for him. History Kayamkulam Kochunni was born in 1818, near Kottukulangara, Karthikapally Taluk in Travancore (present-day Kerala). He spent his childhood and younger ages in Evoor. After his father's death, the family fell to poverty and Kochunni was employed in a grocery store. Later he began stealing and became an outlaw. He was known for stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. Kochunni was once caught by the officials after his lover betrayed him, he escaped and killed her along with her assistant. Following that he went into hiding, during which he stole the Shaligram belonging to the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. Ayilyam Thirunal Rama Varma was the ruler of Travancore and T. Madhava Rao was the Diwan of Travancore at the time. Kochunni was accused of several thefts and two homicides. Both the Palace and police officials failed to find Kochunni, after which a warrior, Arattupuzha Velayudha Panicker, was enlisted with the task, who eventually captured him and submitted to the Diwan. Panicker was honoured by the King. Kochunni was remanded for one year, during which he died in the Travancore jail in 1859. His remains was buried at the Pettah Juma Masjid. According to historians, the Central Archives building in present-day Thiruvananthapuram was formerly a prison in the 19th century and is believed to be the first Travancore prison, which is likely where Kochunni was incarcerated. However, Kochunni's death is disputed. Another record cites he was imprisoned at Central Prison, Poojappura in his 70s. Some researchers states that it was after the success of the 1966 film that the present account of his death (that he died in September 1859, aged 41) was popularized and dominated while the other account diminished, the movie used the former since it was more suitable for the film's commercial success. As per the other record, he escaped and lived another 36 years. He died at the age of 77 from Tuberculosis at the cow barn of Thoppil tharavadu (family of Thoppil Bhasi) in Vallikunnam. He was staying there undercover as a steward and farm-hand of the family. A woman from the house took care of him during his final days, who was the only one aware of his true identity. During Kochunni's peak time, the Diwan ordered his capture. The then Tahsildar of Karthikapally Taluk managed to capture him with the help of one of Kochunni's confidant. But Kochunni escaped and killed his confidant and the policeman who arrested him. Later, Kunju Panicker was appointed as the Tahsildar. He sought the help of Kochunni's acquaintances Kochu Pillai, Kopparaparambil Mammad, Kaduvachery Vava, Kottappurathu Bappukunju, Pakkolathu Noorammadhu, and Valiyakulangara Kunjumarakkar. Kochunni was invited to Kochu Pillai's wife's home in Vazhappally and sedated him by drugging food. He was arrested, and while transporting him to Thiruvananthapuram through Kayamkulam backwaters, he regained sense and managed to escape by leaping into the water. It is said that Kochunni was in hideout at Pathanamthitta and Punalur after that and to have returned to Kayamkulam during his final period, and shortly after moved to a secure hideout at Thoppil family. While another of the same account states he was successfully transported to Thiruvananthapuram, incarcerated and hanged after 91 days (in 1859 at the age of 41) and his remains to have buried at the Pettah Juma Masjid. However, there is no documentation about his sentencing in state's jail records or in the Mathilakam documents. Legacy A shrine dedicated to Kochunni is attached to Edappara Maladevar Nada Temple near Kozhencherry that dates back more than one and a half centuries. People there offer candles, incense sticks, ganja, country-made liquor, betel leaves, pan, areca nut, tobacco, etc. to propitiate the deity. There is a small museum at Varanappallil, an ancestral house in Kayamkulam for Kochunni.

Biography=Background and early life Gardiner was born in Poona, India, the son of Colour Sergeant Charles Gardiner of the Worcestershire Regiment, and Beatrice Gardiner (n√©e Delahay). He attended the Duke of York's Royal Military School in Dover, Kent, from 1901 until 1906, then joined the Army. World War I Gardiner was serving as a corporal in the 16th (The Queen's) Lancers when on 10 September 1915 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant \\"for service in the field\\" in the Royal Irish Regiment. On 21 May 1916 he was seconded for service with the Machine Gun Corps, and on 6 October he was transferred to the Royal Flying Corps, being appointed a flying officer (observer) on 15 December. He served with No. 14 Squadron RFC in the Middle East, before training as a pilot, and he was appointed a flying officer on 24 June 1917. On 1 July he was promoted to lieutenant, and was assigned to No. 47 Squadron RFC, serving on the Macedonian front. He gained his first victory there on 1 October, over Beles, flying a B.E.12, by driving down an Albatros C out of control. He was wounded in action later in October, but soon returned to flying as he was credited with destroying an Albatros D.III in November, while flying a DH.2. Gardiner gained this victory while repelling an attack, and even though his gun jammed on the fourth shot, infantry below belatedly confirmed the kill. On 1 April 1918 the Army's Royal Flying Corps was merged with the Royal Naval Air Service to form the Royal Air Force, and the same day Gardiner was one of a number of pilots from No. 47 and No. 17 Squadrons transferred to form a new unit, No. 150 Squadron RAF, based at Salonika. On 3 June, in the King's birthday honours list, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, and on the 6th, now flying a Sopwith Camel, he gained his third victory, accounting for another Albatros D.III over Mravinca. He then destroyed an Albatros D.V on 12 June, near Pardovica, and another Albatros C east of Cestovo on 25 June, to gain \\"ace\\" status. On 28 June he was appointed acting captain, and gained his sixth and final victory on 3 September, with another Albatros D.V destroyed west of Cerniste. Inter-war career Gardiner remained in the RAF post-war, being appointed an acting captain for a second time on 1 May 1919, and being made a Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur, and receiving the Croix de guerre, from France. He was promoted from flying officer to flight lieutenant on 1 January 1922, while serving with No. 84 Squadron in Iraq. He then returned to the UK, and was posted as a supernumerary officer at the RAF Depot (Inland Area) on 31 March 1922. On 27 August he was posted to the Headquarters of No. 7 Group (Inland Area) for personnel staff duties. Gardiner was then assigned to No. 2 Flying Training School at RAF Duxford on 1 March 1924. On 28 July 1927 he was assigned to the Air Ministry to serve in the Directorate of Training, and between 5 July and 10 October 1928 he was seconded for duty in Estonia. After a short time at the RAF Depot at RAF Uxbridge, he returned to the Air Ministry Directorate of Training on 21 December 1928. Gardiner was promoted to squadron leader on 14 May 1930, and on 2 January 1931 was posted to No. 55 Squadron based at RAF Hinaidi in Iraq. On 23 June he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order \\"in recognition of gallant and distinguished service in Iraq\\". Gardiner was posted to No. 4 Flying Training School at RAF Abu Sueir in Egypt, as Chief Flying Instructor, on 23 October 1934, and also served as an instructor at RAF Hendon in 1935. In June 1936 he was selected for retention on the active list up to the age of 48, which would be in 1940. On 1 January 1937 he was promoted to wing commander, and on the 11th was appointed commander of No. 216 (Bomber Transport) Squadron based at Heliopolis. World War II Gardiner was promoted to group captain on 1 March 1940, but \\"died on active service\\" at Helmieh Hospital on 30 July 1940 while serving as station commander at RAF Helwan, and was buried at the Cairo War Memorial Cemetery. He was survived by his wife Kathleen August Lyle Gardiner of Tiverton, Devon.

It was written by a Pseudo-Aristotle instead and is now generally believed to be the work of Anaximenes of Lampsacus. Authorship Quintilian seems to refer to this work under Anaximenes' name in Institutio Oratoria,Quitilian, Institutio Oratoria 3.4.9 as the Italian Renaissance philologist Piero Vettori first recognized. This attribution has been disputed by some scholars however. Content As a complete Greek manual on rhetoric still extant from the fourth century BCE, Rhetoric to Alexander gives us an invaluable look into the rhetorical theory of the time. Aristotle did in fact write a work On Rhetoric at much the same time. The author claims to have based this treatise on the Techne of Corax and the Theodectea of Aristotle which may in fact refer to On Rhetoric seeing that Aristotle's work was not published until 83 BCE. The teaching of Aristotle on the matter was made available during his lectures and his lecturing notes was preserved after his death by his pupil, Theophrastus. The structure of Rhetoric to Alexander is quite similar to that of Aristotle's work. Chapters 1-5 deal with arguments specific to each of the species of rhetoric corresponding to the first book of Aristotle's work. Chapters 6-22 are about \\"uses\\" what Aristotle calls \\"topics\\", discussing them in the latter part of his second book. Chapters 23-28 discuss style which Aristotle discusses in the first half of his third book. And chapters 29-37 finally treat arrangement as discussed by Aristotle in the latter part of his third book. From this it is clear that both the Rhetoric to Alexander and Aristotle's On Rhetoric were using a structure common to rhetorical handbooks of the fourth century. In contrast to Aristotle, the author of Rhetoric to Alexander does not use examples illustrating his precepts. Because this treatise differs from Aristotle in some details it is sometimes thought to have stood in the tradition surrounding the person of Isocrates, but there is no clear evidence for this. The treatise Rhetoric to Alexander does not seem to have made a big impact on rhetorical studies at the time and is not often heard of afterwards. It only survived because it was thought to have been written by Aristotle.

It rises to about 20 metres above the level of the lake (itself 258 m above sea level), and takes the form of a comma with dimensions of about 450 x 260 m and an area of some 5 hectares. It is about 470 m NE of the larger island of Isola Maggiore. Isola Minore is covered by woodland, with pines and holm oaks providing protection for the nesting sites of numerous cormorants. In the Middle Ages it had rather a large population. During the fifteenth century however the inhabitants transferred en masse to the mainland to escape from the depredations of brigands and subsequently it has been home only to the occasional hermit. Today the island is in private ownership and uninhabited. It is not on any of the ferry routes and there is no jetty or other dedicated facilities for moorage.

First, a circular hole is dug on the ground, and a circle is drawn on the outside. After placing a short stick around the outside of the hole, it is hit with the long stick, and the rebounding stick (the short one that was just hit), is hit again with the long stick in mid-air, sending it flying far away.  History  Jachigi or ja chigi is said to have originated from the game called gyeokgu, a popular sport in ancient Goryeo used for military purposes. It involved two teams holding sticks, which were used to shoot a ball in between two goal posts set up in the middle of a gyeokgu field. The game resembled the modern-day field hockey sport especially as it was also played on horseback. It was, however, included in the military service examination and training in the Joseon period. The advent of modern warfare, particularly after Joseon's war with Japan, made the gyeokgu irrelevant in armed combat and from then on, it transformed into simpler forms and spread across Korea as popular children's games. It was the basis of the shuttlecock-kicking game and the jachigi. The jachigi game denotes measuring with a stick and hitting. Ja means wooden stick, while chigi means measuring distance. To play effectively, the stick should be about 30 centimeters long and the shorter stick must be 7 centimeters.  How to play Jachigi  The rules are to first divide two or more people into two teams, either the offensive area or the defensive area. The offensive side hits the stick and lets it fly; if the opposing team catches it, the offense and the defense switch sides. If there were only two people playing, the player who hit the stick would lose. In the case that it could not be caught, the opposing team picks up the short stick, and throws it toward the hole. Then, the offensive person hits it back. Where the short stick fell, they measure with the long stick. Right then, the long stick becomes one ruler. The name Jachigi is used because of the use of the long stick as a ruler to determine the winner. The longer the distance measured, the higher the score.

Bian was born in Haimen, Jiangsu on December 8, 1910, and liked to read classical and modern Chinese poems when he was very young. In 1929, he entered the English department of Beijing University to study. During this time he was greatly influenced by the English romantic poems and French symbolic poems, and began to write poems by himself. The poetry anthology The Han Garden Collection () co-written by Bian, Li Guangtian and He Qifang, was published in 1936. Bian's poems were related to the Crescent School () which advocated modern metrical poetry, but his style was closer to the Chinese symbolists. He once coedited the magazine New Poems () with the representative figure of Chinese symbolist poetry Dai Wangshu. Bian's poems of this time represented his dissatisfaction and thinking of the social reality as a young intellectual, showed his quick perception, and sometimes hard to understand. He sought for strangeness of words, tidiness of syllables, and many of his poems were full of a melancholy mood. During the Second Sino- Japanese War, he taught at Sichuan University and National Southwestern Associated University. From 1938 to 1939 he took a visit to Yan'an and Taihangshan, and once taught at the institute of Lu Xun's art and literature. Bian compiled his A Selection of 10 Years' Poetry (1930‚Äì1939) () in 1941, and it was published in the next year. In 1946, he went to the Nankai University to teach. In 1949, Bian became a professor of the foreign language department of Beijing University.

Managing the Eurasian Fund for Stabilization and Development Main article: EurAsEC Anti-Crisis Fund The EurAsEC Anti-Crisis Fund totalling US $8.513 billion was established by the governments of six countries: Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan. Its main goals are to help its member countries mitigate the negative effects of the global financial crisis, to ensure their long-term economic and financial stability, and to foster integration. In June 2009, member states appointed EDB the manager. As the fund manager, EDB prepares and implements its programme. In June 2015 fund was renamed as the Eurasian Fund for Stabilization and Developmentd because of the abolition of the EurAsEC as a result of the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union. The fund has two instruments at its disposal: financial credits to support budgets, balances of payments, and national currencies; and investment credits for international projects. In addition to financial and investment credits, it can provide grants to its member states. In 2010-2011, the fund authorised financial credit for Tajikistan (US$70 million) and Belarus (US$3 billion). To date, US $2.63 billion has been disbursed under these loans. In December 2013 the fund's council approved the financing for two investment projects in the Kyrgyz Republic: * US $60 million to reconstruct a section of the Bishkek-Osh road corridor * US $20 million to purchase agricultural equipment EDB and the Kyrgyz Republic signed agreements to finance these projects in March 2014. In July 2014 the fund's council decided to provide a US $150 million investment credit to Armenia to finance the construction of the North-South road corridor (Phase 4). In April 2015 the bank and the Republic of Armenia signed an agreement to finance this project. In addition, the Fund's Council approved blueprints for four projects: * reconstruction of the Toktogul HPP in Kyrgyzstan (US $75 million), including the replacement of Units 2 and 4 * commissioning of Unit 2 at the Kambarata 2 HPP in Kyrgyzstan (US $80 million) * upgrade of irrigation facilities in Armenia (US $40 million) * distribution network infrastructure construction to export agricultural produce from the Kyrgyz Republic to the Customs Union member states (US $25 million) Technical assistance In 2008, the bank established a technical assistance fund to provide financial support for pre-investment and innovation research at the international, national and sector levels, aimed at deepening Eurasian integration, strengthening market infrastructure and promoting sustainable economic growth in its member states. This fund implements the following programmes: * technical assistance as part of financing investment projects * the Regional Integration Studies Programme * the Innovative Economy Support Programme * the Programme of Support for Interregional and International Programmes The total portfolio includes 57 projects and has a value of about US $6.5 million. Research EDB's Strategy and Research Department implements large-scale research and applied projects, holds regular conferences and round tables; and publishes research, sector-specific and specialist reports and macroeconomic reviews providing analysing and forecasts relating to the economic development of the region. Materials published by the Bank discuss regional integration, the operations of other development banks and the financing of investment projects in the post-Soviet space. The deepening and widening of integration in Eurasia made possible by the establishment of the Customs Union and the Single Economic Space by Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia are processes that require comprehensive analysis. EDB established the Centre for Integration Studies in 2011 to provide this analysis. The centre carries out research and drafts reports and recommendations for EDB's member-state governments. It also hosts round tables and expert group meetings on a wide range of issues concerning regional economic integration. The results of the centre's work can be found in a number of publications, in particular its series of Reports, the Journal for Eurasian Integration, the Eurasian Integration Yearbook, various papers and monographs. The centre leads work on a number of large-scale permanent projects, in particular the System of Indicators of Eurasian Integration, Monitoring of Mutual Investments in the CIS, and the Integration Barometer.r Mobilisation of financial resources EDB works with financial institutions worldwide to mobilise long-term finance in capital markets, which are the main source of financing for the bank's investment activities. The fundraising instruments include Eurobonds under the EMTN programme; bonds in local markets; securities under the ECP programme; and bilateral bank loans. The bank has credit ratings from international rating agencies: Standard & Poor's (–í–í–í/negative) and Moody's Investors Service (–ê3/stable). International cooperation EDB focuses on cooperation with the United Nations and its specialized agencies, the Eurasian Economic Commission and the Commonwealth of Independent States.

During the riot members of Horde Zla (\\"Legions of Evil\\", a FK Sarajevo supporters group) and ≈†kripari (a NK ≈†iroki Brijeg supporters group) confronted each other in altercations which subsequently spilled out to the majority of the town. Horde Zla burned cars and demolished shops while ≈†kripari and residents of ≈†iroki Brijeg stoned Horde Zla buses and shot at supporters. Horde Zla also claim multiple counts of severe police brutality which led to the death of Horde Zla member Vedran Puljiƒá from gunshot wounds. The riots There are conflicting reports about who started the violence. Horde Zla accused local residents and police for their mistreatment on their way to the match, saying that the incident was planned by local politicians and that their buses were separated and parked too far from the stadium which left them open to stoning and attacks. They also claim that initially there were only 30 local policemen present, and they did nothing to prevent the violence. Local police and residents said Horde Zla fans were the first to attack. According to local police officials, most of the regional police had earlier been sent to the nearby city of Mostar to prevent possible violence during the match between the rival Zrinjski and Vele≈æ clubs scheduled for the same day thus leaving the match in ≈†iroki Brijeg relatively ill secured. Some 500 fans of the Sarajevo football club were present during the match in ≈†iroki Brijeg as well as between 150 and 200 members of the Red Army (supporters of FK Vele≈æ closely aligned with Horde Zla). According to Croatian media, members of Horde Zla have a history of starting riots in nearby Posu≈°je and that Horde Zla were involved in similar riots before. In September 1990 they had a conflict in Belgrade and they stabbed 2 members of Grobari (supporters of FK Partizan). While ≈†kripari have been accused by Bosnian media of harboring far-right Usta≈°e sympathies including displaying the Nazi swastika in their stands on multiple occasions. 31 people were injured in the riots, 6 of them severely. One member of Horde, named Vedran Puljiƒá (a Sarajevo Croat), was shot and subsequently died. According to Zlatko Galiƒá, the chief of West Herzegovina Canton police, Vedran Puljiƒá had a record for multiple violations related to hooliganism. Police arrested Oliver Knezoviƒá as a suspect of shooting Vedran Puljiƒá. Knezoviƒá is believed to be a former member of Ka≈ænjeniƒçka Bojna unit of HVO. He reportedly fired at the FK Sarajevo supporters using a Kalashnikov automatic rifle. Knezoviƒá escaped from prison only hours after he was apprehended. Eight ≈†iroki Brijeg policemen were detained for allowing the escape of Oliver Knezoviƒá. Oliver Knezoviƒá fled to Zagreb, Croatia, where he would not be extradited to the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as there is no agreement on this issue between the two countries. He gave an interview for a local TV network, asserting his innocence. After the interview Knezoviƒá surrendered to a Zagreb police station with his lawyer. An autopsy revealed that Puljiƒá was killed by a bullet from a police pistol. Knezoviƒá reportedly had been shooting from an AK 47. Citing unnamed police sources, some media reported that Knezoviƒá took the pistol from an officer before shooting Puljiƒá. Knezoviƒá said that he had taken the pistol but returned it to the policeman before the shooting. He later came to the police station, but escaped after claiming that the police were looking to arrest him for not only shooting at members of Horde Zla (which he does not dispute he did) but also for the murder of Vedran Puljiƒá (which he claims was committed by someone else. The policeman Dragan Vujoviƒá was also taken into custody in relation to the murder of Puljiƒá. Citing unnamed police sources, some media reports claimed Vujoviƒá is being investigated as an accomplice to murder. Other media reports said that Vujoviƒá's hands tested positive for gunpowder residue, which he purportedly claimed was due to his coming into contact with the large quantities of fireworks used that day. Some reports say that the policeman has failed a polygraph test in relation to the event. Some members of Horde zla were arrested and put in custody. But after Horde Zla spokespeople claimed they had reports that those members were being mistreated in prison the Federal Minister Of Justice Mirsad Kebo had them transferred to Sarajevo and released. This move was met with disapproval by citizens of ≈†iroki Brijeg. Reactions=≈†iroki Brijeg During the following days many citizens had gathered in front of the West Herzegovina county headquarters. They blamed the violence on Horde Zla. Miro Kraljeviƒá, the mayor, addressed the audience giving them his support. The official representative of ≈†kripari read a list of requests to the authorities of West Herzegovina county. The protesters left after a speech by Stanko ≈†korba, the president of the Union of handicapped people from the Homeland war. ≈†korba told them that the ministry of internal affairs has accepted to look into their requests. Although, he said, that does not mean that the Ministry necessarily sees these complaints as valid. The council of ≈†iroki Brijeg also held an extraordinary meeting. The counselors made a declaration denouncing the violence that occurred. The protests were repeated the same week. There were between 13,000 and 15,000 protesters. Besides citizens of ≈†iroki Brijeg the fans of Croat dominated clubs from Mostar, Tomislavgrad, Livno, ≈Ωepƒçe, Kiseljak, Posavina and a number of people from Croatia attended. Representatives of ≈†kripari demanded the resignation of Mirsad Kebo and Zvonimir Jukiƒá. Sarajevo In Sarajevo, members of Horde Zla also organized citywide demonstrations. They were joined by fans of Vele≈æ, ≈Ωeljezniƒçar, ƒåelik, Rudar (Kakanj), Travnik, Sloboda and many other, mainly Bosniak, clubs as well as over 10,000 citizens. They alleged that the causes for violence started even before they entered the town of ≈†iroki Brijeg in the form of provocations by local residents shouting ethnic slurs at them and gross negligence by the ≈†iroki Brijeg police which split them up into small unprotected groups and completely ignored any misconduct on the side of the ≈†kripari up to and including doing nothing to stop the ≈†kripari from hurling rocks at them. The supporters of many other Bosnian clubs present during the demonstrations have also reported that they were subject to similar ethnic provocations and willful police neglect when visiting Western Herzegovina. They also expressed shock at the fact that as soon as physical confrontations broke out between them and the ≈†kripari, the police started attacking members of Horde Zla in unison with ≈†kripari and other local residents instead of doing their job of separating them. They demanded a thorough investigation into the misconduct of the ≈†iroki Brijeg police force which later confirmed that multiple policemen have been aiding and abetting assaults on members of Horde Zla including, in the case of policeman Dragan Vujoviƒá, being accomplices to murder. They also accused the police of ignoring local residents who had been shooting automatic weapons at the members of Horde Zla as in the case of Oliver Knezeviƒá who can be seen holding an AK-47 while being ignored by a nearby police officer on surveillance footage.

It was available on the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit family, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, and VIC-20. Gameplay The player jumping in the mines The player takes the role of an explorer searching a diamond mine and the temple of an ancient civilization. The object of the game is to discover and collect the Golden Crown and take it to the peak of the mountain. The mountain environment is made up of platforms and ladders, with the Perpetual Flame located on the top of the summit. This is where the Golden Crown must be taken. To retrieve the Crown, the player must first collect one thousand points. Diamonds are worth 25 points each and treasure chests are worth 260 points. Diamonds are scattered throughout the level, and treasure chests can be located by using the explorer's flashlight to see in the darkness. While it is not necessary for the player to descend to the very bottom of the mountain, there are many treasure chests to find there, but these resources are not without peril: a giant spider lurks in the lowest level, and will give chase if the player spends more than a few seconds exploring the bottom. Once the player has the required score, they must locate the Flame Spirit by following the musical cues. The Flame Spirit is the key to the Temple Chamber, where the Crown is kept. If the player attempts to enter the Temple before they have the Flame Spirit, the Skull Spirit guarding the entrance will stop him. When the Temple Chamber is unlocked, the player can collect the Crown and take it to the Perpetual Flame - however, there will now be Cave Bats stalking the player. If they touch the crown, they will steal it, and the player will have to start collecting points again. There are three ways to lose the game. The first and most probable conclusion to the game is the expiration of the timer. When time reaches zero, the game is over. The second, more unfortunate fate involves the giant spider. If the spider catches the player on the lowest level, the player is trapped in a web cocoon. The player can escape from this web by rapidly moving the joystick left and right. If the player does not escape by the time the spider returns, the game will end, ostensibly with the player having been eaten by the spider. The third, when the player touches any regular fires, they shall die and the game will end.  Hidden level  Mountain King has a \\"hidden level\\" which can be reached by jumping from the tip of a ledge located on the mountain peak at the top of the game screen. Timed correctly, the player will catch the very bottom rung of a higher ladder. The ladder leads into a hidden level of ladders and platforms. At the very top of this area are two strange ghost-like figures, but there is no reward or bonus for entering this level, and the level is extremely difficult to navigate (with falling from the various ladders a common occurrence). Reception Softline stated that Mountain King is \\"a game worth playing\\" which \\"is also something more [than a game], something like a fantasy or adventure\\". Antic praised Mountain King for its gameplay and intelligent use of music and sound. Soundtrack The game prominently features Edvard Grieg's 1875 composition, In the Hall of the Mountain King from Peer Gynt, after collecting the Golden Crown.

It is notable for its Ruskin Pottery collection and for hosting the first public display of the Stuckism art movement. Building The building was built in 1891 to house a collection of paintings, drawings and watercolours donated by Mrs Mary Ann Richards on behalf of her late husband Edwin, and cost ¬£5821 to build. It was designed by West Bromwich architects Wood and Kendrick, and built by Henry Wilcock of Wolverhampton. Four panels on the building's facade show the heads of Sir Christopher Wren to represent Architecture, Sir Joshua Reynolds for Art, John Flaxman for Sculpture, and Sir Isaac Newton for Science. Two busts sit in recesses above the entrance, of Alderman Williams and Alderman Lloyd, both mayors of Wednesbury and chairmen of the Art Gallery Committee. Following the Second World War, the museum was used by the council as offices, but returned to use as a museum in 1972, modernised and renovated. Permanent exhibitions The museum holds a number of permanent displays: The Ruskin Pottery collection Ruskin Pottery was made in Sandwell, and is sought by collectors globally. The pottery on display exemplifies numerous types of glaze, including Bleu Souffl√©, Lustre, Flamb√© and Crystalline. The Richards Gallery The gallery was originally built to display a large collection of works owned by Wednesbury residents, Edwin and Mary Richards. The couple were prolific collectors of art and especially favoured landscapes. In her will, Mary donated her and her husband's collection of paintings to the town of Wednesbury. These are displayed in the Richards Gallery. The works were stored in caves in Kinver, Staffordshire during the Second World War. Only some of the paintings were returned to public display when the war ended. The collection now consists of fifty-four paintings, following a large sale by Wednesbury Borough Council in 1948. Old toys and games This gallery stores toys and games from Victorian to 20th century. Toy-handling activities are provided for Key Stage 1 classes.  Joseph Gibbs  The museum has a significant collection of the works of local artist, Joseph Gibbs, including a probably posthumous portrait of Mary Ann Richards, dated 1891.  Kilvert medals  The museum holds the two Crimean War medals of former Wednesbury mayor, Alderman John Ashley Kilvert JP. They were noted missing in 1974, believed stolen. After passing through several hands, they were bought, innocently, by a medal collector from Walsall. After his death, his widow put them up for auction, when their origin was identified and she agreed to donate them back to the museum. The museum also has his portrait, in oil, in which he is wearing civic regalia. The artist is unknown. Temporary exhibitions The Museum hosts a lively series of temporary exhibitions which change every six months. Between July and December 2013, the museum hosted an exhibition of works by the international video artist, Bill Viola. This exhibition was organised through the Artist Rooms programme in conjunction with the Tate Gallery and the National Galleries of Scotland. The works on display included Catherine's Rooms, Four Hands and Surrender. During the first half of 2014, the museum hosted an exhibition of portraits on loan from Ingestre Hall, the 17th-century Jacobean mansion and seat of the Earls Talbot and the Earls of Shrewsbury.

It is a liquid at room temperature, the second hydrogen chalcogenide with this property after water. It is very unstable chemically and tends to decompose into elemental polonium and hydrogen; like all polonium compounds, it is highly radioactive. It is a volatile and very labile compound, from which many polonides can be derived. Preparation Polonium hydride cannot be produced by direct reaction from the elements upon heating. Other unsuccessful routes to synthesis include the reaction of polonium tetrachloride (PoCl4) with lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH4), which only produces elemental polonium, and the reaction of hydrochloric acid with magnesium polonide (MgPo). The fact that these synthesis routes do not work may be caused by the radiolysis of polonium hydride upon formation. Trace quantities of polonium hydride may be prepared by reacting hydrochloric acid with polonium-plated magnesium foil. In addition, the diffusion of trace quantities of polonium in palladium or platinum that is saturated with hydrogen (see palladium hydride) may be due to the formation and migration of polonium hydride. Properties Polonium hydride is a more covalent compound than most metal hydrides because polonium straddles the border between metals and metalloids and has some nonmetallic properties. It is intermediate between a hydrogen halide like hydrogen chloride and a metal hydride like stannane. It should have properties similar to that of hydrogen selenide and hydrogen telluride, other borderline hydrides. It is very unstable at room temperature and must be stored at freezer temperatures to prevent reversion to elemental polonium and hydrogen; this is because it is an endothermic compound, like the lighter hydrogen telluride and hydrogen selenide, and decomposes into its constituent elements, releasing heat in the process. The amount of heat given off in the decomposition of polonium hydride is over 100 kJ/mol, the largest of all the hydrogen chalcogenides. Polonium hydride is a liquid due to van der Waals forces, and not due to the same reason as why water (hydrogen oxide) is liquid (hydrogen bonding). It is predicted that, like the other hydrogen chalcogenides, polonium may form two types of salts: polonide (containing the Po2‚àí anion) and one from polonium hydride (containing ‚ÄìPoH, which would be the polonium analogue of thiol, selenol and tellurol). However, no salts from polonium hydride are known. An example of a polonide is lead polonide (PbPo), which occurs naturally as lead is formed in the alpha decay of polonium. Polonium hydride is difficult to work with due to the extreme radioactivity of polonium and its compounds and has only been prepared in very dilute tracer quantities. As a result, its physical properties are not definitely known. It is also unknown if polonium hydride forms an acidic solution in water like its lighter homologues, or if it behaves more like a metal hydride (see also hydrogen astatide).

Banks (p. 87) gives June 4; both \\"Antietam on the Web\\" and Allardice (p. 87) state June 14; Eicher (p. 596) gives June 15. was an American merchant and soldier. He served as an officer in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War, fighting in both the Eastern as well as the Western theaters. Fiser was seriously wounded five times in the conflict, losing an arm in 1863's Battle of Fort Sanders, and he was appointed a general officer late in the war; however, the appointment was never confirmed by the Confederate Senate. Afterward he returned to his business interests and was active in Confederate veterans organizations. Early life and career John Fiser was born in 1838 in the city of Dyersburg located in Dyer County, Tennessee. His father was Matthew Day Fiser (died 1852) and his mother's identity (died 1849) is not known.Banks, United Daughters of the Confederacy, p. 86. In 1848 Fiser's family moved to Batesville in Panola County, Mississippi. After his father died Fiser was raised by his uncle, John B. Fiser, a politician and merchant also living in Panola County.Allardice, More Generals in Gray, p. 86. In 1853 he began working in Lafayette County, clerking in a country store near the shore of the Tallahatchie River. In 1855 Fiser moved to Memphis, Tennessee, and found work as a cotton merchant and later in the mercantile business.Banks, United Daughters of the Confederacy, p. 86; Antietam on the Web site biography of Fiser; Allardice, More Generals in Gray, p. 86. Civil War service When the American Civil War began in 1861 Fiser returned to Mississippi to follow the Confederate cause. On May 27 he was elected a first lieutenant in the 17th Mississippi Infantry, assigned to Company H (styled the \\"Panola Vindicators\\") in the regiment he had helped create in Panola County.Antietam on the Web site biography of Fiser; Allardice, More Generals in Gray, p. 86. On June 4 he was made the regiment's adjutant, and he participated with the 17th Mississippi in the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21. That autumn he fought with distinction during the Battle of Ball's Bluff, where he was praised for his \\"most important and effective service.\\" On October 12, 1861, Fiser was appointed the assistant adjutant general of his regiment,Eicher, Civil War High Commands, p. 596. and during the reorganization of the Army of Northern Virginia early the following year he was elected lieutenant colonel of the 17th Mississippi as of April 26, 1862. He fought during the Peninsula Campaign, replacing the regiment's colonel when that officer became a casualty in the Battle of Malvern Hill.Allardice, More Generals in Gray, p. 86; Antietam on the Web site biography of Fiser. The 17th's attack that day has been described as: Fiser continued to command the regiment during the Maryland Campaign in the fall of 1862, leading it in the Battle of Antietam on September 17. Later that year he was appointed adjutant of his brigade.Eicher, Civil War High Commands, p. 596. Assistant adjutant general of the 6th Brigade, 1st Division (Center Wing) of the Army of Northern Virginia in 1862. He fought during the Fredericksburg Campaign that winter, part of Brig. Gen. William Barksdale's brigade that defended the Rappahannock River crossing at the town on December 11. Fiser was wounded during the main battle two days later. He then fought during the 1863 Gettysburg Campaign, and was wounded during the Battle of Gettysburg that July. Fiser was first shot in the cheek and then hit in the same leg twice.Allardice, More Generals in Gray, p. 86; Eicher, Civil War High Commands, p. 596. Fort Sanders Knoxville; Fiser lost an arm in an attack on them in November 1863. In the fall of 1863 Fiser and his regiment were sent west with Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's First Corps units. He participated in the Battle of Chickamauga and then fought during the Knoxville Campaign. On November 29 Fiser was hit in his right arm as he reached the top of the Union defensive position during the Battle of Fort Sanders, a wound requiring the amputation of the limb.Banks, United Daughters of the Confederacy, p. 86.; Eicher, Civil War High Commands, p. 596. An account of his actions in the attack follows: While recovering from losing his arm, Fiser was assigned to recruiting duties. On February 26, 1864, he was promoted to the rank of colonel, but the wound was slow to heal and he resigned his commission on June 12 and returned home. That winter Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws asked for Fiser for service in South Carolina, and he rejoined the Confederate Army. In 1865 Fiser was given command of a brigade of reservists from Georgia, part of the scattered forces that opposed the Union soldiers of Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman during the Carolinas Campaign. On April 9 his small 800-man brigade was merged with that of Col. George P. Harrison, his senior, reducing Fiser to regimental command. Also in 1865 Fiser was appointed a brigadier general, however the Confederate Senate never confirmed his commission as such.Eicher, Civil War High Commands, p. 596; Allardice, More Generals in Gray, pp. 86-7; Antietam on the Web site biography of Fiser.Allardice, p. 87: \\"Fiser's obituary states that his commission as brigadier general was issued in the last days of the war, but never reached him.\\" Postbellum When the Civil War ended in 1865 he returned to Memphis, Tennessee, where he resumed his pre- war business affairs. In 1866 he married Hayes Dunn, with whom he would have three daughters, and shortly thereafter changed the spelling of his name to Fizer, reasoning that was the way it had sounded all his life. Three streets in Memphis were later named after him, all using this spelling. He also became a partner in a large and successful cotton brokerage firms and actively participated in local Democratic politics.Banks, United Daughters of the Confederacy, p. 87; Allardice, pp. 86-7. In 1871 Fiser was elected president of the Confederate Historical and Relief Association based in Memphis, and at the time of his death he was serving as president of the Office Security Building and Loan Association. Fiser died of dysentery in 1876, and his remains were buried in the Chapel Hill section of the Elmwood Cemetery located in Memphis.

The International Society for the Empirical Study of Literature and Media (IGEL) is one learned association which brings together experts in this field. Major journals in the field are Poetics: Journal of Empirical Research on Culture, the Media and the Arts, Poetics Today: International Journal for Theory and Analysis of Literature and Communication, and Scientific Study of Literature. The empirical study of literature attracts scholarship particularly in the areas of reception and audience studies and in cognitive psychology when it is concerned with questions of reading. In these two areas research and studies based on the framework are steadily growing. Further fields where the framework in various revised and expanded versions attracts scholarship is (comparative) cultural studies and pedagogy. One of several dictionary definitions of the field is as follows: \\"Movement within the study of literature concerned with the study of literature as a social system of [inter]actions. The main question is what happens to literature: it is written, published, distributed, read, censored, imitated, etc. The empirical study of literature originated as a reaction to, and an attempt at, solving the basic problem of hermeneutics; that is, how the validation of literary interpretation can be demonstrated. From reception theory it had already become clear that interpretations are not only tied to the text, but also, and even to a great extent, to the reader ‚Äî both in terms of the individual and of social conventions. This led to the theory of radical (cognitive) constructivism, based on the thesis that the subject largely construes its empirical world itself. The logical consequence of all this, to be seen in the work of Siegfried J. Schmidt, is the separation of interpretation and the strictly scientific study of literature based on radical constructivism. The literary system of actions is observed from the outside ‚Äî not experienced ‚Äî and roughly characterized as depending on two conventions (hypotheses) that are tested continually. These conventions are the aesthetic convention (as opposed to the convention of facts in the daily language of reference) and the polyvalence convention (as opposed to the monovalency in the daily empirical world). Thus, the object of study of the empirical study of literature is not only the text in itself, but the roles of action within the literary system, namely, production, distribution, reception, and the processing of texts. The methods used are primarily taken from the social sciences, reception theory, cognitive science, psychology, etc. In general the steps to be taken in empirical research are the formation of a hypothesis, putting it into practice, testing, and evaluation. More concretely, for the study of reader response a wide array of techniques are used, ranging from protocol techniques and thinking aloud protocol to pre-structured techniques, such as the semantic seven point scale (C. Osgood) and the classification technique (card sorting), and forms of content analysis, discourse analysis, association techniques, etc. Some objections often raised to the empirical study of literature are the triviality of many of its research results such as confirmation of what was already known or suspected or its reductionism (artificiality of the framework and set-up, and limitation to reader response instead of the study of the text). It is clear, however, that the empirical study of literature by its specific approach of the object and its focus on methodology is an outstanding way to explore the socio-cultural aspects of the literary system. It makes an irreplaceable contribution to the development of a more rational, scientific, and socially relevant study of literature.\\" Hendrik van Gorp, R. Ghesquiere, D. Delabastita and J.

As a young man, Mori migrated from Japan to Chuuk, where he helped to establish Japanese businesses in Micronesia.Gaimusho (2000), p. 69 Mori's guidance and direction helped to expand Japanese business interests throughout Micronesia during the Spanish and German colonial-era. After Japan annexed Micronesia from Germany in 1914, Mori was hired as an adviser to the Japanese administration in the South Seas Mandate, and was instrumental in encouraging Japanese settlement in Micronesia. In his final years during World War II, Mori facilitated Micronesian support in the Japanese war efforts, but was already suffering from failing health from old age. He died within a few days after the Japanese surrender, and a sizeable minority of Micronesians with Japanese ancestry from Chuuk trace their ancestry back to Mori.„ÄêÂ§™Âπ≥Ê¥ãÈÄö‰ø°„ÄëÂçó„ÅÆÂ≥∂„ÄÖ„Åã„ÇâÔºàÔºëÔºâ„ÄåÊó•Êú¨‰∫∫„ÅÆË°Ä„ÄÅË™á„Çä„Å´ÊÄù„ÅÜ„Äç„ÄåÂÜíÈô∫„ÉÄ„É≥Âêâ„Äç„ÅÆ„Çà„ÅÜ„Å´ September 23, 2003, Coconuts College (retrieved October 9, 2009) Early life Mori was born in Tosa Province (part of modern-day K≈çchi Prefecture), Shikoku to a Samurai family. In his youth, Mori developed an aptitude for the study of Mathematics, Physics and Chinese classics. At the age of fifteen in 1884, Mori left his hometown to work as a houseboy for Oi Kentar≈ç. At that time, Oi was plotting to raise an army to prepare for an invasion of Korea. Mori was inspired by Oi's, and often followed along Oi and his activist followers to carry out robbery and extortion to raise funds for the purchase of weapons. The police carried out a crackdown on Oi's followers the following year, and about 130 activists were arrested in Osaka and Nagasaki. Mori was among those who was arrested, but was released on account of his young age.Peattie (1988), p. 26 Shortly after he was released, Mori managed to secure employment to work as a houseboy in the Court where Kentar≈ç was being tried. Mori attempted to steal evidence that was used against Oi in the prosecution, but was caught red-handed and convicted to prison for a year. After his release, Mori returned to his hometown, and later moved to Tokyo in 1889. Through a former acquaintance of Oi, Mori worked as a houseboy for Got≈ç Sh≈çjir≈ç's household the following year. During his stint with Got≈ç's family, Mori came across artefacts and research which Got≈ç's son, Taketar≈ç had gathered during his diplomatic to Micronesia. Mori left Got≈ç's household in May 1891 to work for the Ichiya company, a trading firm which had business interests in Micronesia.Peattie (1988), p. 27 Adult life=Early years in Micronesia Mori was selected to work as a resident representative of the company's branch in Micronesia, and left Japan from Yokohama, on board the Tenyu Maru in November 1891 with eight other employees. The Tenyu Maru stopped by the Bonins, but encountered a typhoon when it came close to the Marianas. Mori and his colleagues reached Pohnpei in 1891, where one of his colleagues got his wife pregnant and had a set of triplets disembarked to manage the company's branch store. The Tenyu Maru headed for Truk Lagoon, and Mori left the ship's company and armed himself with a sword and two daggers. Mori offered his services as a military adviser for Manuppis, the most influential chief in Moen. After leading a successful attack against a rival tribe, Manuppis facilitated Mori's efforts to assimilate with Chuukese society. He maintained contacts with the Ichiya company, and equipped Manuppis with Japanese Murata rifles. A few Japanese settlers came to Chuuk over the next few years, and Mori maintained close contacts with Japanese traders in Chuuk and Pohnpei.Peattie (1988), p. 28 As tribal warfare continued into the 1890s, Mori and the other Japanese settlers continued to align themselves with the tribal chiefs in order to safeguard their business interests.Hezel (2003), p. 78 Mori lost the fingers on his right hand in 1896, while he was preparing gunpowder for ammunition which suddenly exploded. Mori tended to his own wounds in spite of the great pain, and remained in Chuuk for several weeks before leaving for Yokohama by a merchant ship. He sought medical treatment in Tokyo, before he returned to Tolas where he spent several months recuperating. The following year, Mori returned to Chuuk, and built a house at Moen. Mori was appointed the resident agent for Hiki Company, after the Ichiya company faced bankruptcy.Peattie (1988), p. 29-30 In 1898, Mori married Manuppis' daughter, and their first son Taro was born in the same year. He became an independent trader in 1899, after the Hiki company ran into financial difficulties, and aligned himself with the Jaluit Gesellschaft, a German trading company at the turn of the century.Peattie (1988), p. 30 Two years after Germany purchased the Micronesian islands from Spain in 1898, the German authorities arrested the Japanese traders at Irais and deported them back to Japan, leaving only Mori in Chuuk and another Japanese trader stranded in Pohnpei. Japanese traders were barred from trading in Micronesia. Mori and his family relocated to Tol, and received occasional contacts of news reports from Japan. Japanese traders began settling in Micronesia after the Germans lifted the ban in 1907, but Mori kept a low profile to avoid antagonising the German administration.Peattie (1988), p. 31 Japanese colonial-era (1914-1945) Shortly after Japan seized the Micronesian islands from Germany, Mori was hired as a civil affairs adviser by the Japanese military administration. At the direction of the Japanese navy commander, Mori authored a thesis on the culture and customs of the Chuukese people, and was later used by the military administration in drafting local administrative policies. When the military occupation gave way to the South Seas Mandate, Mori stayed on. He was ranked among the wealthiest men in the Carolines in the 1920s, having built his wealth from revenues that he received from coconut and copra plantations that he had established. He lobbied the Japanese government to facilitate the construction of trade facilities, transportation and schools in Chuuk. He was also elected as the chief of Tol within the Chuukese community, and was the first known foreigner to be elected to a political position in traditional Micronesian society. A comic book written by Shimada Keizo in the 1930s, Boken Dankichi which drew its inspiration from Mori's experiences in his youth, led the general public to acquaint itself with Mori, both in Japan and Micronesia.Peattie (1988), p. 323 Government officials and businessmen based in Chuuk often paid their respects to Mori in his house before they went about carrying out their duties, and the Japanese press often referred to Mori as the \\"King of the South Seas\\" in news reports.Peattie (1988), p. 196 During the opening ceremony for a new athletic field at Dublon, Mori was awarded the 8th class„Éã„É•„Éº„Çπ„Å™Âè≤ÁÇπ, May 19, 2007, ÂæπÂ§úÂüé„ÅÆÂ§öË∂£Âë≥„ÅÆÂüé of the Order of the Sacred Treasure.Peattie (1988), p. 197 In the Second World War, Mori provided assistance to the Japanese government for the country's war effort. At the persuasion of Mori's family, many Chuukese offered their services to the Japanese government.Peattie (1988), p. 299 A few of his grandsons also served in the army, and Mori's sons and grandsons were instrumental in protecting the islanders' food resources from petty theft during the war.Poyer et al. (2001), p. 210 Mori himself suffered a stroke in 1942, and was left paralysed in the right side of his body. He gradually developed increasing signs of dementia which left him hallucinating of Japan's defeat in the Pacific War. Mori slipped into unconsciousness shortly before the Japanese surrender in early August 1945, and died at his home in Tol seven days after the surrender.Peattie (1988), p. 300 Family Mori had six sons and five daughters with Manuppis' daughter. His wife was given the Japanese name of \\"Isa\\" at the time of their marriage in 1898. Mori gave his children Japanese names, and in his younger days he taught his children Japanese and often celebrated Japanese national holidays at home. When Japan ruled Micronesia between 1914 and 1945, Mori's family were granted Japanese citizenship and were identified by their Japanese heritage. After the Japanese surrender, members of the Mori family renounced their Japanese citizenship, and identified themselves as Micronesians.Kiste et al. (1999), p. 204 A 1984 survey counted that there were at least 1,000 male-line descendants of Mori,Crocombe (2007), p. 103 mostly from the 3rd to the 6th generations.

Biography Born in Boston, Massachusetts, she and her husband, Anthony Bland, who was serving in the US Navy, relocated to the Naval Station Great Lakes in North Chicago, Illinois. She and her husband remained together for 31 years, before separating. She was diagnosed with Gardner's syndrome in the 1970s and reportedly given a short time to live but managed to overcome the disease. In later years, however, she fought several bouts with cancer. Bland received a BA from the University of Southern Illinois in 1981, and from 1981 to 1999 worked as an accountant. She had two children and several grandchildren, and resided in Waukegan, Illinois, during the later years of her life.O‚ÄôDonnell, Maureen. \\"Writer Set Mysteries in Waukegan.\\" Chicago Sun-Times, June 8, 2010.

They are supposed to show artistic coherences, relationships between epochs and disciplines and to build bridges between ancient and modern art. The art pieces are to be viewed under a new aspect: an exhibition to the oeuvre of Henri Matisse gathered his portraits for the first time; the exhibition about Frida Kahlo devoted itself first to the connection between Mexican and European art. Thus also connoisseurs are to achieve new impressions. The manageable size of the display area induces a precise focus of the topic and a limitation on 100 exhibits. At visitor-surveys three special experiences are named consistently: the visitors are delighted to be able to see the whole exhibition within one hour, without being exhausted; they have the satisfying feeling that their attention lasts for everything; and they were able to connect the experience of art with an increase in knowledge. Despite the focus on a broad public interested in the arts the exhibitions of the Bucerius Kunst Forum are scientifically sound. Frequently they are preceded by a symposium, which assembles international specialists of one topic. During the symposium topics and theses of the exhibition are discussed. Until the summer of 2008 these symposiums took place at the Warburg Haus, Hamburg; since the winter of 2008 they have been hosted at the Bucerius Kunst Forum. The contributions are printed in widely illustrated exhibition catalogues, which have been published by Hirmer Verlag since 2005. For most of the exhibitions the exhibits are assembled from various museums around the world. Thus \\"Terror and Desire. The Temptation of St. Anthony from Hieronymus Bosch to Max Ernst\\" showed exhibits from more than 40 lenders from 10 different states, while \\"High Society. American Portraits of the Gilded Age\\" gathered exhibits from 32 lenders, among which were exhibits from 29 different museums of the United States. Occasionally exhibitions show thematic presentations, which are chosen from the collection of one institution, such as the Mannerism exhibition from the Sz√©pm√ºv√©szeti M√∫zeum in Budapest or the exhibition \\"New World. Creating an American Art\\" with pieces from the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford (Connecticut). So far the lenders have included, among others: * Museo del Prado, Madrid * Louvre, Paris *Bucerius Kunst Forum (2019)National Gallery of Art, Washington * Staatliche Museen zu Berlin * The Tate Gallery, London * Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden * Museum of Modern Art, New York * Museum Ludwig, Cologne * Centre Pompidou, Paris * Kunstsammlung Nordrhein Westfalen, D√ºsseldorf * The Israel Museum, Jerusalem * National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin * Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris * Victoria and Albert Museum, London * Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York * Naples National Archaeological Museum * Gemeentemuseum Den Haag * The National Gallery, London * Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam * The British Museum, London * Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien * St√§del Museum, Frankfurt am Main It belongs to the concepts of the house to design the display area for every new exhibition in fundamentally new colours and architecture to convey a new spatial experience every time.  Topics  The thematic range of the exhibitions is broadly defined and reaches from ancient times to the present age. From the field of archaeology there were exhibitions about the Etruscans, Cleopatra and \\"Painting for Eternity. The Tombs of Paestum\\". Extra-European cultures were discussed during \\"Art of the Silk Road. The Allure of Buddha\\", old masters through an exhibition about Lucas Cranach the Elder as well as \\"Greco, Vel√°zquez, Goya. Spanish Paintings from German Collections\\", eras and periods of time through \\"Descent into the World. The Art of Mannerism in Europe\\" and \\"Between Heaven and Hell. Medieval Art\\". Themed exhibitions discussed \\"Cloud Pictures\\" or \\"The Temptation of St. Anthony\\". The biggest thematic project so far was a trilogy about 150 years of American art from 1800 to 1950. From 2007 to 2009 it presented the three respective leading categories of paintings of the United States in three consecutive parts: 19th-century landscapes, portraits around 1900 and finally the urbanism of the years 1900 to 1950. The focus is on artists of classical modernism. Up to this point Willi Baumeister, Max Beckmann, Marc Chagall, Otto Dix, Frida Kahlo, Oskar Kokoschka, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Auguste Rodin and the artist community Die Br√ºcke have been paid tribute through monographic exhibitions. The exhibition \\"Gerhard Richter. Images of an Era\\" in 2011 presented for the first time a contemporary artist at the Bucerius Kunst Forum. In the summer of 2012 the Bucerius Kunst Forum dedicated itself to the medium of photography in the exhibition \\"New York Photography 1890-1900\\".  Curators  The concepts of all exhibitions are developed in-house by the scientific department of the house or in collaboration with visiting curators Former curators and visiting curators were: * Marion Ackermann, D√ºsseldorf * Bernard Andreae, Rom * Alla Chilova, Cologne * Ina Conzen, Stuttgart * Barbara Dayer Gallati, Bristol * Klaus Gallwitz, Karlsruhe * Nikolai Grinew, Nowgorod * Doris Gr√∂pper, Berlin * Barbara Haskell, New York * B√§rbel Hedinger, Berlin * Andreas Hoffmann, Hamburg * Tatiana Kasarmschtschikowa, Nowgorod * Kordelia Knoll, Dresden * Michael Kuhlemann, M√ºlheim * Steingrim Laursen, Copenhagen * Elizabeth Mankin Kornhauser, Hartford * Magdalena M.

The wide programme of events during the exhibitions with technical lectures, readings, movies and concerts, excursions and art journeys are made possible by the Bucerius Kunst Club‚Äôs subscriptions, donations and voluntary activities. The club finances both the children‚Äôs programme and the scientific traineeship of the house. This traineeship gives junior scientists a year-long education in the exhibition business. The approximately 1,900 members of the club benefit depending on the category of their membership: they receive the exhibition catalogues for free, get free entry into the exhibition at any time and are invited to the openings and previews. They obtain reductions for the events and are allowed to participate in a wide offer of exclusive activities such as art journeys, day trips, seminars, and tours through the other culture institutions of Hamburg.  Building and location  The Bucerius Kunst Forum is located at the Rathausmarkt, on the corner of the Alter Wall with the adjacent Rathaus and the building of the Hamburger B√∂rse (Handelskammer) in the city centre, i.e., the historic city. On one side it adjoins the Alsterfleet with the Rathausschleuse. The representative landmarks building was built for the Reichsbank-Hauptstelle Hamburg starting in 1914 (construction 1914-1916, completion 1918/1919, alteration and restoration 1981-1983), which is also pointed out by the inscription of the tympanum of the fa√ßade on both sides of the imperial coat of arms. The neoclassical building is decorated with sculptures which symbolize the commercial life of the Hamburg area (fishermen, blacksmiths, merchants, sailors) and medallions of the three emperors of the realm. Economic power and armed forces are symbolized by figures of Mercury and a knight above the entry of Alter Wall with a revetted marble staircase and foyer (the material originates from the former German colony of Togo). The entrance - leading into the museum - at the Rathausmarkt was created especially for the Bucerius Kunst Forum. Formerly, the ticket hall was located in the lower exhibition area. The eight pillars decorated with mosaics and arranged in an octagon belong to the original structure. They are also to be found in the display area on the first floor. Overall the display area amounts to about 850 square meters. During the renovation and rearrangement of the rooms by architect‚Äôs office Jan St√∂rmer the safety devices and air conditioners were installed, which guarantee ideal exhibition terms and are to match the highest demands of the leading museums in the world. The Ian-Karan- Auditorium, the Lounge with a view onto the Rathausmarkt and Alster, and the restaurant Season are also rented out for private events.  Cooperation Partners  As a young exhibition house with international alignment the Bucerius Kunst Forum depends on co-operation with museums domestic and abroad. It may be that curators from other houses conceptualize exhibitions as guest curators or that exceptional pieces from international museum collections are on display. As a double exhibition \\"The Etruscans. Pictures of Life on Earth ‚Äì Pictures of Death\\" (2004) was displayed simultaneously at the Bucerius Kunst Forum and at the Museum f√ºr Kunst und Gewerbe, Hamburg. Some exhibitions at Bucerius Kunst Forum were conceptualized in co-operation with other houses. Among those were: * \\"Greco, Vel√°zquez, Goya\\" (2005): conceptualized with Old Masters Picture Gallery, Dresden, and displayed there after its duration in Hamburg. Afterwards it was shown at the Sz√©pm√ºv√©szeti M√∫zeum, Budapest. * \\"Rodin in Germany\\" (2006): conceptualized with the sculpture collection of the State Art Collection at Dresden and displayed there after its duration in Hamburg. * \\"Matisse. People Masks Models\\" (2009): conceptualized with the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart and displayed there first. * \\"Ferdinand Hodler and Cuno Amiet\\" (2012): conceptualized with the Solothurn Art Museum and displayed there after its duration in Hamburg. * \\"Dionysus. Intoxication and Ecstasy\\" (2013): conceptualized with the State Art Collection at Dresden and displayed there after its duration in Hamburg. * \\"Mir√≥. Painting as Poetry\\" (2015): conceptualized with the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen and displayed there after its duration in Hamburg. Another form of co-operation is the takeover of an exhibition conceptualized by the Bucerius Kunst Forum by another museum. Former second stations were: * \\"Cloud Pictures\\" (2004): Alte Nationalgalerie Berlin and Aargauer Kunsthaus, Aargau * \\"Willi Baumeister. Figures and Drawings\\" (2005): Westphalian State Museum of Art and Cultural History, M√ºnster, and Von der Heydt Museum, Wuppertal * \\"Painting for Eternity. The Tombs of Paestum\\" (2008): Martin-Gropius-Bau, Berlin * \\"Modern Life. Edward Hoppe and his Time\\" (2009): Kunsthal Rotterdam, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York * \\"Rubens, van Dyck, Jordaens.

The foundation is the sole shareholder and is financing the Bucerius Kunst Forum with the income of its endowment capital to about two-thirds. The remainder is earned in ticket and catalogue sales as well as postcard sales and renting out parts of the exhibition house for exclusive events. The Bucerius Kunst Forum does not utilize public funds. Exhibitions with many international loans as the America-Trilogy were supplied by foreign foundations as the Terra Foundation for American Art, the Henry Luce Foundation, and the Max Kade Foundation. Companies like ExxonMobil, Latham & Watkins or Bankhaus Lampe as well as Lampe Asset Management engage themselves in individual projects as sponsors. There was an institutional partnership with HSH Nordbank for the duration of three years from 2007 to 2009.  Leadership  Founding director of the Bucerius Kunst Forum was the former director of the Schleswig-Holsteinische Landesmuseum Schloss Gottorf, Heinz Spielmann, who was leading the House until 2005. Ortrud Westheider was the director until 15 February 2016. From June 2016 to May 2019 Franz Wilhelm Kaiser was the director and since June 2019 Kathrin Baumstark is the director of the Bucerius Kunst Forum. The CEO of the Bucerius Kunst Forum is Andreas Hoffmann.

Formed in 1945, the party went through a series of mergers and fractures before dissolving in 1954 after the United States-backed coup d'√©tat. Formation The PAR was formed in November 1945 through the merger of the National Renovation Party (PRN) and the Popular Liberation Front (FPL), which had supported the presidency of Juan Jos√© Ar√©valo. The two parties together held a large majority in parliament during the entirety of Ar√©valo's term. 18 months after coming together, the FPL and the RN split again, but the PAR survived the split and remained a political player. The fracturing of the PAR was partially due to the manipulations of Ar√©valo, who preferred not to confront a single large party in parliament. The leadership of the party, similar to that of other major Guatemalan parties of the period, was composed of middle-class urban youth, especially those who had been involved in the university uprisings during the October Revolution. Leaders of the party included Jos√© Manuel Fortuny, Victor Manuel Gutierrez, and Augusto Charnaud McDonald. Leftist turn and split In 1946, several radical figures within the PAR made a successful effort to take over important leadership positions within the party. Fortuny, who had become secretary general of the PAR in 1945, was a member of this push. One year later, Fortuny and other young radical figures founded a covert group within the PAR called the Vanguardia Democratica (Democratic Vanguard), which believed in Marxist politics. This group, which included Guerra Borges, Silva Jonama, and Alvarado Monz√≥n, continually clashed with the more conservative factions of the party, led by Charnaud MacDonald and Humberto Gonz√°lez Hu√°rez. At the 1949 party convention, this Marxist faction was defeated in a 382-120 vote. They were given some positions within the party to maintain unity, but were unable to influence its course of action any more. Fortuny was removed from the position of secretary general, a position he had held since 1945. At approximately the same time, Fortuny was approached twice by Francisco Javier Arana, seeking the PAR's support for his candidacy in the next presidential election. Fortuny demurred, stating that Arana was not friendly enough to the labor movement. Instead, the PAR became willing to support Jacobo √Årbenz, who they believed was more willing to enact progressive change. √Årbenz' candidacy in the 1950 presidential election was announced on 5 February 1950 by the PIN, and the PAR endorsed him soon afterward. From 1947 to 1949 the PAR was the furthest left among the three major parties. Although it remained smaller than the FPL, it was the strongest backer of organized labor. It grew steadily more distant from Ar√©valo over the years. In 1949, frustrated because they were unable to take complete control of the PAR, Fortuny and his colleagues founded the Partido Comunista de Guatemala (Communist Party of Guatemala), which later became the Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo (Guatemalan Party of Labor: PGT). On 20 May 1950 Fortuny and nine others resigned from the PAR, and formally announced that they were leaving to start a communist party. Presidency of √Årbenz In July 1951 the PAR split once again, when some members left to form the Partido Socialista (Socialist Party: PS), described by observers as a party without a specific ideology. This faction was led by Charnaud MacDonald. In June 1952, the PAR joined the FPL, the National Renovation Party, the PIN and the PS to form the Party of the Guatemalan Revolution (PRG) to support Jacobo Arbenz' agrarian reform program. However, this lasted only six weeks before it broke up again into its constituents. Despite these splits, the PAR was the mainstay of the government coalition from 1951 to 1954. The PAR drew significant support from the CNCG, the largest labor union in Guatemala at the time. The CNCG, founded in 1950 by a PAR deputy named Castillo Flores, had its base among farm laborers, and thus grew in strength after the implementation of the agrarian reform policy of 1952. The CNCG was nominally independent of any single party, but lent its support to all the parties that had taken part in the 1944 revolution, including the PAR, the FPL, and the RN. It was an anti-communist group, and thus opposed the PGT of Fortuny. When Charnaud MacDonald left to form the PS in 1951, the CNCG led by Castillo Flores briefly shifted its loyalty to the PS. However, soon afterward √Årbenz showed his continued support of the PAR by appointing a director of the agrarian reform program from within the ranks of the PAR. Following this, Flores and the CNCG returned to supporting the PAR. Infighting and dissolution The PAR experienced significant infighting following its separation from the PRG. In October 1953, Secretary General Francisco Fern√°ndez Foncea stood up in parliament while intoxicated, and stated that he supported the communist PGT, while describing the PAR as a \\"temporary party.\\" A newly elected executive board expelled him. Foncea proceeded to storm the party headquarters with a band of supporters, seeking to \\"save\\" the party from its new executive committee. For many months afterward, party cadre were bombarded with messages from both factions, each seeking to ensure their loyalty. The party disbanded after the coup d'√©tat of 1954.

They are used in a wide variety of industrial automation applications at the machine, cell and line levels. History The CC-Link Partner Association (CLPA) offers a family of open-architecture networks. These originated with the CC-Link (Control & Communication) fieldbus in 1996,https://eu.cc- link.org/en/clpa/history/ developed by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation. In 2000,https://eu.cc-link.org/en/clpa/history/ this was released as an ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù network so that independent automation equipment manufacturers could incorporate CLPA network compatibility into their products. In the same year, the CC-Link Partner Association (CLPA) was formed to manage and oversee the network technology and support manufacturer members. In 2007,https://eu.cc- link.org/en/clpa/history/ the CLPA was the first organisation to introduce open gigabit Ethernet for automation with CC-Link IE (Industrial Ethernet). In 2018,https://eu.cc-link.org/en/clpa/history/ the CLPA was the first organisation to combine open gigabit Ethernet with Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) as CC-Link IE TSN. As of May 2020, over 2,100 CLPA compatible products from more than 340 automation manufacturers were available. CLPA offers a variety of open automation network technologies. These are the CC-Link fieldbus, CC-Link Safety fieldbus, CC-Link IE and CC-Link IE TSN. Compatible products include industrial PCs, PLCs, robots, servos, drives, valve manifolds, digital & analogue I/O modules, temperature controllers, mass flow controllers and others. As of May 2020, there was approximately 30 million devices installed worldwide. Structure of the CLPA The CLPA is a global organisation with branches in 11 locations worldwide (Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, China, South Korea, India, Turkey, Germany, USA and Mexico). The headquarters are in Nagoya, Japan. Some branches offer conformance testing facilities (see below). The CLPA is controlled by a board of currently nine companies, which are 3M, Balluff, Cisco, Cognex Corporation, IDEC Corporation, Mitsubishi Electric, Molex, NEC and Pro-face. The board controls the strategic direction of the organisation and oversees its operations, including the activities of the technical and marketing task forces and the global branches. Industry Cooperation The CLPA has been involved in strategic cooperation with other open technology associations in the industrial automation space. These include PROFIBUS & PROFINET International (PI), the OPC Foundation and AutomationML. The cooperation with PI resulted in a standard for interoperability between CC-Link IE and PROFINET.https://www.cc-link.org/en/news/161122.html The OPC Foundation activity created an OPC UA companion specification for the CLPA's \\"CSP+ (Control & Communication System Profile) For Machine\\" technology.https://opcfoundation.org/developer-tools/specifications-unified- architecture/cspplusForMachine-opc-ua-companion-specification. Cooperation with AutomationML involved the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding to incorporate the \\"CSP+\\" and \\"CSP+ For Machine\\" device profile technologies into AutomationML models.https://eu.cc- link.org/en/news_events/386/CLPA%20strengthens%20industry%20cooperation%20by%20signing%20an%20MoU%20with%20AutomationML%20e.V.

She drew particular acclaim for her portrayals of Verdi heroines. She also had a successful career as a concert soprano, particularly in performance of Verdi's Requiem and Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 9. She was married to bass Massimiliano Malaspina who also has an important opera career. Prior to her marriage she performed under the name Rita Orlandi.Biography, operissimo.com; accessed 25 April 2017. Biography Born in Bologna, Orlandi was a student of the famous Italian soprano and voice teacher Carmen Melis in Milan. She made her professional stage debut in Milan in 1963 at the Teatro Nuovo as Giovanna in Verdi's Giovanna d'Arco. She quickly became a major figure in Italy's most important opera houses during the 1960s. Orlandi-Malaspina enjoyed a particularly fruitful partnership with La Scala, where she made her debut on 29 April 1966 as Leonora in Verdi's La forza del destino under the baton of Gianandrea Gavazzeni with a cast that included , Piero Cappuccilli, Nicola Zaccaria, Bianca Maria Casoni and Renato Capecchi. Other Verdi roles she was admired for at that house were Aida, Amelia in Un ballo in maschera, Elvira in Ernani, Leonara in Il trovatore, and Odabella in Attila. She also appeared as a guest artist at the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma, the Teatro di San Carlo, the Teatro Carlo Felice, La Fenice, the Teatro Regio di Parma, the Teatro Massimo, the Teatro Regio di Torino, the Teatro Comunale di Bologna, and the Teatro Comunale Giuseppe Verdi. She was a regular performer at the Arena di Verona Festival where she sang in 1968‚Äì1969 and 1971‚Äì1972. She also made several appearances at the Baths of Caracalla in Rome. On the international stage Orlandi-Malaspina has sung as a guest at the Royal Opera, London at Covent Garden, the Bavarian State Opera, the Hamburg State Opera, the Palais Garnier, the Op√©ra de Nice, the Th√©√¢tre du Capitole, the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden, the Liceu, La Monnaie, the Vienna State Opera, the Teatro Col√≥n, the Op√©ra de Montr√©al, and the Opera Company of Philadelphia. On 17 October 1968 she made a successful debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City as Amelia in Verdi's Simon Boccanegra with Cornell MacNeil in the title role, Richard Tucker as Gabriele Adorno, Nicolai Ghiaurov as Jacopo Fiesco, Sherrill Milnes as Paolo Albiani, and Francesco Molinari-Pradelli conducting. She sang several more times with the company over the next 12 years portraying the roles of Elizabeth of Valois in Don Carlo (with Shirley Verrett) and Aida to the Radam√®s of such singers as Giorgio Lamberti, , Ermanno Mauro, and William Johns.Metropolitan Opera archives Orlandi-Malaspina's extensive stage repertoire includes such roles as Tosca, the title character in Giacomo Puccini's Suor Angelica, Elsa in Richard Wagner's Lohengrin, Maddalena de Coigny in Umberto Giordano's Andrea Ch√©nier, and a large number of Verdi roles (Luisa Miller, Abigaille in Nabucco, Desdemona in Otello, Elena in I Vespri Siciliani, Mina in Aroldo, and Lucrezia Contarini in I due Foscari in addition to those already mentioned).

Catopsilia pomona migrate regularly in South India and Himalayas. Many populations of Lepidoptera (butterflies or moths) migrate, sometimes long distances, to and from areas which are only suitable for part of the year. Lepidopterans migrate on all continents except Antarctica, including from or within subtropical and tropical areas. By migrating, these species can avoid unfavorable circumstances, including weather, food shortage, or over-population. In some lepidopteran species, all individuals migrate; in others, only some migrate. The best-known lepidopteran migration is that of the eastern population of the monarch butterfly which migrates from southern Canada to wintering sites in central Mexico. In late winter/early spring, the adult monarchs leave the Transvolcanic mountain range in Mexico for a more northern climate. Mating occurs and the females begin seeking out milkweed to lay their eggs, usually first in northern Mexico and southern Texas. The caterpillars hatch and develop into adults that move north, where more offspring can go as far as central Canada until next migratory cycle. The Danaids in South India are prominent migrants, between the Eastern Ghats and Western Ghats. Three species will be involved in this, namely Tirumala septentrionis, Euploea core, and Euploea sylvester. Sometimes they are joined by lemon pansy (Junonia lemonias), common emigrant (Catopsilia pomona), tawny coster (Acraea terpsicore) and blue tiger (Tirumala limniace).  Definition  Migration in Lepidoptera means a regular, predictable movement of a population from one place to another, determined by the seasons.Scoble, MJ. (1995) \\"Migration\\" in The Lepidoptera: form, function and diversity. 68-71. Previewed in Google Books on 09 Oct 2009. There is no unambiguous definition of migratory butterfly or migratory moth, and this also applies to proposals to divide them into classes.Meerman, J.C. (1987) \\"Dutch Sphingidae\\" Wet. meded. KNNV 180. Migration means different things to behavioral scientists and ecologists. The former emphasize the act of moving whereas the latter discriminate between whether the movement has been ecologically significant or not. Migration may be viewed as \\"a behavioural process with ecological consequences\\". Migration in Lepidoptera takes place in two of the three modes of migration identified by Johnson (Johnson, 1969). In the first mode (also Johnson's first), the Lepidoptera move in one direction in their short life-span and do not return. An example is the pierid butterfly, Ascia monuste, which breeds in Florida but sometimes migrates along the coast up to 160 kilometers to breed in more suitable areas. In the second mode (Johnson's third), migration takes place to a place of hibernation or aestivation where they undergo diapause and the same generation survives to return. The classic example is that of the nymphalid monarch butterfly (Danuas plexippus).  Adventive  Species that are recorded in unexpected areas (adventive species) are not considered to be migratory species, because these did not leave their habitat on their own strength. Examples are species that are imported as egg or caterpillar alongside of their host plants or individuals that were reared by a collector but have escaped. An example of an introduced species is Galleria mellonella, which is found all over the world, because it is reared as food for captive birds and reptiles. At times it is difficult to decide if a species is adventive or migratory. Migratory species like Chrysodeixis chalcites and Helicoverpa armigera would be able to reach western Europe on their own, but are also common in greenhouses.  Seasonal migration  Australian species Agrotis infusa spends the summer as an imago in the Australian Alps, and is sometimes found in buildings in large numbers. Lepidoptera migration is often seasonal. With species of which all individuals migrate, the population moves between areas in the summer and winter season or the dry and wet season. For species of which only part of the population migrates, seasonal migration is hard to determine. They can maintain themselves in part of their habitat but also reach areas where they cannot establish a permanent population. They only live there in the season that is most favorable for the species. Some of the species have the habit of returning to their permanent residence at the end of the season. = Difference with bird migration = An important difference with bird migration is that an individual butterfly or moth usually migrates in one direction, while birds migrate back and forth multiple times within their lifespan. This is due to the short lifespan as an imago. Amazingly the monarch receives no navigation instruction for the migration from their parents, unlike birds. Species that migrate back and forth, usually do so in different generations. There are however, some exceptions: * The famous migration of the monarch butterfly in North America. This species migrates back and forth in one generation, though it completes only part of the journey in both directions in that generation. No individual completes the entire journey which is spread over a number of generations. The imago of the last summer generation is born in North America, migrates to Mexico, Florida, or California and stays there for the winter. After the winter it migrates back to the north to reproduce. In a couple of generations, the monarch migrates north to Canada. * The migration of the bogong moth in Australia. This species migrates from south-eastern Australia to the Australian Alps in the summer to avoid the heat. After the summer it returns to reproduce.Common, I. F. B. (1954). \\"A study of the ecology of the adult bogong moth, Agrotis infusa (Boisd) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), with special reference to its behaviour during migration and aestivation\\". Australian Journal of Zoology. 2 (2): 223‚Äì263.  Flight behaviour  The small diamondback moth is a migratory species which can be found at altitudes of a 100 meters. It is capable of covering over 3,000 kilometers. Migratory Lepidoptera are, in most cases, excellent flyers. Species like Vanessa atalanta are capable of managing a fierce headwind. In case of headwind, they usually fly low and are more goal- oriented.J. Blab, T. Ruckstuhl, T. Esche en R. Holzberger (1989) Actie voor Vlinders, zo kunnen we ze redden, Weert: M&P.; During migration, some species can be found at high altitudes, ranging to up to two kilometers. This is especially noteworthy for day-flying species like Vanessa atalanta, since the temperatures on these altitudes are low and day-flying species depend on the outside temperature to stay warm. It is thought that Vanessa atalanta produces enough body warmth during flight since it has also been recorded migrating at night. In the case of transcontinental migration where distances are large, the flying speed of the butterfly (of the order of 3 metres per second or less) is inadequate for timely completion of journey. The migration is carried out by relying on heavy winds; a persistent wind speed of 10 metres per second being able to provide a displacement of 300 to 400 kilometers in a single day. For example, the painted lady (Vanessa cardui) migrates from Africa to Spain aided by tail winds. That the migratory species are good flyers, is not the same as saying they are robust flyers. The small diamondback moth is also a migratory species that migrates 3,000 kilometers and can be found up to altitudes of 100 meters or more.Yau I-Chu (1986) \\"The Migration of Diamondback Moth \\" in: Diamondback Moth Management, Proceedings of the First International Workshop, Tainan, Taiwan, 11‚Äì14 March 1985. Shanhua: The Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center. Inhoud . Vanessa cardui migration between North Africa and Europe  Navigation  To be able to migrate over long distances, species must be able to navigate. There are several ways they do this. Landscape: Lepidoptera use coastal lines, mountains, but also roads to orient themselves. Above sea it has been observed that the flight direction is much more accurate if the landscape on the coast is still visible. Celestial navigation: Butterflies are known to be capable of navigation with the help of the sun. They can also navigate by using polarized light. The polarization of the sun's light changes with the angle of the rays, hence they can also navigate with cloudy weather. There are indications that they can even make corrections depending on the time on a day. Diamondback moths are known to fly in a straight trajectory which is not dependent on the angle of the sun's rays. Tests have been performed to interfere with the biological clock of certain species by keeping them in the dark and then observing if they would choose for other flight paths. The conclusion was that some species did, and others did not. Research on monarchs demonstrates that with removal of antennae, the location of the circadian clock, individuals do not localize in any one direction during flight as they do with antennae intact. Night flyers cannot use sun light for navigation. Most of these species rely on the moon and stars instead. Earth's magnetic field: A number of moths use the Earth's magnetic field to navigate, as a study of the stray heart and dart suggests. Another study, this time of the migratory behaviour of the silver Y, showed that this species, even at high altitudes, can correct its course with changing winds, and prefers flying with favourable winds, which suggests a great sense of direction.Scientists make compass discovery in migrating moths , University of Greenwich. A study in Panama of Aphrissa statira, which migrate in large groups annually, found that this species loses its navigational capacity when exposed to a magnetic field, suggesting they use the Earth's magnetic field to determine their direction of flight in migration.  Areas where migratory butterflies and moths can be found  Blue tiger (Tirumala limniace) butterflies resting while migrating, Western Ghats, South India. Migratory Lepidoptera can be found on all continents, migrating within or from the Tropics and Subtropics. North, they can be found up to Spitsbergen, above the Arctic Circle. Some migratory Lepidoptera have spread over most of the world. Some of these are pest insects, such as the diamondback moth, Helicoverpa armigera, and Trichoplusia ni.  Examples of migratory Lepidoptera  Distribution map of Acherontia atropos. Red, all year. orange, summer * In the Indian subcontinent, migrating Lepidoptera are common just before the monsoon season. Over 250 species are known to migrate during this period.C.B. Williams (1930) The Migration of Butterflies Oliver & Boyd: Edinburgh. * On Madagascar, Chrysiridia rhipheus migrates between populations of four plant species of the genus Omphalea, the host plant of this species. The three western Omphalea species live in dry coniferous forests, the eastern species is found in the rainforest and is the only species that is green year round. * Rhodometra sacraria is normally found in Africa, large parts of Asia and southern Europe. At times, it migrates north and can reach central and northern Europe. * Vanessa cardui is found all over the world, except South America, at altitudes of up to 3,000 meters above sea level. Its home, however, are subtropical steppe areas. Its relative Vanessa atalanta is also migratory. * Several South and Central American species of Uraniidae display a great peak in migratory behavior in certain years. In the years with a great number of migrating individuals, there are \\"population explosions\\". Individuals migrate to the south and east. There is no real re- migration to speak off. These moths feed on Omphalea species. These can be found in scattered populations all across South and Central America, but only part of the areas where they are found are a permanent habitat for these moths. Research suggests that the cause of the migration peak is an increase in toxicity when much of a single plant is eaten and decreasing toxicity when only small amounts of a certain plant are eaten. * The migration of Euploea core, Euploea sylvester, Tirumala septentrionis, and Tirumala limniace between the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats in India cover up to 350 to 400 km. This migration happens twice a year. The most probable reasons seem to be the heavy monsoons, reproductive diapause, and a lack of host plants, nectar and alkaloidal resource availability. * The Australian painted lady periodically migrates down the coast of Australia. Occasionally, in periods of strong migration in Australia, these butterflies have been known to migrate to New Zealand. The bogong moth also migrates biannually towards and from the Australian Alps. * The gatekeeper butterfly (Pyronia tithonus) from southern and eastern Britain has been expanding to northern Britain over the past three decades, despite their preference for warmer conditions.Merckx, Thomas; Hans Van Dyck (July 2002). \\"Interrelations Among Habitat Use, Behavior, and Flight- Related Morphology in Two Cooccurring Satyrine Butterflies, Maniola jurtina and Pyronia tithonus\\".

The reproductive systems in both females and males are less developed during the south-bound migration and calling behavior increases in the north-bound migration, indicating that mating is more favored in the summer. * Anagrapha falcifera (a celery looper) is another migratory moth in the United States.The Prairie Ecologist.

In the blue areas it can be found in summer. In the yellow area it is found in winter Macroglossum stellatarum is a moth that is recorded in the subtropical part of the Palearctic realm year round. In summer, the species disperses north up to Scandinavia and Iceland. In winter it migrates further south, deeper into Africa and to the Indian subcontinent. In the Netherlands and Belgium, there are 100 to 200 records per year in an average year. In warm summers however, like 2005 and 2006, several thousand are recorded.Vlindernet. Retrieved on 2008-08-26. In mild winters, small numbers can survive this far north, but these numbers are insufficient to call it a real population.  Causes  Usually, butterflies and moths migrate to escape from potentially harmful circumstances. Examples of this are a shortage of proper food plants, an unfavorable climate, like cold or extreme rain or overpopulation.  Migration and evolution  A phenomenon like migration is an evolutionary development. By migrating, the species has survived the process of natural selection. There are a number of advantages and disadvantages to migration. An example of this is the protozoan Ophryocystis elektroscirrha a parasite of the monarch. Severely infected individuals are weak, unable to expand their wings, or unable to eclose, and have shortened lifespans, but parasite levels vary in populations. This is not the case in laboratory or commercial rearing, where after a few generations, all individuals can be infected. Infection with this parasite creates an effect known as culling whereby migrating monarchs that are infected are less likely to complete the migration. This results in overwintering populations with lower parasite loads.  Recording  Record of a massive appearance of (presumably) Agrius convolvuli in 1719 near Turnau. Butterflies (and to a lesser extent moths) migrating in large numbers are a noteworthy sight, which is easy to observe and track. There are several historic records about migrating butterflies. There are records dating back to 1100 about migrating butterflies (probably a Pieris species) from Bavaria to the Duchy of Saxony and from 1248 about the migration of yellow butterflies in Japan. When flying at high altitudes, spotting migrating butterflies or moths can be hard. Low flying species are easily spotted or caught using a light trap. When individuals fly too high for these methods, air balloons equipped with nets are used at times. Alternatively, radar is used to monitor migration. Another registration technique, is marking the wings with tiny stickers, a technique comparable with bird ringing. This technique has not proven to be very successful though. Advances in technology might make it possible to equip individuals with micro transmitters in the future.  Migration and climate change  Global warming has caused an increase of migratory butterflies and moths that reach north-western European countries like the Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom. Research in the United Kingdom confirms that an increasing number of migrants reach the country. Because one would expect that migratory species can adapt to new circumstances quite well, the researches warn for new species that can have a negative impact on native species and possible damage to both health (species like the oak processionary) and agriculture.

The airfield was built by the Luftwaffe and opened in the early 1940s. Its primary use was as an interceptor fighter airfield during the Defense of the Reich campaign. In 1945 it was seized by the United States Army and was used as a combat airfield by Ninth Air Force during the Western Allied invasion of Germany. After the war the airfield became part of \\"Camp Eschborn\\", one of the United States Army facilities in the Frankfurt Area. It was closed in 1992 as part of the drawdown of American forces in Europe after the Cold War ended. Today the area is being redeveloped as an industrial site. History=German use during World War II Eschborn Airfield was built by the Luftwaffe about 1942 to provide air defense of the Frankfurt am Main area from Allied bomber attacks. A 1,600m concrete runway, aligned 12/30 was laid down, along with taxiways, dispersal aircraft hardstands, a support area and other buildings. Jagdgeschwader 106 (JG 106), a Focke-Wulf Fw 190A day interceptor fighter unit was assigned to the airfield in March 1943. In August 1943, JG 106 was moved to Mannheim and replaced by JG 27, a Messerschmitt Bf 109G unit that was being withdrawn from North Africa. JG 27 was based at Eschborn until September 1944. Other Luftwaffe day interceptor units assigned to Eschborn were JG 53 (March‚ÄìMay 1944); JG 301 (May‚ÄìJune 1944) and JG 2 (September 1944), flying mostly Bf 109Gs, or Fw 190As (JG 2). The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 In response to the interceptor attacks on Eighth Air Force heavy bomber formations, Eschborn was attacked in 1944 by XIII Fighter Command P-51 Mustang escort fighters that would drop down on the airfield and perform fighter sweeps over targets of opportunity. As Allied ground forces moved east into Central France, the airfield came within range of Ninth Air Force air units, which attacked the airfield with B-26 Marauder medium bombers and P-47 Thunderbolts. These attacks would take place when Eighth Air Force heavy bombers (B-17s, B-24s) were within interception range of the Luftwaffe aircraft assigned to the base, with the attacks being timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the interceptors pinned down and unable to attack the heavy bombers.Derived from information in USAAF Film \\"Target For Today\\" (available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkGL7vuC2A4) USAAF use United States Third Army units moved into the Frankfurt area during mid-March 1945, and ground forces captured Eschborn Airfield about 25 March. On 30 March, combat engineers from IX Engineer command 832d and 825th Engineering Aviation Battalions arrived to make the airfield operational for American aircraft. A Pierced Steel Planking runway was laid down over the damaged concrete runway and enough repairs were made to make the airfield operational by early April. The airfield was designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"Y-74 Frankfurt/Eschborn\\" and immediately put to use as a transport resupply and casualty (S&E;) evacuation airfield. C-47 Skytrain transports used the airfield frequently.IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout On 7 April, Ninth Air Force P-47 Thunderbolts arrived at Eschborn. The 371st Fighter Group and the 367th Fighter Group flew combat missions with Thunderbolts until the end of the war in May. The 367th remained at the airfield until mid-July 1945 when the Air Force turned the Eschborn airfield and base over to Army ground forces, which used the facility as an occupation garrison.Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. United States Army use Under Army control in July 1945, for a while Eschborn became a Displaced Persons camp while Europe tried to sort out the masses of people forcefully removed from their home nations during the war. Also, Eschborn remained an Air Technical Service Command facility until 1947 to process out excess American aircraft and to destroy surrendered Luftwaffe aircraft. The Luftwaffe buildings were repaired and reconstructed, the facility eventually becoming a major Army garrison as part of the Army of Occupation. During the 1950s, as a part of the United States Army NATO facilities in the Frankfurt area, the airfield was closed and Eschborn Airfield became \\"Camp Eschborn\\", the home of Army Engineering units. Army forces remained at Eschborn for the next 40 years during the Cold War, being withdrawn in 1992 as part of the general American drawdown of forces in Germany. The facility has been basically abandoned since 1992, and today the ghostly relics of empty buildings, streets and other facilities used by the United States Army during its 50-year use of Eschborn remain. Parts of the former military base are being redeveloped into an industrial estate. The airfield, not used since 1947, remains in part with an abandoned aircraft parking apron and a large Luftwaffe hangar, used for storage by the Army, but now a reminder of the wartime past of Eschborn as a combat airfield by both German and United States forces.

The bombing killed 17 people and wounded 63.  Background  The bomb comes following a spike in such attacks in Afghanistan and amid debate in NATO countries about sending more ISAF troops to fight in \\"Operation Enduring Freedom\\". India believed its longtime alliance with Afghanistan, as well as its political and cultural ties, made it less of a target than many Western powers. However, this confidence was shattered in an attack the previous year where a bombing at the embassy killed more than 50 people and injured more than 100.Many killed in Kabul suicide blast. Al Jazeera. 7 July 2008.  Bombing  The attacker struck at about 8:30 a.m. when the street‚Äîwhere the embassy and the Afghan Interior Ministry face each other‚Äîis normally busy with pedestrians. The Indian foreign secretary said that the attackers \\"came up to the outside perimeter wall of the embassy with a car loaded with explosives, obviously with the aim of targeting the embassy.\\" However, blast walls built since the previous bombing deflected the force of the explosion. The bomb blew out doors and windows at the embassy but caused no loss of life inside. Though there was damage to the watch tower there was no damage to chancery premises. The bombing was said to be of the same intensity as the previous years bombing. An Interior Ministry spokesman, Zemeri Bashary, said the explosion was a suicide bomb, without providing additional details. A bystander, Ahmadullah, said \\"We heard a big explosion, and smoke was everywhere. They pulled out several dead civilians and a few dozen wounded. One of my friends in [a nearby] house was injured by all the flying glass.\\" Another witness, Nik Mohammad, who was driving in the area, said that the road shook violently and he saw at least four vehicles badly damaged.  Casualties  All of the people killed were local people, there were a few Indians injured in the attack. India's ambassador to Afghanistan Jayant Prasad said that a few Indian security personnel were slightly injured. Reports suggest that Pakistan ISI was involved.  Responsibility  Within hours of the attack the Taliban claimed responsibility confirming suspicions that the Indian Embassy was the target. A Taliban spokesperson said the attacker was an Afghan man who blew up his sports utility vehicle laden with explosives just outside the embassy. G. Parthasarathy, a former diplomat and analyst at the Centre for Policy Research, said that although it was too early to point fingers there was a clear indication that the Taliban sees Indian economic assistance as complementary to American strategic objectives. He said that \\"Therefore, Indians are targeted. Add to that, their Pakistani mentors are not too happy with our (sic) presence in Afghanistan.\\" Phunchok Stobdan, a senior fellow at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, also said that despite being the apparent target of the attack and some prior pressure from Washington to back off, given Pakistani sensitivities‚ÄîIndia is still not likely to walk away from its Afghan commitments which include $1.1 billion in ongoing development projects. He said, \\"No one in India is willing to sacrifice Afghanistan for the sake of Af-Pak strategy. India-Afghan relations are very strong and very old, even during the British period.\\" India's previous accusations against the Pakistani spy agency were again brought to fore as speculation started that the ISI may have been involved.  International reaction  * ‚Äì President Hamid Karzai's office condemned the attack, adding that civilians accounted for most of the injured. The Foreign Affairs Ministry also condemned the attack on Indian television.Times NOW. 8 October 2009. * ‚Äì The U.S. ambassador to India, Timothy Roemer said: \\"Our heart goes out to India, to the victims of terrorism and our prayers are with the people of India today.

The novel was released on May 4, 2010 by Ace Books and follows Sookie as she deals with her increasingly more complicated romantic and personal relationships with the supernatural creatures around her.  Plot summary  When the novel begins, Sookie Stackhouse is still recovering physically and emotionally from the torture she received at the hands of demented fairies Lochlan and Neave in the previous book (Dead and Gone). She has finally settled into a relationship with the Viking vampire Eric, and her errant brother Jason seems to have his life in order, too, with a solid new girlfriend, Michele. But all the other people in Sookie‚Äôs life--Eric himself, her former lover Bill, her friend and boss Sam--are having family problems. Eric‚Äôs maker, Appius Livius Ocella, shows up with Eric‚Äôs ‚Äòbrother‚Äô in tow--he is Alexei Romanov, only son of the last Czar of Russia, who as an adolescent witnessed the Bolshevik Revolution, including the slaughter of his entire family. He developed emotional problems as a result. Appius has sought Eric out as a last resort, to see if Eric can help restore Alexei to sanity. Meanwhile, Bill is still suffering from the silver poisoning he got via the teeth of Neave when he rescued Sookie from her torturers. He is not getting better, and may only be able to be cured by the blood of a vampire made by Bill's maker, the dead Lorena, but Bill refuses to ask his sibling for help. The furor raised by the coming out of the two-natured continues, as Calvin Norris reveals himself to his co-workers and Sam's family deals with the news of having the two-natured in the family. Certain forces are agitating for a were registration system, and the weres suspect that they are under surveillance by the government. Sookie begins to recover from her torture at the hands of Lochlan and Neave, but still has post-traumatic stress and anxiety. She wants to kill Victor because she realizes he is a major threat to Eric, Pam, and Bill, wanting them dead. But Sookie struggles with the idea of killing Victor in cold blood, rather than in the heat of battle or in self- defense. Victor sends assassins to kill Sookie, Pam, and Bill, without success. Sookie's cousin Claude comes to live with her, claiming he suffers without the company of other fairies (his triplets, Claudine and Claudette, are now deceased). Sookie's mad half-fae uncle, Dermot, has been wandering the property for reasons unknown, as has another unidentified fairy. Sookie seeks out Bill's \\"sibling\\", Judith Vardamon, to ask for her help. She learns that Judith was made vampire by Lorena in an attempt to placate a sullen Bill, her reasoning being that having a companion who so resembled Bill's late wife would please him. However, Bill avoids contact with Judith, believing that she blames him for her vampiric state. Judith won't contact Bill because she fears and hates Lorena. Sookie contacts Judith for the sake of Bill's health. Upon learning of Lorena's death, Judith is overjoyed and happily anticipatory of her visit with Bill. Her blood serves to heal him, and the two seem to build a rapport quickly. Sookie is called upon to babysit her cousin Hadley's young son, Hunter, who is also telepathic. She helps him with the social nuances of being telepathic. Sookie attends a trial by the Shreveport pack, to learn why the body of Basim, a new were, was found buried on her property. She learns that Alcide's second is the bloodthirsty Jannalynn, who is dating Sam Merlotte. Sookie struggles to prevent the pack from killing any of their own. Ultimately, she learns that Colman, father of the baby Claudine was carrying, is seeking revenge on Sookie for the part he perceives she played in Claudine's death. He was going to kill her, but after seeing her mothering Hunter, he can't bear to kill her, and instead wants her to be arrested. Meanwhile, Alexei has been carelessly draining people and refusing to be controlled by Appius, and Eric struggles to control him. Ultimately, Alexei attacks and almost kills Pam and Eric, and kills Bobby Burnham (Eric's \\"day man\\"), and Felicia. The stories converge at Sookie's house, where Eric kills Alexei, Colman kills Appius Livius while attempting to kill Sookie, and Dermot kills Colman. Sookie and Claude free Dermot from the spell that had made him mad.

After the war, he dedicated himself to diplomacy, working under the minister Wilhelm von Humboldt, when the latter led the negotiations on determining the borders of the German territories in Frankfurt am Main. He followed von Humboldt to London in 1817 as embassy secretary and in 1819 to Berlin, where he took over the section for trade and maritime affairs in the Prussian Foreign Office. Here he married Wilhelm von Humboldt's younger daughter Gabriele (1802‚Äì1887) in 1820. He was particularly successful and active in preparing the Zollverein (German Customs Union) through the conclusion of customs agreements with the neighbouring states. Also as ambassador to London, to which he was appointed in 1827, he worked to advance the Zollverein. He won the trust of the British statesmen and played a successful part in the negotiations over Belgium and the Eastern Question (1840‚Äì41). In autumn 1841 he was made envoy to the Bundestag in Frankfurt am Main, but already on 2 April 1842 was appointed Foreign Minister of Prussia in place of Mortimer von Maltzan.

It is at 1200 Blanding Street in downtown Columbia. The depot was named to the National Register of Historic Places on December 28, 1989. After the bus terminal was closed, the building became a bank. Currently, it is a physician's office. History The building was constructed in 1938 and 1939 for Atlantic Greyhound Lines. The bus station was closed in 1987. In 1990, it was acquired by Lexington National Bank. They used the ticket windows as teller windows. After the bank left in 2000, the building was vacant. In 2005, the building was adapted for a plastic surgeon. Since 2014, the building has been a contributing property in the Columbia Commercial Historic District, which was listed on the NRHP on October 20, 2014. Architecture The depot is an island-type station designed by George D. Brown in the Art Moderne or Streamline Moderne style, which grew out of the industrial design work of Norman Bel Geddes, Henry Dreyfuss, and Raymond Loewy. These designs emphasized a streamlined shape with minimal ornamentation. The building has a reinforced concrete foundation and a structural steel frame. The east, west, and north elevations have three horizontal bands and rounded corners. The lower band is blue stucco. The middle band is glass block. The top band is blue and ivory Vitrolite panels. The north elevation on Blanding Street has four ivory Vitrolite columns extending through the canopy over the five entrance doors. The vertical sign above the entrance was constructed of aluminum with stainless-steel trim. The sign was capped with the iconic \\"running greyhound\\" logo of the bus company. The letters in the words \\"Greyhound Bus Depot\\" and the running greyhound were outlined with neon tubing. The original interior had a terrazzo floors, plaster walls, and wainscoting. The waiting room had a skylight for additional, natural lighting. In its current use as a plastic surgeon's office, the exterior remains the same with the exception of the sign, which no longer has the Greyhound name or logo. The interior was redone with a patient waiting room, consultation room, a surgery suite, recovery rooms, and offices.

Life He was the only child of John Shawe (d. December 1634, aged 63) by his second wife, born at Sykehouse in the chapelry of Bradfield, parish of Ecclesfield, West Riding of Yorkshire, on 28 June 1608. His mother was Emot, daughter of Nicholas Stead of Onesacre in the same chapelry. He went to school at Darwen and Rotherham. In 1623 he was admitted pensioner at Christ's College Cambridge, his tutor being William Chappell. Two sermons by Thomas Weld at a village near Cambridge made him a puritan before he had taken his degree. He graduated B.A. in 1627, then M.A. 1630. Driven from Cambridge by the plague in 1629, he was ordained deacon and priest (28 Dec.) by Thomas Dove, bishop of Peterborough. His first charge was a lectureship in the chapelry of Brampton, Derbyshire. His diocesan was Thomas Morton, bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, thought him young for a preaching license, and interviewed him with a scholastic examination, but required no subscription and allowed him to preach anywhere. He remained at Brampton three years (1630‚Äì3), occasionally visiting London, where his preaching attracted some Devon merchants. Shawe was now married, and held the post of chaplain to Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke; through his city connections he was transferred in 1633 to a lectureship to be maintained by for a term of three years at Chulmleigh, Devon. (This arrangement was seen by Shawe himself as parallel to the work of the Feoffees for Impropriations, but was not part of it; it was cut short some time after the Feoffees lost their case to William Laud.)Christopher Hill, Economic Problems of the Church (1971), p. 167. In 1636 Shaw retired to Sykehouse, of which he had become possessed on his father's death. At the instance of John Vaux, the lord mayor of York, he was soon appointed lecturer at Allhallows-on-the-Pavement, York. Having preached his first sermon there, he was summoned by the archbishop, Richard Neile, who regarded Vaux as his enemy, but moderated his tone on learning that Shawe was Pembroke's chaplain. On 17 April 1639 Shawe was instituted to the vicarage of Rotherham on Pembroke's presentation, and the earl took him to Berwick as his chaplain. At the pacification of Berwick (28 May) Shawe made the acquaintance of Alexander Henderson, and improved it when he acted (October 1640) as chaplain to the English commissioners for the Treaty of Ripon. He acted as chaplain at Doncaster to Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland in 1641, when, Holland was engaged in disbanding the army raised against the Scots. Shawe's ministry at Rotherham was disturbed by the outbreak of the First English Civil War. On Sunday, 22 January 1643, Rotherham was attacked by an armed force, while Shawe was preaching, and he hid in the steeple. He fled to Kingston-upon-Hull, but, having preached there once, he was excluded by the governor Sir John Hotham as an extremist. Subsequently, he preached before Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron at Selby. Returning to Rotherham, he was proclaimed a traitor and fined a thousand marks. On the taking of the town (4 May 1643) his wife was imprisoned, but Shawe, after hiding in cellars for three weeks, escaped to Manchester. Here he preached every Friday without pay, He accepted from Sir William Brereton the rectory of Lymm, Cheshire, but continued to reside in Manchester. On the approach of Prince Rupert (June 1644), Shawe fled to Yorkshire. He was chaplain to the standing committee established after the surrender of York (16 July) for the government of the northern counties, preached in York at the taking of the Solemn League and Covenant (20 September 1644), and was scribe to the assembly of ministers which met weekly in the chapter-house at York to assist Fairfax in the work of expelling scandalous ministers. All the records of this assembly were kept by Shawe, who burned them when national affairs changed. Fairfax gave him the rectory of Scrayingham, East Riding; he preached there only a short time, and accepted a call to Hull, lecturing first at the low church (St. Mary's), then at the high church (Holy Trinity), with a stipend from the corporation, and a house. He lectured on Wednesdays and Sundays, and preached to the garrison. His parishioners petitioned parliament about his gathering a particular church. In 1646 he was at Newcastle-on-Tyne, as chaplain of the parliamentary commissioners to Charles I. In 1651, through the interest of Sir William Strickland, he was appointed master of the Charterhouse at Hull. During the Protectorate he preached frequently at Whitehall and Hampton Court. Oliver Cromwell admired his preaching, and gave him a salary. He once preached before Richard Cromwell at Whitehall. In the early 1650s he clashed at Hull with John Canne, who denounced him as corrupt in a pamphlet.:s:Canne, John (DNB00) When the Restoration came, Shawe was sworn a royal chaplain (25 July 1660). By the end of the year complaints of his services from the officers and garrison of Hull reached Charles II through Gilbert Sheldon. Shawe was present at the coronation (23 April 1661). On 9 June Sir Edward Nicholas despatched a royal mandate (dated 8 June) inhibiting him from preaching at Holy Trinity, Hull. Shawe went up to London and was introduced to the king by Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester. Charles declined to remove the inhibition, but allowed him to retain his mastership, and promised to provide for him as his chaplain, Shawe then saw Sheldon, who explained that he was looked upon as a clerical leader in the north, and as no great friend to episcopacy or the Book of Common Prayer. Shawe declared that he had never in his life said a word against either, but owned that 'if they had never come in, he would never have fetched them.' Returning to Hull, he preached every Sunday at the Charterhouse, and drew crowds, in spite of obstructions by the garrison, Finding the situation hopeless, the Uniformity Act 1662 being now passed (19 May 1662), he resigned the Charterhouse, closed his accounts with the corporation who owed him money, and moved on 20 June to Rotherham. Here, till the act came into force (24 August), he conducted services in the parish church alternately with the vicar, Luke Clayton (d. 1674), Henceforth he preached only in private houses. His means were ample. He died on 19 April 1672, and was buried in Rotherham parish church. Works He published, besides sermons, 'Mistris Shawe's Tomb-stone, or the Saint's Remains,' &c.; [June] 1668, a memoir of his first wife. His autobiography, written for his son, was edited by John Broadley (from a transcript by Ralph Thoresby) as 'Memoirs of the Life of John Shawe,' &c.;, Hull, 1824, re-edited for the Surtees Society, 1875; and again re-edited by the Rev. J. R. Boyle, Hull, 1882. Family He married, first, on 13 December 1632, Dorothy Heathcote (died 10 December 1657) of Cutthorpe Hall, Derbyshire, by whom he had six daughters, and a son who died in infancy; secondly, on 19 December 1659, Margaret, daughter of John Stillington of Kelfield, by whom he had one daughter, and a son John, born 9 February 1663, died unmarried December 1682.

About 1418 he emerged as a leading opponent of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury. Together with Christopher Preston, 2nd Baron Gormanston, he was accused of treasonable correspondence with Thomas Le Boteller, the Prior of the Order of Hospitallers at Kilmainham, imprisoned and threatened with forfeiture of his titles and estates. No plausible evidence of treason was produced against either Kildare or Gormanston, and they were released and restored to their estates.

He was Justiciar of Ireland until 1462. Both Thomas and his cousin Thomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Desmond were leaders of the home rule party. In 1468 both Desmond and Kildare were attainted and their lands forfeited and Desmond was beheaded at Drogheda on 14 February 1468 at the age of 42. Kildare was more fortunate: he escaped to England. Edward IV discovered Ireland was ungovernable without the support of Kildare, replacing the now deceased Desmond, and Kildare's attainder was reversed.Wagner, John A.

It was planned as an attempt to force the French to withdraw their forces from Flanders to reinforce their own coast. At the same time, as Lorient was used by the French East India Company as a base and supply depot, its destruction would serve British objectives in the East Indies. Around 4500 British soldiers were embarked, but the ships carrying them had to wait off the Lorient coast several days, allowing the town to organise its defences and call in reinforcements from other towns in the region. The British troops only arrived in the outskirts of the town on 3 October and negotiations for the town's surrender were ended on by the bombardment of 5‚Äì7 October. On 7 October the British force was ordered to retreat. The British engineers' incompetence and losses to disease and fatigue forced the commander to stop his offensive. At the same time, the French commander originally planned to surrender, believing his enemy to have an overwhelming numerical superiority and knowing the weakness of his defences and the poor training and weaponry of his own troops. He made a surrender offer on 7 October, shortly after the enemy's departure, and never received a reply. The raid is notable for its military results, such as forcing the French to develop fortifications in southern Brittany, but also for its cultural consequences, such as starting a controversy between David Hume and Voltaire and giving rise to a cult of the Virgin Mary in the town along with several songs describing the siege. Background=War of the Austrian Succession Following the capture of Louisbourg in 1745, the British government contemplated launching an attack on Quebec which would hand Britain control over Canada. The Duke of Bedford was the leading political supporter of a campaign. A force was prepared for this with troops under Lieutenant General James St Clair, to be escorted by a naval force under Admiral Richard Lestock. It was ready to sail by June 1746. However, it was decided that it was too late in the year for an Atlantic crossing and operations up the St Lawrence River and the British were alarmed by the sudden departure of a French fleet under d'AnvilleDull 2005, p.15. (which met with its own failure in attempting the retaking of Louisbourg). As it would be impossible to re- integrate the British force back into another one, Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle suggested to James St Clair that it be used for a landing in France. George II of England heard about the proposal and asked the general if a plan had been prepared.Louis Le Cam, 1931, page 24 The general told him there was not yet any such plan and that he did not know where such a landing might be made, but proposed the generals study possible landing places on the French coast.Louis Le Cam, 1931, page 25 In a meeting with the king, Newcastle insisted that the plan be carried through and on 29 August St Clair received orders to proceed to Plymouth to await orders for the operation.Louis Le Cam, 1931, page 26 Origin of the British planDecision to attack Lorient= At Plymouth, St Clair received orders to sail for the French coast and attack Lorient, Rochefort, La Rochelle, Bordeaux or any other town as opportunity presented itself. In a letter of 29‚Äì30 August, he favoured an operation against Bordeaux, an area he already knew and which (unlike the other towns) was unfortified. Lorient was also far enough to draw off French troops from Flanders, where they were proving very successful under the mar√©chal de Saxe, overrunning Austrian territory and winning several victories such as Fontenoy, Rocourt and the Brussels Admiral Anson was also in Plymouth. He met St Clair and informed him that he knew the town of Lorient in southern Brittany was poorly fortified. It was therefore decided to send the naval force to identify possible landing or raiding sites along that coast.Rodger 2006, p.248. At the same time, Newcastle began to support a plan to land in Normandy which had been produced by major McDonald of the general staff. McDonald was sent to Plymouth to defend his plan in person before St Clair, but St Clair decided that McDonald was ignorant in military matters and if he switched from Lorient to Normandy now he would have to send his ships out on another reconnaissance mission. It was finally decided to send the expeditionary force against Lorient, since it would reap a double benefit \\\\- firstly, the town was the headquarters of the French East India Company, whose activities could be stopped by a raid on the town, and secondly it would act as a diversion for the French force in Flanders. = British preparations = The Battle of Camaret served as a model for later British amphibious operations against Brittany. British tactics had evolved since the War of the League of Augsburg. Instead of bombarding ports and raiding the coast of Brittany as it had done during that conflict, Britain shifted more and more to larger amphibious operations such as the 1694 Battle of Camaret. Vice admiral Richard Lestock was court-martialled due to his implication in the defeat at the Battle of Toulon and appointed to head the British fleet for the new operation in Brittany in February 1744.John Lingard, Histoire d'Angleterre depuis premi√®re invasion des Romains jusqu'√† nos jours, Paris, Parent- Desbarres, 1842, 549 pages, p.216 He had at his disposal 16 ships of the line, 8 frigates and 43 transport ships. Shortly before the expedition's departure the historian and philosopher David Hume became secretary to James St Clair, in command of the land offensive. Andr√©-Louis Leroy, David Hume, Presses Universitaires De France, p 7 St Clair's force was made up of the 1st Battalion of the Royal Regiment, the 5th Battalion of the Highlanders Regiment, the 3rd Battalion of Bragg's Regiment, the 2nd Battalion of Harrisson's Regiment, the 4th Battalion of Richbell's Regiment, part of some battalions from Frampton's Regiment and some companies of marines, numbering a total of 4,500 men. The commanders were doubtful as to whether Brittany was the best target for the raid, preferring Normandy. Brittany was not well known to the British - St Clair could not acquire a map of the region and had to use a small-scale map of France instead, whilst Lestock knew nothing about the town's defences. The landing force was also unable to acquire horses. The fleet left Plymouth on 26 September and passed Ushant without being intercepted by the French. French contextIntelligence and preparations= The French staff had been informed of the importance of the troops stationed at Plymouth by their intelligence services through interrogating British prisoners, but this had not revealed the force's intended target. An agent on the ground sent a message that the force had little food and few horses, suggesting a small-scale raid on the French coast. The commanders of French ports on the English Channel and Atlantic coasts were notified, notably Port-Louis on 24 September. Coastguard militias were sent to the coast, though British reconnaissance along the coast went unreported. At the same time ships under Mac Nemara were ordered to head for Lorient and wait. =Situation around Lorient= Map of Lorient. At the end of the 17th century, the coast of Brittany was gradually covered in new fortifications, but the area around Lorient itself was still poorly defended. The citadelle de Port-Louis which closed off the Lorient roads had not been modernisedLa citadelle de Port-Louis, sur Gertrude, base du service de l‚ÄôInventaire du patrimoine de la r√©gion Bretagne. and only low ramparts protected the city's rear, whilst its coast had no other defences. The place had become a trading port and a strategic point. Arsenals were built to construct ships for the French navy and the East India Company - the latter had chosen to move its base from Nantes to Lorient in 1732. It was also a centre for cabotage between Brest, Nantes and Bordeaux. To the town's south-east, Belle-√éle gave shelter to ships returning from the East Indies and heading for Lorient. The nearby islands of Houat and Ho√´dic were fortified at the end of the 17th century to defend the approaches to the main island. A cult of the Virgin Mary developed in the area from the 1620s onwards. Apparitions of saint Anne were reported in the era near Auray and several miracles were attributed to her during earlier British raids, against a background of Protestant British forces fighting Catholic Breton ones. Raid The expedition sailed in September, reaching the French Atlantic coast shortly afterwards. The two commanders were distinctly uncomfortable with their orders, as they believed the equinoctial gales would make the operation extremely risky, and they lacked any firm intelligence about Lorient and its defences. The troops were landed on 20 September, and advanced towards the town. They reached its outer defences and came under fire ‚Äì which led to their withdrawal. St Clair reboarded his troops and the expedition sailed back to England. In fact the townspeople had been about to surrender, so lightly defended was Lorient, and the lack of sea defences meant that Lestock could have sailed his ships into the harbour and landed them on the quayside.Rodger 2006, p.248‚Äì249. Opening phase Landing = The British fleet arrived off Lorient on 29 September after six days crossing the Channel and joined up with its reconnaissance vessels. A barque from Port-Louis sighted them but confused them with Mac Nemara's ships, which were expected at the same time. Lestock chose the entry to the Lorient roads as his landing point due to his poor knowledge of Lorient's defences. The fleet started to anchor in Pouldu bayfrom the evening of 29 September onwards, near the mouth of the La√Øta. Despite favourable weather, a full moon and a good wind blowing inshore, Lestock postponed the landing until the following day, leaving time for the French to prepare their defences. Even so, the landing site presented several issues - it was exposed to the wind, running the risk of running the ships against the shore if a storm blew up, whilst it was 16 miles away from Lorient. The landing took place on Saturday 1 October after being cancelled due to lack of time the day before. The landing could not take place early in the morning due to unfavourable weather, allowing the Lorient coast-guards definitely to identify the fleet as British and not Mac Nemara's, and time to organise their defences. The British forces approached three beaches and landed in groups between 400 and 1000 men under a bombardment from Lestock's ships. The first available French forces were the coast-guards, mainly made up of ill-equipped peasants, with only staffs, pikes and a few muskets). Since 1744 they had been trained for 15 days each year, to limited effect. There were also three companies of cavalry - with the coast- guards, this made a total of around 2,000 men under the command of marquis De L'H√¥pital. Even so, only two of the three beaches could be guarded effectively, and St Clair took advantage of this to land his troops. = Reaction in Lorient = Stages of the siege. News of a British landing in the area reached Lorient on 30 September at around 3pm and several middle-class inhabitants of the city evacuated their possessions towards Hennebont and Vannes. The alert was given and went inland as far as Noyal-Pontivy. On the same day Deschamps (commander of the citadelle de Port-Louis fortress in Morbihan) requested troops from several towns in the region. They were sent on 1 and 2 October and amounted to 300 men for Vannes, two militia detachments for Josselin, some troops for Rohan, 300 men for Morlaix, a few dozen musketeers for Lamballe and a little under 1,000 men for Rennes. The retreating French forces arrived in Lorient the same evening. Peasants and around 2000 men of the coastguard militias managed to fight guerilla rearguard actions in the countryside separating the British positions from the town. A British reconnaissance force seized Guidel on the first day after fighting peasant troops and forcing them to retreat to Qu√©ven. De L'H√¥pital took command of the defences of Lorient on the evening of 1 October and immediately held a council of war. He wished to initially leave the defence of the town to the peasant militias whilst his own troops harassed the British troops in the countryside, but the town's inhabitants did not agree and so he relinquished the command.  March to the town and French reactions  Approaching the town = The British land offensive started on 1 October 1746 and immediately faced difficulties. Rain made the land hard to cross and the three miles separating the beaches from the town made it difficult to supply the besieging force with munitions and supplies. On Sunday 2 October most of the British force began marching towards Lorient, but St Clair did not have a detailed map and even when he captured prisoners, they spoke Breton not French and were useless for intelligence purposes. St Clair had to divide his troops into two columns, one heading for Pl≈ìmeur and the other going north towards Quimperl√©. The first column reached Pl≈ìmeur safely but the Quimperl√© column was harassed by 300 militiamen coming from Concarneau and for a time had to retreat before turning towards Pl≈ìmeur. The two columns rejoined just before Pl≈ìmeur, which was attacked and sacked before the force moved on Lorient. The British came in sight of Lorient around 3pm and set up camp at Lanveur, two- thirds of a league from the city. = French reactions = H√¥tel Gabriel, site of the East India Company's headquarters. The British force send a surrender proposal to the town on the evening of 3 October 1746. St Clair required a right of pillage for four hours and a large sum of money. The French negotiators rejected the proposal the same evening - they proposed that the French force be allowed to retreat back to the town with full honours of war and a guarantee that neither the town nor the East India Company's storehouses would be pillaged by the British troops. These terms were contrary to St Clair's requirements and he refused them on 4 October and send orders to bring his ships' guns to the town to besiege it. With no horses or pack animals, everything had to be carried on the men's backs. The peasants had also hidden all their food, adding to the troops' fatigue - many men fell sick or became unfit for duty every day. Several French militia sorties were made against the besiegers during the early days of the siege, but these were unsupported by regular troops, limiting their impact. The main aim was to buy time to allow reinforcements to arrive. On the evening of Monday 3 October, major De Villeneuve arrived at Port-Louis and took command of it, from the morning of 4 October until Thursday 6 October, on which date he was replaced by the comte de Volvire, the king's commander in Brittany. He was able to interview British prisoners and learn his enemy's weak points. On the evening of Wednesday 5 October, news of the landing reached Louis XV of France at Versailles. He decided to detach troops from the Flanders front and send them to the west - this included 20 infantry battalions, a dragoon regiment, two cavalry regiments and an army staff detachment.  Siege and retreat  British attempts = British engineers promised to destroy the town in 24 hours but rapidly proved unable to keep that promise. Cannon were deliver without enough shot and mortars without furnaces, forcing them to stop firing. A third of the British troops also had to help transport the artillery, exhausting them. The siege only began in earnest on 5 October 1746 and the bombardment the following day. However, the British guns were dug in too far from the town and only caused limited damage \\\\- six were killed, twelve wounded, two houses set on fire, two others heavily damaged and fifteen more lightly damaged. Mainly built of stone, with little wood, the houses of Lorient mainly proved resistant to British artillery fire. David Hume summed up the situation : The \\"fontaine des anglais\\" (English fountain) in Lorient, used by British troops during the siege. The British force began to shrink thanks to exhaustion and sickness. Only 3,000 men were still fit for combat on the evening of 6 October. They had to face militia sorties and defend their camp on the Keroman moorland. They gained information from deserters on 6 October, as well as from a black slaveThe town was part of the Atlantic slave trade from 1720 until 1790 and especially after 1732, when the East India Company decided to move all its business from Nantes to Lorient. Around 43,000 slaves were deported by expeditions setting out from Lorient. and prostitutes, made the British believe that a force of nearly 20,000 men were waiting within the town and that a massive counter-attack was imminent. Storms were expected and so Lestock sent word that he could no longer remain offshore. St Clair concluded that he would have to raise the siege. A council of war on the evening of 6 October did not come to a definite decision, but retreat was much talked of. The bombardment of the town was still proving unsuccessful on the following day (7 October) and during the afternoon the British decided to retreat, abandoning the camp whilst the artillery continued to bombard the town to hide the force's retreat. Only on Sunday 9 October did the last troops re-embark, though a headwind prevented immediate departure and the fleet only sailed on 10 October. = French defences = The town prepared its defences - cannon were brought off ships and installed on the town's ramparts, new defences were built and the garrison was boosted by the arrival of troops from Port-Louis. On 6 October almost 15,000 militiamen were in the town, but they were all inexperienced and undisciplined. On the same day the French guns began replying to the British bombardment, using better-quality shot - the French fired chain shot and grapeshot whilst the British used bombs and exploding grenades. The following day (7 October) around 4,000 shot were fired against the British Three British deserters were also captured, revealing that the British force only amounted to 3,000 men and not the rumoured 20,000. On the evening of 7 October, a British shot fell near the French command centre, leading to a council of war. De Volvire and de L'H√¥pital backed surrender, thinking that the British were about to reinforce their firepower. The town's commander did not believe that his troops could win, thinking weaker than the British troops, but his officers and the town's inhabitants opposed surrender, stating they were ready to defend the town to the last bullet. It was thus decided to surrender, and on 7 October at 7pm De L'H√¥pital left the town carrying its surrender proposal. He was unable to find the enemy force and had to return to Lorient around 10pm. He suspected a British ruse and ordered the town's defences reinforced. On the following day (8 October) the French cannon and mortars were found in what was left of the besiegers' camp and that evening the peasants of Pl≈ìmeur brought the town news of British retreat. The coastguard militia harassed the British force as it retreated, but the French cavalry and dragoons refused to take part in those operations. No attempt was made to stop the British fleet as it passed Port-Louis on 10 October, for fear of a second landing there. The inhabitants of Lorient were also on the alert against British reinforcemenets landing in the region. News of the siege reached Paris via Versailles, alarming the shareholders of France's East India Company. De L'H√¥pital arrived in Paris on 14 October and met the king. Omitting to mentions his mistakes, his account of the battle promoted his and De Volvire's role in it and thus gained him advancement and financial advantage. Aftermath The concept of Naval Descents, such as Lorient, became fashionable again in the 1750s during the Seven Years' War when Britain launched a number of raids against towns and islands along the French coast in a bid to destabilise the French war effort in Germany. Britain launched raids on Rochefort, Cherbourg and St Malo during the war.  Military results  Later raids on southern Britanny = The British fleet headed to the east of Lorient to start attacking several points along the coast until on 10 October a storm hit and five transports with around 900 men lost touch with the rest of the fleet. Without orders of their own, these ships sailed back to Britain. Three battalions of reinforcements had been promised and were expected by the commanders but never arrived. The Quiberon peninsula was occupied and pillaged between 14 and 20 October. The island of Houat was also attacked on 20 October and Ho√´dic on 24 October. The defences built on these islands by Vauban were captured without a shot being fired and razed to the ground. Belle-√éle-en-Mer was blockaded until the squadron left on 29 October. The many raids disrupted trade in the region but the operation had no effect on the War of the Austrian Succession. After receiving news of the allied defeat at the battle of Rocourt and of the probable arrival of French reinforcements in Brittany, the commanders decided to sail back to Britain. The fleet was battered by strong winds and scattered, with some of them sailing for Spithead and the majority of the transports and other ships (still under Lestock's command) setting course for Cork, which they reached in early November. News of the defeat reached Britain before Lestock did and he was forced to surrender his command, dying a month later. In December the same year The Gentleman's Magazine published a letter from someone presenting himself as well-informed about the expedition and accusing the admiral of being under the influence of a prostitute during the campaign and of letting her run councils of war on board. Nicholas Tindal repeated these accusations to explain the expedition's failure. = Fortification of southern Britanny = Map of fortifications around Lorient. The British raid reminded the French of the weaknesses in the region's defences. Several measures were put in place from 1750 onwards and the duc d'Aiguillon arrived as the new governor of Brittany. He divided the coast into twenty 'capitaineries', each with a battalion and improved land communication routes and the battalions' training. A new network of defences was begun around Lorient. Hornworks were built on pointe de Pen Man√© and at Locmiqu√©lic from 1761 to 1779 to protect the Lorient arsenal, a battery at Fort-Bloqu√© in 1749 (expanded in 1755) to protect the region's southwest coast. Further to the west was fort du Loch, built in 1756. Inland, the approaches to the town were fortified with two lunettes, one at Kerlin in 1755 and the other at Le Faou√´dic in 1758. New fortifications were also begun in a zone from the Gl√©nan archipelago in the west to √Æle Dumet in the east. At the latter a circular battery and barracks were built between 1756 and 1758. On the Quiberon peninsula a new fort was completed in 1760, barring entry at Penthi√®vre. The fortifications of Houat and Ho√´dic were rebuilt between 1757 and 1759 and fort Cigogne was built on the Gl√©nan archipelago in 1755.  Cultural results  Controversy between Hume and Voltaire = David Hume, who took part in the expedition. After the battle a controversy developed between Voltaire and Hume over their accounts of the battle. One version of Histoire de la guerre de mil sept cent quarante et un attributed to Voltaire (he later challenged the version's authenticity, stating it was made from stolen drafts and formed a \\"shapeless and disfigured heap\\" of his manuscripts) published in 1755 dealt with the British operation at Lorient in 1746. It held St Clair responsible for the British defeat and used unflattering words to decry all his actions before concluding: . It reached Hume and in January 1756 he got in contact with another veteran of the expedition to write a new account that would be more favourable to St Clair. Many close to him pushed him to published it and a draft was written. Descent on the coast of Brittany in 1746, and the causes of its failure was completed the same year, just after the outbreak of the Seven Years' War. In it Hume attacked Voltair without naming him. Earlier, in April, an anonymous letter was published in the Monthly Review - this was later signed by Hume and is attributed to him by several scholars. A French translation of it was published in the Journal britannique in 1756 but it did not draw a reply. = Marian cult and political recovery = Statue of Our Lady of Victory, showing her entrhroned on the ramparts of Lorient and striking the British lion. On 15 November 1746 the town authorities in Lorient met and arrived at the conclusion that their victory had been due to an intervention by the Virgin Mary. It was thus decided to hold an annual celebration mass in the town's parish church of Saint-Louis on 7 October, followed by a procession through the town. The bishop of Vannes approved the decision on 23 February 1747. One statue was thus produced showing the Virgin as a warrior saint along the lines of Joan of Arc, sitting on the arms of the city as a pedestal and using her sceptre to beat a lion with the British arms on his sword and shield \\\\- this was melted down during the French Revolution, though a larger replica was produced in the 19th century. Between the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th century, the cult took a major part in the city's politics and was opposed on two fronts. Opposition between the Church and State found a particularly strong echo in the town when the mayor Adolphe L'Helgouarc'h discussed banning the procession. The ceremony thus became a demonstration of opposition to the state. The local press also used it around that time to show opposition to Protestant Britain - 7 October was also the anniversary of the 1571 battle of Lepanto between the Catholic and Ottoman fleets and was frequently used by Catholic opposition parties. For example, in 1898 La Croix du Morbihan talked of L'Helgouarc'h's administration as an \\"English municipal council\\". It was also used this way during the Fashoda Crisis of 1898 and during World War Two to condemn the British after the attack on Mers-el-K√©bir and the British bombing of Lorient. = Songs and poetry = Louis Le Cam referred to the events in a short six-verse poem describing the British's arrival in the Lorient region. A slightly longer chanson also exists, speaking of a young woman who commits suicide rather than let British soldiers assault her - this probably refers to Brittany's motto \\"Plut√¥t la mort que la souillure\\" (sooner death than defilement). At the end of the 19th century the abb√© Jean-Mathurin Cadic wrote a long poem describing the different stages of the British campaign.

Lauaki Namulau'ulu held the position of high talking chief for Pule when the traditional power brokers of Samoa met to determine matters of national importance. Samoa's main traditional power brokers were Pule and Tumua. Tumua being the Main Chiefs who are from the island of Upolu and who supported the royal families of Tama Aiga. Upolu is the second largest island in the Samoan archipelago. The competition and rivalry between these two powerful traditional cadres of chieftains fueled the dynamics of Samoa's traditional political structure. Lauaki and his followers were not ready to concede their authority as the decision makers for Samoa to a foreign power. This was the impetus for the Mau a Pule movement which sought to retain the authority of the Traditional political structure which was based on thousands of years of historical events, cultural designations and achievements. This indigenous structure in Lauaki's opinion, as well as many other Samoan Chiefs including Mata'afa Iosefo, who fought against foreign interference with Samoan traditional authority, was too deeply entrenched in Samoa's cultural structure, thus it was unacceptable to Lauaki for Samoans to live in a world where the Samoan way was relegated to irrelevancy. Exile In the first months of 1909, Governor Solf called in the military to quash Lauaki and the Mau a Pule on Savai'i. Four warships and troops from the East Asia Squadron arrived.

Lauritsson was after some time sent back to Norway with a letter for the nobility, describing great hostilities and suggesting they should kill as many Danes as possible. Due to this, Lauritsson was captured and sentenced to be executed. However he was set free after paying 100 daler. This was probably due to Enno's sister Anna Tronds and the fact that the lord of Bergenhus Fortress, Erik Rosenkrantz (1519-1575) was also Enno's cousin.

It is found in south-east Asia, including Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and most of Australia. The wingspan is about 16 mm. The larvae are considered a pest on Zea mays, Oryza sativa and Triticum, Saccharum and Sorghum species. The moth is very active, bright yellow or straw in colour with two distinct wavy lines in the fore wing and one wavy distinct line in the hind wing. It has a wing span of 15mm. Eggs are laid singly or in groups arranged in longitudinal rows on the undersurface of the leaves which are scaly white in color. Fecundity is about 56 eggs. Incubation period is 4‚Äì8 days. We find 5‚Äì6 larval instars, larval period is about 22‚Äì23 days. It pupates with in the infested leaf fold for a period of 6‚Äì7 days. The fully grown caterpillar is green in color and is 16.5mm long. The total life cycle completed in about 5 weeks. All the stages of the crop is attacked by this pest. On hatching the newly hatched caterpillar cut the leaf edges and folds the leaf. When young seedlings are attacked it folds 3‚Äì4 adjacent plant leaves and scrapes the green matter so that the infested leaves appear white. A single caterpillar damages several leaves. The attacked plants dry up and it reduces the vigour of the plant. Ultimately the yield gets reduced. The yield loss may vary up to 10‚Äì50 per cent. It is more problematic at boot leaf stage.  Feature Description  Rice leafroller's egg is close to elliptic , flat shape, about 1 mm long, the first birth is milky white, then become yellow- brown, there will be a black spot before hatching. Larva has 5 instars generally, the larva body length of mature stage is about 15-18 mm. Larva has a brown head, the thorax and abdomen were green at first, then become yellowish-green, and were reddish brown when they were mature. There were two spiral-shaped black lines at the posterior margin of the tergum of the front thorax and 8 distinct small black circles at the tergum of the middle and posterior thorax, among which there were six leading edges and two trailing edges. Pupa, about 9 mm long, abdominal 5th to 7th segment near the leading edge with 1 line of dark brown fine, tail tip, with 8 barbed, pupa long with white thin cocoon. The adult is 7-9 mm long approximately, the wingspan is about 13-18 mm, show flaxen, proala has 3 brown transverse belt, among a relatively coarse short. The central part of the leading edge of the male moth's proala has a shining and concave eyespot, while the female moth's proala has no eyespot.  Pest Impact  Rice leafroller is harmful at the stage of larva. A single larva can consume approximately 25 square centimetre of leaf tissue, constituting less than 40% of a normal leaf of rice. Generally, the 1st-instar larva crawled into the heart leaf or the leaf sheath nearby, and the 2nd-instar larva began to spin silk at the leaf tip, and then began to turn into a small insect bud after the 3rd-instar. The food intake at 4th and 5th instar, which accounting for more than 90% of the total food intake of the larva. Although, there are some differences between different generations. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the most important staple food for more than half of the world population including India. It is grown on an estimated 41.85 million hectares in India with a production of 102 million tonnes. Insect pests inflict an average of 21%‚Äì51% yield loss in rice, which leads to one of the major reasons for poorer crop productivity in India. The leaf folder infestation may cause more than 50% of leaf damage with significant yield losses.  Methods of pest control = Cultural Control  Reform the tillage system and cultivation system, rational fertilization, avoid the early growth of rice, late ripening. Also, the damage of rice leaf roller could be reduced by avoiding early, middle and late rice mixed cropping. It is also possible to reduce the damage of pests through variety layout, setting up trapping and killing fields and reducing application area. It is also possible to harvest early rice according to the growth rate of the leaf roller, and then kill some larvae and pupae in deep water, so as to reduce the birth rate of the next generation.  Physical and Mechanical Control  Because rice leaf roller has phototaxis, it has a strong tendency to metal halogen lamp, and farmers can use light to lure and kill pests. Lure insect lamp has the advantage of quick, effective, and simple operation. It rarely requires medicament, and does not cause environmental pollution.  Biological Control  Application of chemical pesticide results in drag resistance and re- occurrence of the pests, and also kills natural enemy of the pests. However, natural enemies can effectively control the pest. It is estimated that there are more than 130 natural enemies of rice leaf roller. Therefore, the protection and utilization of natural enemies is very important to improve the sustainability of rice pest management.  Chemical Control  The selection of pesticides should be based on biological pesticide bacillus thuringiensis, select some high efficiency, low toxicity pesticides. According to different generations, the use of pesticides should be reasonably arranged and used alternately to prevent the resistance of rice leaf roller.

Guzzardi's support of Folmer became a campaign issue when Brightbill accused the two of running a \\"stealth Democrat campaign\\", because of Folmer's past Democratic voter registration and Guzzardi's past support of Democratic candidates. Brightbill noted that Guzzardi had donated financially to Ed Rendell, John F. Street, Bob Casey, Jr. in the past. Guzzardi told the Intelligencer Journal that Folmer's challenge to Brightbill was \\"viable now ...because of the pay-jacking and because of people like me. I just happen to be one of those guys who happens to have a little bit of money, and is interested in good government.\\" In the May 2006 primary election, Folmer defeated Brightbill in one of the largest upsets in Pennsylvania electoral history. John Eichelberger In October 2005, Guzzardi sponsored two public opinion polls in the 30th senatorial district to gauge the damage that the pay raise had done to longtime Republican Senator Robert Jubelirer. The unflattering poll results showed Jubelirer's weakness and caused reporter Dimitri Vassilaros to call Guzzardi \\"Jubelirer's worst nightmare\\" and attracted potential candidates to a race that had seemed un-winnable. Guzzardi became a strong financial supporter of John Eichelberger, who successfully challenged Jubelirer in the Republican primary. Unseating John Perzel Because Perzel occupied an invincible seat, a direct challenger was not feasible. Instead, Guzzardi set out to unseat John Perzel from his Speakership by funding State House candidates of both parties that would refuse to vote for him in the Speaker election. He spent over $100,000 of his own money in this effort. Perzel's staff claimed this effort was illegal and threatened to have the Pennsylvania Attorney General investigate Guzzardi. Following the election, Guzzardi and his newly elected allies hoped to split enough Republican votes for an alternative reform-minded candidate to deny Perzel the speakership and to elect Bill DeWeese, who would have to deal with a \\"reform wing\\" for him to deal with. The plan worked, denying the speakership to Perzel when six Republicans and the entire Democratic caucus voted for Republican Dennis M. O'Brien once it became clear that neither Perzel nor DeWeese had enough votes to win the speakership. O'Brien adopted several of the \\"reform Republicans'\\" proposals, including major changes in open records, leading to a new open records law in Pennsylvania. Guzzardi was invited to testify before the Speaker's Commission of Reform. 2014 Pennsylvania gubernatorial race On March 10, 2014, it was announced that Guzzardi had acquired enough signatures on nominating petitions to face Pennsylvania governor Tom Corbett in the May 20 Republican primary.\\"PA Politics webpage with announcement that Guzzardi will appear on the ballot\\", politicspa.com; retrieved 2014-03-13. However, Guzzardi failed to file a statement of financial interests as required by law, after being told by an employee of the State Department that it was unnecessary. Four Republicans, backed by the state Republican Party, sued to have him removed from the ballot. The case reached the state Supreme Court which ordered that Guzzardi's name be struck from the ballot.

Early life Anne Pellew was born in Haworth, Yorkshire. She attended The Abbey School, Reading, and then went to St Hugh's College, Oxford, where, only the second woman to read Engineering Sciences at Oxford University, she was awarded the Edgell Shepee Scholarship and graduated with a First in 1936.Journal of the Society of Oxford University Engineers, Autumn 2001. She also won a hockey Blue and squash 'Half Blue'. RAE Farnborough She did research work under Professor Richard Southwell at the university's engineering laboratory. Together they wrote one of the early theoretical papers on Rayleigh-Benard convection. At the outbreak of the Second World War she applied to join the Air Transport Auxiliary as a ferry pilot, but her engineering expertise precluded this and in 1940 she was employed by the Ministry of Supply, joining what became the Structures and Mechanical Department at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough, Hampshire, as a scientific assistant Her early work concentrated on flutter problems and on the measurement of the loads imposed on aircraft structures during flight. Other wartime tasks included the development of windscreen wipers for bombers and the double windscreen enclosing a supply of warm air to improve visibility. During this time she made test flights in many types of military aircraft from Tiger Moths to Hawker Typhoons & Gloster Meteors. In the late 1940s she was the first flight-test observer (FTO) in the UK to use strain gauges in an aircraft in flight. In 1953 she became a Principal Scientific Officer. During the investigation in 1954 into the crashes of the early de Havilland Comet jet airliners, she made many flights as an FTO in unpressurised Comets, sometimes up to 40,000 feet. It was known that the aircraft had broken up in flight while flying above 25,000 ft. In her own words \\"We flew about waiting for the windows to blow out.\\" The following year Burns was awarded the Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air in recognition of her bravery and contribution to the investigation. In 1958 she was also awarded the R.P. Alston Medal by the Royal Aeronautical Society for this work. She became an expert on clear-air turbulence due to \\"wind-shear\\", caused by different air movement (wind) at altitudes close to each other, such as at the edge of a high-level \\"jet stream\\".Journal of American Meteorological Society (with Elmar R. Reiter) vol. 23, March 1966. Some of her research into turbulent air was conducted in a Fournier RF-4. In 1963 she was awarded a second Queen's Commendation, this time for her flights in an English Electric Canberra carrying out low- and high-level-gust research. Some of the low level flights were carried out in high temperatures in Libya from the RAF Stations at El Adem near Tobruk and RAF Idris near Tripoli. The Royal Aeronautical Society awarded her its Silver Medal for Aeronautics in 1966, and in 1968, when she was working on clear-air turbulence, flying as an observer in several countries, she was presented with the Whitney Straight Award for her services to aeronautical research and flying. She retired from the RAE in 1976 after accumulating 1,500 hours of flight time as an observer. She met her husband Denis Burns at the RAE and they married in 1947. Gliding Although she had flown military assault gliders during the war, Anne Burns took up gliding as a sport in 1954 winning awards and establishing both national and international records. On her first cross-country flight, from Lasham, Hampshire in an Eon Olympia she reached RAF Ternhill, Shropshire in 4hr 55min breaking the British women's distance record. In December 1956, she flew a Slingsby Skylark 3b following a bungee launch to setting new women's British national and UK absolute altitude and gain-of-height records. Again flying a Skylark 3, she became the first woman to cross the English Channel in a glider in 1957. By 1961 she held 10 of the 11 UK women's records including the current altitude record of . In breaking the altitude record in South Africa she had entered the base of a cumulonimbus cloud at about 6,000 ft above ground. On the way up, there were electrical discharges to the pilot's knees from various metal parts of the aircraft. At about 34,000 ft there was a nearby major strike which discharged itself violently through the left wing. A small panel from the wing was blown away. Anne was temporarily confused by this shock but, coming-to more or less instantaneously, she decided it was time to get out of the cloud and descend. In 1962, Denis and Anne Burns were jointly awarded the Royal Aero Club's Britannia Trophy for their gliding achievements. In 1963 she claimed the women's world record for speed over a 500 km triangular course of 103.33 km/h. In 1966 she became British Gliding Champion, the first woman to hold the title. She received many other awards for gliding achievements including the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale Lilienthal Gliding Medal in 1966. In 1977 her glider was hit by a bird and damaged. She bailed out but became tangled in the shrouds, nevertheless escaping with only an injured ankle by landing in a sycamore tree. She thus became the first woman since the 1930s to become a member of Irvin's Caterpillar Club and aged 62, she was also the oldest person ever to join this club. She then gave up gliding and took up fly fishing and snooker, again winning awards in both sports.

Distribution It is endemic to California, where its distribution is scattered around the North Coast Ranges through the San Joaquin Valley and a section of the Sierra Nevada foothills. It grows in moist habitat in open areas, such as vernal pools and meadows, sometimes carpeting an open area with its tiny pink blooms. Description Diplacus angustatus is a petite annual herb growing in ground-level tufts with hair-thin stems barely a centimeter tall. Its herbage is green to reddish in color, the paired linear leaves spreading about 1 to 3 centimeters long. The tubular base of the flower is surrounded by a hairy greenish to red calyx of sepals. The flower corolla is pale to bright pink to reddish-purple with one or more large purple spots, and sometimes yellow markings, in the throat. The trumpet-like corolla may be several centimeters long, much longer than the stem on which it is borne. Research suggests that the population size of this wildflower is positively affected by disturbance of the soil it grows in, especially by the activity of pocket gophers; plants growing on disturbed soil have bigger flowers, fewer plant competitors, and more pollen on their stigmas from greater numbers of neighboring D. angustatus.

It stands on a site in Hayes Lane, to the south of Bromley, and in the parish of Bromley St Mark. It is named after the River Ravensbourne, which runs nearby. History=Grammar school The school was opened in 1911 as the Bromley County Grammar Schools for Boys and Girls, on two sites: Hayes Lane (boys) and Nightingale Lane (girls).http://www.ravensbourne.info The Hayes Lane site was officially opened on 18 October 1911. They were later renamed Bromley Grammar Schools. The buildings in Hayes Lane were considerably extended in 1933, using the original architect and keeping to the original neo-Georgian design. The new buildings comprised the Great Hall (connected to the original building by an open cloister) the science block, and the dining hall and gymnasium on either side of the hall. The new buildings were officially opened on 30 November 1934. Many of the School's early buildings are recognised as being of historic interest and are Grade II listed. The schools were controlled by Kent Education Committee until 1965. The girls' school had around 700 girls in the mid-1960s. Comprehensive In the late 1960s, following the then government's drive to phase out selective education, the Bromley Grammar Schools were merged with the nearby Raglan Road secondary modern school, to form the new Ravensbourne Schools, still on the two separate sites for boys and girls. The girls' school became comprehensive by degrees; the intake of 11-year-olds in September 1974 was the first non-selective one. Closure of separate sex schools In 1988 the Education Authority decided that the two separate single sex schools should be amalgamated into one new co-educational comprehensive school. The girls' school site in Nightingale Lane was closed in July 1989 and a programme of building works was embarked upon in order to make the boys' school suitable for its new co-educational role. The new co-educational Ravensbourne School opened at the Hayes Lane site in September 1989. Fraud In 1995 governors failed to properly check the CV of the school bursar who claimed to be a qualified accountant. In 2005 \\"massive deficits\\" in the schools' accounts were discovered and the bursar was found to have stolen money from the school using blank cheques signed by the headteacher. New sixth form building In 2003, with over subscription in Years 7 to 11 and an expanding sixth form called the Post 16 centre, yet more building work was undertaken. A new dedicated sixth form block was created, the drama studios expanded and the War Memorial Library refurbished in the original style. A new Lower School Library was installed in what was, in 1911, the dining hall for the original 79 boys. Admissions controversy In October 2009 the school was found to have \\"significant faults\\" with its appeals procedures when a government ombudsman found that members of its admissions panel were not properly trained and the clerk's recording of the appeal was \\"inadequate.\\"Local Government Ombudsman Academy On 1 April 2011, Ravensbourne School transferred to academy status. This allowed the school to manage its own finances. ESFA Financial Mismanagement Report (2018) A report released on 7 November 2018 alongside a DfE Financial Notice to Improve uncovers financial mismanagement relating to how the Ravensbourne School head teacher and Education for the 21st Century academy trust (E21C) CEO was paid for his duties as CEO. The trust failed to 'fully declare related party transactions, meet employee tax liabilities and seek prior ESFA approval of a novel, contentious and repercussive transaction'. The trust paid its CEO excessively without justification through a means against legislation IR35, improperly documented these payments and failed to pay any tax on the total of ¬£145,006.00 paid to the CEO for duties as CEO between 2014 and May 2018. The Ravensbourne head teacher, Mr Paul Murphy, was suspended as head teacher on 13 November 2018 after Bob Neill Conservative MP for Bromley and Chislehurst raised concerns in the House of Commons that he had been allowed to remain in post as headteacher despite his misconduct as CEO of the E21C trust. In January 2019, Paul Murphy resigned from his position of headteacher at the school. He was replaced by Mark O‚ÄôShaughnessy. Ofsted Inspections Ofsted made a report in October 2014.http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection- report/provider/ELS/136540 The school received an 'outstanding' from Ofsted in 2006‚Äì2007. This was downgraded to 'good' in 2009‚Äì2010. The inspector at that time commented in a letter to the students, \\"We judged the school to be good.

Its drydocks range in capacity from vessels of 100 tons displacement to 22,000 tons displacement. The firm was founded in 1946. Coast Guard vessels The United States Coast Guard has called upon Bollinger Shipyards to build many of its patrol vessels. Marine Protector cutters Marine Protector showing its stern launching ramp with transom raised. Bollinger secured the contract to build approximately fifty Marine Protector cutters. These vessels were staffed by a crew of 10. Uniquely for Coast Guard vessels of this size they were designed to be capable of being crewed by crews of mixed sex. These high speed vessels were lightly armed, mounting just two Browning M2 fifty caliber machine guns. But they were equipped with a stern launching ramp, capable of launching and retrieving a high speed pursuit boat while the cutter was still in motion. The launch and retrieval of the pursuit boat required just one sailor to remain on deck. Over 70 vessels were constructed, before the production line was shut down, with 4 being built for other nations, and 4 being built for the United States Navy, although those vessels are manned and operated by the Coast Guard. Island Class cutters Bollinger originally built 49 Island class cutters, so called because each cutter was named after an Island. These vessels were staffed by a crew of 18, and their primary armament was a 25 mm autocannon. Bollinger secured a contract to refit eight of the Island Class cutters, adding thirteen feet to their stern, so they too could launch and retrieve a pursuit boat from a rear launching ramp. The refit also included replacing the original deckhouse and refitting the crew accommodation so they could carry a mixed gender crew of 18. The conversion added 15 tons to each vessel. All of the eight refitted Island class cutters' hulls would crack when driven at high speed in a heavy seas, and proved to be so unseaworthy that they were all withdrawn from service, forcing the scrapping of the conversion program. As a result, in August 2011, the US government sued Bollinger over the failed modifications, alleging that the company made false statements about the hull strength that would result from its extensions to the patrol boats.Laster, Jill, \\"Shipbuilder sued over failed extension of 110s\\", Military Times, 17 August 2011. The suit was dismissed. First Sentinel-class Fast Response Cutter (FRC), USCGC Sentinel Class cutters On September 26, 2008, Bollinger was awarded US$88 million to build the prototype of the Sentinel-class fast- response cutters. In 2008, Bollinger secured a contract to build the first group of 24 to 34 cutters. On 5 May 2016 U.S. Coast Guard signed a new contract with Bollinger to build 26 additional vessels, bringing the total on order to 58 at a cost of almost $3.8 billion.\\"U.S. Coast Guard has signed a new contract with Bollinger Shipyards\\" A news release said that the new ships will replace ones that Bollinger built more than 30 years previously. The 240 ton vessels are staffed by a mixed-sex crew of 22, and are armed with a remote-operated Mk 38 Mod 2 25 mm autocannon and four .50 caliber crew-served Browning M2 machine guns. These vessels can also stern launch and retrieve a high speed pursuit boat, without coming to a stop. They were designed for missions of five days. The first three vessels were launched in 2011, and as of mid-2017 23 had entered service, with deliveries occurring every 73 days. Polar class icebreakers Bollinger was one of five contractors which bid to build new heavy polar icebreakers for the United States Coast Guard. The five bidders were each awarded a $20 million contract for development work. Bollinger announced that, if it were the winning bidder, it would have built the icebreakers in its Tampa, Florida shipyard, which it predicted would have employed 1,000 workers for ten years. However, the vessels were awarded to VT Halter Marine. United States Navy vessels=Cyclone-class patrol ships USS Chinook (PC-9) -- like the Coast Guard vessels the Cyclone-class vessels deploy and retrieve their pursuit boat via a stern launching ramp. Bollinger built 14 Cyclone-class patrol ships for the U.S. Navy between 1993 and 2000. The ships are 179 feet (55 m) long and carry a crew of 28 (4 officers, 24 enlisted). Their mission is coastal patrol and interdiction surveillance. These ships can also provide full mission support for Navy SEALs and other special operations forces. As of 2010, four of these vessels have been decommissioned in the Navy. Three had been loaned to the Coast Guard to fill patrol hours but have been returned to the USN as of October 2011.http://www.navytimes.com/article/20110815/NEWS/108150329/CG- returns-3-coastal-patrol-boats-Navy one vessel, PC-1, was transferred to the Philippine Navy, as an excess defense article. As of 2015, ten of the US Navy's thirteen Cyclone-class patrol ships were deployed to the Persian Gulf to deal with a potential conflict with Iran. The remaining three ships of the class are slated to be transferred to Naval Station Mayport in Florida to work primarily with drug interdiction work with U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command (USNAVSO) / U.S. Fourth Fleet.

It is located to the south of the city centre and has two distinct areas: Old Moulsham and Moulsham Lodge. History Moulsham is approximately midway between Colchester and London and is located on the south side of the River Chelmer, straddling the Roman road between the two cities. Moulsham Street follows the line of the former Roman road and it is a designated Conservation Area. Roman ‚Äì early Moulsham The fertile Chelmer Valley has been a focus for human activities from the beginning of the Neolithic period (c.4000BC), with ceramics of this period having been found during excavation in the Moulsham Street area. These excavations also revealed evidence for settlement through the Bronze Age and late Iron Age. Significant habitation at Moulsham can be traced back to Roman times, preceding the origins of Chelmsford itself. Moulsham Street is perhaps the oldest street in the city. Soon after the rebellion of Boudicca in AD60, a small Roman military fort was built on the southern banks of the River Can near an important road bridge crossing midway between Colchester and London. A civilian town soon grew up around the fort and received the name Caesaromagus (Caesar's Market Place). The present Moulsham Street follows the line of the main thoroughfare through the Roman town southwards to London. Long after the fort had gone, the Romans maintained an official presence in Moulsham, in the form of a grand mansion (located in the vicinity of what is now Roman Road), which served as a post office, civic centre and hotel. Roman occupation of Moulsham centred on the area defined by what are now Moulsham Street/Hall Street/Hamlet Road and Mildmay Road. The town was defended by substantial banks and ditches and contained public baths and a temple. The Roman town was abandoned in the 5th Century AD. The nearest centres of population at this time would have been small Saxon farmsteads to the north of what is now Chelmsford. Following the collapse of the Roman wooden bridge across the River Can, the main route between Colchester and London was diverted to a crossing point at Widford several miles west of Moulsham. Norman ‚Äì the birth of Chelmsford After the Norman Conquest of AD1066 Moulsham was owned by the Abbot of Westminster; the land on the Chelmsford side of the River Can was owned by the Bishop of London. Records at this time refer to a place named Ceolmaer‚Äôs Ford on the northern banks of the Can. Around AD1100 a new bridge was constructed across the River Can restoring the route of the old Roman road along what is now Moulsham Street. In AD 1199 Chelmsford was formally founded by the Bishop of London, William of Sainte-M√®re-√âglise when he was granted the right to hold a weekly market at ‚ÄòChelmersford‚Äô around which a new town was formed. In the years that followed Moulsham remained a distinct hamlet separate from Chelmsford. Rivalry between the Abbot of Westminster and the Bishop of London resulted in the growth of Chelmsford into a prosperous trading centre, while Moulsham became the poor relation, accommodating the destitute and socially unacceptable members of the community, at one time containing a leper colony, much later a gaol and workhouse. Tudor ‚Äì Moulsham hamlet A Dominican friary was built at the north end of Moulsham (in the vicinity of what is now Friar‚Äôs Walk) between 1221 and 1277, and this survived until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538 when the friary and later the manor of Moulsham were purchased by the Mildmay family. In 1563 the same family also acquired the manor of Chelmsford from Queen Elizabeth I, resulting in Moulsham and Chelmsford being owned by the same lord. The Mildmay family lived at Moulsham Hall, a large mansion in grounds to the south of what was to become Old Moulsham on land that is now a residential neighbourhood known as Moulsham Lodge. The Mildmay family effectively controlled Chelmsford for almost 300 years. Moulsham developed into a modest village and a number of the buildings that remain still show their mediaeval origin. The Walker map of Moulsham hamlet in 1591 shows a ribbon of timber-framed houses extending from the Can to a field entrance in the vicinity of what is now Anchor Street. Victorian ‚Äì Industry, commerce and social activity Chelmsford has a large number of pubs, many of which are relatively old with their roots in the coaching days. The number of pubs in and around Moulsham Street was boosted in the nineteenth century, no doubt in response to the presence of soldiers in the town (the barracks occupying the site of the old friary at the town end of Moulsham Street) and the continued growth of Chelmsford reflecting the town‚Äôs increasing importance as a market and retail centre. Moulsham Street still supports many pubs. Judge Tindal is perhaps Moulsham Street‚Äôs most famous son. Tindal was a renowned judge who became Lord Chief Justice in 1829 and is now remembered with a bronze statue in Tindal Square at the top of Chelmsford High Street. He was born at 199 Moulsham Street in 1776. The stone bridge linking Chelmsford High Street and Moulsham Street was built in 1787, replacing an earlier bridge and is one of the city's most enduring landmarks. It was constructed by County Surveyor John Johnson, also responsible for the city's landmark ‚ÄòShire Hall‚Äô. Moulsham gained its own church in 1837 when St John‚Äôs was constructed opposite Anchor Street on the south side of Moulsham Street at a cost of ¬£2,500. The square tower, a local landmark, was added in 1883. In 1839 the Mildmay estate and adjoining land to the south became available for purchase, which enabled the rapid and significant expansion of Chelmsford. At this time a group of local enterprising (non-conformist) businessmen surreptitiously acquired land in several lots, and were thus able to form what is now New London Road, disposing of plots with strict covenants to realise a grand design: ‚Äòa handsome road of highly ornamental mansions‚Äô as an elegant approach to Chelmsford. Whilst it followed a parallel alignment, New London Road was not a ‚Äòby-pass‚Äô of Moulsham Street in the modern sense of the word; rather it was constructed as an alternative route with its new residences enabling merchandisers to move ‚Äòout of town‚Äô. Moulsham was effectively swallowed by Chelmsford during Victorian expansion of the town. The influx of people into the area led to a school being constructed next to St John‚Äôs Church in 1840, which was extended in 1885. Previously, the British School close to the site of the former friary was one of only two or three schools in the town. During the mid-nineteenth century several pockets of industry, focused on manufacturing, were established in and around Moulsham Street. This included Marconi‚Äôs and Crompton‚Äôs ‚Äì two of Chelmsford‚Äôs ‚Äòbig three‚Äô manufacturers responsible for giving the town an international reputation. In 1878 Colonel REB Crompton established the country‚Äôs first electrical engineering works at his Arc Works in Anchor Street, a site that had been in industrial use principally as an iron works since 1833. Crompton was a pioneer of electric lighting schemes, ‚ÄòDevon House‚Äô in Anchor Street was constructed in 1890 as a power station to provide electric lighting for Chelmsford‚Äôs main streets. In 1895 Crompton‚Äôs relocated to Writtle Road after a fire. The vacant factory was occupied in 1902 by Clarkson‚Äôs, who made steam omnibuses at the site until 1917 and branched out into bus operating as ‚ÄòNational‚Äô converting to petrol buses in 1920 ‚Äì the name surviving in the town and beyond until the 1990s. In 1898, Guglielmo Marconi set up the world's first radio factory in Hall Street in a furniture shop, itself a converted Silk Mill adjacent to water board premises. Radio equipment was manufactured and shipped around the world from an expanding operation in Hall Street until Marconi‚Äôs moved to new premises in New Street, Chelmsford in 1912. Marconi‚Äôs retained a presence in Chelmsford until the late 1990s, employing several thousand local people in its heyday. Other industries operating in the late nineteenth century in and around Moulsham Street included rope and tent makers (Godfreys established 1828, wound up 1985), brickworks, ironworks, furniture manufacturing and builder‚Äôs yard/offices. By the late nineteenth century Moulsham Street had also become a busy shopping street, lined with cycle shops, butchers, newsagents, tailors, grocers, animal feed merchants, a confectioner, a pharmacist, cafes and taverns. Its relative narrowness, domestic scale and varied architecture gave the street an intimate ‚Äòvillage‚Äô feel. This and the mixed use function of the street persist to the present day whilst heavy industries have all but gone away. Commercial & Retail The northern end of Moulsham Street consists of many small retail outlets which are often independently run and are represented by the Moulsham Traders Association. There are many offices along New London Road, often housing professionals, such as real estate agents, renewable energy companies, solicitors and accountants. Moulsham Lodge has a shopping parade of a dozen units catering for needs of the immediate estate and the adjoining area of Tile Kiln, also containing a small parade of five shops and a pub, which lies between Moulsham Lodge and Galleywood. Education There are several schools and colleges within Moulsham. These include: Moulsham Infant School, Oaklands Infant School, Moulsham Junior School, St Anne's Preparatory School, St Philip's Priory School, St. Cedd's Primary School, Our Lady Immaculate RC Primary School,http://www.ourladyimmaculate.essex.sch.uk/ Moulsham High School and Chelmsford College. Sport, Leisure & Recreation Sports facilities include: the Grove Tennis Club, the privately owned Spring Health Leisure Club and the council run Dovedale Leisure Centre. There is Oaklands Park, with of grounds containing the Chelmsford Museum. Places of Worship Many Christian denominations are represented within Moulsham. Churches include the Methodist, Church of England St John the Evangelist and St Luke's; the United Reformed Church Christ Church, the Roman Catholic Our Lady Immaculate and Elim. Moulsham's memorial to those who died during the First World War is located at the front of St John's Church. There is also a mosque at the junction with New London Road. Notable Inhabitants and people connected to the area Nicholas Conyngham Tindal, David Rossdale, Francesco Sleter, Walter Mildmay, Antonio Bonvisi, John Rogers (c. 1570‚Äì1636), Giacomo Leoni, Hilda Grieve and Alice Barnham.

Nicolini wrote for the progressive periodical Il Conciliatore, composed poetry, and published prose as well. He translated much of Lord Byron's poetry into Italian and wrote one of the earliest biographies of Byron. He was born in Brescia, the son of merchant, and after studying philosophy there, went on to study law at the University of Bologna, where he graduated in 1807. He preferred teaching to law, however, and after a few years as a lawyer took up an appointment as a professor in the Brescia Ginnasio. For a brief period he was also a professor of history at the principal Liceo in Verona. When his political activities cost him his teaching job in 1821, writing became his main profession. He lived the rest of his life in Brescia, where he married in 1840 and became the father of seven children. Giuseppe Nicolini died in the cholera epidemic that struck the city in 1855.

Early life Grace was born on June 9, 1872 in Great Neck, New York. He was the son of businessman and two time mayor of New York City, William Russell Grace. Grace graduated from Columbia University. Career A polo player, in 1911 Grace purchased a estate in the Lakeville district of Long Island from Almeric H. Paget, son-in-law of William Collins Whitney. He would acquire a stable of polo ponies as well as Thoroughbreds used in Point to point steeplechase events. A devout Roman Catholic, Joseph Grace was a member of the international organization the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, a Catholic organization that aids the sick and poor through the establishment of hospitals and clinics around the world. He also served as president of Grace Institute, a charity created in 1897 by his father and his uncle, Michael Grace, that provided tuition-free education and training in business and administrative skills to economically disadvantaged women. Business career On the death of his father, William R. Grace in 1904, Edward Eyre, the company secretary and a director, was appointed president of W. R. Grace and Company. In 1907, Eyre was made company chairman and Joseph Grace became president. In 1929, Joseph Grace took over as chairman when Edward Eyre retired and Joseph's friend from his college days, D. Stewart Iglehart, was appointed president. The W. R. Grace company's business centered on operations in Peru and surrounding South American countries. To enhance that, in 1914 Grace established Grace National Bank, a New York City private bank that concentrated on business done in South America. The extent of the W.R. Grace company's trade was such that its founders had formed Grace Shipping Company and in 1929 Joseph Grace concluded a partnership with Pan American World Airways to establish Pan American-Grace Airways, the first air carrier to serve the West Coast of South America. In 1945, Grace suffered a debilitating stroke and in 1946 both he and D. Stewart Iglehart retired. His son, Joseph Peter Grace Jr., took over management of the company. Personal life In 1908, he married Janet MacDonald, the daughter of Charles B. Macdonald, a major figure in early American golf who built the first 18-hole course in the United States. Together, they were the parents of five children: * Nora Grace (1910‚Äì1935) * Joseph Peter Grace Jr. (1913‚Äì1995), who married Margaret Fennelly in 1941 and became the longest serving CEO of a public company. * Michael Paul Grace II (1918-1995) * Janet Maureen Grace (1925-2006) * Charles MacDonald Grace (1926-2013) His wife died on December 31, 1937 at age fifty-three. Joseph Grace died of a stroke at his home in Great Neck, New York on July 15, 1950.

It is different from most currencies, including the American currency or British currency upon which it is based, in that it is smaller, one-sided, and does not have different imagery for each denomination. It is not legal tender and has no monetary value in any jurisdictions. Format Many variations of Monopoly exist, with many types of money representing various currencies. In the more \\"standard\\" versions of the game, Monopoly money consists entirely of notes. Monopoly notes come in the following colors: * $1 - White * $5 - Pink * $10 - Yellow (classic) or blue (recent editions) * $20 - Green * $50 - Blue (classic) or purple (recent editions) * $100 - Beige or red (early editions) * $500 - Gold (classic) or orange (recent editions) * $1,000 (available only in Monopoly: The Mega Edition) - Purple (original) or yellow (recent editions) The modern Monopoly game has its Monopoly money denominated in $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $500, and (in some editions) $1,000, with all but the last two paralleling the denominations in circulation in the United States. (The U.S. $500 bill and U.S. $1000 bill were withdrawn in 1969). Monopoly does not include a two- dollar bill; however, Monopoly Junior did include the two in addition to three and four denominations (which do not exist in U.S. currency) for many years. (Monopoly Junior later simplified its system to include only one-dollar bills.) Fans have designed unofficial $1,000 Monopoly bills for longer games and made them available online. Special editions and spinoffs (e.g. Monopoly Deal) may use larger denominations. More recent Monopoly games use a Monopoly- specific currency symbol of a double struck-through capital letter M, similar to the Won sign (‚Ç©) flipped upside-down. As a phrase \\"Monopoly money\\" is also a derisive term used in multiple senses. The most common is by countries that have traditionally had monochromatic currency banknotes (such as the United States) to refer to countries that have colorful banknotes (such as Canada). This has been used in places such as the \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic song \\"Canadian Idiot\\". It can also be used as a derisive term to refer to money not really worth anything, or at least not being used as if it is worth anything.

Nygma has been a member of Los Vatos Locos, a Kiss look-alike group of wrestlers, with whom he held the Mexican National At√≥micos Championship. Nygma was also a part of the Cibern√©tico led group Los Bizarros. Currently, he is part of a team called Los Ex√≥ticos, a group of Exotico, or transvestite wrestlers. Currently Nygma is a part. Nygma's real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. Professional wrestling career The wrestler who later became known as Nygma made his debut in 1992 under the ring name Galaxi after training under Rodolfo Ruiz, Ra√∫l Reyes and Bestia Negra. He was signed by Promo Azteca shortly after the group was formed and his ring persona was changed to \\"Nygma\\", inspired partly by the comic book character The Riddler whose name is \\"Edward Nygma\\". In 1996 Nygma moved from Promo Azteca to Asistencia Asesor√≠a y Administraci√≥n (AAA), initially working as a singles wrestler. On June 13, 1997, Nygma defeated El Salsero to win the Mexican National Welterweight Championship, the first wrestling championship of his career. Nygma only held the title for 42 days and lost it to El Torero in his first title defense. Los Vatos Locos In mid-1998 AAA owner Antonio Pe√±a put together a new group of wrestlers, a stable called Los Vatos Locos (Spanish for \\"the crazy guys\\") consisting of Nygma, Charly Manson, May Flowers and Picudo. After joining Los Vatos Locos Nygma changed his appearance slightly, adopting an outfit and a face paint/mask combo inspired by Kiss lead guitarist Ace Frehley's \\"Spaceman\\" look. Picudo changed his look to resemble Gene Simmons' \\"Demon\\" outfit as well. The team made their first pay-per-view appearance when they defeated Los Vipers (Histeria, Maniaco, Mosco de la Merced and Psicosis II) at the 1998 Verano de Escandalo. The Verano de Escandalo match was just the first encounter in a long storyline feud between the two groups that would last for several years. On February 14, 1999, Los Vatos Locos defeated Los Vipers to win the Mexican National At√≥micos Championship. The team successfully defended the championship against Los Vipers at the 1999 Rey de Reyes show. Los Vatos Locos reign with the At√≥micos title lasted only 63 days as they lost the championship to Los Junior At√≥micos (Blue Demon, Jr., La Parka, Jr., Mascara Sagrada, Jr. and Perro Aguayo, Jr.) on April 18, 1999. The Vatos Locos / Los Vipers feud continued through 1999 with the two teams wrestling to a double disqualification at Tripleman√≠a VII in June. Los Vatos Locos finally regained the At√≥micos title from Los Vipers at the 1999 Guerra de Titanes show. The group's second At√≥micos reign was only slightly longer than their first as they lost the title on April 15, 2000 to Los Vipers. In late 2000 Charly Manson broke away from Los Vatos Locos to join a newly formed group called The Black Family, in his place Los Vatos brought in Espiritu to replace him. In keeping with the \\"Kiss\\" theme set by Nygma and Picudo, Espiritu altered his appearance to look more like Paul Stanley's \\"Starchild\\" character. This combination of Los Vatos Locos (Nygma, Picudo, May Flowers, and Espiritu) did not last long, as May Flowers left the group in early 2001 to form his own Ex√≥ticos group. Los Vatos replaced May Flowers with Silver Cat, a ring persona patterned after Kiss drummer Peter Criss \\"the Catman\\" character, making Los Vatos Locos; the group even began carrying instruments to the ring and \\"perform\\". On November 23, 2001 the new incarnation of Los Vatos Locos defeated longtime rivals Los Vipers to win the Mexican National At√≥micos Championship once more. Los Vatos third title reign lasted for over a year, 374 days, before they lost the titles back to Los Vipers. After losing the At√≥micos title Los Vatos Locos featured less prominently on AAA shows, not making a single major show appearance after September 16, 2002, when they appeared at Verano de Escandalo (2002). In 2005 Espiritu left the group to join La Secta de Mesias, keeping a friendly relationship with his old group. Los Night Queens By mid-2007 both Picudo and Silver Cat began working a much lighter schedule, working more backstage than in the ring. This left Nygma in limbo with no direction. At the 2007 Antonio Pe√±a Memorial Show Nygma returned to action, siding with Ex√≥ticos Polvo de Estrellas, Jessy and Yuriko, forming a group called Los Night Queens. As a group, their first action was to attack Pimpinela Escarlata and Cassandro, starting a storyline with the other ex√≥ticos in AAA. Los Night Queens attempted to qualify for the 2008 Rey de Reyes twice but lost to Real Fuerza A√©rea (Aero Star, El √Ångel, Pegasso, and Rey Cometa) on February 23, 2008 and to Abismo Negro and Psicosis on March 5. Los Bizarros In mid-2009 Nygma left AAA and became part of Los Bizarros, a group led by Cibern√©tico who himself had left AAA, and consisted of Nygma (representing the homosexual lifestyle via his Ex√≥tico persona), Punket (representing the \\"Punk\\" lifestyle), Emo Extreme (Emo lifestyle) and Steel Rock (\\"Rocker\\" lifestyle). The team worked a couple of independent wrestling shows before Cibern√©tico returned to AAA. On July 3, 2009, Los Bizarros helped Cibern√©tico attack his rival Dr. Wagner, Jr.. Subsequently, Los Bizarros worked a match for AAA on August 30, 2009, but disappeared from AAA shortly thereafter. After fourteen months away from AAA, Nygma returned on October 31, 2010, forming a new version of Los Bizarros with Cibern√©tico, Amadeus, Escoria and Taboo. On November 22 Los Bizarros solidified their statuses as tweeners by attacking not only rudo stable La Sociedad, but also technico La Parka. On December 5, 2010, at Guerra de Titanes Charly Manson was revealed as the newest member of Los Bizarros, as he made a surprise jump from Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) back to AAA. Los Bizarros' lineup was completed on March 13, 2011, when La Sociedad member Billy Boy revealed himself as Cibern√©tico's mole and jumped to Los Bizarros, renaming himself Billy el Malo in the process. Los Night Queens reunion On August 19, 2011, Nygma reformed Los Night Queens with Pasi√≥n Cristal, Polvo de Estrellas and Yuriko, when the four attacked AAA Reina de Reinas Champion Pimpinela Escarlata, jealous over his recent success. Nygma's departure from Los Bizarros was never explained.

The company manufactures ready-to-assemble furniture and operates an e-commerce site in which sales are made direct to its customer base.  History  The company adapted an e-commerce model in 2000. Previously, the company founders had been designing seating products for public lobbies in the healthcare and educational markets. In 2004, The Cincinnati Post reported that ‚Äúthe company has constructed other furniture for four generation and some designs were used on the sets of TV shows ‚ÄúER‚Äù and ‚ÄúTouched by an Angel‚Äù.Joyce Rosencrans, The Cincinnati Post, October 30, 2004 In 2000, new product lines were created that were capable of being shipped in flat-packed containers, small enough to be handled by particularized parcel package services such as UPS or Fed-Ex ground. Home Reserve was recognized by UPS for its efforts in this science in their April 2005 Preferred Report.  Furniture line  This company sells sofas, sectionals, love seats, chairs and ottomans with built-in storage space and replacement fabrics.  Development of furniture e-commerce models  The furniture industry has produced several e-commerce models. Although rapid growth has often been a component of these attempts, there are inherent problems in a direct-to-consumer development, the logistics of shipping and returns being the primary obstacle to workable systems. To achieve efficient costs of transportation, ready-to-assemble (RTA) products have been developed. RTA methods as developed by Home Reserve have been chronicled in industry related media journals, such as Furniture Today.Gary Evans, \\"Home Reserve selling RTA sofas on Web site\\", Furniture Today, August 8, 2005 Primarily a logistics idea, the Home Reserve model is based on optimization and efficiency studies of the movement of materials via various country-wide transportation systems. The model was presented at the 2003 McCloskey business plan competition, at the Gigot Center for Entrepreneurial Studies on the University of Notre Dame campus. A booklet was published for this competition based on a fictitious communication between Professor Matthew Albert of the Institute for Management Development in Lausanne, Switzerland, and the protagonist for the idea of Home Reserve, an American businessman. The industry tried to port existing models into the internet age using conventional product lines and conventional transportation methods. Freight costs as a percentage of revenues became much higher than anticipated, and when product returns were factored into the cost mix, the financial equations became untenable. The furniture industry is not unique in its struggle to find a sustainable internet e-commerce model. Even the dominant players in the World Wide Web market space have found profitability difficult. Home Reserve, as a newer company emerging in the internet age itself, has been able to follow different assumptions and cost mechanisms in establishing a methodology of operation.  Product reviews  Country Almanac wrote: \\"Home Reserve's low cost furniture collection comes in ready-to- assemble pieces shipped in separate boxes (no heavier than 70 pounds), that fit easily through narrow doors. They even feature internal storage, making them ideal for apartments and other small spaces.\\"The Latest Ideas to Help Simplify Your Life\\" , Country Almanac Better Homes and Gardens Special Interest Publications listed Home Reserve as one of the new crop of ready-to- assemble furniture items that delivers instant style on a shoestring budget.\\"Some Assembly Required\\" , Better Homes and Gardens Special Interest Publications, winter 2005 Customer relations Home Reserve, LLC is a Better Business Bureau accredited business and currently holds an A+ ranking.http://www.bbb.org/northernindiana/business-reviews/furniture- manufacturers/home-reserve-in-fort-wayne-in-2024673 Company patents The company has five patents awarded for engineering advancements in the art of ready-to-assemble upholstered furniture: Patent #: US 6,267,446http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph- Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2;=HITOFF&d;=PALL&p;=1&u;=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm&r;=1&f;=G&l;=50&s1;=6,267,446.PN.&OS;=PN/6,267,446&RS;=PN/6,267,446 Patent #: US 6,568,058http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph- Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2;=HITOFF&d;=PALL&p;=1&u;=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm&r;=1&f;=G&l;=50&s1;=6,568,058.PN.&OS;=PN/6,568,058&RS;=PN/6,568,058 Patent #: US 6,981,747http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph- Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2;=HITOFF&d;=PALL&p;=1&u;=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm&r;=1&f;=G&l;=50&s1;=6,981,747.PN.&OS;=PN/6,981,747&RS;=PN/6,981,747 Patent #: US 7,044,557http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph- Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2;=HITOFF&d;=PALL&p;=1&u;=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm&r;=1&f;=G&l;=50&s1;=7,044,557.PN.&OS;=PN/7,044,557&RS;=PN/7,044,557 Patent #: US 7,523,989http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph- Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2;=HITOFF&d;=PALL&p;=1&u;=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm&r;=1&f;=G&l;=50&s1;=7,523,989.PN.&OS;=PN/7,523,989&RS;=PN/7,523,989 ReferencesExternal links * Home Reserve home page Category:Furniture companies of the United States ","title":"Home Reserve"},{"id":"24618244","text":"Clube Ferrovi√°rio de Nacala Velha is a Mozambican football club.

Overview  The original On the Ball was a half hour football round-up segment shown as part of the World of Sport Saturday afternoon sports programming on ITV, preceding the traditional Saturday afternoon 3 pm kick off time. Initially presented by Brian Moore, it was later hosted by Ian St John and Jimmy Greaves. When World of Sport was discontinued in 1985, On the Ball was replaced by Saint and Greavsie, a stand- alone lunchtime football show hosted by the same presenters. Saint and Greavsie ended in 1992 when Sky Sports gained the rights to broadcast Premier League football, although ITV lunchtime coverage of football continued with occasional Champions League shows. On the Ball was revived on ITV from the beginning of the 1998‚Äì99 season, presented by Gabby Logan, initially co- presented by Barry Venison. The show was extended to an hour in 2001, coinciding with ITV's capture of the Premier League highlights package from the BBC which also saw the launch of The Goal Rush Saturday afternoon results show and The Premiership Saturday evening show.

Its area is and its highest point is about above sea level. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 236. Early history Remains of a substantial Roman villa have been found just west of the B4100 main road. Hanwell village is Saxon in origin, on an ancient minor road linking the villages of Wroxton and Great Bourton. The road's Old English name of Hana's weg gave rise to the village's toponym. Hanwell has a reliable spring, so its toponym later changed from -weg to -welle. Manor Before the Norman conquest of England an Anglo-Saxon called Lewin or Leofwine held the manor of Hanwell, along with those of Chinnor and Cowley. Whereas the conquering Normans dispossessed many Saxon landowners after 1066, Leofwine still held Hanwell manor by the time the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086. The de Vernon family held the manors of Hanwell and Chinnor, and retained Hanwell until 1415 when Sir Richard de Vernon transferred the manor to Thomas Chaucer, Speaker of the House of Commons of England. After Chaucer's death in 1434 Hanwell passed to his widow Maud and then their daughter Alice de la Pole. Alice's second husband was William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and Hanwell remained with the Duchy of Suffolk until almost the end of the 15th century. In 1498 Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk conveyed the manor to William Cope, who was Cofferer to Henry VII. In 1611 James I made William's great-grandson Anthony Cope a baronet. Hanwell remained with the Cope baronets of Hanwell until the death of Sir John Cope, 5th Baronet in 1721. It then passed to another branch of the Cope family, Sir Jonathan Cope, 1st Baronet of Bruern. When Sir Charles Cope, 3rd Baronet died in 1781, Hanwell passed to one of his sisters, Catherine. In 1790 Catherine's daughter Arabella was married to John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset and received Hanwell from her mother. In 1825 Hanwell was inherited by the Duke and Duchess's younger daughter, Elizabeth Sackville-West, Countess De La Warr, wife of George Sackville-West, 5th Earl De La Warr. Hanwell manor has remained with the Earls De La Warr: in 1946 Herbrand Sackville, 9th Earl De La Warr passed the manor to his son Lord Buckhurst, the future William Sackville, 10th Earl De La Warr. Church and chapel=Church of England The earliest record of the Church of England parish church of Saint Peter is from 1154, but only the Norman font survives from this time. The north and south doorways are 13th century, the east window of the south aisle are late 13th century, and all are Early English Gothic. In the first half of the 14th century St. Peter's was almost entirely rebuilt in a Transitional style between Early English and Decorated Gothic, and north and south aisles and the Decorated Gothic bell tower were added. The arcades linking the aisles with the nave have capitals decorated with carved figuresOxfordshire Churches website: Hanwell St Peter : photographs of carved capitals and the chancel has a frieze of carved people and monsters. Both sets of carvings were made in about 1340 and are the work of a school of masons whose work can be seen also in the parish churches of Adderbury, Bloxham and Drayton. Around 1400 a Perpendicular Gothic clerestory was added to the nave. In the Tudor era new side windows were inserted in the north aisle. Monuments in St. Peter's include a 14th-century effigy of a woman in the south aisle and effigies of Sir Anthony Cope, 1st Baronet (died 1614) and his wife in the chancel. In 1776 the floor of the chancel was raised to accommodate a burial vault for the Cope family, but in the 19th century the floor was restored to its former level In 1671 Sir Anthony Cope, 4th Baronet had a turret clock made for St. Peter's by the noted clockmaker George Harris of Fritwell. It is at the west end of the nave below the bell tower. The bell tower has a ring of six bells. John Briant of Hertford cast the second, third, fourth and fifth bells in 1789 and the tenor bell in 1791. In 2008 White's of Appleton re-hung the bells and added a sixth bell, the Beecroft Bell which Whitechapel Bell Foundry had cast that year. Sir Anthony Cope, 1st Baronet (1550‚Äì1615) was a puritan, and in 1584 the Church of England excommunicated his choice of curate at Hanwell, Jonas Wheler for refusing to hold church services on Fridays and Saturdays. Instead therefore Sir Anthony presented John Dod, another puritan, who was accepted. Dod was a friend of the puritan divine Thomas Cartwight, who at Dod's invitation preached at Hanwell. Sir Anthony was MP for the Banbury constituency for most of the period 1571‚Äì1601. In 1587 he was jailed for introducing to the House of Commons a puritan prayer book and a bill for abrogating ecclesiastical law. John Dod was a hardworking and popular preacher who served as Hanwell for 20 years, but by 1607 the Church of England had deprived Dod of his living and Sir Anthony appointed Robert Harris to take over the curacy. During the English Civil War Royalist troops had expelled Harris from Hanwell by the end of 1642. In 1648 he was made a Doctor of Divinity and President of Trinity College, Oxford. Puritan influence at Hanwell was ended in 1658 with the appointment of a Royalist curate, George Ashwell, who was as pious, hardworking and scholarly as his predecessors. St Peter's is now a Grade I listed building. Its parish is now one of eight in the Ironstone Benefice. Methodist Hanwell had a Methodist congregation by 1822, which built its own chapel in the latter half of the 19th century. The chapel was still used for worship in 1965. Hanwell Castle Hanwell Castle Hanwell Castle was not a castle but a house with ornamental battlements, originally called Hanwell House or Hall. William Cope began building it in 1498, the year he had received the manor of Hanwell from the Duke of Suffolk. It is the earliest example of a brick building in north Oxfordshire. It was a large house with west, north and south ranges around a central quadrangle. Jennifer Sherwood and Nikolaus Pevsner contend that there was an east range but Mary Lobel et al. maintain that there was none. The house has fishponds fed by the village spring. The Cope family had links with Catherine Parr (1512‚Äì48), the sixth and last wife of Henry VIII. Sir Anthony Cope, 1st Baronet entertained James I at Hanwell House in 1605 and 1612, and at the castle Sir William Cope, 2nd Baronet entertained James I in 1616 and Charles I in 1637. Late in the 18th century most of Hanwell Castle was demolished. The western part of the south range was retained as a farmhouse, and in 1902 some restoration and extensions were made to the surviving building. It is now a Grade II* listed building. In 2015 renovation work at Tudor Cottage in the village revealed the broken remains of a stone relief of a Tudor coat of arms believed to have come from the castle. The relief is finely carved from clunch and is described as being of \\"national importance\\", but has not been dated with certainty as parts are missing. The cricket player George Berkeley lived at the castle until his death in 1955. Astronomical observatory Hanwell Community Observatory is in the castle grounds, which are a dark site for astronomy. The observatory was founded in 1992 and the grounds are open to the public at the observatory's annual open weekend every February. Note added 22.2.16 by Christopher Taylor, Director (and founder) of Hanwell Community Observatory: 1992 was the year that my own 12.5-inch reflector, the McIver Paton Telescope, was re-erected in the grounds at Hanwell, and serious astronomy began here. The Hanwell Community Observatory was begun on the same site in 1999, following a successful bid for a Royal Society Millennium Award for public outreach in astronomy the previous autumn. Social and economic history The Red Lion public house, currently called the Moon and Sixpence By the 13th century Hanwell had a watermill on the western edge of the parish, presumably on Sor Brook that forms the boundary with the adjoining parish of Horley. Before 1249 Sir Warin de Vernon granted the mill to the Augustinian canons of Canons Ashby Priory in Northamptonshire, who then rented or leased it out until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1536. The mill then became Crown property until it was sold in 1545. Hanwell rectory dates from at least the 16th century. There is a record of it being leased in 1549, at which time it had one or more dovecotes. When it was assessed for hearth tax it was a large house, second in Hanwell only to the manor house. It was reduced in size and the remainder rebuilt in 1843, but parts of the original house survive in the Victorian building. At the end of the 16th century Hanwell's crops included not only wheat, pease, oats and barley but also at least of woad. In 1645 during the English Civil War, Parliamentary troops were billeted in Hanwell for nine weeks and villagers petitioned the Warwickshire Committee of Accounts to pay for feeding them. Villagers farmed the parish on a two-field open field system until 1768, when Sir Charles Cope, 2nd Baronet bought out the rights of copyholders, life- and leaseholders and enclosed the common lands. The main road between Banbury and Warwick runs north ‚Äì south along a ridge in the western part of the parish. It was made into a turnpike in 1744 and ceased to be one in 1871. In the 1920s it was classified as part of the A41 road. After the completion of the M40 motorway in 1990 this part of the A41 was \\"detrunked\\" and reclassified as the B4100. Hanwell had a public house, the Red Lion, by 1792. It is now a gastropub, the Moon and Sixpence, controlled by Wells & Young's Brewery. In 1848 George Sackville-West, 5th Earl De La Warr gave a cottage to be used as both the schoolroom and schoolmaster's house. In 1868 a National School was built and the cottage became exclusively the schoolmaster's home. The school must have proved unsatisfactory, for in 1872 it was forced to become a board school. By 1952 the school had only 17 children and in 1961 it was closed.

In the Middle Ages, the city of Speyer (formerly Spira), Germany, was home to one of the most significant Jewish communities in the Holy Roman Empire. Its significance is attested to by the frequency of the Ashkenazi Jewish surname Shapiro/Shapira and its variants Szpira/Spiro/Speyer. After many ups and downs throughout history, the community was totally wiped out in 1940 during the Holocaust. With the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 Jews again settled in Speyer and a first assembly took place in 1996. The beginnings in 1084 The earliest reference to Jewish settlement along the Rhine dates from the year 321 in Cologne, and it is assumed that Jews also lived in Speyer in Late Antiquity. With the collapse of state and church administration in the Migration Period and the decline of the urban Roman lifestyle, it is also assumed that Jewish communities dispersed. Jews resettled in the Rhine area coming from southern France where Roman life had more or less remained intact. Traveling Jewish merchants certainly would have had dependencies in Rhenish towns, even though the first branches are only mentioned in 906 for Mainz, and 960 for Worms.Historischer Verein der Pfalz, Bezirksgruppe Speyer: Geschichte der Juden in Speyer, Progressdruck GmbH Speyer 1981, p. 10 With the construction of Speyer Cathedral, beginning in 1032, Speyer emerged as one of the major towns along the Rhine. The first records of Jews in Speyer appear in the 1070s. They were members of the renowned Kalonymos family of Mainz, which had migrated a century before from Italy. Other Jews from Mainz had possibly also settled in Speyer. The actual history of the Jews in Speyer started in 1084, when Jews fleeing from pogroms in Mainz and Worms took refuge with their relatives in Speyer. They possibly came at the instigation of bishop R√ºdiger Huzmann (1073‚Äì1090), who invited a larger number of Jews to live in his town with the expressed approval of emperor Henry IV. In his privilege or charter (Freiheitsbrief) for the Jews, the bishop wrote: > In the name of the holy and undivided Trinity, I, R√ºdiger, with the surname > of Huozmann, bishop of Speyer, in my endeavor to turn the village of Speyer > into a city, believed to multiply its image a thousand times by also > inviting Jews. I had them settle outside the quarters of the other > inhabitants and as not to have them disquieted by the insolence of the lowly > folk I had them surrounded by a wall. Now the place of their habitation > which I acquired justly (for in the first place I obtained the hill partly > with money and partly by exchange, while I received the valley by way of > gift from some heirs) that place, I say, I transferred to them on condition > that they pay annually 3 ¬Ω pounds in silver for the use of the brethren. I > have granted also to them within the district where they dwell, and from > that district outside the town as far as the harbour, and within the harbour > itself, full power to change gold and silver, and to buy and sell what they > please. And I have also given them license to do this throughout the state. > Besides this I have given them land of the church for a cemetery with rights > of inheritance. This also I have added that if any Jew should at any time > stay with them he shall pay no thelony.

The \\"valley\\" refers either to a moat-like grove to the north of the Weidenberg (today Hirschgraben) or to the low areas around the stream of the Speyerbach. This walled settlement for Jews was well to the north outside the walls of the city proper and it is the first documented ghetto.Fulbrook, Mary: A Concise History of Germany, Cambridge University Press, 1991, p. 20, The Jewish community had to mend and guard the walls of Altspeyer themselves. The charter granted by bishop Huzmann went well beyond contemporary practice anywhere else in the empire. The Jews of Speyer were allowed to carry out any kind of trade, exchange gold and money, own land, have their own laws, justice system and administration, employ non-Jews as servants, and were not required to pay tolls or duties at the city's borders. The reason for asking the Jews to come to Speyer was their important role in the money and trade businesses, especially with distant regions. Money lenders were needed on a large scale for the construction of the cathedral. The deliberate settlement of Jews was seen as a measure for business development. The Jews can also be regarded as pioneers of urban development in Germany.Haverkamp, Alfred: Deutsche Geschichte, Vol. 2, Beck'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung, M√ºnchen, 1993, p. 338, Bishops, lords or kings who granted privileges and protection to the Jews were at the same time securing for themselves considerable revenues and protection fees; since persecution of Jews and trade restrictions led to considerable economic disadvantages and loss of revenues, it was in the ruler's best interest to restrain the antisemitic fervor of the lower clergy and the public. With the aid of bishop Huzmann the Jews of Speyer had their rights and privileges confirmed and even expanded (\\"sub tuicionem nostram reciperemus et teneremus\\") by Henry IV as he departed on his third punitive expedition to Italy in 1090. The rights and privileges which had been especially granted to the Jews of Speyer, in particular to Judah ben Kalonymus, David ben Meshullam, and Moses ben Ghutiel (Jekuthiel), were extended to all the Jews of the empire. This Imperial Jews Charter was one of the first in Germany. The regulations concerned various political, legal, economical and religious aspects of life, most prominently free enterprise, the sale of goods to Christians and protection of property. A new regulation was that Jews who acquired stolen goods had to sell them back at the same price if the former owner wished to buy them. This constituted a major improvement because it greatly reduced the business risk for the Jews who had often been subject to accusations that they were dealing in stolen goods. In the event of disagreements between Jews and Christians from then on the \\"right of the concerned\\" was to be employed, which meant that Jews could also prove their case by oath or witness. Trials by ordeal were forbidden. Jews were also allowed to address the emperor or the imperial court directly in case of difficulties. Among each other they could use their own courts, which was to help avoid arbitrariness by Christian judges. Torture of any kind was strictly forbidden, and in the case of murder or injury the privilege stated that fines were to be paid to the emperor. The privilege also introduced strict rules for baptisms. Forced baptisms of children were totally outlawed. Jews voluntarily getting baptised were required to think it over for three days. Conversions were also made more difficult in that baptised Jews would lose their rights to inheritance. Basically, these regulations were meant to protect the size of the Jewish community and to ensure continued revenues. Jews were also allowed to employ Christian maids, wet nurses and labourers in their homes as long as it was ensured that they could observe the Christian Sundays and holidays. Neither the original charter granted by the bishop nor its re-enactment by the emperor proved sufficient to afford the Jews adequate protection. The two charters of 1084 and 1090 marked the beginning of the \\"golden era\\" of the Jews in Speyer which, with limitations, was to last into the 13th or 14th century. They also called for a sound Jewish community in the town by that time. According to these documents, an \\"Archisynagogos\\", also called a \\"Jews bishop\\" (episcopus Iudeorum) presided the administration as well as the court of the community. He was elected by the community and confirmed by the bishop. Later, sources report of a \\"Jews council\\" of twelve presided by the Jews bishop who represented the community outside. In 1333 and 1344, the authority of the Jews council was expressly confirmed by the city council of Speyer.Historischer Verein der Pfalz, Bezirksgruppe Speyer: Geschichte der Juden in Speyer, Progressdruck GmbH Speyer 1981, p. 15 Massacres of 1096 Only twelve years after granting the first privileges for Jews in the empire a wave of pogroms swept the country, triggered by an epidemic of the plague, which was blamed on the Jews, and the First crusade. The Jews of Speyer were among the first to be hit, but compared to the communities in Worms and Mainz, which followed a few days later, they got off lightly. On 3 May 1096, Count Emicho of Leiningen stopped in Speyer on his way to the crusade and, together with burghers of Speyer and peasants from nearby, attacked the Jews and the synagogue. In a report on the pogroms of 1096 in Speyer and Worms, written 1097‚Äì1140 by the so-called Mainz Anonymous, it says: \\"And it happened on the 8. day in the month of Iyar (6 May 1096), on a Sabbath, the last judgement started to come upon us as the mistaken and city dwellers rose in Speyer against the holy men, the pious of the Almighty; they conspired against them to seize them together in the synagogue. This came to their attention, so they rose early in the morning, even on Sabbath, prayed briefly and left the synagogue. And when they (the enemy) noticed that their plan to seize them together couldn't be followed, they rose against them and killed eleven souls among them‚Ä¶.And it happened when Bishop John heard of this, he came with many troops and wholeheartedly stood by the community, he took them into his private quarters and saved them from their hands\\" The bishop had the rioters punished severely and the Jews stayed in the bishop's palace on the northern side of the cathedral and in other nearby towns until the rage of the mob had subsided. Taking this action, which the Jews paid him for, the bishop of Speyer (Johann vom Kraichgau I, 1090‚Äì1104) prevented massacres and expulsions as happened in other cities of the Rhineland, thus saving himself and the town a valuable source of revenues. 800 Jews perished in the pogroms of Worms and even 1000 in Mainz.Schlickel, Ferdinand: Speyer. Von den Saliern bis heute, Hermann G. Klein Verlag, Speyer The events in Speyer are also mentioned in Solomon Bar Simson's chronicle on the Pogroms of 1096 which he wrote around 1140. Flourishing times First room in the medieval mikveh in Speyer. Pool of the medieval mikveh in Speyer, dating back to 1128 Changing alcove in the Speyer Mikveh Around the time of these events a second Jewish quarter was established in the vicinity of the cathedral along modern day Kleine Pfaffengasse which used to be the Judengasse (Jews Alley) while the settlement with a synagogue continued to exist in Altspeyer. It is estimated that the Jewish community of Speyer consisted of 300 to 400 people. Around 1100, on the Judengasse (today Pfaffengasse), the Jews built the Judenhof (Jewish courtyard) as the centre of their community containing a mikveh with a pool at groundwater level for ritual baths, a men's and later a women's synagogue. The synagogue, designed and built by the same architects as the cathedral of Speyer, was consecrated on 21 September 1104, eleven years after the pogrom of 1096. It fell into disuse in the 16th century but its ruins today represent the oldest visible remnants of a mikveh in central Europe. Today it is an archaeological heritage site and has been made accessible; the pool is still supplied by groundwater. Along with the Frisians, the Jews made up the majority of the long distance merchants in the 11th and 12th centuries. Both groups had their headquarters in the merchant's quarters right at the free cathedral territory. Members of the Kalonymos family lived in Speyer at that time and took a leading part in the development of Jewish studies in Germany. One example is Jekuthiel ben Moses, a liturgical poet and author of the reshut ◊ô◊®◊ê◊™◊ô to Kalir's Kerobah for the feast of Rosh Hashana. A son of Jekuthiel named Moses of Speyer has been quoted as a high Talmudical authority. Another Kalonymos from Speyer for some time was responsible for the finances of emperor Barbarossa.Haverkamp, Alfred: Deutsche Geschichte, Bd. 2, Beck'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung, M√ºnchen, 1993, S. 339, Another famous man of letters, Jehuda ben Samuel he-Chasid, called Jehuda the Pious, and the son of the German halachist Balakist Kalonymus ben Isaac the Elder, was born 1140 in Speyer. In these years the Jewish community of Speyer became one of the most significant in the Holy Roman Empire. It was an important centre for Torah studies and, in spite of pogroms, persecution and expulsion, it had considerable influence on the spiritual and cultural life of the city. In a synod of Rabbis in Troyes around 1150 the leadership of the Jews in Germany was transferred to the Jewish communities of Speyer, Worms and Mainz. This was confirmed by a convention of Rabbis in Mainz. The three communities created a federation called \\"SHUM\\" (◊©◊ï◊ù: initials of the Hebrew names of the three cities: Shpira (Hebrew: ◊©◊§◊ô◊®◊ê), Warmaisa, Magenza) and kept this leadership until the middle of the 13th century. Over a period of decades, these communities enacted a body of regulations known as Takkanot SHUM. The SHUM-Cities had their own rite and were accepted as central authority in legal and religious matters. Speyer had renowned Jewish schools and a highly frequented Yeshiva. Because of their high esteem in the Middle Ages the three SHUM-Cities were praised as \\"Rhenish Jerusalem\\". They had considerable influence on the development of Ashkenazi culture. In the 13th century Issac ben Mose Or Sarua from Vienna wrote: \\"From our teachers in Mainz, Worms and Speyer the teachings were spread to all of Israel ...\\", and all the communities in Germany and in the Slavic kingdoms were followers.Reuter, Fritz: Warmaisa: 1000 Jahre Juden in Worms, Verlag Books on Demand GmbH, 2009, Yet, even in this flourishing period of the Speyer Jewry, there were outbursts of violence in 1146 during the Second Crusade, in which not only laymen but also members of the clergy took part. This came to the attention of Bernard of Clairvaux who wrote a letter of reproach to Bishop G√ºnther. Among the victims of this pogrom was a woman named Minna, whose ears and tongue were cut off because she refused to submit to baptism. Pogroms and expulsions beginning 1195 In the wake of the Third Crusade in February 1195 the Jewish community of Speyer was subject to new persecutions during which nine Jews were killed. On 13 February the daughter of Rabbi and judge Isaak ben Ascher Halevi the Younger (*1130) was accused of ritual murder (blood libel), killed and displayed in the market square for three days. Halevi himself was killed when he tried to interfere and recover his daughter's body from the mob. Many Jews sought refuge on the high balcony of the synagogue where they had to remain until Hezekiah ben Reuben of Boppard and Moses ben Joseph ha-Kohen effected their release by paying a ransom. The Jews fled and their homes were plundered and burned; the synagogue in Altspeyer was destroyed. When Emperor Henry VI returned from Apulia the perpetrators were compelled to pay damages to him as well as to the Jews. Riots again occurred in Speyer in 1282 over a blood libel when Herbord, Ritter von der Ohm, accused the Jews of having murdered his grandson. The ensuing rage among the populace had Bishop Werner lay the matter before the provincial synod of Aschaffenburg on September 8, 1282. In the following year Emperor Rudolph approved the decision of this synod and ordered property to be taken from the Jews and reverted to the royal treasury. As the persecutions in Speyer continued, the Jews of Speyer and neighboring Mainz, Worms, and Oppenheim decided to emigrate to the Holy Land. Led by Meir B. Baruch in 1286, the attempt was ill-fated and the property of the few who actually succeeded was confiscated. On June 24, 1291, Rudolph issued another order for taxes, requiring the Jews of Speyer to maintain the newly established Fort and garrison of Landau. At the beginning of the 14th century the powers of the emperor and the bishop were weakened; for a payment of 300 pounds heller the city of Speyer took on the protection of the Jews, which proved as ineffectual as that of the bishop. On Easter week, 1343, when the body of a Christian named Ludwig was found, Jews were tortured and burned at the stake. On March 11, 1344, Speyer requested the king's permission to confiscate the houses of these Jews for the benefit of the city, which was granted. During the great plague of 1348/49 pogroms swept through France and Germany, especially the Rhineland, and on 22 January 1349 the Jewish community of Speyer was totally wiped out. Many chose to be burned in their homes, among them Rabbi Eliakim, others converted or fled to Heidelberg or Sinzheim. In one account, the burnt corpses were collected into empty winecasks and rolled into the Rhine. Property and the cemetery were confiscated. In view of this breach of the urban order of peace (Bruch der st√§dtischen Friedensordnung), which was to protect all the city dwellers alike, emperor Charles IV, who came to Speyer in spring 1349, declared on March 29, 1349, that the city had no blame whatsoever for the riots. Some of the Jews who had managed to escape returned to Speyer beginning in 1352, but were driven out anew the following year only to be allowed to return again in 1354, when they were assigned to quarters between Webergasse and the old school. On December 24 of that year, their synagogue and school, their cemetery and their \\"Dantzhus\\" or \\"Brutehus\\" were returned to them. In 1364 Bishop Adolph borrowed 800 guilders from the Jews for a weekly interest of one Strassburg pfennig. Bishop Nicolaus (1390) granted the Jews permission to settle in any city within the Speyer diocese on payment of a yearly tribute of 15 guilders. One half of this income went to the garrison, the other to the diocese. In 1394 King Wenceslaus renewed the decree of 1349 by Emperor Charles IV, which declared the Jews to be the property of the city. The Jewish community of Speyer never regained the size and status it had had before 1349. In the years between the pogroms the relations between Jews and Christians were tense and the Jews had to put up with many restrictions. From 1405 to 1421 they were entirely banned from the city. On February 11, 1431, King Sigismund ordered that any complaint brought against Jews in Speyer should be heard only before the municipal court, indicating that Jews lived in Speyer that year. There is a document from 1434 in which the Speyer council renewed the right of the Jews to live in the city for another six years, for which 5 to 35 Gilders were to be paid per household. Yet, the council again had to yield to the demands of the citizens and decree an expulsion; as early as the following year, on 8 May 1435, the Jews were again expelled \\"for ever\\" from the city. The decree said: The council is compelled to banish the Jews; but it has no designs upon their lives or their property: it only revokes their rights of citizenship and of settlement. Until November 11 they are at liberty to go whither they please with all their property, and in the meantime they may make final disposition of their business affairs. One of the refugees from Speyer was Moses Mentzlav whose son, Israel Nathan, founded a printing house in Soncino, Italy. Again, for 1467 there is a document confirming that the city of Speyer welcomed Jews for the duration of another ten years at the instigation of the bishop because he had special powers to set rules for the livelihoods of the Jews. In the years 1468, 1469 and 1472 bishop Matthias von Rammung decreed that all Jews in Speyer were to live together in one area and that they might have a synagogue. They were to wear clothes of such a fashion as to distinguish them from the Christians. Men were to wear pointed hats in different colours (this had already been decided at the Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215) and a yellow ring on their chest. There are documents showing Jews of Speyer already wearing pointed hats by the mid-14th century. Jewish women had to wear two blue ribbons in their veils. Jews were forbidden to participate in the public occasions of the Christians, employ Christian servants or midwives, sell medicines, or engage in usury. Jews had to stay out of public areas and were to keep their windows and doors closed during Holy Week and important holidays. In 1472 many Jews committed suicide to avoid forced baptism. As of 1500/1529 there were no Jews in Speyer.

This included beatings, tortures and killings, imprisonment, robbery, expulsion, closing of schools and synagogues, payment of tolls and duties and the denial of the right to appeal to the imperial or other courts.The complaint stated that the Jews had been: \\"gewaltigelich, fraventlich und muetwillig an ihren persohnen, leiben, haab und g√ºettern mit tottschlagen, rauben, wegf√ºren, au√ütreibung ihrer heu√ülichen wohnungen, versperung und zerst√∂rung ierer schuellen und sinagogen, de√ügleichen an gelaiten und zollen belaidigt und beschwerdt ‚Ä¶ nit allain ierer haab und g√ºetter entsetzt, gebl√ºndert und au√ügetriben, sondern auch ohne alle unser rechtliche erkhanndtnu√ü gefangen, gepeiniget, vertilgt und umb leib und guett\\"; quoted in: A trigger for the new wave of antisemitism in the empire can be seen in Martin Luther's antisemitic writings of 1543. Accordingly, Charles V considered it necessary to renew and confirm the Jews' charter. At the same time these rights and privileges were extended to the Jews of the whole empire. Nobody was to have the right to close their schools and synagogues, to drive them out or hinder their use. Whoever violated the imperial constitutio pacis by infringing upon the rights of the Jews was to be punished by every authority. Every Jew was to have the right to do business in the empire and every authority was to protect him and not burden him with tolls or duties. Jews were not required to wear \\"Jewish insignias\\" outside of their dwellings and no Jew was to be driven from his home without the emperor's expressed consent. Because Jews paid higher taxes but had no public offices, real estate or manual trade, they were allowed to charge higher interest rates than the Christians. It was forbidden to accuse Jews of using Christian blood without due proof and witness, to take them prisoner, to torture or to execute them. Infringements of this privilege were to be fined with 50 marks in gold, one half to be paid to the emperor and the other to the Jewish community. In 1548 this charter was once more confirmed by Charles V and again by emperor Maximilian II in 1566. 17th, 18th and 19th centuries From 1621 to 1688 Jews again settled in Speyer. It was especially during the Thirty Years' War and the following years that the indebted cities saw themselves forced to make use of their financial power. In Speyer at least five such loans are documented between 1645 and 1656. The city started taking out loans from Jews as early as 1629. This enabled the Jews to anticipate the town's forthcoming profits in trade matters, which got them into conflict with the guilds. So, because of complaints, the Jews trading rights were restricted several times for short periods of time during the 17th century. Before Speyer was burned down by the French in 1689, trade and financial transactions with Jews had been totally banned. In the following years of reconstruction Jews were not allowed to resettle permanently. Until 1750, the internal affairs of the small community were administered by the rabbi of Worms for an annual compensation of 10 Reichsthaler. Visits by the rabbis required official permission, as documents from 1682, 1685, 1698, 1713, and 1746 show. In the last-named document a reference is made to \\"our rabbi David Strauss of Worms\\". Episcopal edicts in 1717, 1719, 1722, 1726, 1727, 1728, 1736, 1741, and 1748 prohibited Romanies and Jews having no safe-conducts from visiting the diocese estates; and those that were provided with safe-conducts were required, for sanitary reasons, to submit their bundles or packages to a rigid examination. As of 1752 the Jews were forbidden, on pain of severe punishment, to employ the services of any rabbi other than their own. The first rabbi of Speyer was Isaac Weil (1750‚Äì63), succeeded by L√∂win L√∂b Calvaria, whose salary was provided by a bequest in the testament of a Jew named S√ºssle. At the end of the 18th century, a Jewish community re-established itself in Speyer after the French Revolution. It distinguished itself by its liberal and emancipated attitudes which repeatedly brought it into conflict with the more conservative district rabbinate of Bad D√ºrkheim. In 1828 it founded a welfare club and contributed to the efforts of the city council fighting the great poverty in the town. In 1830 the Speyer Jewish community had 209 members. In 1837 it built a new synagogue on the site of the former church of St. Jacob on Heydenreichstra√üe; the synagogue included a little school. In 1863 Carl David became the first Jewish council member in Speyer. A leading figure of the Jews, Sigmund Herz, was member of the city council from 1874 to 1914. By 1890 the Jewish community had grown to 535 members, the greatest number ever in Speyer; by 1910 the number had diminished to 403. In the early 1930s Speyer Jews started leaving for larger cities or to emigrate because of rising antisemitism.Geschichte der Stadt Speyer, Vol. II, p. 21‚Äì22, 150, Kohlhammer Verlag, Stuttgart, 1983, The Jewish community in the 20th century and today Memorial plaque in the Speyer Judenhof Monument commemorating the deported Jews of Speyer at the site of the former synagogue By 1933, the number of Jews in Speyer had fallen to 269, and by the time their synagogue was torched in the November pogroms of 1938 (Kristallnacht) there were only 81 left. In the night of 9 November, SA and SS troops looted the synagogue on Heydenreichstra√üe, taking away the library, precious cloths, carpets and ritual utensils and setting the building alight. The firemen only kept an eye on the neighbouring buildings. Along with the synagogue the Jews also lost their school. The same night the Jewish cemetery was also vandalized. The debris of the synagogue was removed in the following days, which was billed to the Jewish community. A member of the community supplied a prayer room in his house on Herdstra√üe. The city later used this house as a storage for furniture left behind by deported Jews. On 22 October 1940, 51 of the 60 Jews remaining in Speyer were deported to the internment camp of Gurs in southern France. Some of them managed to escape to Switzerland, the USA and South Africa with the aid of locals, while others were deported to Germany and murdered at Auschwitz. Only one Jew survived the Nazi era hidden in Speyer. In 1951, the city of Speyer considered putting a parking lot on the site of the former synagogue. In 1955 the council decided on a payment of 30,000 DM to the German Jewish community (as settlement of a restitution procedure). In 1959 the department store company Anker bought the whole block, including the empty lot of the former synagogue, for Speyer's first department store on Maximilianstra√üe (today Kaufhof). At the recommendation of the German Cities Council, Speyer bought development bonds from the State of Israel worth 2,000 DM in 1961. In 1968, a commemorative plaque was unveiled in the court of the mikveh commemorating the fate of the Speyer Jews. In 1979 another plaque was attached at the back wall of the Kaufhof department store building where the synagogue once stood. Right in front of the site a monument was erected in 1992. Shortly after it was moved across the street to its present place because of the restricted space.Eger, Wolfgang: Geschichte der Stadt Speyer, Vol. 3, Kohlhammer Verlag Stuttgart, 1989, There was no majority for a 2007 motion in the council by the Social Democratic Party to have commemorative brass cobblestones (so-called Stolpersteine or \\"stumbling stones\\") placed in the pavement in front of buildings where Jews lived until their deportation.http://www.speyer- aktuell.de/page.php?modul=Article&op;=show_pdf&aid;=10196 This has been done in many other German cities. Jewish cemetery today Mortuary and eastern wall of Jewish cemetery at St. Klara Klosterweg (until 1888) Up to the 1990s there was no Jewish community in Speyer. It was only in October 1996 that a first assembly took place. Ten Jews who had emigrated from Eastern Europe decided to found a new Jewish community. It was also decided to build a new synagogue by extending the former medieval church of St. Guido. The cornerstone of the Synagogue Beith-Shalom was laid on 9 November 2008. Consecration took place on 9 November 2011 in the presence of President Christian Wulff, Premier Kurt Beck, Speyer Mayor Hansj√∂rg Eger, Bishop Karl-Heinz Wiesemann and Church President Christian Schad. A very honoured guest was Jack Mayer, born 1930 in Speyer, who had fled with his mother and brother to the United States in 1938.spa: Ort der Begegnung und des Dialogs: Speyerer Synagoge als sichtbares Zeichen f√ºr gro√üe j√ºdische Tradition , in www.speyer.aktuell.de, Report from 10 November 2011 The medieval Jewish cemetery of Speyer lay opposite the Judenturm (Jews' tower) to the west of the former Jews' quarter in Altspeyer (today between Bahnhofstra√üe and Wormer Landstra√üe). After the pogroms of 1349 it was ploughed under and in 1358 the city returned some of it as leasehold estate. After the expulsion of 1405 the area was owned by a Christian but in 1429 the Jews were able to retrieve it. After the expulsion of 1435 the city confiscated the cemetery and leased it to Christians. In the 18th century it was the garden plot of the poor house (Elendherbergsacker). After Jews resettled in Speyer in the 19th century, a new cemetery was built at St. Klara Klosterweg and remained in use until 1888. The former mortuary and a part of the western wall are still in place. In 1888, the Jewish cemetery was moved to the new city cemetery built in the north of Speyer along Wormser Landstra√üe, where it now occupies the southeastern section.

The group characterized itself as a \\"pro-queer, pro-feminist, anti-racist direct action group\\" campaigning for sexual freedom in the age of AIDS. It was founded to oppose both mainstream political measures to control sex, and elements within the gay community who advocated same-sex marriage and the restriction of public sexual culture as solutions to the HIV crisis. The group has been depicted as a faction in a gay \\"culture war\\" of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Sex Panic!'s actions and attitudes were criticized as immature and even fanatical by its opponents, but other commentators called the group a vital component of grassroots gay activism that resisted gay marginalization and countered forced conformity to social norms. Origins According to founder member Christopher Murray, in a 1997 letter to the New York Times, Sex Panic! was formed by six HIV-positive gay men opposed to a \\"gay neo- conservative movement\\" and to the closure of gay venues around New York. The closure of gay venues stemmed from the urban rezoning policies of New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration. Giuliani had passed laws that made it harder for sex-related businesses to operate in central city areas, forcing many to close or relocate to the waterfront. These policies, Sex Panic! founder Michael Warner wrote, served to stigmatize sex and sexuality in ways that had negative consequences for public health efforts to combat HIV and AIDS. Reducing the availability and visibility of venues for sex did not, Warner, argued, make people safer; on the contrary it reduced the number of public sites where safer sex messages could be broadcast and gay men encouraged to consider their sexual health honestly, critically, and without the confusion and misinformation fostered by a culture of shame. As well as mainstream politics, the group opposed the anti-promiscuity arguments of prominent gay rights campaigners Larry Kramer, Andrew Sullivan, Michelangelo Signorile, and Gabriel Rotello. Sullivan's 1995 book Virtually Normal: An Argument About Homosexuality had called for the abandonment of radical gay identity politics in favour of campaigning for the right to marry, which he presented as the highest social value attainable and the token of a maturity and moral responsibility the gay movement had lacked. Sullivan's arguments for marriage included the assertion that it was a good defense against the spread of HIV and AIDS; Rotello argued similarly that these diseases could not be eradicated so long as a 'core group' of gay men participated in risky sex. Marriage, Rotello suggested in his 1997 book Sexual Ecology, was a powerful incentive to behaviour less likely to spread disease, while exclusion from the benefits it offered created an equally powerful stigma. These views, the founders of Sex Panic! argued, supported a mainstream political culture that demonized gay people and portrayed gay sex in general, rather than unsafe sex in particular, as a vector of disease. Name The organization's name references a concept used by historians to describe repressive measures against sex in the name of the public good; 'sex panics' in this sense have been documented since at least the nineteenth century. A Gay City News journalist, evaluating the group's role in the history of sex scandals through the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, described the choice of name as an act of self- empowerment. Membership Founder and early members of Sex Panic! included historian Allan B√©rub√©, Christopher Murray, art historian Douglas Crimp, Columbia Law School professor Kendall Thomas, Rutgers University English professor Michael Warner, research activist Greg Gonsalves, and scientific artist Dennis Davidson. Feminist authors Eva Pendleton, Jane Goldschmidt of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, and literary critic Ann Pellegrini were also early members. Aims and activities Members Eva Pendleton and Jane Goldschmidt articulated Sex Panic!'s goals in 1998: The group argued that the best response to sexual health crisis was to promote safer sex, and argued that approaches that contradicted the 'condom code' - the advocacy of barrier methods as the only sure protection - actually undermined efforts to curb the crisis by encouraging carelessness and hypocrisy. This opposed the group to the arguments of Rotello, Signorile, and others, who said that the spread of the disease was best contained by a \\"new maturity\\" of marriage and monogamy, sex with only one partner, and the deliberate use of shame to discourage participation in potentially risky sex. Such an approach, Sex Panic! argued, was either naive or deliberately disingenuous. Rather than demonizing sex with multiple partners, Sex Panic! stressed a need to counteract the effects of shame. They argued that it was absurd and repressive to insist that everyone adopt what Warner called a \\"Fifties gay life\\" of monogamy, to pretend that sex in private was somehow necessarily safer than sex in public, and outright dangerous to create a situation that bred ignorance about safer sex methods, despair over the possibilities for protecting oneself, and a resulting increase in infection rates. It was not gay sex or promiscuous sex, founder member Thomas pointed out, that spread HIV, but unsafe sex. Some of the group's tactics were deliberately eye-catching. The flyer for one 1997 event was headlined \\"DANGER! ASSAULT! TURDZ!\\", the latter a reference to Signorile, Rotello, Kramer, and Sullivan. Other activities included demonstrating alongside ACT-UP against the GMHC's plans to identify seropositive patients by name in public HIV status reporting, rather than the anonymized reporting the group favoured. Other measures were more conventional. In June 1997 the group conducted teach-ins at New York's Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center. The group also held a November 1997 summit in San Diego, California, where a series of lectures and workshops discussed what the group called an \\"emerging culture war\\" within the gay community and sought to forge alliances between gay men and other marginalized groups. At the conference, founder Eric Rofes urged attendees to start grass-roots movements of their own to combat the repression of sexual minorities. The outspoken methods of Sex Panic!, he argued, were indispensable, since the movement they fought worked by means of marginalization, silencing, and oppression. To be 'neutral' in the face of public discourses that sought to shame and marginalize gay communities, Rofes argued, was to be complicit in that shaming and marginalization. Criticism Larry Kramer, an overt target of the group's campaigns, published an editorial piece in the New York Times criticizing the group's tactics and goals. Sex Panic!, Kramer said, was \\"on the way to convincing much of America that all gay men are back to pre-AIDS self-destructive behavior that will wind up costing the taxpayer a lot of extra money.\\" Other commentators accused Sex Panic! of irresponsibility in the face of the HIV epidemic. David Dalton, in the San Francisco Examiner, said the group was telling young men that \\"a sex act... is worth more than your life.\\" In Salon, David Horowitz charged Sex Panic! with \\"intellectual fascism and sexual fanaticism\\" over their defence of sex clubs, which he characterized as the \\"death camps of the current contagion.\\" The group's insistence that a gay public sexual culture continue in the face of the epidemic was, in Horowitz's view, \\"homicidal\\", and its membership composed of \\"sexual extremists\\" cloistered in complicit universities. Sex Panic! member Douglas Crimp rebutted the charges that this was a mere intellectual exercise. Mainstream venues where such debate took place, he argued, were dominated by the group's opponents and had failed to engage with queer theory, so necessarily saw the group's members as fringe extremists. He argued too that the very life-and-death nature of the AIDS crisis made the group's purpose political, rather than academic, rejecting the claim that the group's insistence on the complexity of the issues it addressed was \\"dangerous relativism\\". Others were sympathetic to parts of Sex Panic!'s manifesto but opposed to certain particulars. David Salyer in Survival News, a journal of the AIDS Survival Project, applauded the group's demands for an end to discrimination and greater promotion of safer sex messages, but objected to the emphasis the group placed on public sex. Activist John-Manuel Andriote also criticized Sex Panic!'s assertion that public, visible, anonymous sex was necessarily a cornerstone of gay experience. Michael Warner had told the New York Times that \\"'It is an absurd fantasy to expect gay men to live without a sexual culture when we have almost nothing else that brings us together\\". Andriote responded that the AIDS crisis itself had been an alternative community-forming experience for gays and lesbians, who cooperated to support one another and campaign for awareness. Through the crisis, Andriote said, gay men had acquired a broader common experience than \\"a priapic brotherhood of sexual rebellion\\", offering an alternative grounds for a group politics of identity. Sex Panic! members accused their opponents of mischaracterizing their positions. Founder member Kendall Thomas objected to a New York Times piece claiming the group saw \\"promiscuous sex\\" as the \\"essence of gay liberation\\"; the newspaper printed an amendment, stating Thomas's view to be that \\"any attempt to fight AIDS by demonizinging [sic] the culture of sexual freedom is doomed\\". Tim Dean called the group's criticism of Rotello and Signorile \\"utterly confused and defensive\\", but noted its significance in re- energizing AIDS debates and reviving the political argument over gay assimilation. Craig Rimmerman similarly praised the group's \\"invaluable contribution\\" to sustaining gay and lesbian grassroots activism and fighting \\"normalizing tendencies\\" in public discourse about sexual health.

It was intended to be an aircraft that could be used for a variety of tasks including transport \\"mobile office\\" but only one prototype was built being scrapped in 1950. Design and development The Aerocar was a high-wing monoplane with gondola fuselage and twin-boom tailplane and tricycle undercarriage. The cabin could hold five passengers in addition to the pilot. Four doors were fitted to the cabin. The manufacturer claimed that as well as taking off in 160 yards on (dry) grass, it could climb on one engine at full load at . It was of composite construction; fabric-covered wooden wings, tail booms and tail fitted to a metal fuselage but the production model would have been all-metal. Clamshell doors at the rear of the fuselage were advertised. Construction of both a Major and Minor variants was started but the company decided that the Minor would not have enough power and construction was abandoned. The Major prototype was completed and started taxying trials at Portsmouth on 18 June 1947, Frank Luxmoore was pleased with the trials so he undertook the maiden flight the same day. It was exhibited at the Society of British Aircraft Constructors airshow but funding for the development of the Aerocar was dependent on an agreement for licence manufacture in India. With the uncertainty arising from the partition of India in 1947, this became unlikely and Portsmouth Aviation was unable to continue with development. With Lionel Balfour, the driving force behind the Aerocar, no longer part of the company the Aerocar was stored until scrapped. To support planned production in India the uncompleted Minor was sent to act as a pattern aircraft, the Indian financial backers failed to support the project and the idea of production in India was abandoned. Variants ;Aerocar Major :Powered by two 155hp Cirrus Major engines and a retractable landing gear, one prototype built and flown. ;Aerocar Minor :Planned variant powered by two Cirrus Minor II engines and a retractable landing gear, construction of a prototype abandoned and moved to India to act as a pattern aircraft for local production. ;Aerocar Senior :Proposed variant of the Major with a fixed landing gear and lower level of equipment fit. ;Aerocar Junior :Proposed variant of the Minor with a fixed landing gear and a lower level of equipment fit.

Mixing sports reporting with news and political comment, it achieved a circulation of 80,000 copies a day. Its use of sporting events as promotional tools led to the creation of the Paris‚ÄìRoubaix cycle race in 1896, and the popularisation of the Bordeaux‚ÄìParis cycle race during the 1890s. Its demise was a consequence of the creation of the Tour de France by L'Auto, a rival newspaper that had been founded in 1900 from the intense animosity generated by the Dreyfus affair. Le V√©lo was easily recognised by the green-tinted newsprint on which it was published, so L'Auto (n√©e L'Auto-V√©lo) was distinguished by a yellow tint, and thus the 'Yellow Jersey' worn by the leader of the 'Tour de France'. Personnel Pierre Giffard was a French journalist, a pioneer of modern political reporting, a newspaper publisher and a prolific sports organizer. In 1896, he joined his colleague Paul Rousseau at the head of Le V√©lo, where he wrote under the name Arator. Le V√©lo was widely considered to be the premier sports newspaper produced in France. He had been a journalist with Le Figaro before becoming editor of Le Petit Journal, on whose behalf he had created Paris‚ÄìBrest‚ÄìParis in 1891. On 19 July 1896 he organised the first Paris marathon and helped found the Automobile Club de France. As editor of Le V√©lo, his opposition to the car-maker Albert de Dion over the Dreyfus affair led de Dion to create a rival daily, L'Auto. G√©o Lef√®vre was a sports journalist who was recruited from Le V√©lo, to work as a rugby and cycling correspondent for L'Auto. Lef√®vre's idea for 'a six-day race round France' lead to the demise of his old paper. Victor Breyer was the cycling editor for Le V√©lo, and he was the first to reconnoitre the route for the 1896 Paris‚ÄìRoubaix cycle race, which was promoted by the director at the time, Paul Rousseau. Paris Roubaix In February 1896 two Roubaix businessmen, Theodore Vienne and Maurice Perez, contacted Louis Minart, the editor of Le V√©lo, and suggested a race from Paris to Roubaix. Minart was enthusiastic but said the decision of whether the paper would run the start and provide publicity belonged to the director, Paul Rousseau. Minart may also have suggested an indirect approach because Vienne and Perez recommended their race not on its own merits but as preparation for another. Rousseau was immediately sold on the notion, and sent his cycling editor Victor Breyer to recce the route on a bicycle. Vienne and Perez wrote: > Dear M. Rousseau, Bordeaux‚ÄìParis is approaching and this great annual event > which has done so much to promote cycling has given us an idea. What would > you think of a training race which preceded Bordeaux‚ÄìParis by four weeks? > The distance between Paris and Roubaix is roughly 280km, so it would be > child's play for the future participants of Bordeaux‚ÄìParis. The finish would > take place at the Roubaix v√©lodrome after several laps of the track. > Everyone would be assured of an enthusiastic welcome as most of our citizens > have never had the privilege of seeing the spectacle of a major road race > and we count on enough friends to believe that Roubaix is truly a hospitable > town. As prizes we already have subscribed to a first prize of 1,000 francs > in the name of the Roubaix velodrome and we will be busy establishing a > generous prize list which will be to the satisfaction of all. But for the > moment, can we count on the patronage of Le V√©lo and on your support for > organising the start? The first prize represented seven months' wages for a miner. Rousseau was enthusiastic and sent his cycling editor, Victor Breyer, to find a route. Breyer travelled to Amiens in a Panhard driven by his colleague, Paul Meyan. The following morning Breyer -- later deputy organiser of the Tour de France and a leading official of the Union Cycliste Internationale -- continued by bike. The wind blew, the rain fell and the temperature dropped. Breyer reached Roubaix filthy and exhausted after a day of riding on disjointed cobbles. He swore he would send a telegram to Minart urging him to drop the idea, saying it was dangerous to send a race the way he had just ridden. But that evening, following a meal and drinks with the team from Roubaix, he changed his mind. The Dreyfus affair The Dreyfus affair split French opinion at the turn of the 20th century, causing passionate and physical arguments. Pierre Giffard, the Director of Le Velo, was a 'left-wing' 'Dreyfusard' while many of the manufacturers who funded the advertisements were anti-Dreyfusards, especially the Comte Jules-Albert de Dion, owner of the De Dion-Bouton car works. The comte was arrested and spent 15 days in gaol after a melee at the Auteuil horse-race course in 1899, because he had struck the President of France (√âmile Loubet) over the head with a walking stick. Giffard's tone of reporting this led to a group of 'anti-Dreyfusards' including de Dion, Adolphe Cl√©ment and √âdouard Michelin to withdraw advertising. Subsequently, in 1900, they entrusted Henri Desgrange (editor of Paris-Velo or Le Petit Velo) to create the L'Auto-Velo in direct competition to Le V√©lo. The deliberate similarity of the names triggered a court case by Le V√©lo for infringement of title, which it duly won on January 16, 1903 and thus L'Auto was renamed. There are slightly varying reports about the reason for the breakaway of L'Auto. Either the advertisers withdrew their custom whilst planning a paper of their own, or an alternative version has it that Giffard banished them. Either way, Le V√©lo was directly involved in a 'circulation war' that only one side could win. Advent of the Tour de France and the demise of Le V√©lo  Le V√©lo had always achieved good circulation boosts from the cycle races it sponsored, including the second edition of the 1200 km Paris‚ÄìBrest‚ÄìParis in 1901, as well as the yearly Bordeaux‚ÄìParis and Paris‚ÄìRoubaix one-day classics. By 1903, in a bid to stem falling circulation, L'Auto launched the initial Tour de France, and the success of the race boosted its circulation, to the detriment of Le Velo. In 1904 Le V√©lo ceased its activities and L'Auto eventually transmogrified into L'√âquipe in 1944.

The company is known for pioneering commercial operation of the Mil MI 26T in Western Europe from 1992. History Skytech SA was founded in Belgium in November 1989 by helicopter pilots Thierry Lakhanisky and Lucienne De Dryver. First external load works were carried on with a single MD 500 helicopter; this light lifter was soon joined by a Mil MI 10K Harke-B under long term lease from the Aeroflot regional branch of the Republic of Komi. This MI 10K was used as a flying crane on various projects all over Europe, including building ski lifts up to 3,500 m on the Monte Rosa in the Alps. The Belgian company introduced the first Mil MI 26T in South America in 1994 and in the same year set up partnerships with Nepal Airways to operate five Mil MI 17 helicopters in Nepal, and in Papua Niugini with Heli Niugini to operate a couple of Kamov 32 helicopters to support oil explorations with Barracuda Oil and Chevron Oil.

The School is located off Highway 301 and ¬Ω mile from U.S. 1, at 1 Warrior Drive. The main north/south CSX rail line is located directly behind the athletic complex of West Nassau High School. School spirit \\"Cherokee\\" is the school‚Äôs official fight song, arranged by former directors of the Warrior Band. \\"War Chant\\" written and arranged by Florida State University is alternatively used as one of the fight songs. The school‚Äôs mascot was once Lenny the Warrior, who retired in 2003. Lenny was replaced by various white horses and a student dressed as an Indian warrior. History West Nassau High School opened in August 1936 as Callahan High School (now the location of Callahan Elementary School). The school was combined at the time with Callahan Elementary with the name Callahan School. According to the Nassau County School Board, teachers were hired in July 1936 under the names of Callahan High and Callahan Elementary. The school‚Äôs mascot was the Ramblers. The school colors were then Blue and Gold. The final month of classes at Callahan High was June 1968. During this period of time the State of Florida was mandated by Federal Law under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to desegregate its school systems statewide and allow African Americans to attend its all-white public school systems. The African American students from Hilliard and Callahan who were previously attending the all African American school of Pine Forrest Community School in grades K through 12 in Callahan were allowed to receive an education equal to their white counterparts. Mr. Emmitt Coakley, the football coach at Pine Forrest Community School, would later become the principal at West Nassau High School. In August 1968, Hilliard High School and Callahan High School were combined at a new location to form West Nassau County High School. The Flashes of Hilliard and the Ramblers of Callahan became the Warriors of West Nassau County High School. The school colors at West Nassau represent the consolidation of the two schools with the cardinal red representing Hilliard High School and gold representing Callahan High School. The Class of 2009 marked the 40th anniversary of West Nassau County High School. Hilliard students attended high school at West Nassau (Callahan) for three years and then Hilliard Combined 6-12 School was re-opened. Even though Hilliard reopened their combined middle/high school, the high school in Callahan continued-to-be named West Nassau County High School and the name was not changed back to Callahan High School. The school has been serving students from the Bryceville and Callahan area since 1968. Student population The student population reached an all- time high of 1500 in the school year of 2009/2010. The population is projected to continue growing as Jacksonville continues to expand northward and real estate prices continue to rise in the eastern area of the county. Recent construction Recent construction projects include a new building construction lab, a new technology lab, three new classrooms, two new girls‚Äô locker rooms and two renovated boys‚Äô locker rooms. Ten portable classrooms are necessary to accommodate the students. Community pride The community of Callahan placed the warrior head insignia and \\"Home of the Warriors\\" on the town water tower in 2005 to demonstrate support for the school. The water tower logo is positioned so people entering Callahan from either direction are welcomed by the Warrior Head logo on the tower. Every game days the local restaurants advertise that day‚Äôs game on their sign. Band The Warrior Band's current director is William Jason Eason. Eason is a C/o 2000 graduate from WNHS.

Leket Israel rescues surplus agricultural produce and collects excess cooked meals for redistribution to the needy throughout Israel via its network of 200+ nonprofit organization (NPO) partners. History In 2003, the first National Insurance Institute Report was released revealing that 25% of the Israeli population was living in poverty and that most suffered from some level of food insecurity, meaning not knowing where one‚Äôs next meal was coming from. Joseph Gitler, then a recent immigrant to Israel, started reaching out to nearby nonprofits and discovered that most of them were spending a large percentage of their budgets on purchasing food. Meanwhile, caterers were throwing out an exorbitant amount of food at the end of events. Mr. Gitler offered to pick up the surplus food from the catering halls and deliver it to the nonprofits thereby rescuing the food from destruction and at the same time, providing the food to those in need. This was the first step in creating what was then known as Table to Table. In 2010, Table to Table (established in 2003) merged with the Leket Food Bank (established in 2007) and became Leket Israel. Today, serving as the country's National Food Bank and largest food rescue network, Leket Israel's primary mission is to lead the safe, effective, and efficient collection and distribution of surplus nutritious food in Israel that would have otherwise been destroyed, redistributing the food to a network of 200 partner NPOs serving over 175,000 needy Israelis each week. As an umbrella organization, Leket Israel also works to support its NPO partners through nutrition education, food safety, and capacity building assistance. NPOs include soup kitchens, community based organizations supplying food packages to the needy, centers for the elderly, shelters and after-school programs for youth at risk, among others. Leket Israel mobilizes 50,000 volunteers a year in its food rescue programs, and is playing a crucial role in raising public awareness to the issues of nutritional insecurity, food waste and the environment, and the importance of balanced nutrition. Capacity Leket Israel maintains the greatest logistical and human resource capacity of any single food provision agency in the country working to alleviate the problem of nutritional insecurity through the rescue and redistribution of surplus, nutritious food. No other organization in Israel rescues food on a national level from hotels and caterers or works with farmers to glean produce from fields. The food provisions offer crucial support to Leket Israel‚Äôs network of 200+ NPOs, helping them collectively reduce food costs by tens of millions of dollars a year, while expanding the range of fresh food provisions provided to their needy clientele. In 2018, with the help of more than 47,000 volunteers, Leket Israel: (a) rescued, sourced, and distributed a total of 37,100,000 lbs. of agricultural produce, prepared meals, and other nutritious food to the needy; (b) cultivated, in partnership with farmers, 3,308,000 lbs. of field crops as part of a supplement to rescued food; (c) delivered 70 four-part nutrition workshops on healthy eating on a limited budget; (d) undertook hundreds of site visits to partner NPOs; and (e) invested $110,000 in capacity building funds to help NPOs upgrade basic infrastructure and improve food safety. Food Donation Act In October 2018, after 10 years of intensive work, and for the first time in Israel, the Food Donation Act passed in the Knesset plenum. Led by MK Uri Maklev with support from MKs Eli Elalouf, Moshe Gafni, Yechiel 'Hilik' Bar, Orly Levi Abekasis, Shuli Mualem and Mordechai Yogev, in cooperation with Leket Israel. The Food Donation Act, similar to the United States Bill Emerson Act, absolves food donors, non-profit organizations and staff and volunteers at the non-profit organizations from criminal and civil liability, provided they adhere to food safety requirements set forth by the Ministry of Health. Israel is one of only seven countries in the world (US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Argentina and the UK) who have similar legislation, which encourages the collection of excess food and protects the donors and organizations that distribute it. Awards and recognition Leket Israel has received or been recognized with the following prizes, awards, or titles: *Midot Seal of Effectiveness (2011-2021) *Greenhouse Energy Efficient Certified (2015) *Bonei Zion Prize 2014 (Category of ‚ÄúCommunity‚Äù awarded to Leket Israel Founder) *Official Israeli representative of the Global Foodbanking Network (Inducted 2011) *Presidential Citation Recipient (Awarded 2011) Government Partnerships As an Israeli charity, Leket Israel does not receive any significant government funding. Of its 2019 estimated organization budget only 6.4% is expected to be funded by government sources and is allocated specifically to two new government subsidized initiatives. The first is a joint project between the Ministry of Agriculture and Leket Israel, with Leket Israel tasked to provide workshops on proper nutrition and agricultural surplus for the Bedouin community in the Negev. The second is a project of the National Food Security Initiative, operated in cooperation with Leket Israel and Eshel Jerusalem-Chabad, whereby reloadable cards worth NIS 500 are distributed to thousands of families suffering from severe food insecurity. Leket Israel is responsible for assembling and providing parcels of surplus rescued produce which are then purchased with a portion of the reloadable cards. Programs=Leket to Table: Meal Rescue Leket Israel rescues surplus hot meals and prepared food from 300 suppliers including hotels, army bases, corporate cafeterias, and others, providing a crucial daily source of nutrition to thousands of Israel‚Äôs needy. In 2019, an estimated 2.4 million meals (meat and two side dishes) will be collected and redistributed to 80+ NPO partners throughout the country (an average of 46,000+ hot meals weekly) including soup kitchens, homeless shelters, last chances schools, and others. Project Leket: Gleaning Initiative Project Leket, Leket Israel‚Äôs flagship gleaning initiative, was established in 2005 to prevent the paradoxical waste of fruits and vegetables, in the face of significant levels of poverty and hunger in the country. Through the program, during 2019 Leket Israel‚Äôs staff and volunteers will rescue from fields, orchards, and packing houses over 35 million lbs. of fruits and vegetables slated by farmers for destruction (673,000 lbs. weekly). The project provides tens of thousands of Israel's poor with access to an important source of nutrition they could not otherwise afford. Project Leket was inspired by the Bible, which states: \\"When you reap your harvest in your field and forget a sheaf in the field, you shall not go back to get it; it shall be left for the stranger, the orphan, and the widow, so that the Lord your God may bless you in all your undertakings.\\" () Self-Growing Initiative In 2011, Leket Israel established a Self Growing Initiative to supplement that which is unavailable through rescue. The project currently operates from two sites, (a) Moshav Nahalal in the Jezreel Valley where Leket Israel leases 35 acres of land and (b) Binyamina in the Hof Carmel region where Leket Israel owns 10 acres of land, including 5 acres of greenhouses. Together, the two sites with the support of 20,000 volunteer harvesters, produces up to 1,500 tons (3.3 million lbs) of 8-10 highly nutritious vegetables annually. Sandwich for School Kids Project Sandwich for School Kids Project provides 7,800 volunteer prepared sandwiches daily to disadvantaged school children in over 100 schools throughout Israel. Manufactured Food Leket Israel rescues a weekly average of 22 tons of dairy, baked, dried, and frozen goods from 25 corporate partners, such as Supersol, Angel Bakeries, and Tara Dairy, who donate tens of thousands of perishable food items nearing their expiry dates and manufactured goods that were overproduced, packaged incorrectly, or cannot be sold commercially. Purchasing Cooperative for Nonprofits Leket's purchase cooperative for nonprofits provides savings up to 25% off of nonprofit organizations' food budgets. Nutrition for Life Program One of the primary tenets of Leket Israel is its focus on supplying healthy, nutritious food. Leket Israel‚Äôs Nutrition and Food Safety Department runs nutrition workshops to underprivileged communities throughout Israel. The workshops train participants on how to eat healthy on a limited budget, how to incorporate more fruits and vegetables into their daily diets and offers hands on food preparation activities for the participants. The workshops are run by licensed dieticians and offered in four languages, Hebrew, Russian, Arabic and Amharic. In 2018, Leket Israel began a new program of Parent-Child workshops, working with groups of parents and their children to teach them important tools for eating healthy as a family, trying new fruits and vegetables, sitting down as a unit for dinner and the importance of eating breakfast. Capacity Building Assistance Program for Nonprofits Due to Leket Israel‚Äôs stringent food safety regulations, inspections of the NPO partners are done on a regular basis to ensure that all food donated is being handled in a secure way. In order to maintain a high level of food safety, Leket Israel assists NPOs by providing capital for capacity building and infrastructure improvement projects, and often includes the purchase of such items as industrial refrigerators and ovens, lifting jacks, shelving units, and other equipment. Ideology The concept of Leket or \\"gleanings\\" derives from the Torah, ( and ), which specifies that ears of grain that fall from the reaper's hand or the sickle while being gathered during the harvest must be left for the poor (along with other agricultural gifts to the poor, as specified in the Torah and elaborated upon in tractate Pe'ah of the Talmud). \\"I think that at a very basic level, it's a very Jewish value to be appalled by food waste,\\" says Joseph Gitler, founder and director of Leket Israel. Some farmers find it unprofitable to harvest all their produce while others cannot pick their entire crop before it begins to rot. In both cases, tens of thousands of tons of fresh fruits and vegetables are wasted each year. Israeli farmers invite Leket Israel to harvest their fields and to give the produce to needy people around the country. More than 40,000 volunteers took part in Project Leket in 2011. In addition, 20 Arab women were employed with full wages and benefits to assist in the picking. Through its activities, Leket Israel promotes the idea of peaceful co-existence. \\"We had an organization that had 25 employees, all Jewish, and suddenly, we have 20 Israeli-Arab employees, and it‚Äôs been a very positive experience,\\" says Gitler. Former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon allowed Leket Israel volunteers to pick oranges from his 15-dunam orchard in Ramot HaShavim near Kfar Saba. He was approached by the organization after one of its scouts spotted the unharvested fruit. Researchers have found that more than one-third of Israeli children live below the poverty line. Many children attend school without eating a nourishing breakfast or bringing lunch from home. In 2006, Hands on Tzedakah, a public charity based in Boca Raton, Florida, approached Leket Israel to create a program to provide school children with a minimum of one healthy meal per day. Leket Israel volunteers prepare and deliver more than 4,500 mid-morning meals to students at 70 schools around Israel. Each school day, the children receive a freshly baked roll filled with hummus, cream cheese, yellow cheese, or tuna, and a fresh fruit or vegetable. \\"This is the kind of program that builds and brings together all segments of the community,\\" according to Shimon Pepper, Executive Director of the Rockland County, New York Jewish Federation.

Since September 2020, the ambassador is Etienne Le Harivel de Gonneville. French Residency Bromska palatset The French Residency is one of the last town houses built in Stockholm. It is named the \\"H√¥tel Broms\\" or \\"Bromska palatset\\" and is located on Narvav√§gen 26. The house was built by Emil Broms, who was the main share-holder of mining companies in G√§llivare (Northern Sweden). He had the house built for his family on a land he bought in the heart of the district of √ñstermalm. The property was bought by the French state in 1921 and it officially became the Embassy of France in Sweden in 1947. While the different services have moved in 1997 to Kommend√∂rsgatan 13, the H√¥tel Broms is now the official residency of the French ambassador in Sweden.

The name itself is a fairly accurate description of the process. Literally, a grid of circles of known diameter is etched to the surface of the sheet metal to be formed. After the part is formed, the circles have been stretched into ellipses. By measuring the longest part of the ellipse (called the ‚Äúmajor strain‚Äù) and the shortest part of the ellipse (called the ‚Äúminor strain‚Äù), it is possible to determine how close any stamped part is to splitting or fracturing. The goal of using circle grid strain analysis is to predict potential problems before they become problems. Once you have a forming problem, chances are circle grid analysis won‚Äôt be able to help you, unless it‚Äôs intermittent enough to form a ‚Äúgood‚Äù part from time to time.

It is a brick structure built in 1910 in the Classical Revival architectural style, and was designed by James Knox Taylor, supervising architect for the Treasury Department. The post office serves the ZIP Code 12866, covering the city of Saratoga Springs. At the time of its construction and opening it had one of the most elaborate lobbies of any post office in the state. Two murals depicting the city's race track were added to it in the 1930s. The lobby has since been altered somewhat, but enough of the building's integrity and original design remains that it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. It had already been a contributing property to the Broadway Historic District since that was first designated in 1978. Building The post office is set back somewhat from Broadway. There are mature trees and some landscaping between the sidewalk and street. It is one of four notable buildings at the busy intersection. Across the street is the city's Italianate city hall. On the far corner is the elaborate, massive Ainsworth Building, and the 1916 Beaux-Arts marble Adirondack Trust Company building faces the post office across Church Street. It is rectangular, one story high, three bays by four with a flat roof and faced in yellow pressed Roman brick on a foundation of finished granite. Both marble and limestone are used as trim. Above the window level a limestone egg-and-dart course goes around the building. Above it is an entablature with a frieze decorated with a geometric pattern of red and yellow brick. The cornice is dentilled with plain modillions and shallow panels between. The short roof parapet has limestone coping and, at a higher section over the main entrance, foliated brackets. The middle bay on the east (front) elevation projects. It is a semicircular arch with a plainly molded archivolt supported by freestanding Doric columns of veined and polished marble. A recessed bronze screen has windows in the top and the main doors below. Granite steps with a central bronze rail lead up to it. The original heavy bronze doors are still in place although they have been funcationally replaced by modern aluminum doors. A Greek key design is embellished around the doors, and \\"POST OFFICE\\" is written above. The flanking windows, and the easternmost bays on the north and south facades, have a similar treatment except for the columns being pedestaled on a balustrade. The other window openings on the north and south facades are recessed, their plain limestone sills supported by brackets. Their arches have windows with radiating wooden muntins. A small vertical window is located between the easternmost, projecting bay and the next one. On the south facade a wheelchair ramp climbs up and offers access at this point. The north side has an open brick loading dock that covers part of the rear. Inside, the lobby has a 14-foot‚Äìhigh (4.3 m) plaster coffered ceiling with a central leaded glass skylight, curved to match the angle of the rear wall. The walls themselves are lined with segmented recessed arches, topped by an egg-and-dart cornice. The entrance arch has a similar surround. On either side of the vestibule are murals by Guy P√®ne du Bois entitled Saratoga in the Racing Season. The floor has modern carpeting; a white marble baseboard and green marble wainscoting surround part of the lobby. A 9-foot‚Äìhigh (3 m) screenline with post office boxes divides it in half. Teller windows are on the north side. History Saratoga Springs has had a post office since founder Gideon Putnam built its first resort hotel in 1802. The first two were run out of local merchants' stores. Later in the 19th century it was moved to a local office building, like the first two located on Broadway, the city's main street. The present site was acquired for almost $125,000 ($ in contemporary dollars) in the early years of the 20th century. It was one of the last buildings designed by James Knox Taylor, then Supervising Architect for the Treasury Department. He had already established the neoclassical style of the day as his preferred choice for public buildings, to reflect an embrace of the classically influenced ideals of the country's Founding Fathers. The Saratoga post office shares its arched openings with two others in New York (Johnstown and Ithaca), but its Renaissance Revival touches, the columns and decorative brickwork, are found only one other of his post offices in New York, in Olean, designed around the same time. Both aspects make it harmonize well with the other buildings on the intersection, the city hall and Ainsworth Block across Broadway with similarly Italian Renaissance-inspired features and the classically inspired decor on the bank building on the neighboring corner of Church Street. At the time it was opened the building's lobby was one of the most elaborate in the state. This has been compromised by the removal of the screenline and the substitution of a modern partition wall in the center. The murals were added in 1936‚Äì37 under the Treasury Relief Art Project. The loading dock was added in 1961, and in 1974 the lobby was altered. The original exterior light fixtures have also been replaced. There have been no other major changes to the building.

The station was designed to provide service over digital services in areas where Real was not available in a local form. Real Radio Digital was primarily provided on the MXR regional digital multiplexes. It was not available on MXR Yorkshire (where Real Radio (Yorkshire) was carried instead) or on MXR South Wales & Severn (Real Radio (Wales)); the Switch Scotland (Central Scotland regional multiplex) carries Real Radio (Scotland). Real Digital initially broadcast to the North West, North East, and West Midlands on the regional DAB multiplexes. It replaced a digital-only easy listening service named 'Smooth', which GMG had launched with the MXR multiplexes in 2001; the relaunch of 100.4 Jazz FM as Smooth FM in 2004 led to Real Radio Digital replace the digital Smooth service on MXR NW, and the following year's replacement of 102.2 Jazz FM, which broadcast on the other MXR multiplexes, with Smooth FM saw the Real digital service rolled out to the other areas without their own regional Real Radio service - the West Midlands and North East. (In Yorkshire and the Severn Estuary, where MXR already carried Real stations for Yorkshire and Wales, a feed from jazzfm.com took the vacated slot for a time.) In 2007, GCap Media sold the Century Network of stations to GMG, which consisted of FM/DAB stations in the North East and North West and a digital-only Century broadcast in London, Cardiff and Birmingham. This move made Century and Real sister operations. Century Digital was removed from DAB in Birmingham and Cardiff, with listeners in these areas advised by the Century Digital website to instead listen to Real on the regional multiplex. In March 2007, Century Digital ceased on DAB in London and was replaced by Real Digital.DAB news, 2007 The decision was taken to remove Real Digital from DAB in the North East and North West, in favour of continuing the local Century services (which were becoming more integrated into the Real network). In May 2008, Real Digital was removed from the North East to make way for Rock Radio.DAB in 2008 However, Real Digital ultimately remained available in the North West for a time. In October 2008, the launch of the new version of Jazz FM (UK) saw GMG remove Real Digital from the North West, West Midlands and London multiplexes and instead use the space for Jazz FM. (A relay of London's 102.2 Smooth Radio was also removed from the MXR South Wales & Severn multiplex for Jazz FM). This in effect ended all DAB carriage of Real Digital. In 2009, Century in the North West and North East was renamed Real Radio; this led to the Real name returning to DAB in these areasDAB in 2009 and the demise of the final use of the Century name. On Sky Real Radio Digital was also available nationally within the radio section of Sky Digital. This continued as an automated music service for a time after Real Digital's closure, then subsequently became a relay of Real Radio (Wales). The Sky relay of the Welsh station ceased on 22 April 2014, when, ahead of the relaunch of Real Radio stations as Heart services on 6 May, Real Radio Wales was withdrawn from satellite and replaced with The Arrow.

Julien David Le Roy (), also Leroy (6 May 1724 in Paris - 28 January 1803 in Paris) was an 18th-century French architect and archaeologist, who engaged in a rivalry with Britons James Stuart and Nicholas Revett over who would publish the first professional description of the Acropolis of Athens since an early 1682 work by Antoine Desgodetz. Le Roy succeeded in printing his Ruins of the Most Beautiful Monuments of Greece four years ahead of Stuart and Revett. Athens study Stuart and Revett were researching Athens since 1748Bergdoll, p. 16 but Le Roy had an advantage in accessing the ruins due to good relations between France and the Ottoman Empire.Lefaivre, Tzonis p. 358 Le Roy's studies, supported by Comte de Caylus and his art circle, recruited the finest engravers and architects to produce illustrations, and became sort of a national project for the pre-revolutionary France.Bergdoll, p. 18 Le Roy spent only three months in Athens (compared to three years taken by Stuart and Revett); he researched Greek monuments in a wide, universal cultural context, comparing them with Roman legacy, and travelled to Constantinople to study the Byzantine development of the Greek tradition. Le Roy rushed his Les Ruines des plus beaux monuments de la Gr√®ce (Ruins of the Most Beautiful Monuments of Greece) into print in 1758. Stuart and Revett delayed their first volume till 1762Bergdoll, p. 16 and discouraged their readers by filling it with lesser monuments instead of the expected Parthenon. The delay provided them time to examine Le Roy's book and pinpoint its weaknesses and errors in a bitter critique. Le Roy's success alienated not only the Britons who harshly attacked his book and theories but also Piranesi who considered the Frenchman a threat to his national pride and, worse, means of subsistence.Bergdoll, p. 20 Le Roy responded with a counterargument that an insight in development of a culture is just as worthwhile as meticulous, surgical rendition of antique relics. Unlike the Britons who rushed to copy the Greek models in new buildings, Le Roy stood by his opinion that architecture always follows evolution of the society, and never intended to imitate these models in stone.Bergdoll, p. 19 His book ultimately had a greater impact on practical architecture than Stuart and Revett's, for example, launching the modern tradition of using colonnade in urban design. Both British and French projects began as mere attempts to expand knowledge of Greek antiques beyond the work of Desgodetz and eventually grew into comparative discourse over Roman and Greek art, starting a wide public debate on their relative merits.Bergdoll, p. 17  Biography  Julien- David Le Roy, the son of a court clockmaker Julien Le Roy, studied architecture under Jacques-Fran√ßois Blondel (le petit Blondel), and travelled to Rome on an Academy scholarship in 1751‚Äì1754.Bergdoll, p. 18 He had three brothers: Pierre (1717‚Äì1785) another clockmaker, Jean-Baptiste (1720-1800), a physicist and Encyclop√©diste, and Charles (1726‚Äì1779), a physician as well as an Encyclop√©diste. Le Roy's ideas were materialized in the Church of Saint Genevieve, a project led by his friend Jacques-Germain Soufflot.Bergdoll, p. 29 Le Roy directly advised Soufflot on the philosophy and history of architecture and provided a classic single-sheet scheme of principal Christian church types, solving the problem of marrying the dome with cross-shaped floorplan. He was protected by Marc-Ren√© Voyer d'Argenson, marquis de Voyer (1722-1782), for who he worked in his h√¥tel de Voyer in Paris, near the Palais-Royal in the 1760's.

Born in the Savoy, he was the son of a low-ranking officer in the Habsburg military. In 1789, during the French Revolution, he went to France, where he received a commission in the French Army. In 1793, his troops deposed him, for his strict discipline, but he was immediately reinstated and rose rapidly through the ranks of the general staff. He helped to push the Austrians back to Bavaria in the 1796 summer campaign, and then covered Moreau's retreat to France later that year, defending the Rhine bridge at H√ºningen until the last units had crossed to safety. Ferino commanded the southernmost wing of Army of the Danube in 1799, and participated in the battles of Ostrach and Stockach. Napoleon awarded him the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor in 1804; in 1805, Ferino became a Senator, and in 1808, raised him to Count of the Empire. His name is engraved in the Arc de Triomphe. Family Barth√©lemy Ferino was born in Craveggia, in the Vigezzo valley, near the border of the Swiss Confederation. This section was known as the Piedmont which, at the time of his birth, was under the rule of the House of Savoy.\\"Pierre Marie Barth√©lemy Ferino\\" in Charles Mulli√©, Biographie des c√©l√©brit√©s militaires des arm√©es de terre et de mer de 1789 √† 1850, Paris, 1852. His father, Bernardo Ferino, was an officer of the so- called Bender regiment and served in the Austrian military during the Seven Years' War. Barth√©lemy Ferino entered Austrian military service in 1768 and in 1779 he was brevetted as captain. His promotions in the Habsburg military were few. Responding to perceived inequalities, at the time of the French Revolution he moved to France and, in 1792, acquired a commission in the French army.Whitelaw, A. \\"Barth√©lemy Ferino.\\" The popular Conversations lexicon. London: Blackie and Sons, 1874, vol. 4, p. 330. Service in French Revolutionary Wars On 1 August 1792, he was named lieutenant colonel of the Legion of Biron, also called the Chasseurs of the Rhine, part of the Army of the Rhine under the over-all command of Philippe Custine. Ferino was named general of brigade in December, and on 23 August 1793, he became general of division, in command of the advance guard. Although he was deposed for maintaining discipline too strictly, he was immediately reinstated; he was assigned to the Army of the Moselle under the command of Jean Victor Moreau. In 1795, he was appointed Lieutenant General of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle, and in 1796, Commander of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle, Right Wing. With this force, he participated in the Battle of Landau, and helped Moreau and Jean-Baptiste Jourdan to push the Austrian army from the Rhineland into Bavaria in the 1796 summer campaign. He defeated the Conde's Emigr√© Army at Bregenz, on Lake Constance. In the subsequent Austrian resurgence, he maintained the right flank's protective cover of Moreau's main army as the French retreated through southern Germany in August and September of that year; he participated in the Battle of Schliengen. When the French withdrew after Schliengen, he defended the Rhine crossing at H√ºningen, north of the Swiss city of Basel, until the last French units crossed the river to safety. During the attempted royalist coup in 1797, Ferino was accused of having royalist leanings and removed from his command, but restored to active duty in 1798 as part of the Army of the Mainz (). He continued the rigorous discipline for which he became known and his troops maintained good order, despite the many abuses by other troops that occurred in the Rhine region. In late 1798, he commanded the former Army of the Mainz, now called the Army of Observation when, in November, Jean Baptiste Jourdan assumed command and organized the army for the planned invasion of southern Germany in 1799. In the War of the Second Coalition, as commander of the I. Division of the Army of the Danube, Ferino led the division across the Rhine River at H√ºningen, passed through the Duchy of Baden and marched toward Schaffhausen. He was familiar with this territory from the 1796 campaign. His division secured the right flank for Jourdan's main force for the Battle of Ostrach on 21 March 1799. Although his troops remained outside of the primary battle zone, during the retreat, a portion of his column was cut off by Archduke Charles' army, and captured.Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, A Memoir of the operations of the army of the Danube under the command of General Jourdan, taken from the manuscripts of that officer, London, Debrett, 1799, pp. 175‚Äì179. In the French withdrawal from Ostrach, he again secured the flank, and retraced his steps west toward Bodman, a small village on the furthest western point of Lake Constance, near Stockach. From there, he guarded the main army against an Austrian approach from Switzerland at the Stockach in March 1799.Ramsey Weston Phipps, The Armies of the First French Republic, volume 5: \\"The armies of the Rhine in Switzerland, Holland, Italy, Egypt and the coup d'etat of Brumaire, 1797-1799,\\" Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1939, pp. 49‚Äì50. While maintaining a cordon between the Austrian forces approaching from Switzerland, under command of Baron von Hotze, most of Ferino's division participated in a simultaneous assault in the first hours of the engagement at Stockach. With part of Joseph Souham's Center (the II. Division of the Army of the Danube), they assaulted the Austrian left, but were stopped by overwhelming numbers. Ferino tried to attack again, initiating his assault with a cannonade, followed by an attack through the woods on both sides of the road between Asch and Stockach. Two columns made two attacks, both of which were repulsed; finally, Ferino added his third column to the assault, which resulted in the Austrian reformation of the line, cannons at the center firing a heavy cannonade. Ferino could not respond, because he had run out of artillery ammunition, but his troops fixed bayonets and charged the village of Wahlwiess, capturing it despite the heavy fire and massive numbers. They were forced to relinquish the village at darkness. Relationship with Napoleon Immediately after the coup of 18 brumaire, Napoleon appointed Ferino as commander of the 8th Division. He became a member and grand officer of the L√©gion d'honneur on 19 frimaire, and 25 prairial, respectively. Napoleon appointed him to the Senate of Florence, and made him a Count of the Empire in 1808, and then appointed him as military governor of the Netherlands. In 1813, Ferino organized the National Guard of the Netherlands. Relationship in the Restoration As a member of the French Senate, Ferino voted to request Napoleon's abdication in 1814 and in 1815 did not participate in the Hundred Days, Napoleon's return from exile on Elba. After the restoration, Louis XVIII maintained Ferino's honors and rank, and awarded him a certificate of naturalized citizenship.Peter Sahlins. Unnaturally French. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2004, , p. 415. This allowed him to continue to sit in the new Chamber of Peers. F√©rino died in Paris on 28 June 1816.

A slow left-arm orthodox bowler, Cranfield took 621 wickets in first-class cricket, and took 100 or more wickets in a season in three successive years at his peak. Cranfield first played for Somerset in 1897, and took five wickets on his debut. Somerset hoped that he would be able to replace Ted Tyler, whose career was effectively ended in 1900 when he was repeatedly no-balled for throwing. At his prime, Cranfield was capable of bowling with significant curve, sufficient to allow him to place almost all of his fielders on the leg side. However, he lacked consistency, particularly regarding the length of his bowling. In 1901, 1902 and 1903, Cranfield took 100 or more wickets in first- class cricket, peaking in the middle year, when he claimed 141, at an average of 18.56. He was invited to play for representative sides twice, appearing for the Players against the Gentlemen at Scarborough in 1902, and then for the \\"Players of the South\\" against the Gentlemen in 1904. Despite his professional status, Cranfield also appeared for the \\"Gentlemen of England\\" in 1903 against Oxford University, taking seven wickets in the match. His best bowling performance came the following year, when he claimed eight wickets for 39 runs against Gloucestershire. In all, he took five wickets in an innings 47 times, and on twelve occasions he claimed 10 wickets in a match. Cranfield's batting was lowly regarded, and club historian Eddie Lawrence describes him as \\"an obvious number eleven in the batting order\\". Cranfield was rarely a healthy man, and in January 1909, he caught a chill while watching a football match. Four days later, he died of pneumonia. His brother, Lionel Cranfield, and his nephew (Lionel's son) Monty Cranfield both also played first-class cricket.

Despite its name, it is not actually an act; Section 401 states, however, it can be referred to as \\"Credit Repair Organizations Act\\". The statute was signed by President Bill Clinton on September 30, 1996. The law was intended to prevent credit repair organizations from engaging in unfair business practices which may result in financial hardship for consumers, particularly those of limited economic means or who are uneducated. The purposes of the Credit Repair Organizations Act is to ensure that prospective buyers of credit repair services from credit repair organizations are provided with the information necessary to make an informed decision. It intends to protect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising and business practices by credit repair organizations. It enumerates prohibited practices, required disclosures, contract requirements, liability, and penalties for non-compliance and procedure to report non-compliance. One of the more important areas covered by CROA is how credit repair organizations can get paid. It is the general consensus that a credit repair company can only be paid after services have been rendered. This can be done using a monthly fee model where companies charge clients on a monthly basis after services are rendered or on the more modern pay after deletion model where clients only pay after items are deleted from the credit report.

Most of the woodland is a nature reserve in public ownership which is sometimes referred to as Glengarriff \\"forest park\\" or \\"state forest\\". Glengarriff Forest is one of the best examples in the country of oceanic sessile oak woodland. It is part of the much larger Glengarriff Harbour & Woodlands Special Area of Conservation (SAC).SAC Site Synopsis , National Parks and Wildlife Service History In the eighteenth century the woods were acquired by the White family for whom the title Earl of Bantry was created. The Earls of Bantry were responsible for planting some of the trees which are alive in the twenty-first century. In 1955, ownership of 380ha of the woods passed to the state which used them for commercial forestry purposes. Extensive planting of conifers occurred, and many of the oldest oak trees were felled or ring-barked. In the 1970s, the ecological value of the remaining areas of oak was recognised and in 1991 a Nature Reserve was designated. Glengarriff Woods Nature Reserve covers some 300ha and is managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service for conservation and amenity. Some conifers have been replaced with oak trees. Flora and fauna Sika deer have been recorded, but regeneration of the forest suffers less from grazing than the similar woods at Killarney where there is a larger deer population. The mild climate favours Hiberno-Lusitanian species, such as the Kerry slug, which are to be found in south-west Ireland and the Iberian peninsula. The Kerry slug thrives in the forest's oak trees, and is a \\"selection feature\\" of the Special Area of Conservation. Another example of a Lusitanian species to be found in the forest is the Strawberry Tree (Arbutus unedo).Glengarriff Woods Nature Reserve, References Category:Forests and woodlands of the Republic of Ireland Category:Tourist attractions in County Cork Category:Nature reserves in the Republic of Ireland Category:Protected areas established in 1991 Category:1991 establishments in Ireland ","title":"Glengarriff Forest"},{"id":"24618862","text":"John Bennet (1714‚Äì1759) was an early Methodist Evangelist, regarded as being \\"one of Wesley‚Äôs most responsible helpers in Yorkshire, Lancashire and Derbyshire\\".R. Tudur Jones, Congregationalism in England 1662‚Äì1962, London, Independent Press, 1962, p. 155. Life Born at Whitehaugh, near Chapel-en- le-Frith, Derbyshire, he was the youngest son of William Bennet, a yeoman, and Ann his wife, who were members of the local Dissenting Chapel of Dr James Clegg.The famous Congregationalist minister whose diaries have been published, see V. Doe, (ed) The Diary of James Clegg, 1708-55, 3 vols., Derbyshire Record Society, 1978. Having received a good education at the school at Chapel-en-le- Frith and at the hands of private tutors, at the age of about seventeen Bennet attended Findern Academy, near Derby, to study for the Ministry. However, for reasons unknown, Bennet later commenced work as a Justice's Clerk, and later as an independent packman transporting goods across the moors from Sheffield to Macclesfield. While working as a packman Bennet met the itinerant preacher, David Taylor, a former butler of Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, and became his travelling companion. In January 1741 Bennet had an evangelical conversion experience at Hayfield, Derbyshire. In the spring of the following year he met Benjamin Ingham the Moravian, and became his associate. In the Summer of 1742 Bennet first met John Wesley and, impressed by his preaching, became connected with the Methodist movement. As a Methodist preacher Bennet soon established a circuit of religious societies scattered throughout the north of England, later known as \\"John Bennet‚Äôs Round\\". Usually on horseback, Bennet would follow a route from his home at Chinley which took him throughout the northern counties. While serving as a Methodist preacher Bennet not only served as an itinerant preacher but he was, as Frank Baker remarked; \\"one of the architects of early Methodist connexionalism\\".F. Baker, John Bennet and early Methodist polity, Proceedings of the Wesley Historical Society, vol. xxxv, 1965, pp. 1‚Äì4. Bennet was highly influential in the introduction of the first annual Methodist conference, not only providing the idea for such a conference, providing a detailed account of that meeting. Bennet is also credited with establishing the first Methodist Circuit Quarterly Meeting which took place \\"at Major Marshall‚Äôs at Todmorden Edge on Tuesday 18th October, 1748\\".Bennet‚Äôs diary, S. R. Valentine, Mirror of the Soul: the diary of an early Methodist preacher, John Bennet, 1714‚Äì1754, Methodist Publishing House, Peterborough, 2002, 18 October 1748. Under Bennet's supervision, such Quarterly Meetings were introduced elsewhere and became a key feature of Methodist organization. Apart from his preaching activities, Bennet will be remembered for his marriage to the widow Grace Murray on 3 October 1749, a woman who at the time of Bennet's proposal was already apparently engaged to be married to no less a person than John Wesley himself. This affaire de coeur, and Bennet's Calvinistic views which stood in sharp contrast with Wesley's Arminianism, led to Bennet's departure from Methodism. In 1752 Bennet, after a fierce debate with Wesley, seceded from the Methodist Church in Bolton, Lancashire, taking a large segment of the Methodist society with him. He served as minister at Bolton for the following two years. In 1754 Bennet, now ordained as a congregationalist Minister, pastored a Church in the village of Warburton, Cheshire. On 24 May 1759, Bennet, fatigued with much preaching and constant sickness, finally died at the age of forty-five. Traditionally Methodist historians loyal to Wesley have dismissed Bennet as \\"an incorrigible Dissenter\\",G. E. Harrison, Son to Susanna, London, Nicholson & Watson, 1937, p. 144. or as \\"a treacherous, unfriendly man\\".C. E. Vulliamy, John Wesley, London, Geoffrey Bles, 1933, p. 214. A more accurate appraisal of Bennet is given by Nehemiah Curnock, when he stated that Bennet was \\"one of the most successful of the north-country evangelists\\".The words of N. Curnock, (ed.) J. Wesley, The Journal of John Wesley, London, Epworth Press, 1938, 3: 375n. As James Everett remarked: \\"few men were more useful in the early stages of Methodism than he\\".J.

It is notable for its beauty, for being one of the last manuscript Bibles written before the invention of printing in the West, and for its possible connections with the Gutenberg Bible.Library of Congress, Giant Bible of Mainz . Accessed 8 October 2009. Place and date of production The Bible's colophon records that the scribe began work on April 4, 1452 and finished on July 9, 1453. Around this time large Bibles, designed to be read from a lectern, were returning to popularity for the first time since the twelfth century. In the intervening period, small hand-held Bibles had been usual. Although the place of production cannot be known with certainty, several pieces of evidence link it to Mainz, including the style of decoration. The style of the script also suggests an origin somewhere in the Middle or Lower Rhine region, and the Bible is known to have been owned by Mainz Cathedral from at least 1566. Description Detail of another page The Bible was written by a single scribe on parchment of high quality. The pages measure 576 x 405mm (22.6 x 15.9in) and the text is arranged in 2 columns of 60 lines, with wide margins. There are decorations in a range of styles, by more than one artist. The decoration was never completed, for unknown reasons. Only a few pages in the first volume have the complex and finely drawn illuminated borders the Bible is known for. The Bible is bound in 2 volumes, with 244 leaves in the first and 214 in the second. It is likely that one preliminary and two end leaves are missing. The binding is of plain pigskin over wooden boards and is more or less contemporary with the rest of the book.De Simone, Daniel P.Giant Bible of Mainz. Accessed 8 October 2009. The text block is secured by nine cords with head and tail bands of red, white, and green silk. Library of Congress Giant Bible of Mainz. Accessed 1 May 2015. The text of the Bible has been little- studied but is close to other Vulgate Bibles of the period. Owners The provenance of the Bible is known from 1566 onwards. In that year Heinrich von Stockheim of Mainz Cathedral deposited it in the cathedral library. It is unclear if he was donating it to the cathedral or simply transferring it to the library from the chantry. In 1631 the library was seized as a prize of war by Gustavus Adolphus II of Sweden, who gave the Bible to one of his officers, Bernard of Saxe-Weimar. It remained in Bernard's family until sold to Lessing J. Rosenwald, via the bookseller Hans P. Kraus, in 1951. In 1952 Rosenwald donated it to the Library of Congress. The Bible is in very good condition, suggesting that it was never regularly read. There are no thumb-marks and very little discoloration to the outer margins. It was foliated in the nineteenth century. Relationship to Gutenberg Bible The Giant Bible was written at the same time as Johannes Gutenberg was printing his Bible, and possibly in the same town. The Gutenberg Bible was clearly modelled on the large-format manuscript Bibles being written at this time, for instance in its page size and its wide margins. There has been speculation that the Giant Bible was a particular influence on Gutenberg, but the evidence for this is limited. Gutenberg's typeface is in the same textura style, but it does not seem that the hand of the Giant Bible's scribe was the model for it. The text of the Giant Bible is not especially close to the Gutenberg Bible. Several animals, humans and flowers featured in the decorated borders added to some pages are closely related to figures in the Princeton University copy of the Gutenberg Bible and also in the work of the Master of the Playing Cards. It is assumed that the same model book was used in each case. There has been speculation that the Master of the Playing Cards worked on the Giant Bible, and may also have been an associate of Gutenberg, though there is no hard evidence for this. The Princeton copy of the Gutenberg Bible seems to have been decorated by a different artist to the Giant Bible.

With only a propeller on his head, players control the quirky robot using only the arrow keys - interacting with the environment in order to advance and learn more about their surroundings. The game focuses on puzzle solving and the unraveling of a continuous story that require the player to use the environment in various ways, such as pushing boxes around, destroying floors, manipulating chemicals, using automated guns and activating terminals and trigger beams. However, the core of the game requires the player to time travel back in time, and interact with his past selves in order to solve a puzzle. Doing so might cause a temporal paradox that may create an impossible situation - however the game allows these transgressions and only gives a score penalty for such acts - often resulting in a butterfly effect. Online rankings Temporal features an online leader-board that allows players to upload their records and compete with each other, trying to find faster and better ways to solve the puzzles of the game. The leader-boards can be accessed from the official site of the game.

A combination of costly infrastructure and players' unwillingness to deposit money forced the company to rethink its business model. Co founders Richard Skelhorn and Alex Holt have stayed in the online gaming arena having set up bgo.com. Gaming model Players first had to download client software to participate. They were then able to compete against friends, or against people of a similar skill level (through its own proprietary 'SmarkRank' calculation), in online games with a small prize pot on offer. Most games cost from 20c, (rising to maximum of $10) so the stakes were correspondingly low. The service had a cap on the amount of money a player may deposit each month, so potential losses were limited. One advantage of this model was a reduced number of griefers, which Eurogamer considered to be worth the price of entry, and an over-18 age restriction limiting the amount of immature chatting. Cheating was controlled by 24-hour human oversight and compulsory anti-cheat software called 'TAC' running alongside Steams VAC2 software.

Background and early career  Liu Congjian was born in 803, during the reign of Emperor Dezong. His father Liu Wu was then serving as an officer under Li Shigu the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), who ruled the circuit in de facto independence from the imperial government.Old Book of Tang, vol. 161. As of 819, Li Shigu's brother and successor Li Shidao was in a war against the imperial government, then under the rule of Emperor Dezong's grandson Emperor Xianzong, and the imperial forces were converging on Pinglu. He commissioned Liu Wu to command troops to resist the forces commanded by Tian Hongzheng, the military governor of Weibo Circuit (È≠èÂçö, in modern Handan, Hebei). To endear himself to Liu Wu, he had Liu Congjian made a junior officer at his headquarters. However, Liu Wu was repeatedly losing battles to Tian, and Li became suspicious of Liu Wu's intentions. At one point, Li decided to have Liu Wu executed, so he recalled Liu Wu from Yanggu (ÈôΩÁ©Ä, in modern Liaocheng, Shandong), where his troops were stationed, under the guise of consultation, intending to execute Liu Wu when he got to the circuit capital Yun Prefecture (). Once Liu Wu arrived, however, Li, being counseled by some that executing Liu Wu without evidence of treachery so would destroy morale, changed his mind, and he sent Liu Wu back to Yanggu and gave Liu Wu much treasure. Meanwhile, Liu Congjian, who spent much time with Li's servants, was able to learn what had happened, and informed all of it to his father.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 241. Soon thereafter, Li became resolved to kill Liu Wu. He sent two messengers to Liu's deputy Zhang Xian (), ordering Zhang to execute Liu and take over the army. When the messengers informed Zhang, Zhang, who was friendly with Liu, secretly informed Liu, who immediately put the two messengers to death. Liu then called a meeting with all of his officers, declaring that he was set to turn against Li Shidao and follow imperial orders. When some officers hesitated, he executed them, as well as a number of others that soldiers had resented. The other officers were intimidated into submission. At night, they launched a surprise attack on Yun Prefecture, and the Yun Prefecture defenders, believing that Liu was returning on Li Shidao's orders, allowed them in. Liu Wu controlled the city and arrested Li and his two sons, putting them to death. He then sent messengers to surrender to Tian. To reward Liu for his actions, Emperor Xianzong made Liu the military governor of Yicheng Circuit (Áæ©Êàê, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan). Liu Wu was initially obedient to the imperial government, and continued to be after he was transferred to Zhaoyi Circuit in 820, by which time Emperor Xianzong's son Emperor Muzong was emperor. However, after an incident where the imperial eunuch monitor of the army, Liu Chengjie (), conspired with Liu Wu's subordinate Zhang Wen () to seize control of Zhangyi, Liu Wu killed Zhang and arrested Liu Chengjie. While, under the counsel of his staffer Jia Zhiyan (), Liu Wu returned Liu Chengjie to the imperial government, he subsequently began to rule Zhaoyi semi-independently from the imperial government.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 242. Liu Wu died suddenly in 825. Liu Congjian initially did not announce his death except to the 2,000 soldiers that Liu Wu had brought from Pinglu Circuit initially and, after consulting with the officer Liu Wude (), submitted a petition in Liu Wu's name requesting that Liu Congjian be allowed to succeed him. Jia, however, rebuked Liu Congjian and pointed out that it was improper for him not to publicly mourn his father. Liu Congjian had no response, and so publicly declared Liu Wu's death. When the imperial government, then ruled by Emperor Muzong's son Emperor Jingzong, received the petition in Liu Wu's name, there was much debate among the imperial officials. The former chancellor Li Jiang advocated that the request be denied, and that Liu Congjian be placated by making him a prefect. However, the chancellor Li Fengji and the powerful eunuch Wang Shoucheng, who opined otherwise, prevailed, and Emperor Jingzong made Liu Congjian the acting military governor, and soon thereafter made him military governor. It was said that while Liu Wu was tedious and harsh, Liu Congjian was lenient and graceful toward the soldiers, and the soldiers supported him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 243.  As military governor  In 829, when Shi Xiancheng the military governor of Weibo, who had governed his circuit in de facto independence from the imperial government, offered to surrender control of Weibo, the imperial government commissioned Li Ting () as the new military governor of Weibo. However, Shi's soldiers opposed, and they mutinied, killing Shi. When Li Ting subsequently arrived, the Weibo soldiers, under the leadership of He Jintao, launched a surprise attack on him, inflicting much casualties and forcing him to flee.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 244. Liu Congjian launched an army and saved Li Ting. For this achievement, Liu was created the Duke of Pei. It was said that Liu had intended to be faithful to the imperial government, and in 832, he visited the capital Chang'an to pay homage to then-ruling Emperor Wenzong (Emperor Jingzong's younger brother), with the intent to request a transfer (i.e., to surrender control of Zhaoyi Circuit). However, when he got to the capital, he saw that the imperial government lacked direction, and many imperial officials made improper requests to him. He thus lost the respect he had for the imperial government, and never made the transfer request. Instead, in early 833, Emperor Wenzong conferred an honorific chancellor title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi () on him and allowed him to return to Zhaoyi. Later in 833, Yang Yuanqing () the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) fell ill, and the imperial government was determining a successor for him. The chancellor Li Deyu suggested that Liu be transferred to Xuanwu, to end his family's hold on Zhaoyi. Emperor Wenzong did not find the timing appropriate, and declined the suggestion, instead making the former chancellor Li Cheng the military governor of Xuanwu. In 835, Emperor Wenzong, in an attempt to regain power from the powerful eunuchs, who commanded the imperial guards, conspired with the chancellor Li Xun and the general Zheng Zhu to have the eunuchs slaughtered. When the eunuchs discovered the plot, Li Xun, Zheng, and many other officials were slaughtered, including the other chancellors Wang Ya, Jia Su, and Shu Yuanyu, and effectively put Emperor Wenzong under house arrest. Liu, who had been friendly with Wang, protected the slaughtered officials' family members who fled to Zhaoyi. He further submitted harshly-worded petitions to the imperial government, openly questioning whether the slaughtered officials committed any crimes at all. The eunuchs tried to placate Liu by giving him the honorific title of acting Situ (Âè∏Âæí, one of the Three Excellencies), but Liu's petitions continued, and he eventually submitted four, continuing to call for the chancellors' posthumous rehabilitation. It was said that it was only after Liu's petitions that the powerful eunuchs, led by Qiu Shiliang, became apprehensive and allowed Emperor Wenzong, as well as the new chancellors Zheng Tan and Li Shi, to exercise some of their authorities.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 245.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 247. In 839, in the midst of a controversy as to which of two claimants, Xiao Ben () and Xiao Hong (), if either at all, was the true long-lost brother of Emperor Wenzong's mother Empress Dowager Xiao, after Xiao Ben was judged to be Empress Dowager Xiao's brother, Xiao Hong fled to Zhaoyi and requested help from Liu. Liu submitted a petition on Xiao Hong's behalf. Emperor Wenzong ordered a new investigation, which concluded that neither Xiao Ben nor Xiao Hong was Empress Dowager Xiao's brother; both were exiled.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 246. Meanwhile, Liu continued to accuse Qiu of crimes, while Qiu accused Liu of having designs against the imperial government. After Emperor Wenzong died in 840 and was succeeded by his brother Emperor Wuzong, Liu offered a large horse to Emperor Wuzong, who declined the tribute. Liu believed that Qiu was the one who persuaded Emperor Wenzong not to accept the tribute and, in anger, killed the horse, and this act drew further suspicions from the imperial government. It was further said that Liu armed his circuit and conducted commerce to gather wealth such that the neighboring circuits were jealous of and suspicious of him. In 843, Liu fell ill, and he commented to his wife Lady Pei: Liu thus wanted to have his nephew Liu Zhen (whom he adopted as his son. According to Liu Congjian's biography in the New Book of Tang, Liu Congjian had some 20 sons, but they were all still children at the time of his death) succeed him. He planned with a number of staff members on how to induce the imperial government into allowing the succession, but before the preparations could be complete, Liu Congjian died. Liu Zhen's request to succeed him was subsequently denied, and Emperor Wuzong, under the advocacy of Li Deyu, ordered a general campaign against Zhaoyi, eventually defeating Liu Zhen and slaughtering the Liu family.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 248. Liu Congjian's body was disinterred, exposed in the street for three days, and then cut into pieces.

It is the seat of the Archdiocese of Zamboanga. History The first church was originally located at the front of Plaza Pershing, where the present Universidad de Zamboanga stands. The church was designated a cathedral in 1910 when the diocese of Zamboanga was created. In 1943, the cathedral was one of the edifices bombarded by Japanese soldiers during World War II. In 1956, the cathedral was relocated beside Ateneo de Zamboanga University, formerly known as the Jardin de Chino. Features of the cathedral=The original cathedral The cathedral located at the Plaza Pershing was made of wood and concrete. The image of the Immaculate Conception was located at the main altar, with two Jesuit saints Ignatius of Loyola and Francis Xavier on each side. The image of the patroness was said to be spared from the bombs of World War II and was transferred to a road now known as La Purisima Street. The old cathedral at La Purisima (1956-1998) The former structure of the cathedral was designed in 1956. The site was used to be the chapel of the Jardin de Chino. The facade consists of the life-size sculpture of Immaculate Conception at the left side and the bell-tower at right. The chapel of the saints were located inside the area where the image outside was located. The stations of the cross were made of stained glass at each side and the added station, \\"Resurrection\\", was located near the right altar at the confession area. Then the bronze relief of the last supper was located at the day chapel which serves later as the perpetual adoration chapel. The Metropolitan Cathedral (1998-present) Celebrating 100 years Exterior with Bell Tower The Main Altar The present structure of the cathedral was built in 1998-2002 in cruciform, of which the candle-like design is appropriate to the cathedral's patron. Inside the main church is marble statue of the Immaculate Conception designed by Philippine National Artist for Sculpture Napoleon Abueva. Along the aisles are the stained-glass symbolic images of all dioceses in Mindanao from 1910 to 1984. The day chapel at the ground floor is used for weekday masses. Fronting the day chapel is the baptistery with the relic of Our Lady of the Pillar, the patroness of the city. Behind the day chapel is the columbarium with a replica of Michelangelo's \\"Piet√†\\" and the stained-glass images of the 12 apostles around it. The left wing houses the parish office and the adoration chapel, while the convention hall is located in the right wing. The original statue of the Immaculate Conception, which was placed in the main altar of the old church, can be seen at the parish office. The new structure of the Cathedral was designed by Abarro and Associates through the efforts of former Msgr. Crisanto de la Cruz, who said that the decay of the old cathedral's ceiling damaged by termites was one of the reasons why the reconstruction should take place. The design of the new cathedral was unveiled in December 1997. The old structure had been demolished a day after Easter in 1998, preserving its stained glass window and sculpture from the facade, which respectively are located at the rear portion of the new church and at the left side. The Cathedral was solemnly dedicated on December 6, 1999 with Archbishop Ricardo Cardinal Vidal of Cebu and President Joseph Estrada Ejercito as guests of honor. The day chapel, columbarium, baptistery, the multi-purpose hall and office were constructed in 2002. A more recent addition to the Cathedral is the Century Bell Tower, which broke ground on the feast of the Immaculate Conception in 2010. This belfry, located at the Ateneo side of the Cathedral, marked the 100th anniversary of the Archdiocese of Zamboanga. Chapel communities under the cathedral parish *Sta.

It was developed by Creoteam, a company based in Ukraine. The game is notable for combining Quick Time Events and sword battles similar to God of War series, third-person shooting, and a setting similar to S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl. The soundtrack was composed by the Russian electronic band Gameplay Rodan (left) fighting a boss, Yakir The gameplay is divided into sections where a player is encouraged to use either swords or guns. The shooting section is similar to many third- person shooters, while the close-range combat is similar to the God of War series. Boss battles are usually finished using quick time events. Many of the locations in the game are based on real-life Kiev places, such as Maidan Nezalezhnosti and Kiev Pechersk Lavra. Plot The story is set in 2096 in Kiev, Ukraine, a city that turned into the center of the Zone. The Zone was created after a strange interdimensional rift opened, leading the city and all surrounding areas to be infested with outwardly beasts and dangerous anomalies. The rift become known as the Hole. To stop the spread of the Zone, a quarantine was declared, and all the inhabitants of the place became hostages. At first, the Zone was controlled by scientists and militia, but due to monster attacks and strong aggression from the locals, the Zone soon became divided between various bandit clans led by so-called Lords. The city itself and surrounding area of the Zone became known as the Junkyard. Rodan, the main hero of the story, is a Lord of one such clan, who is going to participate in a meeting of Lords. The meeting turns out to be a trap by Lord Mark, the leader of a clan of fanatics who worship him as a messiah. Rodan is forced to fight back with his swords, various weaponry and telekinetic powers granted by the Zone's anomalous power. He soon finds out that there is much more to worry about than just a new clan war, as he is forced to confront an enigmatic and very powerful man whose ambition threatens not only to safety of the Zone, but to the whole world outside. During his journey, Rodan also has to uncover the mystery of his past and the secret of the inter-dimensional rift, the Hole itself. Development A patch was released, updating game to version 1.1. The patch fixed most of the problems with gameplay balance and bring some new effects to the game. It was highly recommended to download the patch, as it improves the game drastically. Collapse: The Rage A stand-alone expansion entitled Collapse: The Rage () was released in 2010. It continues the story of Rodan after the destruction of the Hole. The features include improved ranged and close combat mechanics, new special effects and the \\"Rage\\" mode. Reception The game received mixed reviews. Many critics praised the unusual setting, hack'n'slash mixed with shooting, and soundtrack. However, the game was highly criticised for simplicity of its combat system, repetitive gameplay and poor design of some characters.

It is the old route for US 68 going into rural communities, such as Hobson and Finley in Taylor County and Jessietown and New Market, Kentucky in Marion County. The route is 15.066 miles long and is in some cases more expedient in going between Lebanon and Campbellsville than the scenic highway Route 68. An earlier KY 289 was a road from Golden Pond northward to Eddyville. In 1964/1965, most of the road was inundated due to formation of Lake Barkley. A small portion remained north from Golden Pond but that was decommissioned the next year, and it is now Forest Road 134. Route description KY 289 begins at an intersection with US 68/KY 55 in Campbellsville, Taylor County, heading north on two-lane undivided Lebanon Avenue. The road passes a few businesses before it enters residential areas. The route becomes Old Lebanon Road and passes through more areas of homes and businesses, where it runs to the west of a lake. KY 289 passes to the west of Taylor Regional Hospital as it continues through developed areas and crosses KY 3350. The road leaves Campbellsville and heads into farmland with some residential development, curving northwest and intersecting the eastern terminus of KY 3211. The route continues through a mix of farms and woods with some homes, turning to the north at an intersection with KY 1400. KY 289 runs through more rural areas and comes to an intersection with KY 744. At this point, the route forms a concurrency with KY 744 before KY 744 splits to the west. KY 289 curves to the northeast and reaches a junction with the northern terminus of KY 634. At the KY 634 intersection, the road crosses into Marion County and becomes unnamed, heading into dense forests. The route makes several curves before it continues to the north. KY 289 continues into farmland with some woods and homes and forms a short concurrency with KY 412. The road turns east before curving to the northeast as it heads through more rural areas.

John Murray, London.The Story of Rimini was a poem composed by Leigh Hunt, published in 1816. The work was based on his reading about Paolo and Francesca in hell. Hunt's version gives a sympathetic portrayal of how the two lovers came together after Francesca was married off to Paolo's brother. The work promotes compassion for all of humanity and the style served to contrast against the traditional 18th century poetic conventions. The work received mixed reviews, with most critics praising the language. Background The first mention of The Story of Rimini comes in Hunt's 1811 edition of The Feast of the Poets where he alludes to writing the poem.Roe 2005 p. 127 In October 1811, Hunt started reading various works to develop a theme for his poem and he fixated on the Paolo and Francesca episode in Canto V of Dante's Inferno. The poem was originally intended to be a satire on England during 1811 but it was edited to focus on nature.Roe 2005 pp. 156‚Äì157 Hunt travelled to Hampstead to work on his poem.Roe 2005 p. 166 However, his life was soon interrupted in 1812 when he was put on trial for libel. However, the trial was pushed back, and Hunt visited Taunton at the end of the summer. While there, he continued to work on his poem.Roe 2005 pp. 168‚Äì169 By September 1812, Hunt was busy at work on the poem and he remained there until his trial in December. He was sentenced to two years in prison, and he continued to work on the poem during that time.Roe 2005 pp. 175, 181, 208 In 1813, Lord Byron, the poet, came to visit Hunt and even brought him material on Italy that helped Hunt with his poem.Holden 2005 p. 80 The poem was almost finished by the time Hunt was released from prison in 1815. To raise money to pay a 500-pound fine, he sold The Story of Rimini, The Descent of Liberty, and The Feast of the Poets to the publisher Gale, Curtis and Fenner for 450 pounds. However, Hunt did not send them the works, and the firm backed down from the deal in December 1815. In October 1816, Hunt sent portions of the work to Byron for approval, and the work was edited on the basis of his responses.Roe 2005 pp. 241‚Äì244 In November, Byron served as intermediary between Hunt and the publisher John Murray. On 18 December, Hunt asked for 450 to 500 pounds from Murray as an advance, but Murray believed that the work would not bring in such money. Instead, Murray proposed a limited release of the work with split profits with Hunt retaining the copyright. Hunt soon agreed to the terms as he needed the money, and the work was published in February 1816.Roe 2005 pp. 245‚Äì244 In March, the work brought Hunt 45 pounds, and he sought to have Murray buy the rest of the copyright. Murray declined, which caused a rift between Hunt and the publisher.Holden 2005 p. 100 A close friend of Percy Bysshe Shelley, a line from the poem, \\"very poetry of nature\\", II.47, is quoted in the 1818 edition of Frankenstein and cited as \\"Leigh Hunt's Rimini\\" in Volume 3, Chapter 1. In the 1831 edition, however, the line is quoted in Chapter 18 but there is no attribution. Poem The Story of Rimini describes the background of Paolo and Francesca's story from Dante's Inferno. The purpose was to describe how Francesca was still able to love Paolo even though the two were in hell. The first canto of the work discusses Ravenna and how the Duke of Ravenna wishes to marry his daughter, Francesca, to Duke Giovanni of Rimini. The poem begins with a description of an urban environment that focuses on the bustle of the crowd:Roe 2005 pp. 246, 208 For on this sparkling day, Ravenna's pride, The daughter of their prince, becomes a bride, A bride, to crown the comfort of the land: And he, whose victories have obtained her hand, Has taken with the dawn, so flies report. His promised journey to the expecting court With hasting pomp, and squires of high degree. The bold Giovanni, lord of Rimini. Already in the streets the stir grows loud Of expectation and a bustling crowd. With feet and voice the gathering hum contends. The deep talk heaves, the ready laugh ascends: Callings, and clapping doors, and curs unite. And shouts from mere exuberance of delight, And armed bands, making important way. Gallant and grave, the lords of holiday. And nodding neighbours, greeting as they run. And pilgrims, chanting in the morning sun. (lines I:1‚Äì18) Although the first canto ended with a marriage that seemed to be well received, the second canto describes how the marriage was problematic. Instead of Giovanni himself being there to marry, his brother Paulo was sent to serve as a proxy:Roe 2005 pp. 246‚Äì247 The truth was this:‚Äî The bridegroom had not come. But sent his brother, proxy in his room. A lofty spirit the former was, and proud, Little gallant, and had a sort of cloud Hanging for ever on his cold address Which he mistook for proper manliness. But more of this hereafter. (lines II:18‚Äì24) After the political marriage, Francesca travels to Rimini while describing how there is little ability to make free choices in life. In Rimini, she is kept as a possession and is isolated. However, she falls in love with Paulo. After the two read the story \\"Launcelot of the Lake, a bright romance\\", they believe that the story describes their own situation. Together, they believe that they enter into a paradise type of life. Canto IV introduces how the relationship came to an end. While sleeping, Francesca speaks words that tip Giovanni off to the relationship, and he attacks Paulo. Paulo is stabbed by Giovanni, and Francesca soon after dies because she cannot bear to be without Paulo.Roe 2005 pp. 247‚Äì249 Themes Hunt chose the Paolo and Francesca episode from the Inferno to discuss problems relating to \\"setting authorized selfishness above the most natural impulses, and making guilt by mistaking innocence\\".Roe 2005 qtd p. 9 The tone of the work is one of compassion, and he promoted the idea of universal restoration, a view that came from the preaching of Elhanan Winchester that was connected to the Universalism movement. Hunt's use of such beliefs was a source of criticism lodged against him.Roe 2005 p. 29 Hunt also believed that wisdom was connected to understanding the workings of the human heart, and his understanding of it in The Story of Rimini was later developed in Hunt's Christianism and The Religion of the Heart.Roe 2005 p. 90 Part of the basis for the intimacy and the emotion within the story, especially when Francesca turns to her father before she is forced into marriage, is from Hunt's own emotional reaction after he was sentenced to jail for 2 years and separated from his brother.Roe 2005 p. 181 The landscape of Hampstead influenced the depictions of the land found within The Story of Rimini. He described the land in an impressionistic manner like a painter with a mix of his political beliefs in regards to criticising land enclosure or other rural matters. When Hunt was forced to go to Taunton, the valley became the basis for Hunt's description of Ravenna within the work. The description also marked a change in Hunt's style, as he became more spontaneous in his writing and more familiar in his tone. However, he also made sure to political and social matters.Roe 2005 pp. 169‚Äì170 When describing urban life, Hunt was quite different from William Wordsworth's repulsion regarding crowds; Hunt focused on the sights and sounds of the crowd to represent the human community that Wordsworth ignored.Roe 2005 p. 209 Hunt wanted the poem as a response to poetry written by those like Alexander Pope and \\"to break the set cadence for which Pope was the professed authority, as he broke through the set morals which had followed in reaction upon the licence of many reigns\\".Holden 2005 qtd. p. 81 Within the poem, Hunt attempted to follow the pattern of Wordsworth in Lyrical Ballads by relying on common speech. Hunt felt that too many works dealt with a written language and were disconnected from spoken language. This emphasis on what was deemed natural was in contrast to the 18th century emphasis on the neoclassical rules to poetry and language. Previously, those like Samuel Johnson viewed the common language like that of barbarians and that it was poetry's job to protect society against vulgarity. Although other Romantics turned to Scotland or rural England for their language, Hunt turned to Italian to basis his views of natural language.Roe 2005 pp. 244‚Äì245 Critical response A review in the Edinburgh Review by William Hazlitt praised the poem as a \\"gem of great grace and spirit, and in many passages and in many particulars, of infinite beauty and delicacy\\".Holden 2005 qtd. p. 100 In a letter to Hunt, Hazlitt stated, \\"I have read the story of Rimini with extreme satisfaction. It has many beautiful & affecting passages. You have, I think, perfectly succeeded. I like the description of the death of Francesca better than any. This will do.\\"Holden 2005 qtd. p. 101 A review in the Quarterly Review attacked the poem, which Byron attributed to Hunt's poetic diction. Thomas Moore told Byron: \\"though it is, I own, full of beauties, and though I like himself sincerely, I really could not undertake to praise it seriously. There is so much of the quizzible in all he writes, that I never can put on the proper pathetic face in reading him.\\"Holden 2005 qtd. pp. 100‚Äì101 Nicholas Roe claimed that \\"Hunt reveals a keen observation of gestures, manners and motives: he could readily turn such details to satirical effect [...] but in his poem satirical disruption is smoothed into an attractively 'fluttering impatience' for what will follow [...] Hunt's master of townscape is highlighted by Wordsworth's repulsion from crowds\\". He later argued: \\"The Story of Rimini is structurally satisfying as a narrative, opening with the springtime pageant of Paulo's arrival at Ravenna and closing with a funeral cortege and an autumnal landscape\\" and that it is \\"an artful poem about artful behaviour, in which the malign intrigue of the two dukes is doubled and answered by the gentler dissimulation of the lovers‚Äîsimultaneously transgressive and a discovery of truth.\\"Roe 2005 p. 249 NotesReferences * Blainey, Ann.

Hurst, Nelson and Company Ltd was a railway rolling stock manufacturer based in Motherwell, Scotland. The company also built many railway wagons, as well as trams and trolleybus carosseries for several local authorities. Products=Glasgow Subway A Glasgow Subway 4-wheel carriage. The company built the original trailer carriages for the Glasgow Subway. A batch of 24 four-wheeled vehicles were supplied in 1898. The wheels were of teak, with Bessemer steel tyres, and each had 24 seats, twelve along each side of the carriage. They were similar in style, although shorter than the gripper cars supplied by the Oldbury Railway Carriage and Wagon Company for the opening of the cable-hauled railway in 1896. They were not fitted with a mechanism for gripping the cable, nor did they have automatic brakes, and so relied on the brakes of the gripper cars in operation. Manual hand brakes were provided, and shackles were provided at each corner, so that they could be lowered down onto the tracks at the car sheds pits. Electric lighting was supplied by a jumper cable running from the adjacent gripper car, and the vehicles weighed 4.65 tons. Hurst Nelson displayed one of them at the Earl's Court exhibition centre in London.Wright and Maclean (1997), pp.18, 28 London Underground The company also supplied vehicles for the London Underground. In August 1905, they delivered two battery-electric locomotives, which were used for the construction of the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway, and subsequently for the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway. They were long, with a cab at both ends and a compartment behind one of the cabs, which housed braking and traction control equipment. 80 batteries, arranged as two rows of 40, occupied the central section of the vehicle, which was lower than the cabs. Chloride Electrical Storage Company supplied the batteries, which had to be charged at charging stations. The vehicles weighed 55 tons, and were not fitted with current collector shoes, since none of the rails were electrified during construction.Bruce (1987), p.26 Extensions and improvements to the District Railway (later the District line of the London Underground) in the early 1900s required additional rolling stock, and in 1910 Hurst Nelson received an order for 32 motor cars and 20 trailers, which were similar in both construction and appearance, and were known as C Stock. Traction control used a non-automatic electro-magnetic controller supplied by British Thomson-Houston Co., but the motors were to a new design, which included interpoles. They were the first use of such motors on the Underground, and probably in England. The cars were long, with double doors in the centre, and single doors at either end. Much of the bodywork was made of wood. There were some problems with the motor bogies, and 60 new bogies were provided between 1910 and 1922, although not all were for the Hurst Nelson vehicles, as the problem also affected the D Stock and E Stock, which had been supplied by other manufacturers in 1912 and 1914. The C stock trailer cars were subsequently modified at Acton Works to become motor cars in the 1928 Reconstruction Programme.Bruce (1970), pp.91-92 Surviving vehicles=Still in service The most notable example of Hurst Nelson rail vehicles still in service are the tramcars of the Great Orme Tramway. Seven tramcars were built for the Great Orme in 1902,History at GreatOrme.org site. of which four remain in service today.Great Orme Tramway Centenary Guide, Johanna Firbank, First Edition, published by Conwy County Borough Council, 2002, These vehicles are not preserved, as they have never ceased to be in revenue-earning service. With well over a century of use, they are the longest serving Hurst Nelson products. Preserved trams A small number of trams built by Hurst Nelson, and subsequently withdrawn from service, are now in heritage preservation. * Newcastle 102 - Built 1901, and now preserved at the National Tramway Museum, Crich Derbyshire. Non-operational, it is hoped to bring it into working order in the near order. * Hull 96 / Leeds 6 - Built 1901, and now preserved at Heaton Park Tramway.

She was born in Galveston, the daughter of famed civil rights leader Norris Wright Cuney, who led the Texas Republican Party during and after the Reconstruction Era, and his wife Adelina (n√©e Dowdie), a schoolteacher. In 1913 Cuney-Hare published a biography of her father. Essentially part of the second generation after emancipation, Cuney Hare studied at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston and became an accomplished pianist. She lived in Jamaica Plain, a neighborhood of Boston, most of her adult life. A musicologist, she collected music from across the South and Caribbean in her study of folklore, and was the first to study Creole music. She is most remembered for her final work, Negro Musicians and Their Music (1936), which documents the development of African-American music. Early life and education Maud was born in Galveston, Texas on February 16, 1874 to Adelina (Dowdy, or Dowdie in alternate spelling) and her husband Norris Wright Cuney. Both parents were of mixed race; her father was of majority-white ancestry. Her mother, one of the \\"handsome Dowdy girls,\\" came from Woodville, Mississippi. Her father's ancestry was African, Indian, European, and Swiss-American. The Cuney children were a \\"second family\\" related to a large, wealthy and politically powerful white family headed by Gen. Philip Minor Cuney of Austin County, Texas, who had been born in Louisiana. Norris Cuney was one of eight mixed-race children born to Cuney and his mixed-race slave housekeeper, Adeline Stuart. Philip Cuney acknowledged and freed his children and Stuart before the Civil War. By 1850 Cuney was one of the largest planters and slaveholders in Texas, with 2,000 acres and more than 100 slaves. He had eight white children born to his 'legal' white wives: three children by his second wife, Eliza (Ware) Cuney, who died young; and five by his third wife, Adaline (Spurlock) Cuney. Philip Cuney sent his mixed- race sons Joseph and Norris to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania before the war for their education. Afterward Norris worked on steamboats on the Mississippi River. After the war, he became an established leader in the Texas Republican Party. He served in the Customs Office and later was appointed as Collector of Customs for the port of Galveston.Maud Cuney Hare papers, 1843-1936, Robert W. Woodruff Library of the Atlanta University Center, Inc. He established a business of stevedore workers, employing about 500 men on the docks and organizing a union. Interested in Shakespeare and other great writers, Norris Wright Cuney sang and played the violin; Adelina Dowdy Cuney was a soprano singer and played the piano. Maud and her brother Lloyd grew up in a house filled with music and literature. After completing school at Galveston's Central High School in 1890, Maud Cuney went to Boston to study at the New England Conservatory of Music. There she studied piano with Edwin Klahre and music theory with Martin Roeder. She also studied at Harvard's Lowell Institute of Literature. When white students learned that Maud Cuney and another African American, Florida L. Des Verney, were living in a campus dormitory, some of them tried to have the young women excluded. Fearing financial pressure from white southern families, the Conservatory requested that the women find other lodgings, implying that their safety could not be guaranteed. Maud Cuney told the school that she refused to move. Her father also refused to move her, criticizing the school for dishonoring \\"the noble men and women\\" abolitionists of Massachusetts who had fought against prejudice. Members of the Boston black community spoke out against the Conservatory, as did black students, including Harvard Cambridge student W.E.B. Du Bois. The Colored National League took up the issue, and the Conservatory eventually reversed its position. Though Des Verney moved away, Maud Cuney stayed. She later wrote, \\"I refused to leave the dormitory, and because of this, was subjected to many petty indignities. I insisted upon proper treatment.\\" Boston had a vibrant black community. While studying in Boston, Cuney became part of the Charles Street Circle (or West End Set), meeting at the home of Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin. She became a close friend of W. E. B. Du Bois, who was based in Massachusetts for a time, and they were briefly engaged. Du Bois described Maud vividly as \\"a tall, imperious brunette, with gold-bronze skin, brilliant eyes and coils of black hair.\\" After graduating from the conservatory, Cuney returned to Texas, studying privately with pianist Emil Ludwig in Austin. She taught at the Texas Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Institute for Colored Youths in 1897 and 1898. She chose to oppose racial prejudice when management of the Austin Opera House demanded that Negroes in the audience coming to her performance must be segregated and seated in the balconies. She and Emil Ludwig cancelled the planned concert and performed instead at the Texas Institute for Colored Youths, where no distinction of color was applied.  Marriage  Maud's mother, Adelina Dowdy Cuney, died on October 1, 1895 of tuberculosis. her father died on March 3, 1898 of the same disease, which at the time was considered incurable, as antibiotics had not been discovered. Later that year, Maud married J. Frank McKinley, a doctor 20 years her senior, who like Maud was of mixed race. The McKinleys moved to Chicago, where Dr. McKinley insisted upon \\"passing\\" as Spanish-American. When their daughter Vera was born in 1900, her birth certificate identified her as Spanish-American. Maud, who had been brought up to assert her black heritage, found the deception painful. For a time, she hid her identity as her husband demanded, compensating by working in the settlement movement at the African Methodist Episcopal Institutional Church of Chicago. Eventually she left her husband, taking her baby daughter and returning to Texas. She obtained a teaching job at Prairie View Agricultural and Mechanical College, an historically black college. McKinley filed for divorce in 1902. Maud returned to Chicago for a highly visible custody battle that resulted in the court awarding custody of their daughter to her husband, which was typical of the era. After the divorce, Maud returned to Boston. She married William Parker Hare on August 10, 1904, and from then on used the joint last name \\"Cuney Hare\\". The couple settled at 43 Sheridan Street, Jamaica Plain. Their house is marked by a Bostonian Society plaque, as part of the Boston Women's Heritage Trail. In 1906, Maud gained access to her daughter during the summer months, but Vera died in 1908. Cuney Hare was politically active, and was among the first women to join the Niagara Movement in 1907, an organization founded against segregation. It was a predecessor to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), founded in 1909. Throughout her career as a teacher, performer, and musicologist, Cuney-Hare believed her work contributed to the \\"racial uplift\\" of her people. Career As a teacher of music, Cuney had taught at the Texas Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Institute for Colored Youths in 1897 and 1898; at the settlement house program of the Institutional Church of Chicago during 1900 and 1901; and in Prairie View, Texas in 1903 and 1904. As a performing pianist and lecturer, Cuney Hare collaborated with William Howard Richardson, a Canadian baritone singer, beginning around 1913. They shared an interest in music of the African diaspora and toured together for 20 years. In 1919, they were the first musicians of color to perform in the concert-lecture series at the Boston Public Library. Cuney Hare founded the Allied Arts Center in Boston, to encourage education and performance in the arts. In addition to providing funding and serving as a manager, she performed and lectured there. The Center had a 'Little Theatre' group, and offered classes and performances in art, music, and drama. Although open to all, its focus was the development and support of young black performers, composers, and playwrights. Cuney Hare wrote and directed the play Antar of Araby (1929) about the pre-Islamic poet, Antar Bin Shaddad. The overture was composed by Clarence Cameron White and incidental music by Montague Ring. Cuney Hare did extensive research as a musicologist. She traveled to Mexico, Cuba, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico to collect and study folklore and musical traditions. She was \\"the first music scholar to direct public attention to Creole music,\\" publishing a collection of Six Creole Folk-songs with commentary in 1921. Her personal collection of music and artifacts was extensive, and was used as the basis of exhibits. Cuney Hare wrote numerous articles about black music and arts. Throughout her life, She was a close friend and confidante of noted author and activist W. E. B. Du Bois. She edited a column on music and the arts for The Crisis, the magazine that Du Bois edited for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). She also contributed articles on these topics to the Christian Science Monitor, Musical Quarterly, Musical Observer, and Musical America. Her writing about music culminated in her best-known work, Negro Musicians and Their Music (1936). In it, Cuney Hare documented the development of African-American music, contextualizing it both nationally and internationally. She writes compellingly of the history of African-American music, from its beginnings in Africa, through the diaspora to the United States and elsewhere, to the development of American traditions of Negro spirituals, and finally the newer forms of blues and jazz. She disliked ragtime, and distrusted the unstructured nature of Jazz music, preferring the classical traditions in which she had been trained. The index to the book contains no references to Duke Ellington, Scott Joplin or Louis Armstrong. The book contains extensive details on the lives and music of Negro musicians both in America and abroad, in voluminous footnotes as well as the main text. The second book to address Negro music, and the first by a music scholar, it is described by Josephone Harreld Love as \\"a priceless legacy of accomplished documentation ... valuable for meticulous, sensitive scholarship, discernment, and devotion.\\" Cuney Hare never saw the published book. Suffering from cancer, which prevented her from playing the piano, but not from proof-reading her manuscript, she died before it was published. Maud Cuney Hare died on either February 13 or 14, 1936, in Boston, Massachusetts. A memorial service was held in Boston on February 17, 1936. Maud Cuney Hare is buried in an unmarked grave next to her father and mother in Lakeview Cemetery, Galveston, Texas. Works Among Cuney Hare's many artistic and literary works are the following: * Norris Wright Cuney: A Tribune of the Black People (1913), a biography of her father. * The Message of the Trees: An Anthology of Leaves and Branches (1918), a collection of nature poems, which Cuney Hare edited. * Six Creole folk-songs : with original Creole and translated English text (1921) * \\"Portuguese Folk-Songs, from Provincetown, Cape Cod, Massachusetts\\", The Musical Quarterly [0027-4631], 1928, vol:14 iss:1, pp. 35‚Äì53 * Antar of Araby (1929), a play revolving around the life of the Arab/Abyssinian poet whose \\"valor\\" outshines his status as a slave * Negro Musicians and Their Music (1936), a history of African-American music traditions from Africa to the American jazz age See also *African-American music *Racism in the United States *Norris Wright Cuney *W.

A group of white men attacked African Americans who were engaging in sit-in protests opposing racial segregation. The attack took its name from the ax handles used by the attackers. Background Because of its high visibility and patronage, Hemming Park and surrounding stores were the site of numerous civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s. Black sit-ins began on August 13, 1960, when students asked to be served at the segregated lunch counter at Woolworths, Morrison's Cafeteria, and other eateries. They were denied service and kicked, spit at and addressed with racial slurs. Incident On August 27, 1960, a group of 200 middle aged and older white men (allegedly some were also members of the Ku Klux Klan) gathered in Hemming Park armed with baseball bats and ax handles.https://thecoastal.com/flashback/ax-handle-saturday- jacksonvilles-ugliest-hour/ They attacked the protesters conducting sit-ins. The violence spread, and the white mob started attacking all African Americans in sight. Rumors were rampant on both sides that the unrest was spreading around the county (in reality, the violence stayed in relatively the same location, and did not spill over into the mostly white, upper-class Cedar Hills neighborhood, for example). A black street gang called the \\"Boomerangs\\" attempted to protect the demonstrators. Although police had not intervened when the protesters were attacked, they became involved, arresting members of the Boomerangs and other black residents who attempted to stop the beatings. Nat Glover, who would later work in Jacksonville law enforcement for 37 years, including eight years as Sheriff of Jacksonville, recalled stumbling into the riot. Glover said he ran to the police, expecting them to arrest the thugs, but was told to leave town or risk being killed.Pemberton, John: Florida Times-Union, February 22, 1998, \\"Focus on: Nat Glover\\" Several whites had joined the black protesters on that day. Richard Charles Parker, a 25-year-old student attending Florida State University was among them. White protesters were the object of particular dislike by racists, so when the fracas began, Parker was hustled out of the area for his own protection. The police had been watching him and arrested him as an instigator, charging him with vagrancy, disorderly conduct and inciting a riot. After Parker stated that he was proud to be a member of the NAACP, Judge John Santora sentenced him to 90 days in jail.Weathersbee, Tonyaa: Florida Times-Union, February 4, 2008, \\"The story of a white man who joined the '60s sit-ins\\" Aftermath Snyder Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church hosted community discussions and negotiations following the incident.https://thecoastal.com/buzz/buildingupjax/finding-new- purpose-for-snyder-memorial-church-building Lunch counters in Jacksonville were desegregated in 1961.https://www.jacksonville.com/2016-03-08/stub-301 ReferencesFurther reading * * External links *Ax Handle Saturday, 1960: A day of defiance in black and white (newspaper article) *\\"Ax Handle Saturday\\": A dark day in Jacksonville history occurred 56 years ago Category:1960 in Florida Category:1960 protests Category:August 1960 events Category:Civil rights movement Category:Civil rights protests in the United States Category:History of African-American civil rights Category:History of Jacksonville, Florida Category:History of racism in Florida Category:Riots and civil disorder in Florida Category:African-American history of Florida Category:White American riots in the United States ","title":"Ax Handle Saturday"},{"id":"24619579","text":"Professor Beƒülan Birand Toƒürol (born March 1927 in Istanbul) is a Turkish scientist, best known for her contributions to medical and experimental psychology, some of which were led the way on other studies.

It produces reissues and compilations of musicians such as Sonny Stitt, Eddie Barefield, George Masso, and Eddie Miller. History Progressive Records was founded by Gus Statiras in New York in 1950. When the business declined, Savoy bought and reissued much of the label's catalog, then sold it to Prestige with backing from Bainbridge, a Japanese record company. Progressive had a revival in the late 1970s when Statiras bought the label back from Fantasy, which by then had absorbed Prestige, which continued into the 1980s. Progressive's second era included recordings by Buddy DeFranco, Scott Hamilton, J. R. Monterose, and Al Haig. In the 1980s, Progressive was acquired by George Buck and his Jazzology group and is owned by the George H. Buck Jr. Jazz Foundation.

He played college football for four seasons at the University of Georgia, and was the team's starting quarterback for the 2009 season. Early years Cox started at Independence High School in Charlotte, North Carolina. Cox was named to the 2004 Parade Magazine All- America Team and Super Prep All-Mid Atlantic Team. He was the North Carolina Gatorade Player of the Year. Cox was on the AP first-team All-State team and was a two-time Charlotte Observer Offensive Player of the Year. He also played in the Shrine Bowl of the Carolinas and impressed scouts by going 31-0 as a starting quarterback. Cox was a two-time team captain and was the number 7 rated quarterback in the country by Rivals.com and Tom Lemming of ESPN. He set a North Carolina record with 66 touchdown passes while taking his team to its fifth consecutive state championship his senior year. Cox was named the MVP of the state title game twice. As a junior, Cox threw for nearly 4,000 yards and over 40 touchdowns. As a senior, he completed 240 out of 363 passes for over 4,500 yards and only five interceptions. College career=2005‚Äì2008 Cox was redshirted his freshman year in 2005. Through the first four years of his career at the University of Georgia, Cox had scattered playing time and completed 33 out of 58 pass attempts for 432 yards with five touchdowns and one interception. As a redshirt freshman in 2006, with Georgia trailing Colorado 0-13 at home late in the third quarter, Cox was put in the game to relieve ineffective starter Matthew Stafford. Cox threw for 153 yards and two touchdowns late in the game to lead Georgia to a comeback win, 14‚Äì13. Cox would start one more game in the season, in a 14-9 victory over Ole Miss, but eventually lost his starting job to the highly touted Stafford, who ended up being the first overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft. 2009 While Cox threw for over 1,200 yards and 11 touchdowns and boasted a 146.4 quarterback rating in his first four games of the 2009 season, he did not perform as well in the next few games. Georgia finished 8-5 on the season with Cox as the starter. In Georgia's 52-41 win over Arkansas in Fayetteville, Cox threw for a career-high 375 yards and matched a school record with five touchdown passes. Against #1-ranked Florida, Cox completed 11-of-20 pass attempts for two touchdowns, which was as many as the Gators had allowed all season, but also threw three interceptions in the 17-41 loss. In his final game at Sanford Stadium, the Bulldogs had a 14-point half-time lead. However, Cox threw two interceptions in the fourth quarter. Along with a red-zone fumble (as Georgia was attempting to tie the game), these interceptions sealed a loss against Kentucky, Georgia's first home loss to the Wildcats since 1977. However, Cox was not asked to do much in the final regular season game against #7-ranked Georgia Tech. With Bulldog tailbacks Caleb King and Washaun Ealey combining for 349 rushing yards, Cox managed the game well, completing 8-of-14 passes for just 76 yards and a touchdown in Georgia's 30-24 victory. Coaching career In June 2013, Joe Cox joined the coaching staff at Mallard Creek High School in Charlotte, NC, as the quarterbacks position coach. On December 14, 2013 the Mallard Creek team won its first state championship. In 2014, he became the Offensive Coordinator for Mallard Creek and led the Maverick offense to its second state title on December 13, 2014. On February 3, 2015 it was publicly announced that Joe Cox had left Mallard Creek High School to become a Graduate Assistant for the Colorado State Rams. In January 2016, Cox was promoted to tight ends coach for Colorado State.

Early years Born Bruce Chalmers in San Juan Capistrano, California, Chalmers was orphaned and put up for adoption. As a young boy, he was an avid stamp collector, and wrote to the Imam (King) of Yemen, asking for local postage stamps for his collection. His reply came from the Imam's young son, Muhammad al-Badr, which started a lifelong friendship between the two. Military service After studying Spanish at UCLA, he joined the US Army, serving in the 82nd Airborne in North Africa during the Second World War. He was later posted to Japan where he studied Japanese, but his true passion remained the Arab world. Following his discharge from the army, he moved to Beirut to study Arabic with the assistance of the G.I. Bill. He changed his name to Conde, his grandmother's family name, and claimed to be descended from the French royal family, even though the House of Bourbon-Cond√© became extinct in 1830. Yemen As his correspondence with al-Badr continued, he received an invitation to visit the country. After relocating to Sana'a, Yemen, Conde renounced American citizenship and converted to Islam in 1958. He was granted Yemeni citizenship and a passport. Conde convinced the Imam that Yemen could make money selling postage stamps to collectors and was placed in charge of the country's philatelic office, which eventually caused some friction between Conde and the Minister of Communications. Conde was accused of espionage and expelled from the country and his passport revoked. Without travel documents, he spent three weeks in the Cairo Airport before moving to Beirut, Lebanon where he became a correspondent for Linn's Stamp News. Sharjah Conde eventually found himself invited to the tiny emirate of Sharjah, where he established a post office and again taught the country how to generate revenue from the sale of postage stamps to collectors. In gratitude, the government of Sharjah issued him a passport. North Yemen Civil War Following the overthrow of the Imam of Yemen in 1962, Conde returned to Yemen and enlisted with Royalist forces in the North Yemen Civil War. He eventually rose to the rank of General, while in the meantime overseeing the production of Royalist Yemen postage stamps, which helped to raise funds for the cause. He now called himself H.S.H. Abdurraham B.A. de Bourbon, Prince of Conde claiming that his royal lineage had been recognized and \\"reinstated\\" by the Yemeni Royal Family. Despite serving bravely in the war, the Imam's forces collapsed in 1970, and Conde moved to Spain, and then to Morocco in 1980. Post-war years During the 1980s, he ceased writing for Linn's Stamp News, and wrote instead for Stamp Collector newspaper, owned by Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. In 1984 Conde married Beatrice Dolgorouky, who claimed to have been descended from the Russian / Ukrainian royal families. Conde adopted her son Alexis Brimeyer who spent a lifetime attempting to prove his alleged connection to European royalty. Having given up his US citizenship many years before, Conde eventually found himself once again stateless, without a passport, and unable to leave Morocco. He died there on July 20, 1992.

Their style is based on the fast, melodic skate punk of the mid-to-late 1990s made popular by bands such as NOFX, Lagwagon, and No Use for a Name. The band began in 1999 under the name Don't Look Down and changed to Much The Same in 2001 after a legal dispute with the now-defunct New Jersey band Don't Look Down. They released Quitters Never Win on A-F Records in 2003 and Survive in 2006. The band announced their break-up on April 23, 2007 following their first and only European tour. They reunited for a final farewell performance on March 26, 2011 at Reggie's Rock Club in Chicago. The sold out show featured both fan favorite songs and a few the band rarely, if ever, played live. The band announced on March 30, 2015 that they reunited and would be working on a new album. History Lead singer and guitarist Chris \\"Gunner\\" McGrath and bassist Andy Simon started playing songs together with various people and bands beginning in 1997. When McGrath decided to put out a local punk rock compilation entitled Fun With Dirt, he recruited SKG's drummer, Mike \\"Mook\\" Snoreck, to learn and record the song, and he joined immediately afterward. This marked the official beginning of the band's career. Soon afterward, Simon left to play guitar in SKG, and their bassist Adam Mufich took his place. This lineup went on to play their first appearance on the Vans Warped Tour in Chicago in 2000. Andy Simon later rejoined as a second guitarist in September 2000, only to leave again along with Mufich six months later, but not before recording the band's first CD, the Caught Off Guard EP. Franky Tsoukalas and Matt Haraburda replaced them before the EP was released and their picture appears in the booklet despite the fact that they did not record the songs. In 2001 it was at this point that the band decided they needed to change their name, leading to a rushed search for a new name commenced, producing largely unsatisfactory results. In frustration, McGrath started searching through a thesaurus for any word or phrase that stood out, and \\"much the same\\" stuck out due to its appearance in the lyrics of his side band's song \\"Big Surprise.\\" The band decided the name was fitting, since it described the change of name as being irrelevant to the music of the band, and also served as self-deprecation acknowledging their similarity to many other popular punk bands of the time. Furthermore, at this point the incestuous emigration continued as Matt left to join Andy Simon's new band and SKG's singer/guitarist Dan O'Gorman was invited to join Much The Same. In December 2001 the new lineup recorded a 3-song demo which eventually got the band signed to Anti-Flag's label A-F Records, where they released their first full- length album, Quitters Never Win in 2003. During a later tour with A Wilhelm Scream and Break the Silence, Snoreck decided he was no longer interested in the touring life and left the band to pursue his new clothing company, Offset Clothing. The band found Jevin Kaye after his St. Louis, Missouri band Form Follows Failure had broken up, and invited him to join. This lineup recorded the Nitro Records release Survive. In April 2007, after the band's European tour, McGrath left the band for personal reasons, with guitarist Dan O'Gorman leaving soon after, prompting the official break-up of the band. The band announced on March 30, 2015 that they reunited with former Break the Silence drummer, Mike Ford, on drums. In April, 2017, the band announced that Jevin had returned as the full-time drummer and would accompany them on their first South American tour later that year. In August, 2017, the band stated that Dan has been diagnosed with Stage 3 Cancer and will not be joining the band on their South American Tour, they have also stated that John Feliciano, formerly of Hit The Switch and One Last Chance, will be filling in for Dan. On 10 January they released the Song \\"Making Friends\\" (original by Lagwagon) digital. On June 7, 2019, the band unveiled the first single from their new album Everything Is Fine titled \\"Snake In The Grass\\".

In 1973 she became the first woman to take charge of a whip's office in either of the houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and she served in the 1974 to 1979 Labour Government as Captain of the Gentlemen-at-Arms (Government Chief Whip). Early and personal life Llewelyn-Davies was born in Birkenhead in 1915 to Charles Percy Parry and Sarah Gertrude Parry (n√©e Hamilton). She studied at Wallasey High School, Birkenhead High School, Liverpool College, Huyton and Girton College, Cambridge. In 1934 she married Alexander Francis Rawdon Smith, a research physiologist; they had no children. After this marriage was dissolved, in 1943 she married Richard Llewelyn Davies, and their surname was hyphenated when Richard was elevated to the peerage as Lord Llewelyn-Davies. They had three daughters. Political career Llewelyn-Davies entered the civil service in 1940 and served in the Ministry of War Transport, the Foreign Office, the Air Ministry and the Commonwealth Relations Office. She resigned to contest the Wolverhampton South-West parliamentary seat for Labour during the 1951 general election, but was defeated by the incumbent Conservative Enoch Powell. She subsequently unsuccessfully contested the Wandsworth Central seat in 1955 and 1959, but didn't stand for parliament again. With support of those in the Wilson government and the backing of close friend Richard Crossman, who described her in his diaries as \\"the real politician\\" when her husband was elevated to the peerage, she was created a life peer as Baroness Llewelyn- Davies of Hastoe, of Hastoe in the County of Hertfordshire on 29 August 1967. She went on to serve as a Government whip in the House of Lords between 1969 and 1970, and as Opposition Deputy Chief Whip from 1972. In 1973 she was elected Chief Whip, becoming the first woman to take charge of a whip's office in either house.

They sought solace in each other following the death of their partners, which developed into a love affair. They kept their relationship secret because she feared it would damage him politically, and she declined to marry him. Shortly after her death Alport met academic Mark Garnett, who was working for Sir Edward Heath on his memoirs, and he asked him to write his life story. Speaking to The Guardian, Garnett said of the meeting: \\"He was wearing a black tie and he mentioned the recent death of a 'close friend'. ...

He started his business career in Massachusetts, before moving to California in the 1850s. He had a successful entrepreneurial career. He moved to Worcester in 1878, and founded Clark University in that city in 1887. Biography=Early life Clark was born in Hubbardston, Massachusetts. He was a son of a farmer, and received a common school education. He became a carriage-maker at the age of sixteen, and opened his own carriage shop after five years. He extended his business to the manufacturing and marketing of chairs. He entered the tinware industry after discovering the greater profitability in this business around 1845. He was also a manager of retail stores in Hubbardston, Milford and Lowell. Clark married Susan Wright (1816-1904) in 1836; Susan was his childhood friend and neighbor. The couple were active supporters of the anti-slavery movement. Life in California, New York City, and Worcester Clark sold his hardware business to his brothers, and moved his capital to business in California. His first business venture in California was not successful because he lost his money because of the ineptitude of his partner. He formed a second partnership, and in 1853 went to San Francisco to run his business. He achieved success in the furniture business. In 1860 Clark liquidated his businesses because of the medical reasons. He reinvested his fortunes in the San Francisco area, particularly in real estate. When the American Civil War began, Clark supported the Union cause; he was active in multiple Union causes. In 1868 he purchased a mansion on Fifth Avenue in New York City. He started collecting rare books and art works, and also invested in securities and real estate. He made trips to Europe. He developed a deep interest in higher education; he visited and collected information about the universities in Europe. Clark and his wife, Susan, shifted to Worcester in 1878. He started to liquidate his California and New York area holdings in the early 1880s. He started collecting a compact plot of land in the growing South End of Worcester in 1881. He had acquired most of a block that bordered Main Street by the fall of 1885. Clark University Front entrance to Clark University's Jonas Clark Hall, the main academic facility for undergraduate students. Clark founded Clark University in 1887. He was probably inspired by his friend Leland Stanford to establish his own university. In January 1887, Clark secured from the Legislature, for himself and his associates of his choice, an act of incorporation under the name of Clark University. On March 31, the legislation was passed and signed. On May 4, at the first regular meeting of the Board of Trustees, Clark disclosed his educational and financial plans for the new university. Clark University was to incorporate the best features of the continental European and American universities such as Cornell University and Johns Hopkins University. Clark started the university with a million dollars, and later added another million dollars to the university fund because he feared the university may face lack of fund someday. G. Stanley Hall became the first president of Clark University; he was hired by Clark, and other trustees. Hall wanted to start the graduate school and library first, and he persuaded Clark and other trustees that the undergraduate college would be started after few years. The university was opened on October 2, 1889 as the first all-graduate university in the United States. It opened with graduate departments in physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and psychology. Hall made multiple promises to the faculty of Clark University, but was unable to fulfill them. He blamed Jonas Clark or the trustees for his unfulfilled promises, and also misled Clark about the financial aspects of Clark University. Jonas Clark wanted the undergraduate college, but Hall didn't want it. As a result of these conflicts, Clark didn't trust Hall. Clark University suffered from financial problems. Jonas Clark expressed his disappointment towards the affluent trustees, and to some extent towards the Worcester community, for not coming forward to support the university to Hall and the trustees, before leaving for Europe in 1891; he warned to reduce expenses if the public didn't give more support to the university. He resigned as treasurer, but remained president of the board of trustees. From this point forward, Clark talked with Hall and the board particularly through letter; he also didn't spent much time in Worcester. The trustees didn't build the undergraduate college, something that Clark wanted, but they continued to appeal to him to financially support the university. In 1892 Clark and multiple trustees held various discussions on how to salvage the remaining assets of Clark University. Clark wanted an undergraduate college, but Hall rejected his wish. Clark wanted the university to be a traditional undergraduate institution, while Hall wanted it to be a graduate institution. Hall and the trustees wanted to keep Clark happy until his death; after Clark's death they could use his money according to their wishes. Clark gave money to the university for the academic year 1892-93, but gave no more financial support to the university from this point forward. He realized that Hall and the trustees would not start the undergraduate college. His will, drafted in New York City, was kept secret from Hall and the trustees. Clark died on May 23, 1900 at his home in Worcester. After his death, when the conditions of his will became known, the trustees discovered that they would have to establish an undergraduate college or else they would lose the remainder of Clark's fortune. The college was established, and it merged with the university in 1920 after Hall's retirement.

It became the nation's largest producer of hand-tooled saddles, bridles, horse collars, postal bags, cowboy boots, and shoes and had a contract to supply the sporting equipment giant, Spalding, with raw material for the manufacture of baseballs and baseball mitts.https://www.ajc.com/news/local/flashback-photos-buford-was- once-home-the-country-most-prolific-tannery/k88cgTUiYACiPDwnYlyXBK/ Starting in the early 20th century Bona Allen saddles were offered in the Sears Mail Order catalog under a variety of names. The Bona Allen Company was owned by Bonaparte Allen Sr. Also known as the Bona Allen Shoe and Horse Collar Factory, the factory closed in 1981 after a fire, and the main tannery building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 3, 2005.https://www.ajc.com/news/buford-fire-continues-erase-the-once-landmark- tannery-for-the- stars/ZRD3zvDk7JIOfGCBCOwL2I/http://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20050121.htm It is located at 554 West Main Street. After another fire on February 10, 2015, firefighters allowed the building to burn itself down.  History  Bonaparte Allen learned the trade of tanning from his father, Washington Allen. Bonaparte opened the Bona Allen Company at the age of 27 and operated it as a tannery and leather goods shop. It started off making whiplashes, then followed with the production of horse collars. In 1903, a fire swept through the building and destroyed the business and the entire building. Allen lost everything. But, thanks to his established business track record, a local bank loaned him the money he needed to re-establish and rebuild his business. It didn't take Bonaparte long to restore his thriving business and pay off all of his debt. In 1925, Bonaparte Allen died. He left everything to his sons, Bona Jr., John, and Victor. They took over their father's business and continued to produce what some people have deemed the country‚Äôs finest leather. The Great Depression of the early 1930s had a positive effect on the Company's tannery. The nation's farmers could no longer afford to operate their tractors, so they had to return to using horses. This, in turn, created a demand for saddles and collars, as well as all other horse related equipment. The Bona Allen Company continued to expand and soon was selling groceries and dried goods in addition to its leather products. In 1933, a Bona Allen saddle won a blue ribbon at the Chicago World‚Äôs Fair. At the fair, The Bona Allen Company provided several jobs as well as entertainment; it sponsored many sports events and teams such as basketball, football, and the Bona Allen Company's own baseball team. In 1941, a strike was called and shut down the Company's shoe plant. Six months later, the government stepped in and reopened the shoe plant to repair army shoes. The Company's collar factory was closed for good after WWII.http://www.visitbuford.com/History.html The Bona Allen Company received special acclaim in the 1950s for production of its classic saddles. During the peak of western movies, many of Hollywood's famous cowboy actors, including Roy Rogers, William F. (\\"Buffalo Bill\\") Cody, Gene Autry, Kenny Rogers, Lash LaRue, Gabby Hayes, and the cast of the popular TV show \\"Bonanza, \\" preferred a Bona Allen saddle‚Äîsome even bringing their horses to Buford, Georgia, to get them custom fitted. To head its saddle department, the Company hired Victor Alexander, a famous saddle expert from the King Ranch in Texas. Under his management, the Bona Allen Company produced some of the finest hand-tooled saddles and bridles ever made, including a silver-studded special order saddle for Roy Rogers.https://www.flickr.com/photos/robertlz/465050310/ Bonaparte Allen also owned up to 200 houses that he would rent to his employees; the houses would typically rent for $4.00 to $12.00 per month. Some employee could buy them with no down payment. In 1932, the Bona Allen Company hit the peak of its employment: 2,200 people worked there until rough times hit in 1943, when it closed its horse collar factory, shoe and chrome tannery‚Äîdropping its total employee headcount to 500.http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/news/archive/16428/ Following the death of John Allen in 1968, the tannery and saddle and harness factories were sold to Tandy Corporation. The railroad depot closed in 1972, and the demand for horse-related leather goods decreased. While Tandy Corp. continued operations for a few years under the Bona Allen name, after the devastating tannery fire in December 1981, they chose not to rebuild, and the last of the Bona Allen Company's 160 employees were let go. On February 10, 2015, a warehouse caught fire. Gwinnett County allowed the building to burn itself out, citing dangers from leftover chemicals. U.S. Military Shoemaking In 1918, The Bona Allen Tannery expanded into shoes and boots. It was profitable at first, but production was cut during the Great Depression. In 1941, the Company ceased shoe production due to labor unrest, but the factory was reopened at the request of the United States federal government during World War II to make footwear for the United States military.http://www.aboutnorthgeorgia.com/ang/Bona_Allen_Tannery Bona Allen Shoemakers Semi-Pro Baseball Team In the 1930s, factories and mills across the nation sponsored semi-pro baseball teams to advertise their businesses, provide affordable entertainment and serve as a source of civic interest and community pride. Major league baseball had only 16 teams, and semi-pro baseball teams grew in popularity. John Q. Allen, a son of Bona Allen, arranged for The Bona Allen Shoe Company to sponsor one of the finest semi-pro teams in US history, known as The Bona Allen Shoemakers. In 1933, the Shoemakers won 56 of its 61 games. The Bona Allen Shoemakers were a semi-pro industrial league baseball team sponsored by the Bona Allen Shoe Company. They were active during the late 1920s through the early 1940s when World War II began. Their most successful years were the late '30s and early '40s. They won the 1938 national semi-pro championship held in Wichita, Kansas, as well as the Denver Post Baseball Tournament championship in 1940.  Monuments  A statue of Roy Rogers, his horse Trigger, and saddle-maker Jack Johnson now stands in downtown Buford‚Äôs park as a tribute to the tannery.http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/news/archive/16428/ This statue, across the street from the Buford, Georgia, based tannery recreates Roy Rogers and a Bona Allen employee putting a newly purchased saddle on Rogers' horse Trigger. The story behind the statue began when Roy Rogers and Trigger rode east on a private train for Trigger to be fitted for one of Bona Allen‚Äôs renowned saddles. The statue features Trigger rearing, with Rogers in pointed boots and western gear standing to the side and the saddle craftsman, Jack Johnson, standing on the other.

The \\"instrument\\" is in essence a highly flexible and portable controller, with the sound being actually generated in the software it drives. History An Eigenharp Alpha-model Eigenharp was invented by web entrepreneur and musician John Lambert. As a member of the ambient trance group Shen, Lambert felt that the electronic instruments were not as emotive or expressive as guitars or human voices. After selling his internet company, Hyperlink, he founded Eigenlabs in 2001 and began 8 years of development that resulted in the Eigenharp. The Alpha model was introduced in 2009, followed by the Pico in 2010 and the Tau in 2012. Models The instrument comes in three models: Alpha, Tau, and Pico, in decreasing order of size. Each has a breath- pipe, a key matrix (120, 72, and 18) and a ribbon controller. The Alpha and Tau also have 12 percussion keys each and a headphone output. The Alpha also has microphone preamplifier with an input on the instrument as well as a second ribbon controller. Characteristics Characteristics of all of the instruments are: * A matrix of velocity sensitive multi-expressive keys, each of which act like a 6-way analog joystick. This allows the simultaneous pitch bend and modulation (or other parameters) of each played note individually. * A stick-like vertical form factor akin to a sitar for the larger models or a flute in the smaller ones. * A built-in wind controller, giving the larger versions of the instrument an appearance similar to a bassoon. * One or two ribbon controller strips. * The software is available as open-source under the GPLv3 and runs both on Macintosh and Windows. Additionally, the larger models have: * A series of percussion keys * A built-in step sequencer with indicator LEDs for each key. * A headphone amplifier with an output on the instrument ReferencesExternal links=Articles * Do you drum it, strum it or stroke it? - BBC News, 8 October 2009 * G4 TV Coverage of the Eigenharp * Eigenharp Article on CrunchGear * Eigenharp News, Tips and Tricks * In-depth Eigenharp Alpha review after three months - EigenZone, 21 June 2010 Example Videos * Battlestar Galactica Cylon theme on Eigenharp Alpha * James Bond theme on Eigenharp Alpha * Live performance with Eigenharp Alpha of the band Flytecase Category:Keyboard instruments Category:Synthesizers Category:2009 musical instruments ","title":"Eigenharp"},{"id":"24620103","text":"Packers Plus Energy Services, Inc. is a privately held, Calgary-based oil and gas service company.Seale, R, Donaldson, J., Athans, J.

Diskit Monastery also known as Deskit Gompa or Diskit Gompa is the oldest and largest Buddhist monastery (gompa) in the Nubra Valley of Ladakh, northern India. It belongs to the Gelugpa (Yellow Hat) sect of Tibetan Buddhism. It was founded by Changzem Tserab Zangpo, a disciple of Tsong Khapa, founder of Gelugpa, in the 14th century. It is a sub-gompa of the Thikse gompa. Lachung Temple and Hundur Monastery are also located nearby, the latter is below the main road near a bridge. The monastery has statue of Cho Rinpoche (Crowned Buddha) in the prayer hall, a huge drum and several images of fierce guardian deities. An elevated cupola of the monastery depicts a fresco of the Tashilhunpo Monastery of Tibet. The monastery administration runs a school, with support from a non-government organization known as the \\"Tibet Support Group\\", which has computer facilities and teaches science subjects, in English, to Tibetan children of the region. A popular festival known as Dosmoche or the \\"Festival of the Scapegoat\\" is held in the precincts of the monastery in February during the winter season, which is largely attended by people from villages of the Nubra Valley since the other regions in Leh are inaccessible during this period due to heavy snow fall. History A renovated mural depicting the Four Heavenly Kings opposite a prayer hall (2009). The same mural is seen in a ruined stage in the 2004 photo (below, in Structures) at the top of the stairs. The Diskit monastery was founded by Changzem Tserab Zangpo in the 14th century. The history of the Nubra Valley and the monastery could thus be traced from the 14th century onwards. Ladakh was then ruled by King Grags-pa-‚Äòbum-lde (1400‚Äì1440) and his brother, who unsuccessfully attempted to usurp Nubra Valley, which was under a local ruler named Nyig-ma-grags-pa. The local ruler assisted a Gelugpa order advocate to build the monastery at Diskit and deify the idol of Tsong Khapa, the founder of the Gelugpa sect, in the monastery. During the rule of King Blogros-chog- idan (1440‚Äì1470) who had even controlled western Tibet, Panchen Lha-btsun - a resident of Nubra Valley by birth - studied in Tibet and later became a regent to the founder of Tashilhunpo Monastery and finally during his last stage of life returned to Nubra. His remains have been preserved in Charasa. In 1500, Ladakh was ruled by Bkra-shis-rnam-rgyal, who fought the invader Mirza Haider of Central Asia, in Nubra and close to Leh, finally defeated the latter and thus bringing Nubra under Ladakh King‚Äôs rule. Even then, the local chieftains still yielded power in Diskit and Hundar. Shia Muslims started settling in Nubra after this war. Bkra-shis-rnam-rgyal‚Äô son, Tshedbang-rnam-rgyal ruled Ladakh from 1530 and expanded his kingdom. At that time, Nubra people prevailed on him and preventing him from invading Hor in Xinjiang, as trade with Yarkand was considered crucial to Nubra. During the reign of Jams-dbang- rnam-rgyal, historical records indicate that a regular tribute payment was made by the Nubra people to the king. The King Bde-‚ÄòIdanrnam-rgyal (1620‚Äì45) successfully defeated Baltistan and the Mughals. Rgyal kings were very religious and built mani walls throughout their kingdom. Monks were specially engaged to recite hymns of Mani-tung chur in Nubra Valley and in other surrounding areas. In mid eighteenth century, Tshe-dbang-rnam-rgyal gave away the control of Diskit monastery to the Rinpoche of Thikse Monastery and this arrangement has been perpetuated to this day. Since then, Diskit is considered a sub-gompa of Thikse. Geography Location of Diskit and Khardong La pass in the Nubra Valley The Diskit monastery is situated on the hill, just above the flood plains of the Shyok River, on its right bank in the Diskit village () in Nubra Valley. Nubra River is a tributary of the Shyok River, which flows parallel to the Indus River on the northern side of the Ladakh Range. Since the valley is at lower elevation, it has a mild climate. This climatic condition has created lush vegetation in the valley and the valley is, therefore, called the \\"Orchard of Ladakh\\". The valley was part of the caravan route between Tibet and China. It has various trekking sites, along the countryside. The valley is also the natural home of the double-humped Bactrian camel. It is located trans Leh, beyond the snow-clad Khardung La pass. Since the snow clad mountains become unpassable many times during winter, Diskit village and the monastery in the valley have become the congregation centre for people of the region of the valley. Diskit is the headquarters of the Nubra Valley and thus has lot of government offices with basic facilities. It is also connected by road with Leh. A monk meditates on terrace of Diskit monastery, with Nubra Valley and Diskit village seen in the background The approach road to the monastery is from the Diskit village through a rugged and dusty road that crosses a stream in the middle of the village. The village is approachable from Leh by road via the Khardung pass. The traffic on this road may be disrupted between October and May due to snow fall and landslides. This road is often -and incorrectly -claimed to be the highest motorable road in the world. The road from Leh passes through South Pullu (an army camp), then to Khardung La (), goes down to the North Pullu (foreign visitors have to register their entry to Nubru Valley), moves down to the Khardung village, slopes down to the Khalsar village in the valley floor and then bifurcates into two branches. The left branch from Khalsar village leads to the Diskit and Hunder villages, while the right branch road leads to Sumur and Panamik villages. Leh to Diskit is by road which is maintained by the Indian Army'. Structures Approach to the Monastery Diskit Monastery has been built at the edge of the approach road. This road links with Parthapur and Those. Approach to the monastery is through a flight of steps made of stones, which lead to the prayer hall of the monastery. A statue of Maitreya Buddha is enshrined in the hall. There is a huge drum located within the hall. In the chamber on the second floor, there are many images of fierce guardian deities. Diskit Monastery also has an elevated cupola, with a fresco depicting the Tashilhunpo Monastery of Tibet. It also has a number of shrines and Mongolian and Tibetan texts in the storehouse. Diskit Monastery is connected to Mongol mythology in that the monastery is believed to be the place where an evil anti-Buddhist Mongol demon once lived and was killed near the monastery grounds but is said to have been resurrected several times. Today, the wrinkled head and hand of the demon are believed to lie inside a temple in the monastery. The Lonely Planet India guide describes that the gompa roof offers \\"glorious\\" views of the Nubra Valley. Recent extensions to the monastery building are in good shape but the Dukhang (\\"main prayer hall\\") and Zimcchungh are not in good condition. Paintings have been covered with soot and images are kept in total disorder. The older part of the monastery is said to be in certain degree of decay, as cracks have been observed, and they remain untended. Large statue of Jampa (Maitreya) Buddha The photong or official residence of the Chief Lama of Nubra is located at the foot hill where there is also a very large statue of Jampa (Maitreya) Buddha. This impressive 32 metre (106 foot) statue on top of a hill below the monastery, faces down the Shyok River towards Pakistan and, according to Mr. Tsering Nophel, chairman of the committee which organised it, most of the money came from local donations. The Head of the Gelugpa, Ganden Thipa (the reincarnation of Tsongkhapa), and Abbott of Rizu Monastery, gave 8 kg of gold for its decoration. It is the first time a Ladakhi monk has been the head of the Gelugpa sect. The statue's construction was started in April 2006 and it was consecrated by the Dalai Lama on 25 July 2010. Mr. Nophel says the statue was built with three main functions in mind - protection of Diskit Village, prevention of further war with Pakistan, and to promote world peace. Lachung temple Lachung temple is close but above the Diskit monastery, and is said to be one of the oldest temples in the Nubra Valley where a large idol of Tsong Khapa is deified and a Gelugpa yellow hat crowns the image. School The monastery, which houses about 100 monks, runs a school in its precincts. This school teaches Tibetan children. The school has been upgraded recently to enable teaching of scientific subjects with support from the Lungta, a 'Tibet Support Group' (a non governmental organization) that has created computer facilities in the school. Lungta has trained the monks of the monastery in computer skills and in the English language so that they could in turn teach the children of the school. Further additions to the school library in the form of dictionaries, encyclopaedias and English teaching materials are being provided. Festival Statues of guardian deities, whose heads are uncovered only during the festival. Desmochhey or Dosmoche, also known as \\"Festival of the Scapegoat\\" is the popular prayer festival that is celebrated at Diskit Monastery, Likir Monastery and Leh Palace in Leh. Since the festival is celebrated in February during the winter season, when snowbound Khardong peak is not passable to attend similar festivities at Likir monastery in Leh, large crowds from villages in the Nubra Valley assemble at Diskit to witness the mask dance. The mask dance also known as Cham dance is performed by the Lamas of the Monastery to dramatically express the superiority of good over evil forces. The dances are believed to avoid ill-fortune in the new year (Tibetan new year is celebrated in December/January). On this occasion, images made of dough are thrown out to deter any disaster occurring and to usher peace and prosperity to the people. The cloths covering the heads of deity statues are removed in this period.

Background Bred and raced by George D. Widener, Jr., she was conditioned for racing by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame trainer Syl Veitch. Racing career As a three-year-old in 1965, What a Treat won seven of the top races for her age group, including a win over older stars Tosmah and Affectionately in capturing the Beldame Stakes. At age four, carrying high weight, What a Treat finished off the board in the February 15, 1966 Columbiana Handicap at Florida's Hialeah Park Race Track. On that same track, she then won the March 2 Black Helen Handicap and won again at Aqueduct Racetrack on April 14 before running second in the Bed O' Roses Handicap. The rest of her 1966 campaign brought What a Treat limited success, with her finishing off the board in important races such as the Diana Handicap, Ladies Handicap, and Maskette Handicap. Although What a Treat was in training in May 1967, her career ended that year without further racing success. Breeding record What a Treat was retired to broodmare duty at owner George Widener's Old Kenney Farm near Lexington, Kentucky, where he bred her to Never Bend. Following Widener's death in December 1971, on February 12, 1972 What a Treat was auctioned through the Keeneland Sales to a breeding syndicate from France for a then world record price for a broodmare of US$450,000. Of the foals she birthed for her new owners, her mating to Northern Dancer was the most successful, producing the 1974 colt Be My Guest. Although Be My Guest proved to be a good miler who won three Conditions races in England and Ireland, he is best remembered as one of the foundation sires responsible for turning Ireland's Coolmore Stud into one of the most important Thoroughbred breeding operations in the world.

The film stars Billy Franks as Nick Andrews, the founder of a company called Terminal Assist, which matches up thrill killers and people who want to commit suicide. The supporting cast includes Bobbi Ashton, John Innocenzo, and Mike Mclaughlin. Plot The film opens as Terminal Assist \\"matches\\" a depressed man named Tom Taylor (Larry Schneider Jr.) with a killer. Tom waits downstairs for his all-too-willing executioner. Things go awry when the killer decides to murder Tom's wife, too, and the resulting double homicide is all over the local news. This doesn't suit the purposes of Terminal Assist, an altruistic service that strives to hook up terminally ill people with low-life hit men that enjoy killing. Founder Nick Andrews (Franks) has established a working relationship with local police authorities, based on an understanding that they won't kill anyone living in the same community. The double homicide presents problems, and the police expect Nick to find a way to relieve the pressure. Complications ensue when it's soon apparent that Nick has a thing for the grieving widow Teresa (Bobbi Ashton), and he has competition‚Äînamely, Tom's doctor buddy Carl (John Innocenzo). Carl has a different problem. He's falsified medical reports and hidden his diagnosis of pancreatic cancer that allowed Tom to obtain a lucrative insurance policy before his expiration date. He certainly doesn't want an investigation into Tom's death with potential criminal charges and license revocation pending. Production In an interview with the website 'buried.com' McCleery gave some background on the conception of the idea for The Altruist. While shooting Track 16 in the summer of 1998 (also starring Franks and Ashton), director Mick McCleery read an article about the statistics of murders and suicides each year in the USA. He was surprised that the suicide rate was double that of the murder rate (an average of 60,000 versus 30,000). He wrote a note to himself about it: \\"That is an awful lot of waste there, if only someone could match those two groups up\\", and the basic plot of The Altruist was born. McCleery continued to work on the idea as he finished up post-production on Track 16 and was ready to shoot this new film in the summer of 2002. Leading man Billy Franks, who is British, flew over to America for the shoot, and was promptly deported. His passport had been out of order for years, and in pre-9/11 days they simply let him through, but things had changed by 2002. Instead of recasting, McCleery rescheduled the film for the following summer, hoping that Franks' passport issues could be worked out by then. He used the time to rework the script, changing several subplots. Premiere The Altruist premiered at The Ritz cinema in Voorhees, NJ on November 4, 2004. Just four days later it premiered in London at the Clapham Picture House (November 8, 2004).

Cox & King's first naval architect, Joseph Edwin Wilkins, who worked for the firm for some 15 years, designed many of the firm's best known yachts such as Iolanda, Gunilda, Rosabelle, Venetia, and Surf. Upon Wilkins's departure in 1908, Francis Gordon Pratt, the son of Gustavus Pratt (one of the original owners along with Sidney Depree), took over the design of motor yachts, fast launches and racing motor boats. Pratt raced a number of the latter (especially the Tyreless series) in such places as Monte Carlo as well as in the United States (Harmsworth Cup). The demand for luxury yachts after World War I was greatly reduced due to the prevailing economic climate, and the financial crisis of the late 1920s and early 1930s, in addition to various lawsuits, led to the closure of the firm.

Biography Gana was the older son of Federico Gana Munizaga y Rosario Gana Castro, and first cousin of the descendants of Albero Blest Gana, the preeminent Chilean novelist. He began his secondary education in the Linares lyceum in 1878, where he spent his first year, and completed the remainder at the National Institute. He obtained his law degree in the University of Chile in 1890, but practiced law only for a short period of time. He lived principally in Santiago and in San Bernardo. In October 1890, his first published work, the short story \\"¬°Pobre vieja!\\" appeared in the weekly La Actualidad, under the pseudonym Pedro Simple. At the end of that year, Gana was named Second Secretary of the Chilean legation to London, a charge that ended with the fall of the Balmaceda government. Freed from his diplomatic work, he traveled to France, Belgium, and Holland, where he came into contact with the works of Flaubert, Balzac, and Ivan Turgenev, the lattermost impressing him profoundly. Upon his return to Chile, in 1892, he disseminated the works of the Russian novelist throughout literary circles. In 1894, Gana published another short story, this time in publication El a√±o Literario, that was initially titled \\"Por un perro,\\" but later came to be called \\"Un car√°cter.\\" In July 1897, La Revista Literaria published the story \\"Una ma√±ana de invierno, later known as \\"La Maiga,\\" with which Gana began the current of criollismo rural in the country. In 1903, he married Blanca Subercaseux del R√≠o, with whom he had six children. The same year he participated, along with his friend Baldomero Lillo, in a literary competition organized by the Catholic Review, submitting the stories \\"La Se√±ora,\\" ‚ÄúEn las monta√±as,\\" and \\"La Maiga.\\" He also began contributing to the literary magazine Zig-Zag in 1906, publishing his Manchas de color in 1914. A great number of his works circulated in a diverse array of newspapers, including La Revista Nueva, Sucesos, Silueta Magazine, El Mercurio, La Naci√≥n, Atenea, Las √öltimas Noticias. Following a brief hospitalization in San Vincente's Hospital in Santiago, he died in 1926. Literary Analysis Studies of the character and evolution of the Chilean short story have established categorically that Federico Gana is the authentic discoverer of the Chilean countryside as a theme of national literature. Coming from the modernista envirornment of the end of the 19th Century, his early stories reveal a natural vacillation between the subjective and fleeting tendency that inspired modernism, and the utilization of the concrete motives offered by the natural environment of the countryside. In this manner, with his first published story in 1890, \\"¬°Pobre vieja!\\" he subtly reveals his interest in vernacular literary elements; the same occurs with \\"Por un perro,\\" in 1894. It is in this year that he wrote \\"En otro tiempo,\\" later known as \\"Pesadillas,\\" in which he adopts an extremely modernist tone. In 1897, he published \\"The Maiga,\\" with the name of \\"D√≠as de campo: Una ma√±ana de invierno,‚Äù a story which shows his definitive association with the movement of criollismo. The date serves well as a point of departure for this movement, which at that time enjoyed great representation in the works of the nation and within the whole of the literature of Latin America. Yet this first rapprochement of the Chilean countryside, which Gana experienced firsthand during his childhood summer vacations to the country near and around Linares, does not reveal the depth and concern of Baldomero Lillo and other subsequent criollistas. Nourished by the works of Turgenev, with whom he shared an aesthetic similitude, the creative attitude of Ferderico Gana reflects a tendency of gentle reverie, with a style always dignified and clean. This harmony reflects a serene and intimate vision of the Chilean countryside in its patriarchal aspect, with its peasants and elderly, full of resignation and reverential respect for authority. ‚ÄúLa se√±ora\\" y \\"Paulita,\\" are, without a doubt, Gana's greatest achievements; they reflect all of the noble virtues that characterize his narrative and poetic work. There appears the sharp landscape of the Valle Central, and the man of the land, below a gaze both kind and understanding.

During his playing days, he played as a defender. In his early career, he won caps for the France national under-19 football team. He retired from playing in 2002, and is currently the manager of Championnat de France amateur 2 club Chaumont. Mazzolini was born in Reims, Marne and joined local junior football club Lunel in 1975, and played there for six years before he was spotted by AJ Auxerre in 1981, at the age of fourteen. After a number of seasons in the youths and reserves at the club, including the Auxerre reserves' Division 3 championship-winning season in 1985‚Äì86, Mazzolini was promoted to the first team at the start of the 1987‚Äì88 season. He made his Division 1 d√©but for the club on 20 September 1987, in the 0‚Äì1 defeat away to RCF Paris. His first goal for Auxerre came in the 61st minute of the 2‚Äì0 victory over Sporting Toulon Var on 16 September 1989. In a total of six seasons with the club, he went on to play 128 times in the league, 17 games in the Coupe de France and 16 UEFA Cup matches. He transferred to Division 1 rivals FC Martigues in 1993, but stayed with the club for only one season before moving to then Division 2 side Olympique de Marseille in the summer of 1994. In his first season with the side, Mazzolini played 20 league matches as Marseille claimed the Division 2 championship. However, after promotion to Division 1, he made just eight appearances the following season and signed for National 2 outfit AC Ajaccio at the end of the 1995‚Äì96 campaign. He played for the Corsica outfit for the following two seasons, and was a part of the side that won promotion to the National 1 in 1996‚Äì97. In 1998, he moved into French non-league football when he was signed by Chaumont.

The network has members in nine countries worldwide, including the United States, China, India, UK, Australia, Brazil, Norway, South Africa and Nigeria. Its secretariat is housed at the Institute for Public Policy Research in London, UK. GCN members are engaged jointly in a programme of research projects, the results of which each member feeds into policy making at the domestic and international levels. Collectively, members of the Global Climate Network are committed to a vision of a prosperous and secure world in which greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced to a level that is no longer harmful to the climate system. Working together, the Network construct a narrative for action on climate change that is concerned with human and economic progress as well as environmental wellbeing. The network's patrons are Dr Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and director-general of the Energy and Resources Institute in India; John Podesta, former Chief of Staff to President Bill Clinton and director of Center for American Progress, and Lord Christopher Patten of Barnes, former European Commissioner for External Affairs. History The Global Climate Network was launched at the 14th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Pozna≈Ñ, 2008. Its first paper, Closing the Mitigation Gap, which was released to coincide with the Network's launch, identified the amount of carbon dioxide that would still need to be reduced once developed or Annex 1 country pledges had been achieved. Breaking Through technology: Overcoming the Barriers to the Development and Wide Deployment of Low-Carbon Technology, its second paper, published in July 2009, focussed on the low-carbon technology needs of eight member countries and how these could be met, or partly met, through government policies. In October 2009, the work of the Global Climate Network was acknowledged by the UK current affairs magazine Prospect who named the Institute for Public Policy Research the UK's Green Think Tank of the Year at their annual award ceremony, in part because of its involvement in the global alliance. Judges, including Rohan Silva, senior adviser to UK Prime Minister David Cameron, Baroness Falkner and David Walker, former managing director of the UK's audit commission, gave special mention in their citation to the GCN, calling the initiative 'ground-breaking' and 'unique'. Also in October 2009, the GCN facilitated a high-level meeting of environment ministers and executive directors of environmental protection agencies from a number of countries, including the US, Brazil, Australia, Korea and Indonesia, at Windsor Castle in the UK. The 'Windsor dialogue' was presided over by Lord Chris Smith, Chairman of the Environment Agency and concluded with agreement that greater resources are needed to ensure comprehensive and accurate reporting of greenhouse gas emissions data in developing countries. At the 15th Conference of the Parties in Copenhagen, held in December 2009, the GCN published a third discussion paper, Low Carbon jobs in an Interconnected world, analysing the potential employment opportunities in clean energy sectors in eight countries. The study - which featured the headline '20 million opportunities in a global low-carbon economy' - argued that the bolder government policies to promote rapid growth in climate-friendly innovations and industries are, the higher the likelihood of new job creation on a significant scale. The report was reissued with additional analysis from Brazil in March 2010. In October 2010, the Global Climate Network will release a major new report on clean energy finance in the developing world, which will identify the capital needs of developing countries and potential solutions for leveraging private sector investment in clean energy industries. A further study on 'low carbon industrial strategy' will be published in January 2011. Members The founding and current members of the Global Climate Network are: * Institute for Public Policy Research, UK; * Center for American Progress, US * The Energy and Resources Institute, India * The International Centre for Energy, Environment and Development, Nigeria * The Climate Institute, Australia * Research Centre for Sustainable Development at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, China * Bellona Foundation, Norway * IMBEWU Sustainability Legal Specialists Pty Ltd, South Africa The GCN also has a growing number of associate members who collaborate on specific research and advocacy projects. These include: Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy in Germany; Vitae Civilis in Brazil; and the Institute of Policy Analysis and Research in Rwanda. IPPR in London houses the Global CLimate Network's secretariat. Key publications The Global Climate Network publishes research that seeks to highlight the barriers and opportunities in the transition to a global low carbon economy. Recent reports have focused on clean energy jobs, barriers to low-carbon technology development and deployment, and the shortfall in carbon dioxide mitigation between what developed countries have pledged and what the scientific evidence on climate change suggests is needed. Low Carbon Jobs in an Interconnected World - This report identifies the employment opportunities on offer in nine of the world's leading economies if their governments enact ambitious policies to stimulate growth in clean energy sectors. Breaking through on Technology - this report analyses the barriers preventing the development and widescale diffusion of low-carbon technologies in eight member countries. Among its recommendations, it calls for technology to be placed ‚Äòfront and centre‚Äô of the international negotiations on climate change and for the establishment of a network of global and regional innovation hubs to spearhead collaborative low-carbon technological development - a proposal that was later also called for by the World Economic Forum's Task force on low-carbon prosperity.World Economic Forum (2009) 'Task force on low carbon prosperity: recommendations October 2009', http://www.weforum.org/documents/gov/Environment/TF%20Low%20Carbon%20Prosperity%20Recommendations.pdf Closing the Mitigation Gap - a commissioned paper that highlights the shortcomings of developed countries proposals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the ‚Äòmitigation gap‚Äô which could open up and undermine the credibility of a post-2012 regime to prevent climate change.

James Weller Ladbroke held the estate until his death in 1847, though the actual development of the land was carried out by a firm of City solicitors, Smith, Bayley (known as Bayley and Janson after 1836), working in conjunction with the architect, landscaper and surveyor Thomas Allason. Under the terms of his uncle's will, James Weller Ladbroke could only grant leases of up to twenty-one years' duration. However, he and his advisers managed to obtain power by means of a private Act of Parliament of 1821 to grant ninety- nine-year leases, and it was at this point that development began in earnest. Allason's first task was to prepare a plan for the layout of the main portion of the estate, which was completed by 1823. The 1823 plan marks the genesis of Allason's most enduring idea‚Äîthe creation of large private communal gardens enclosed by terraces and/or crescents of houses. Eventually around fifteen of these communal gardens would be built, and they continue to define the character of Notting Hill to this day. Death and legacy Ladbroke died at his house at Petworth, Sussex on 16 March 1847. His Notting Hill estate by this time brought in an annual revenue of around ¬£3,000 in ground rents, a significant sum at the time. He had married Caroline Raikes on 26 May 1803 at St Mary de Crypt, Gloucester, and had one daughter, Caroline (born 26 Mar 1804, Caldon, Surrey), who married Rev. Henry Danvers Clarke, MA, uncle of Stanley Calvert Clarke. They had three children: Henry Weller Ladbroke Clarke (born about 1933, married 04 Jan 1855 Laura Frances Mary Agnes Morris \\"Florence Lancia\\", a famous operatic soprano of the times, and died after 1863 without children), Emily Georgina Clarke (born 25 Sep 1835, married 10 Nov 1857 Constanzo, Marquess del Carretto de Mombaldone, and had one daughter, Gertrude, who married Prince Emmanuele Gonzaga and left descendants) and Augustus Stanley Clarke (born 27 Feb 1837, died 1885 unmarried). James Weller Ladbroke's heir was a distant cousin named Felix Ladbroke of Headley, Surrey, who found himself in possession of absolute title to the estate.British History Online Retrieved August 2011 Many streets in Notting Hill still bear the Ladbroke name today, including Ladbroke Grove and Ladbroke Square. The former Ladbroke estate is now a conservation area, and the Ladbroke Association, a local non-profit group with around 400 members, is dedicated to preserving and maintaining its architectural integrity.

History In 2002, RAP4 began as a small company that brought a new type of marker to the paintball industry by distribution of R.A.M (real action marker) by APS Airgun Limited (a worldwide supplier for military training and Real Action Game equipment). First marker RAP4 started as a home business and sold a .43 caliber R.A.M. paintball gun rebranded after the company, the RAP4. The RAP4 used a smaller version of the standard .68-caliber paintball, the measurement was .43. The .43-caliber paintball was encased in an alloy, and when the paintball was fired, the casing would eject from the port while the paintball was projected from the barrel. This marker was designed after and was a replica of the M4. This marker featured an air system in the back of the marker, inside the butt stock, thus removing an air tank on the bottom of the standard paintball markers. This was the first of its kind in the paintball world. The other unique quality of the marker was that it used a 20-round magazine instead of the standard paintball hopper to chamber paintballs. By using the magazine to feed paintballs, this made it possible to replicate the M4. The R.A.M. was the first marker to utilize a magazine. Products= 468  The next level in Mil-Sim and tactical training markers that replicates the function and feel of M4 and AR15 family of rifles.  T68 paintball marker  The T68 marker debuted with the first generation in 2004, and has since had seven revisions. It is a .68-caliber semi-automatic and full auto CO2 or HPA (high pressure air) powered paintball marker. Besides standard paintball play, the marker is also used for military simulation (MilSim), and law enforcement training. as the marker physically resembles an M16 and M4 U.S. Military assault rifle and carbines. The markers provide crowd control and are an alternative method for subduing individuals; the markers can fire .68 caliber Less Lethal Live Rounds, more commonly known as pepper balls - live rounds filled with powder substance that irritates the eyes and nose, similar to pepper spray. The T68 core is a design similar in action to the Spyder markers. Primary systems (Barrel, Air System, Feed System & Trigger) attach to the core. Additional external components add to the overall M-4 look. These include a carry handle (fixed or removable with RIS weaver rail), T-charging (cocking) handle (Gen 3 upwards), pistol grip with trigger guard, faux clip housing with working magazine release, fake magazine with hollow interior (for storage), M-4 handguard assembly with interchangeable front handguards, M-4 forward sight with bayonet lug and sling loop, and either 3-position M4 Carbine or fixed M-16A2 style stock. Various barrel lengths and styles are available, from 1\\" through 20\\", with interchangeable muzzle flash suppressors or faux silencers. The barrels use Spyder threads, so aftermarket barrels are also capable of being used. Made from machined aircraft aluminum, the marker is mechanical, with no electronic parts in its factory form. A screw is provided under the stock for adjustment of the shooting velocity, and a simple push-safe safety is situated just ahead of the trigger on the core. The sixth generation and later models feature changes to the marker core and body to accept a working 18-round magazine. They eliminate the gap between the trigger and the magazine receiver, allowing the trigger finger to reach the magazine release button for tactical reload. The air system is internal and allows the unit to be self- contained. The T68 can use any weaver-mounted accessory and can be made into any configuration of the M-16/M4 Carbine, as well as working M203 grenade launchers, that can be mounted on the marker. There are also AK-47 stocks and handguards, and MP5 accessories, allowing custom configurations. Split Fire Dual Feed system RAP4 also has a hopper- fed system. Its newest design is the Split Fire Dual Feed System. This is compatible only with the T68, M4 and AK47 and allows use of both a hopper and a magazine. The Split Fire adapter is installed inside the T68, and when the user turns a dial the marker switches from feeding from the magazine to the hopper, and vice versa. M80 Landmine The M80 Landmine is pressure activated and fires a variety of liquids and powders. The reusable M80 Landmine is powered by a rechargeable CO2 reservoir that disperses more than two ounces of smoke-simulation powder or liquid paint, creating a twenty-foot blast radius. The RAP4 reusable M80 Landmine is used for paintball and the military combat training. The mine is light and compact, and it can be concealed as a booby trap. As an antipersonnel training device, the M80 can be used with smoke-simulation powder to leave a residue and cloud or liquid paint for a distinguishing mark. The mine will ‚Äúdetonate‚Äù with 10 lbs of pressure and will produce a loud explosion. It may be used on its side or vertically, buried with the top exposed or incorporated into a wide variety of realistic booby-trap setups.  Xpower  The XPower is an exact match of the M4 Carbine. It is the same length, weight, look and functionality. The paintball version shoots .43-caliber paintballs. This marker ejects a cartridge after each shot, just like real assault rifles. It shoots .43-caliber paintballs, which are loaded into alloy or biodegradable plastic shells, which eject after every shot. The paintballs used for this marker are smaller than the standard .68-caliber that most markers use.  T68 M249 Magazine  The T68 M249 Magazine is designed after the real M249 magazine for the Squad Automatic Weapon; this magazine holds 200 .68-caliber paintballs, like most hoppers. Unlike a hopper. though, this magazine feeds from beneath the marker. The magazine is battery-operated and is force-fed into the chamber of the marker prior to each shot. This magazine is currently compatible only with the T68 markers.  T68 AK47 Gen6  Another product of the T68 production line is, the T68 AK47. RAP4 completed its scenario and realism focus by producing the two most common assault rifle, just in a paintball gun version. The M16 and AK47 are both available for purchase as a paintball marker. The T68 Gen6 AK47 features an all-metal construction with the RAP4 internal Flexi Air System. Each unit incorporates a magazine-feed system with an 18-round detachable magazine. The AK47 Paintball Gun is designed for scenario paintball and for military training.

Kelley, their daughter Emma Niederbrock and friend Melanie Wells. Emma Niederbrock shared an online relationship with Richard Samuel McCroskey, a troubled aspiring rapper. Together, Emma Niederbrock, McCroskey, her mother, and father, along with friend Wells, attended a horrorcore concert the week before. When Wells' mother could not locate her daughter, she alerted police, who discovered the murders. McCroskey, 20 years old, was subsequently arrested, convicted of the murders and sentenced to life in prison. As of 2020, he is serving his sentence at Wallens Ridge State Prison in Big Stone Gap, Virginia. The murders The murders took place at Dr. Debra Kelley's home, where Kelley lived with her daughter Emma Niederbrock. The bodies were found just after 3:00 p.m. on September 17, 2009, the victims having been bludgeoned to death with a hammer and maul. Three bodies were found in a downstairs bedroom and one in a room upstairs. Days before the killings Emma Niederbrock and Melanie Wells joined McCroskey in Michigan for a horrorcore concert, the Strictly for the Wicked Festival. According to police, Emma's parents, Debra Kelley and Mark Niederbrock had taken Emma Niederbrock, Melanie Wells and McCroskey to the concert. Prince Edward County Commonwealth's Attorney James Ennis said McCroskey's anger over his failing relationship with Emma Niederbrock led to the killings. Ennis says McCroskey was angered by some text messages Emma sent while they were in Michigan. They returned to Virginia, and McCroskey became increasingly distraught about the relationship, Ennis said. He had an expectation that he and Emma were seeing each other exclusively and was unhappy with how things were going. Late in the evening of Sept. 14, 2009, or early the next morning, McCroskey attacked the three female victims in the house as they were sleeping, Ennis said. He killed each within a short period of time around 3 a.m. on Sept. 15. Ennis said that McCroskey first killed Wells, who was on a sofa in a first-floor den, then Kelley in an upstairs room, and finally Emma in her downstairs bedroom. He struck each victim multiple times with the maul. \\"No one awoke,\\" Ennis said, adding that the victims had no defensive wounds. Mark Niederbrock arrived at the home three days later, Sept. 17 about 5 p.m., and McCroskey attacked him with the maul in a living room, Ennis said. McCroskey later moved Mark Niederbrock's and Wells‚Äô bodies into Emma's room, and he attempted to clean up the bloody den, Ennis said. At some point, McCroskey used a digital camera to record a video of himself, according to Ennis. In the video, he indicated that he knew he had to pay for what he had done and contemplated suicide, Ennis said. A press release was issued to the public at the time of the murders. An e-mail was sent to Longwood University students. The following Monday, the Attorney General and Farmville County Police Department held a press conference where the bodies were identified. The victims Mark Niederbrock was a pastor at a Presbyterian church in Hixburg in northern Appomattox County, and father of 16-year-old Emma Niederbrock. Niederbrock had been heading Walker's Presbyterian Church for the past six years. Born in Illinois, Niederbrock was an Eagle Scout and graduate of the University of Illinois. Before he entered the ministry he worked as a graphic designer. Niederbrock and his wife Debra Kelley had been divorced for about nine months. Dr. Debra S. Kelley was a 53-year-old associate professor of sociology and criminal justice studies at Longwood University. Emma Niederbrock was Mark Niederbrock's and Debra Kelley's 16-year-old daughter and a friend of Richard McCroskey, the convicted murderer. She had been home-schooled since middle school. Melanie Wells was the 18-year-old daughter of Thomas G. Wells Jr. and Kathleen Wells, of Inwood, West Virginia, and Emma Niederbrock's friend. Wells and her family moved to West Virginia from Louisville, Kentucky, just before Wells was to enter high school. Wells dropped out and was studying for her high school equivalency diploma. She attended Musselman High School. Wells had been staying with Emma Niederbrock and Emma's mother. Perpetrator Richard Samuel McCroskey (born December 26, 1988) had been a graphic designer and amateur horrorcore rapper and had been living with his father and 21-year-old sister in Castro Valley, California. McCroskey and his sister had been raised in Hayward before moving to Castro Valley. In high school, McCroskey had been teased and bullied because of his weight and red hair. Neighbors described him as a loner. His sister Sarah recalled him as a mild-mannered and kind person who never fought back or defended himself unless provoked. McCroskey's MySpace page featured songs he authored with violent lyrics, dealing with subjects including mutilation, death and the thrill of murder. McCroskey dropped out of Tennyson High School in Hayward, then attended Hayward High School for a time before dropping out again. About five months prior to the murders, McCroskey had been devastated when his father asked their mother to move out. He was excited for a planned trip to Virginia to see friend Emma Niederbrock, whom he had dated online for almost a year and spoken with almost daily by phone. He flew to Virginia on September 6. Investigation, arrest and conviction Prior to discovering the murders, Melanie Wells' mother had called city police asking them to check on her daughter. Each time Melanie Wells' mother had called the Kelley home and spoken with Richard McCroskey, McCroskey had given her a different story. When police arrived at the Kelley home, McCroskey answered the door and told police Wells was at the movies with a friend. The police left, and when Melanie Wells' mother called police again they went to the house and discovered the bodies. By that time, McCroskey had fled, stealing and wrecking Mark Niederbrock's 2000 Honda. Unaware of the murders, a deputy issued him a summons for driving without a license but did not arrest him. Prince Edward Sheriff's Sgt. Stuart Raybold said at the time there was no reason for the deputy to be suspicious. During this time, McCroskey made a call to confess he had just killed the victims. McCroskey was apprehended at Richmond International Airport on September 18, where police found him sleeping in the baggage claim area, about to fly back to California. McCroskey, who had no prior criminal record, was first charged with first degree murder, robbery and grand larceny (stealing the car), but later was charged with six counts of capital murder. McCroskey was subsequently held in Piedmont Regional jail, on suicide watch. Police concluded the victims died from blunt force trauma to the head. Police occult expert Don Rimer, brought in because of symbols found in the music the teens listened to, described the murder scene as a slaughter house. McCroskey did not initially cooperate with police after his arrest. The police took McCroskey's computer, house phones and more than a dozen paper bags full of evidence from his home. McCroskey was charged with six counts of capital murder per Virginia criminal law. On September 20, 2010, McCroskey pleaded guilty to the four murders. Although facing the death penalty, he was sentenced to life in prison. Commonwealth's Attorney James Ennis says that the victims' families supported his decision to reach a plea agreement instead of going to trial and seeking the death penalty.

Life He was born in Nottinghamshire, the son of Robert Hodgson Fowler (1798-1858) the vicar of Holy Trinity Church, Rolleston and Frances Elizabeth Bish (1802-1872). Career In the early 1860s, following an apprenticeship with Sir George Gilbert Scott, he commenced work in Pimlico, London, and became an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1863. His proposers were Scott, E. W. Pugin and Matthew Digby Wyatt. In 1864, he moved to Durham, where he lived for the rest of his life. Fowler's initial appointment in Durham was as Clerk of Works at Durham Cathedral in succession to E.R. Robson. In 1870 he became a Fellow of the RIBA. At various times, he held the position of Architect to Rochester Cathedral and Lincoln Cathedral, and Architect to the Diocese of York and the Diocese of Lincoln. From 1885 to the time of his death, he was Architect to the Dean and Chapter of Durham, a post that had previously been held by Sir George Gilbert Scott. Almost all of Fowler's work was done in four counties: County Durham, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire.DSA architect biography Designs Although much of Fowler's work involved restoring and enlarging buildings, he was the architect of a number of new or rebuilt churches.

It is a notable work of Polish romanticism, focusing on the issues such as thirst for power and evolution of the criminal mind. The story revolves around the rise and fall of Balladyna, a fictional Slavic queen. One of the most famous and controversial stagings of Balladyna took place in 1974 at the Grand Theatre in Warsaw. It was directed by Adam Hanuszkiewicz with Anna Chodakowska playing the titular role. Balladyna was performed as tragi-comedy in English for the first time in the United Kingdom in November 2018 by Passing Stranger Theatre Company at Drayton Arms Theatre in Kensington, London and directed by Emma Blacklay-Piech, with a Polish actress Anna Krauze in title role. Power and ethics in tragedy Balladyna by Maksymilian Gierymski, 1868 Zofia Jaroszewska in the role of Balladyna, 1938 Balladyna has been compared to Macbeth, both being dramas which show how evil and prone to suggestion human nature is. In both cases, the author claims that it is impossible to righteously rule a country if power was gained unlawfully.Klp.pl Plot Balladyna opens with a young prince Kirkor consulting with a Hermit on whom to marry. The Hermit reveals that he was formerly King Popiel III, who was deposed by his brother who also murdered his three children. However when exiled he was able to bring the true ancient crown of Poland with him. Kirkor swears to raise an army and restore the throne to him. The Hermit considers women untrustworthy and advises Kirkor to find a plain cottage and to marry a poor girl as he will be happier that way. Balladyna and Alina are sisters who live with their mother in a poor hut in the middle of a forest. Goplana ‚Äì the nymph queen of Gop≈Ço Lake - is in love with Balladyna's beloved, Grabiec, and because of her jealousy she intervenes in peoples' lives and changes their destiny. The sisters‚Äô hut is visited by the rich Kirkor, who was led there by Skierka, Goplana's servant. Goplana wanted Kirkor to fall in love with Balladyna so that Grabiec could be hers alone, but Skierka made a mistake and Kirkor fell in love with both sisters. He also believes that this proves the Hermit's advice was good to marry a poor girl. The sisters compete to marry Kirkor by collecting raspberries. When Balladyna finds out that Alina is winning, she kills her with a knife. The only witness is Grabiec, whom Goplana turns into a weeping willow to prevent him from telling anyone about the murder. After returning home, Balladyna claims that her sister ran away with a lover. The only things reminding Balladyna of the crime she committed are a bloody stain on her forehead that cannot be removed, pangs of remorse and terrible nightmares. The body of the dead girl is found by Filon, who falls in love with her. Soon after the marriage, Kirkor leaves for the battle of Gniezno and wedding guests come to the castle. Balladyna is so ashamed of her mother that she orders the servants to lock her in a tower. During Kirkor's absence, Balladyna and Kirkor's knight, Fon Kostryn, fall in love. Balladyna decides to visit the Hermit hoping that he will remove the bloody stain. The perceptive Hermit soon discovers Balladyna's deeds and sends her away. With the Hermit distracted by this, Goplana's servants find and steal his crown. Kostryn, to prove his loyalty to Balladyna, aids her in killing a messenger sent by Kirkor with presents for his wife. In the castle, a feast takes place, with the guests including Grabiec (dressed as the King of Bells [in English Diamonds], wearing the Hermit's/Popiel's crown), and the nymphs Skierka and Chochlik. Balladyna disavows her mother and exiles her from the castle. When hearing Chochlik's song detailing her felonies, Balladyna goes mad. She hears voices from beyond, sees the ghost of her sister and finally passes out. In the middle of the night, Balladyna and Kostryn kill Grabiec and take the crown ‚Äì the symbol of legitimate royal rule ‚Äì and leave for Gniezno to seize power. Balladyna orders that the Hermit be killed. Fon Kostryn defeats Kirkor's army in battle and Kirkor dies on the battlefield. Soon after, Balladyna gives Kostryn a piece of bread sliced with a poisoned knife. Kostryn dies in agony, warning against Balladyna's rule with his dying breath. Balladyna becomes the queen. The chancellor informs her that, as a new monarch, she should decide on some of the cases pleaded by her subjects. The first case concerns the poisoning of Kostryn and Balladyna is forced to sentence an unknown man to death. The next case regards the death of Alina and another unknown innocent is sentenced to death. At that moment Balladyna's mother enters the palace, blinded by lightning and complaining about her daughter who drove her out of the castle during the storm and who refused to have anything to do with her. She refuses to name Balladyna and is killed during torture. Forced by the chancellor, Balladyna issues a third death sentence for the daughter. The triple punishment on Balladyna is carried out by God himself, who strikes the evil queen with lightning, killing her.

Both members Nick Woolfson and Elliot Jones met through their involvement with the underground music scene in London. Their style has been described as ambient dub-techno by musical critic Jason Birchmeier . According to Birchmeier, the compositions were \\"meticulously crafted downtempo (...) with a combination of analog and digital gear\\". Career Elliot Jones's background is in chillout and dub music, from running his own label and performing for clubs and gatherings in the early 1990s. Nick Woolfson has worked in lots of different styles of music, as long as it is innovative and good quality, with downtempo being his comfort zone. Jones had written Triangle as a demo which was introduced to Woolfson; their styles matched and the duo was born. Woolfson's studio in London is called The Starlight Rooms. Woolfson has been working primarily with Mac and Logic for approximately the last 10 years. He has incorporated older analog and digital synthesizers into his music: Yamaha CS-70, ARP Axxe, Moog Rogue, Yamaha CS30, Roland TB-303, Yamaha DX7, Virus, 2 x Roland JV-1080, 2 x Akai S3000 samplers. A Mackie 32-8 plus extra 24 input mixing desk has been rendered virtually redundant by the Mac. SFTG have collaborated with various artists over the years, including vocalists Taz, Aine, Colein, Nicola Hitchcock, Dillinger and General Levy. The duo has also worked with pedal steel guitarist BJ Cole, ex Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor, as well as Gaudi and Benjamin Zephaniah. The duo were regular performers and DJs at The Big Chill music festivals, and have played at Glastonbury. In October 2010 SFTG released their studio album The Maze, which was followed by the release of a remastered version of Mosaic on 28 March 2011. A new EP download only release was offered later that year, as well as Luminal (remastered). In 2012 the duo released Ready, Steady, Slow (A Chillout Release), and Widerworld which was published on Waveform Records on 11 September.

It is used in drainage design. Parameters in Hooghoudt's drainage equation A well known steady-state drainage equation is the Hooghoudt drain spacing equation. Its original publication is in Dutch.S.B.Hooghoudt, 1940 (in Dutch). Algemene beschouwing van het probleem van de detailontwatering en de infiltratie door middel van parallel loopende drains, greppels, slooten en kanalen.

By considering a long-term (e.g. seasonal) average depth of the water table (Dw) in combination with the long-term average recharge rate (R), the net storage of water in that period of time is negligibly small and the steady state condition is satisfied: one obtains a dynamic equilibrium. Derivation of the equation For the derivation of the equation Hooghoudt used the law of Darcy, the summation of circular potential functions and, for the determination of the influence of the impermeable layer, de method of mirror images and superposition. Hooghoudt published tables for the determination of the equivalent depth (d), because the function (F) in d = F (L,Di-Dd,r) consists of long series of terms. Crop yield (Y) and seasonal average depth of water table (X in dm) Data provided by various authors on banana, cotton, sugarcane and wheat response to shallow water tables Determining: *the discharge rate (Q) from the recharge rate (R) in a water balance as detailed in the article: hydrology (agriculture) *the permissible long term average depth of the water table (Dw) on the basis of agricultural drainage criteria *the soil's hydraulic conductivity (Ka and Kb) by measurements *the depth of the bottom of the aquifer (Di) the design drain spacing (L) can be found from the equation in dependence of the drain depth (Dd) and drain radius (r). Drainage criteria One would not want the water table to be too shallow to avoid crop yield depression nor too deep to avoid drought conditions. This is a subject of drainage research. The figure shows that a seasonal average depth of the water table shallower than 70 cm causes a yield depression Drainage research in farmers' fields: analysis of data.
