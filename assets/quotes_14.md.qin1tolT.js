He is an Independent politician, but a member of the European Green Party. Tarand has served as an advisor to the Prime Minister of Estonia and as the Secretary General of the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Biography Tarand is the eldest son of Andres Tarand. His mother Mari Tarand is a well-known linguist and the elder sister of Juhan Viiding. He studied history at the University of Tartu, as well as the University of Bologna, Italy. As a student during the Soviet occupation, he was expelled in his first year for lighting candles with his fellow Estonian patriots on the grave of Julius Kuperjanov, an Estonian military commander. Tarand was forced to the Soviet military service and after that he finished the university in 1991. In 2005, Tarand caused a scandal at a soccer game by wearing a shirt that bore the names of some former Communist Party members, including Estonian president Arnold Rüütel and Prime Minister Andrus Ansip with the words Kommarid ahju! (\\"Commies to the oven!\\") This was one of the reasons that caused defense minister Jaak Jõerüüt to resign.Defence minister suddenly resigns In 2006, Tarand participated as a celebrity contestant on the first season of Tantsud tähtedega, an Estonian version of Dancing with the Stars. His professional dancing partner was Kaisa Oja. He is also a freelance journalist hosting programmes in radio and television, including the Estonian version of Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?.

Career Scott Herbert Carl Campbell began writing poetry at the age of six and songs at the age of eight. He taught himself guitar, piano, alto saxophone, oboe, violin, and multitrack audio recording. He formed Nebula Records in 1972 and released the single Apparition/Astral Spirit in 1973 under the band name Apparition, playing all the instruments on both songs. Campbell formed The Sillies in 1977, considered one of Detroit's first modern punk rock bands.

The Police, Ultravox, The Damned, John Cale, Peter Hammill, The Cramps, and many other acts made their Detroit debuts at Bookie's. As a result, numerous other clubs catering to original live music sprang up as a result of the success of Bookie's. Campbell left Bookie's in late 1979 and presented concerts and benefits around Detroit. He began performing under his own name in 1982 and released the single \\"I'm Saving Myself For Angela Cartwright\\", in 1986. Campbell has appeared in the films Mirror, Mirror (1989) and Hoffa (1992) as an extra.

It was released as the album's third single on 21 June 2009, by Island and Moshi Moshi Records. The song was written by Florence Welch and Paul Epworth, produced by Epworth and mixed by Cenzo Townshend. The song contains elements of \\"House Jam\\" by Gang Gang Dance. It has been remixed by numerous artists, including Jamie T, whose remix appears on the single's CD and digital releases. \\"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)\\" peaked at number 12 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the band's third most successful single to date, behind \\"Spectrum\\", which peaked at number one, and \\"You've Got the Love\\", which reached number five. Background \\"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)\\" features Florence Welch's voice overdubbed with so many harmonies she sounds like a massed choir of one. She confessed to The Independent: \\"The guy who mixed it nearly had a nervous breakdown.\\" The song was co-written by Welch together with Paul Epworth who also produced the song which was recorded by Mark Rankin. The track features Tom 'Moth' Monger on harp and Robert Ackroyd on guitar. During the verses, the song features some of the melody and lyrics (e.g. \\"How quickly the glamour fades\\") from Gang Gang Dance's song \\"House Jam\\". Florence described her inspiration behind the song: > I'd written all these dark songs, and the label suggested we should have > something that was a bit more upbeat. In the process of trying to do that, I > realised maybe I was sacrificing something. So I had a really upbeat piano > and drums, but the lyrics that came out were 'This is the gift/It comes with > a price/ Who is the lamb/And who is the knife?' The rabbit heart is a > reference to fear. I'm so afraid of what's about to happen. Of being in the > spotlight. As part of the single's promotion, the band performed the song on The Jonathan Ross Show as well as in BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. The single was also performed at numerous festivals across the United Kingdom throughout 2009, including Glastonbury, Electric Picnic, Brighton, T in the Park, Bestival and Reading, among others. The song was also featured as BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe's \\"Single of the Week\\". Critical reception \\"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)\\" received critical acclaim from music critics. Pitchfork Media wrote that Welch \\"add[s] some welcomed ambiguity to a Paul Epworth production that stunningly internalizes every pseudo-psych/freakishly-folk trend that's passed through these parts over the last few years. 'The looking glass so shiny and new/ How quickly the glamor fades,' wisely observes Welch. A gold record in every way.\\" Chart performance On 4 July 2009, \\"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)\\" debuted at number twelve on the UK Singles Chart. It spent a total of seven weeks in the top twenty, and seventeen in the official top seventy-five, a significantly longer charting period than any of the band's previous three singles. \\"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)\\" debuted at number forty-two on the Irish Singles Chart on 27 June 2009.

It was shot on location at Painshill Park in Cobham, Surrey on 6 May 2009. Welch told NME that the video shoot had \\"a twisted mid summer night's dream feel to it.\\" The video premiered on YouTube on 14 May 2009. The video starts in a field with a piece of cloth being lifted from in front of Welch's face, before she begins spinning as two girls follow her. The girls then start to dance all around the field, you see a harp being played and then Welch joins in the dancing, doing the bunny hop. Welch sits at a table with six other people, including a man wearing a top hat, there are pig heads served on a plate. Welch and the other six people throw the food on the floor and begin to dance. Welch lies down on the table and the other people lift up the sides to make it into a coffin. The people carry the coffin into the river and it drifts away as the video ends.

Early life and family Navaratnam was born on 25 October 1910. He was the son of Vaithianathan from Karampon on the island of Velanaitivu in northern Ceylon. He was educated at Karampon Shanmuganathan Maha Vidyalayam, St. Patrick's College, Jaffna and Ananda College. After school he joined Ceylon Law College, graduating as a proctor in 1936. Navaratnam married his first cousin Parameswari. They had five sons (Chandra Mohan, Jagadishan, Jegan Mohan, Raj Mohan and Bala Mohan) and a daughter (Shyamala). Career Navaratnam became interested in politics following Ceylonese independence in 1948. He was appointed joint secretary of the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (Federal Party) when it was founded in 1949. Navaratnam stood as ITAK's candidate in Kayts at the 1952 parliamentary election but was defeated by the All Ceylon Tamil Congress candidate Alfred Thambiayah. He was ITAK's theoretician and played an important role in the formulation of the Bandaranaike–Chelvanayakam Pact. Navaratnam stood as ITAK's candidate in the constituency in the 1963 by-election following the sitting MP V. A. Kandiah's death. He won the election and entered Parliament. He was re- elected at the 1965 parliamentary election. An ardent Tamil nationlist, Navaratnam fell out with the ITAK leadership over its decision to join Dudley Senanayake's national government and left the party in 1968. In 1969 he founded the Tamils Suyaadchchi Kazahagam (Tamil Self Rule Party) which campaigned for Tamil self-rule and independence for the Tamil speaking provinces of Ceylon. He stood as an independent candidate in Kayts at the 1970 and 1977 parliamentary elections but on each occasion was defeated the ITAK/Tamil United Liberation Front candidate K. P. Ratnam. Navaratnam has written two books: Ceylon Faces Crisis (1956) and The Fall and Rise of the Tamil Nation (1995). He died on 22 December 2006 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Campi is best known as one of the first northern Italian artists to work in the Flemish style of realist genre painting. Early career Campi was born into a family of prominent artists. He was the son of Italian Renaissance painter Galeazzo Campi, and younger brother of painters Giulio and Antonio. Vincenzo and Antonio are thought to have trained in the workshop of their older brother Giulio, a prominent painter and architect working in Cremona.[The Age Of Caravaggio. 1985. New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 57.] Few records exist of Vincenzo's early years, with the first record of the artist's work being a portrait (now lost) of Archduke Ernest and his brother Rudolf of Austria painted during their stay in Cremona during 1563.[Ibid.] Vincenzo Campi, Christ Nailed to the Cross, 1577, oil on canvas, 210 x 141 cm, Museo del Prado, Madrid Style =Cremonese Mannerism and Lombard naturalism= While his brothers Giulio and Antonio worked closely within the Cremonese Mannerist style, Vincenzo was celebrated for his naturalism and ‘descriptive mode of painting’[ Moynihan, Kim-Ly Thi. 2012. \\"Comedy, Science, And The Reform Of Description In Lombard Painting Of The Late Renaissance: Arcimboldo, Vincenzo Campi, And Bartolomeo Passerotti\\". Ph.D, Columbia University, 165.] as described by Filippo Baldinucci in his Notizie as, ‘(a) good naturalist, keeping always to the imitation of the real.’[Baldinucci, Filippo. 1815. Notizie Del Professore Del Disegno De Cinnabar. 2nd ed. Florence: Francesco Saverio Baldinucci and Ferdinan Ranalli, 188.] Vincenzo's development in style is thought to have been motivated by both the death of his brother Giulio in 1573, and the influence of an important commission received in that same year. Vincenzo was commissioned to fresco the spandrels of the Cremona Cathedral left unfinished by painter Il Pordenone some fifty years previously. It is suggested that it was through the loss of the stylistic guidance of his brother, and the influence of Pordenone's raw and expressive frescos, that Vincenzo began to merge the styles of Cremonese Mannerism and Lombard naturalism in his painting.[ Moynihan, Kim-Ly Thi. 2012. \\"Comedy, Science, And The Reform Of Description In Lombard Painting Of The Late Renaissance: Arcimboldo, Vincenzo Campi, And Bartolomeo Passerotti\\". Ph.D, Columbia University, 172.] =Religious painting= Although it is not what he is best known for, Vincenzo and his brothers were most active as painters of religious subjects. Pordenone's influence can be clearly seen in Vincenzo's 1575 altarpiece, Christ Before the Crucifixion that shows the artist's developing Lombard naturalism. The crucifixion is unconventionally depicted with Christ standing awkwardly over the cross while his arm is pulled to the ground by the hand of the executioner poised between his legs. The peculiar pose was appropriated from an early drawing by Il Pordenone depicting the Passion of Christ.[Ibid. 173.] =Northern Italian genre painting= Campi is best known for his significant contribution to the birth of northern Italian genre painting. The style appeared quite suddenly between 1580 and 1585 in Cremona and Bologna, and its development was heavily influenced by similar genre paintings by Flemish artists Pieter Aertsen and Joachim Beuckelaer.[McTighe, Sheila. 2004. \\"Foods And The Body In Italian Genre Paintings, About 1580: Campi, Passarotti, Carracci\\". The Art Bulletin 86 (2): 301. Access to these works was made possible by the import of Flemish genre paintings, in particular those of Beuckelaer, from Antwerp to Cremona by wealthy merchants including the Affaitati banking family who had holdings in both cities.[Ibid.] It is highly likely that Campi had access to these imported paintings through his time painting for the House of Farnese in Piacenza where the family held significant collections of these imported Flemish genre scenes.[The Age Of Caravaggio. 1985. New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 57.] Campi was a key figure in the birth of genre painting in northern Italy as he was the first to paint a series of paintings depicting butchers, fish vendors and poultry sellers as a commission for the wealthy Fugger family of Augsburg.[McTighe, Sheila. 2004. \\"Foods And The Body In Italian Genre Paintings, About 1580: Campi, Passarotti, Carracci\\". The Art Bulletin 86 (2): 301.] This development saw a move away from Mannerism towards an “Anti-Mannerist” naturalism[Ibid. 303] described by Art Historian Walter Friedlaender, as, 'A healthy down-to- earth spirit (coming) into existence, paralleling a vigorous treatment of form achieved through purposeful work and renewed contact with living reality.'[Friedlaender, Walter F and Donald Posner. 1965. Mannerism And Anti- Mannerism In Italian Painting. New York: Schocken Books.] Vincenzo Campi, Pescivendoli (The fishmongers), 1579, oil on canvas, 146 x 214 cm. La Roche- sur-Yon museum. Vincenzo Campi, Fishmongers, c. 1580, oil on canvas, 145 x 215 cm, Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan Vincenzo Campi, The Ricotta Eaters, 1580, oil on canvas, Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon Campi's depictions of the villano, or peasant illustrated and reinforced a contemporary northern Italian discourse that argued certain foods were only appropriate for high-born citizens and others for low-born.[Pisanelli, Baldassare. 1586. Trattato Della Natura De' Cibi Et Del Bere. Venetia: Gio. Alberti.] Campi's Fishmongers depicts its subjects eating beans, dark bread, and scallions, which were the exact foods listed as only suitable for the working classes in Bartolomeo Pisanelli's influential Trattato della natura de’ cibi et del bere published in 1585. Cheese was also seen to be suitable nourishment for the lower classes, '(who) do not have the means to provide themselves with other more healthy foods’.[Ibid.46] Campi illustrates the low standing of cheese in his work, The Ricotta Eaters, which rather unflatteringly depicts \\"gluttonous peasants\\" laughing and spooning fresh cheese into their gaping mouths. Despite Campi's choice to depict the lower working classes, his treatment of these subjects was neither sympathetic nor romanticised. With the heavy use of food metaphors and established character tropes, Campi often depicts his subjects as crude, dim-witted, and sexually available.[McTighe, Sheila. 2004. \\"Foods And The Body In Italian Genre Paintings, About 1580: Campi, Passarotti, Carracci\\". The Art Bulletin 86 (2):303.] Art Historian Barry Wind sees these works as a contemporary extension of the classical idea of pitture ridicole, or comic painting, where the painting served as a ‘”sustained bawdy joke”[Wind, Barry. 1974. “Pitture Ridicole: Some Late Cinquecento Comic Genre Painting.” Storia Dell’arte 20: 24–35.] for an educated man with a low sense of humour.’[McTighe, Sheila. 2004. \\"Foods And The Body In Italian Genre Paintings, About 1580: Campi, Passarotti, Carracci\\". The Art Bulletin 86 (2):303.] Influence Other artists working alongside Campi in Cremona between 1580 and 1585 include Bartolomeo Passarotti and his apprentice, Annibale Carracci who both made significant contributions to the development of northern Italian genre painting. Art historians often describe these 1580s works as a precursor to Caravaggio’s more progressive realism emerging in the following decade.[Ibid.] Selected works File:Vincenco Campi- Cucina.jpgVincenco Campi, Kitchen, 1580, oil on canvas, Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan File:Vincenzo Campi - Chicken Vendors - WGA3826.jpgVincenzo Campi, Chicken Vendors, 1580, oil on canvas, Pinacoteca di Brera File:Vincenzo Campi - Christ in the House of Mary and Martha - WGA03831.jpgVincenzo Campi, Christ in the House of Mary and Martha, c.1580, oil on canvas, Galleria Estense File:Vincenzo Campi - St Matthew and the Angel - WGA03832.jpgVincenzo Campi, St Matthew and the Angel, 1588, oil on canvas, 268 x 180 cm, San Francesco d'Assisi File:Vincenzo Campi Cristo inchiodato alla Croce Prado.jpgVincenzo Campi, The Crucifixion, c. 1575, oil on canvas, 201 x 141 cm, Museo del Prado, Madrid File:Campi, Ascension of Christ, San Paolo Converso, Milan 01.jpgVincenzo Campi, Ascension of Christ, 1588, fresco, San Paolo Converso, Milan Sources *Baldinucci, Filippo. 1815.

Cleaning graffiti off buildings costs billions of dollars annually. Many cities have started anti-graffiti programs but vandalism is still a problem. Companies across the globe are attempting to develop coatings to prevent vandals from defacing public and private property. The coatings being developed can be the paint itself, or a clear coat added on top of existing paint or building facades. Depending on the substrate and the severity of graffiti, different coatings give different benefits and disadvantages.Andrew Turley. 9 March 2009. Anti-Graffiti Paint Cleans Up on Historic Buildings. Chemistry and Industry. 9.  Types of paint  There are two common types of paint used today. The first are water-based paints such as latex and acrylic paint, and the second are oil-based paints. The paint of choice will depend on the substrate to be painted upon and the desired end result. All paints have the same basic structure: * Pigment – This is the part of the paint that is seen by the eye. The pigment gives the paint opacity and color. The pigments of all paints contain a white base composed of titanium dioxide (TiO2) or zinc oxide (ZnO). Dyes are added to the pigment to attain the desired color. *Binder – the binder is the glue that holds the paint together. This is usually a polymer that upon drying will polymerize to keep the pigments homogeneous and adhered to the substrate. *Solvent – this is the bulk of the paint, it is used to keep the paint workable when it is wet. After paint is applied to a surface the solvent evaporates, the pigment and binder will coalesce together to form a uniform coating. The solvent is water for water-based paints, and an oil for oil-based paints. Paint drying on surface There actually is no chemical bond between paint and an underlying surface. Paint adheres simply through physical forces like Van der Waals. When paint is first applied to a surface it goes on as a thick wet coating. As the solvent is allowed to evaporate out, the pigment plates which are attracted to one another stack up to form layers. The binder polymerizes essentially locking the pigment plates together. What remains is a uniform coating of binder and pigment. Anti-graffiti coatings make paints unable to adhere to the surface.  Types of coatings  Anti-graffiti coatings can be invisible to the naked eye. There are two different categories of anti-graffiti coatings. The first, sacrificial coatings, are applied to a surface and then removed when graffiti is applied. The surface underneath will be left clean and a new sacrificial coating can be applied. The other type of coating are permanent coatings that prevent graffiti from adhering to a surface in the first place. Newer coatings are made of charged polymeric materials that form a gel on the surface of the building or substrate. Some of the most important characteristics of anti- graffiti coatings are: * Sufficient adherence without damage to substrates * Hydrophobicity (water-repellance) * Environmentally friendly composition and processing * Resistance to UV aging and weathering * Good Cleaning Efficiency = Sacrificial coatings = A sacrificial coating forms a clear coat barrier over the wall or surface being protected. If the surface is vandalized the coating can be removed (sacrificed) using a high-pressure washer taking the graffiti with it. The coating then must be reapplied. The materials used to make a sacrificial coating are usually inexpensive optically clear polymers such as acrylates, biopolymers, and waxes. These polymers form weak bonds with the substrate to allow for easy removal. = Semi sacrificial coatings = A semi sacrificial coating known as a safety shield acts as a penetrating sealer on the wall or surface protecting the surface pores. If the surface is vandalized the coating can be particularly removed using a combination of graffiti removal solvent and high-pressure washer. The anti graffiti safety shield is generally reapplied every second attack. While it is possible to use only pressure to remove coating, this will cause additional surface erosion. = Permanent coatings = Permanent coatings are often more expensive than sacrificial coatings, but if used appropriately only have to be applied once. These work by creating a protective surface that spray paint cannot bond to. After the surface has been vandalized, often all that is needed to remove the paint is a simple solvent (toluene) and some manual labor. The underlying surface and the protective coating will remain undamaged. Some of the types of permanent coatings include those based on polyurethanes, nano-particles, fluorinated hydrocarbons, or siloxanes. Polyurethane coatings are useful because of their barrier properties. High chain stiffness and high crosslinking density reduces the ability of the polymer to swell and absorb graffiti paint.CBS Interactive. BNET Fluorinated coatings are some of the most effective in the field of graffiti prevention. Fluorine is the most electronegative element, meaning that it shows very little affinity for the electrons of other elements. When fluorine is attached to a surface it will decrease surface energy at the interface, minimizing the contact with the graffiti paint. For the same reason that a Teflon-coated pan repels both water and oil, a fluorinated coating will repel water and oil-based paints. These coatings also have the added benefit of being chemically inert as well as very durable. They are also expensive and can be difficult to apply.Jurgen Scheeder, N. Visscher, T. Nabuurs, and A. Overbeek. Oct 2005. Novel, Water- Based Fluorinated Polymers With Excellent Antigraffiti Properties. JCT Research. 2:8, 617–625. Silicon based coatings are hydrophobic, which means the surface repels water. This reduces the effects of photo-oxidation of surfaces. Hydrophobic and lipophobic ligands grafted to nanoparticles in coating One of the newer additions to this ever growing market are nanoparticle based coatings. Silica particles are formed using the sol-gel method. The resulting silica particles have both reactive (Si-OH) and nonreactive (Si=O) groups on the surface. The reactive groups provide locations for further chemical processing, which allow you to change the surface properties of the nanoparticles. For anti-graffiti coatings, hydrophobic and oleophobic (oil-fearing) ligands are grafted onto the silica nanoparticles. Hydrophobic ligands are non-polar molecules such as hydrocarbon chains. Oleophobic ligands consist of polar molecules. Normally these two different types of molecules would phase separate in solution, for the same reason that water and oil do not mix. By chemically grafting the ligands onto the silica particles, this effect is counteracted. The effect is a coating that shows an equal dislike for both water-based and oil-based paints.Bayer MaterialScience. Wiping Out Graffiti. Bayer AG. 26 April 2009. . Use on historic buildings and monuments The use of anti-graffiti barrier coatings to protect graffiti-prone historic buildings, monuments, and other culturally- sensitive surfaces may seem to be an easy solution to a persistent problem. Research suggests that the application of such coatings can cause physical or aesthetic changes or otherwise damage historic substrates.Ashurst, Nicola; Chapman, Sasha; MacDonald, Susan; Butlin, Roy; Murry, Matthew. \\"An investigation of sacrificial graffiti barriers for historic masonry.\\" English Heritage Research Transactions. Vol. 2 (2002). Both the National Park Service and English Heritage advise against the use of anti-graffiti coatings and promote the exercise of caution when they are applied to historic buildings and monuments.Weaver, Martin E. \\"Preservation Brief 38: Removing Graffiti from Historic Masonry.\\" National Park Service (1995). CoatingsEnglish Heritage. \\"Graffiti on historic buildings and monuments: Methods of removal and prevention.\\" Technical Advice Note. English Heritage (1999). In the United States, many state and local historic district commissions and review boards have regulations that require approval for both graffiti removal work and the application of coatings applied to the facades on designated landmarks or properties located in local historic districts. Alternatives to anti-graffiti barrier coatings include security measures such as night lighting and surveillance cameras, design strategies such as barrier plantings and fences, improved maintenance of the general area and rapid graffiti removal, as well as community awareness raising programs like a neighborhood watch. Use in charity Anti-graffiti coatings are frequently used by a number of charities that use public installations to raise money for their respective causes. In cases where pieces of art and sculptures may be put out into the public, these coatings have been used to protect the pieces against graffiti attacks. These sculptures are protected by anti-graffiti coatings, often polysiloxane clear coatings so as to protect them from graffiti and weather damage.

The Russian Aviation and Space Agency, Rosaviakosmos, was responsible for the mission. Launched in January 2001 after a short delay due to a problem with Mir, on 27 January Progress M1-5 became the last spacecraft to dock with the station. It spent two months attached to the Kvant-1 module before deorbiting the station on 23 March 2001. Mir re-entered the atmosphere with Progress M1-5 still docked, disintegrating over the Pacific Ocean, with debris falling into the ocean at around 06:00 GMT. During the early stages of the uncrewed Progress M1-5 mission, a crewed Soyuz was placed on standby to launch in order to complete the mission if a problem occurred. The decision to deorbit Mir attracted both praise and criticism for Rosaviakosmos, while several campaigns to save the station were conducted.  Background  Mir in orbit, photo taken in 1998 from on the last Shuttle-Mir mission. A Progress spacecraft is attached on the side nearest the viewer. Mir was the seventh and last crewed space station to be launched as part of the Soviet space programme, and was the first true modular space station to be launched. The first component, the Core Module, was launched by a Proton-K rocket on 19 February 1986. This had been followed by six more modules, launched between 1987 and 1996, all using Proton-K rockets, except one which was launched aboard . Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Mir became the property of the Russian government, and the newly established Russian Aviation and Space Agency. It supported 28 long duration crews, visited by 40 crewed Soyuz and Shuttle missions, whilst 64 uncrewed Progress spacecraft were launched to support it. It was visited by 125 cosmonauts and astronauts, who performed 75 spacewalks. During the Shuttle-Mir programme, a series of American Space Shuttle missions visited Mir between 1995 and 1998 in preparation for the construction of the International Space Station. After the construction of the International Space Station began in 1998, Russian resources were split between the two stations. In 2000, Rosaviakosmos signed an agreement with MirCorp to lease the station for commercial use, with the Soyuz TM-30 mission, intended to prepare the station for future use and conduct some commercial research, being flown in later that year. This was to have been followed by more missions, including flights with space tourists, however due to the Russian government being concerned about MirCorp's ability to fund these missions, Rosaviakosmos decided against funding the continued operation of Mir. In November 2000, Rosaviakosmos decided to deorbit Mir, and the next month Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov signed an order to do so. By this stage Mir was well past the end of its design life, and Rosaviakosmos General Director Yuri Koptev believed that \\"any of its systems could well fail at any time\\". Therefore, it was decided to deorbit it whilst it was still functioning, rather than risk it falling back to Earth out of control, like Skylab in 1979 and Salyut 7 in 1991, potentially dropping debris over a populated area. At the time, Mir was the largest spacecraft ever to reenter the Earth's atmosphere, and there were concerns that sizeable pieces of debris, particularly from the docking assemblies, gyrodynes and external structure, could survive reentry. Progress M1-5, which had originally been built to resupply and refuel either Mir or the International Space Station, was selected to perform the deorbit manoeuvre. Its mission earned it the nickname Hearse. It was a Progress-M1 11F615A55 spacecraft, with the serial number 254. An uninhabited area of the southern Pacific Ocean was selected for the station to be deorbited into, as had been done with five earlier Salyut spacecraft.  Mission  = Launch and docking = The launch of Progress M1-5 on a Soyuz-U rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome Progress M1-5 was launched by a Soyuz-U carrier rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan. It was originally scheduled for launch on 16 January 2001, but by the first week of January, it was targeting 18 January. It was rolled out to the launch pad on 16 January, with the rocket departing the MIK assembly facility at Site 2 of the cosmodrome at 02:00 GMT, and was erected at the launch pad, Site 1/5, within two hours of the start of rollout. Launch was set for 06:56:26 GMT on 18 January. On the day, a problem with the computers aboard Mir developed shortly before fuelling of the Soyuz-U rocket was scheduled to commence, about five and a half hours before the launch was due to occur. The launch attempt was scrubbed, or cancelled, and the launch was expected to be delayed by four or five days. On 19 January, the launch was rescheduled for 24 January, giving controllers time to restart the computer and the station's gyroscopes, which had shut down when the computer failed. Preparations for the launch resumed on 22 January, and the launch occurred successfully at 04:28:42 GMT on 24 January. Following the launch, Progress M1-5 spent three days in free flight before docking with the rear port of the Kvant-1 module of Mir at 05:33:31 GMT on 27 January. The docking port had previously been occupied by Progress M-43, which departed at 05:19:49 on 25 January, and subsequently remained in orbit until Progress M1-5 had docked with Mir. Progress M-43, which had originally been launched to carry supplies and raise Mir's orbit, in anticipation of crewed flights which were never launched, was subsequently deorbited at 02:12 GMT on 29 January, burning up during re-entry at 02:58. Free-flights of Progress spacecraft typically lasted two days from launch to docking with Mir, however Progress M1-5 took three days to reach Mir in order to conserve fuel for the deorbit burn. If it had launched on 18 January it would have spent four days in free flight. = Post- docking = Progress M1-5 spent two months docked to Mir before the deorbit burn occurred. The gap between docking and deorbit was in order to allow the spacecraft to dock whilst Mir was still in a stable orbit, but then to allow some natural decay, or decrease in altitude, to occur in order to conserve the Progress' fuel. Controllers determined that they should wait for the station's orbital altitude to reach before deorbiting it. In addition, RKK Energia wanted to wait until after the fifteenth anniversary of the launch of the Core Module, on 19 February. Following the docking, Mir's attitude control system was used to spin the station, to provide spin-stabilisation in order to further conserve the fuel, as the station had descended to an altitude at which its gyroscopes could not be used for attitude control. The station would remain in this spin until the deorbit manoeuvres began. On 20 February, Mir was predicted to descend to 250 kilometres within five days of 9 March. By 1 March, it was at an altitude of , and descending at a rate of per day. On 7 March, the Russian space agency opted to delay the deorbit burn until the station reached as a result of natural decay, in order to allow more fuel for the burn, giving a greater range of options in the event of an anomaly during the deorbit manoeuvre. It was predicted that without intervention, the station would have naturally entered the atmosphere on 28 March. On 12 March computers aboard Mir were reactivated ahead of deorbiting, along with the control system on 13 March. On 14 March it was announced that the procedure would be conducted on 22 March. On 19 March it was delayed one day further due to a lower than expected descent rate, with the start of the first deorbit burn being set for 00:31 GMT. = Deorbit = Progress M1-5 carried of fuel with which to perform the manoeuvres to deorbit Mir. These were completed on 23 March, when three deorbit burns were made; the first two using just docking and attitude control thrusters, and the third using the main engine as well as the thrusters. The first burn began at 00:32:28 GMT, and lasted 21.5 minutes, leaving Mir in an orbit with a perigee of and an apogee of . The second burn, which began at 02:24 GMT and lasted 24 minutes, placed Mir into a by orbit. The final deorbit burn began at 05:07:36. It was scheduled to last 20 minutes, however flight controllers decided to let the Progress burn to depletion to ensure that the station re-entered as expected. The last signals from Mir were received at 05:30 GMT, as it passed out of range of its ground station. Mir re-entered the atmosphere over the southern Pacific with Progress M1-5 still docked at 05:44 GMT. It began to disintegrate at 05:52, beginning with the detachment of solar panels, followed by other peripheral structures. The modules then buckled, before detaching completely. Debris came down in the ocean at around 06:00 GMT. Debris was intended to fall at around . An official statement announced that Mir \\"ceased to exist\\" at 05:59:24 GMT. The final tracking of Mir was conducted by a United States Army site on Kwajalein Atoll. The European Space Agency, German Federal Ministry of Defence and US National Aeronautics and Space Administration also assisted with tracking Mir during its final orbit and reentry. Former cosmonaut Vladimir Solovyov, who had been a member of the first crew to visit Mir, led the mission control team which was on station during the deorbit.  Contingency planning  The Soyuz-TM spacecraft Kristall would have flown a crew to Mir, should a problem have developed on Progress M1-5 Like all Progress spacecraft, M1-5 carried two docking systems, Kurs and TORU. The automated Kurs system was the primary docking system, with TORU, which required manual input, as the backup. Because Mir was uncrewed at the time of its docking, and a cosmonaut aboard the station would have been required to perform a TORU docking, or to troubleshoot any other problems during the docking, the Soyuz-TM spacecraft Kristall was made ready for a flight to Mir should the flight control system aboard the station have failed and human intervention be required. Cosmonauts Salizhan Sharipov and Pavel Vinogradov were originally scheduled to have been on standby for this mission, with Talgat Musabayev and Yuri Baturin, the crew who eventually flew Kristall to the International Space Station during the Soyuz TM-32 mission, as the backup crew. However, in December 2000, they were replaced by Gennady Padalka and Nikolai Budarin, a crew which became known as Expedition Zero. These cosmonauts were chosen because of their training for a similar emergency mission to the International Space Station the previous year, which would have been launched if the Zvezda module had failed to dock. If a crewed flight had been launched, controllers would have waited until after it had landed to begin the deorbit of Mir. Progress M-43, which had been launched in 2000, undocked from Mir the day after Progress M1-5 launched, and was kept in orbit until Progress M1-5 docked. In the event that Progress M1-5 had been unable to dock, Progress M-43 would have returned to the station and provide supplies of food and oxygen for the Soyuz crew. Progress M-43 was deorbited after Progress M1-5 docked successfully. If Progress M1-5 had launched on 16 January, the Soyuz launch would have occurred on 10 February if it had been required. It was stood down around 22 February, after the decaying altitude of Mir made it too dangerous to send a crew to it. If Mir's main computer had failed after Progress M1-5 had docked, then the flight plan would have been modified to use either the station's BUPO rendezvous system, or the Progress for control. Under this plan, the third deorbit burn would have been conducted 24 hours after the first two burns, with the station being spin- stabilised again between the second and third burns. Controllers also planned for a failure of Mir's power system, which would have resulted in the deorbit being delayed one day, with all guidance and control functions being handled by the Progress spacecraft. It was reported that Rosaviakosmos had taken out an insurance policy worth 200 million US dollars to cover damage caused by falling debris. The risk of debris from the station reaching land was estimated to be 3%. Countries located near the target zone monitored events surrounding the deorbit to determine whether precautions should be taken. In New Zealand the Satellite Reentry Committee was responsible for this, whilst Emergency Management Australia handled preparations in Australia. The head of the Defense Agency, Toshitsugu Saito, postponed a trip to the United States in case any debris fell on Japan, as the station was scheduled to pass over several Japanese islands on its final orbit. Residents of Okinawa were warned to stay indoors as the station passed overhead. Members of the South Pacific Forum requested assurance from Russia that they would not be hit by falling debris. Chan Sek Keong, the attorney general of Singapore, called for greater regulation of space debris.  Reaction  The reaction to Russia's announcement and subsequent execution of its plan to deorbit Mir was mixed. Several cosmonauts expressed regrets at the loss of the station, but support for the decision to end the programme; Vladimir Titov described the station as \\"a good ship\\", but said that he agreed with the decision to prioritise the International Space Station, while Vladimir Dezhurov said that he felt \\"sad about Mir but we have to look into the future.\\" In November 2000, shortly after plans to deorbit Mir were announced, members of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia passed a resolution in the Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, aimed at preventing it. On 8 February 2001, a protest against the deorbiting of the station was held in Moscow, and a petition was subsequently sent to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Gennady Zyuganov, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, described deorbiting the station to be \\"incorrect and harmful\\", and the act of a \\"helpless, weak-willed, inefficient and not very responsible\\" government. Iran attempted to buy the space station, with president Mohammad Khatami offering to fund it for two to three years in return for Russian assistance with cosmonaut training, however by this stage it was too late for such a transaction to be completed. The major Russian ORT TV station organised a national televised debate as to what should be done with the station. Former cosmonaut Georgi Grechko suggested that it should be kept in orbit long enough to salvage any useful equipment from it, for transfer to the International Space Station or other spacecraft, however Konstantin Feoktistov argued that it would cost more to retrieve the equipment than to replace it. Anatoly Artsebarsky argued that Mir should be kept because he believed that once it had been deorbited, the US would try to marginalise Russian involvement in the ISS. An online opinion poll showed 67% support worldwide for keeping it in orbit. Rosaviakosmos and RKK Energia responded to criticism of the decision in an open letter in mid February, which explained that the \\"actual condition of the onboard systems...[does] not make possible the safe and reliable operation of Mir\\", and that attempts to prolong its life \\"may lead to the loss of control of Mir..and, as a result, to catastrophic consequences not only for Russia but for the whole world.\\" The US Government welcomed the decision to deorbit Mir, as it freed up Russian resources for the International Space Station programme. The Space Frontier Foundation, however criticised the Russian government for yielding to what it claimed was pressure from the American government. SFF co-founder Rick Tumlinson claimed that \\"Mir was bulldozed to make way for [the] International Space Station\\". It had previously run a campaign called \\"Keep Mir Alive\\", which aimed to either secure the continued operation of Mir, or to have it placed into a higher orbit, allowing it to be stored until its operation became viable. In anticipation of the reentry of Mir, the owners of Taco Bell towed a target, measuring 12 by 12 metres (40 ft × 40 ft) out into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Australia. If the target was hit by a falling piece of Mir, every person in the continental United States would be entitled to a free Taco Bell taco. The company bought a sizeable insurance policy for this \\"gamble.\\" No piece of the station struck the target. A group of enthusiasts from the United States, led by Bob Citron, chartered an aircraft to fly over the Pacific and view the reentry.

A co-education system was in place until the 1990s but after the establishment of Excelsior College, the boys were shifted there and from then onwards only girls were admitted to this prestigious school. Conception & History Sangotians are busy in marching This convent school was established in 1965 by Miangul Abdul Haq Jahanzeb, popularly known as Wali sahib, the last ruler of Swat state, who not only donated land for the school but also provided generous financial aid for its construction and operations. The majestic building of the school was situated in a beautiful location on the left bank of the meandering Swat river, committed for spreading the light of education in the region. The Sister teachers of the school also dedicated their lives to education of young girls in neighboring villages and hamlets, without any thought of financial gains, teaching them the same courses as were being taught in the school in the morning. Announcement of closure The school for girls was closed on September 10, 2007, after a letter warned the Sisters running the school to close the \\"factory of Christians\\" or face suicide attacks. Jan Nisaran-e-Islam (sacrificers of Islam) sent the letter to Swat Press Club, and local newspapers published it on September 9. It reopened on 17 September after the Swat district coordination officer assured protection for the convent and the school. In June 2009 it was destroyed by raiders, according to a report from the Pakistani Bishops National Commission for Justice and Peace. The girls' boarding school, run by the Sisters was attacked with explosives that destroyed the building. No victims were reported, as the Sisters themselves had closed the school, as a precaution. The school had nearly 1,000 students mainly from poor Christian and Muslim families. According to the Church, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa has suffered attacks on nearly 150 schools in recent years, a sign of the rise in intolerance and the spread of Islamic fundamentalist groups that are trying to annihilate the work of Christian institutions in the area of education. Re-opening In April 2012 the school was reopened with three sisters and over 80 girls and an impressive new building was erected for its operations.Agenzia Fides 11/4/2012 In 2015, the school had 26 teachers and 10 other workers assisting four Pakistani nuns.

It is under the de facto control of Northern Cyprus.  Name origin  There are several traditions as to how the village got its name. One of them says that the name comes from the plant Myrtos or Myrtia – myrtle. On the western side of the village there is a whole area full of myrtle as well as other plants and bushes. This particular area is known as Mersinia. According to the writing of ancient writers myrtle was a plant dedicated to Goddess Aphrodite and God Apollo. There is a probability that in this area was a sanctuary dedicated to Apollo and even a small village with the name Myrtos. Myrtou area was inhabited prehistorically. The present Turkish name Çamlıbel means \\"area with pines\\", and the village is currently on the edge of the Akdeniz National park with its pine forests and woodland walks. Archaeological excavations in two areas of the village Stephania and Pighades brought to light valuable findings. Oxford Ashmolean Museum and a mission from Sydney Australia University carried out the excavations. The finding proved the religious political and trading connection of Cyprus with other islands of Greece and especially Crete. Location Myrtou village is located southwest of Kyrenia at a height of 270 metres above sea level. It is on the south side of the Pentadaktylos mountains and because of its position was considered to be the administrative centre of the area before 1974. From the village there is easy access to Nicosia through Asomatos and to Kyrenia through Panagra. It was also connected with Morphou through Diorios. Population The village for many years had a limited number of people because the administrator of the monastery’s property was the Metropolis of Kyrenia. When the Metropolis decided to start dividing the land to smaller plots, the village begun to grow bigger and bigger. People could buy a plot of land build their house and stay in their village rather than to move to the towns. In 1881 there were 69 buildings in the village and the population was 278, plus another 20 in the monastery.Census of Cyprus 1881, pr.

Other were working at Nicosia or Xeros. Of course you could find carpenters, mechanics, butchers, storekeepers and so on.

The population in 2011 was 872 a drop from 1,037 recorded in 2006. About a mile from Myrtou, to the south, lies Karpasia, a Maronite village, whose church is of ancient foundation but later much rebuilt.A description of the historic monuments of Cyprus, by George Jeffery, publ.Nicosia, 1918; Page 278 Monastery of St. Panteleimon Monastery of St. Panteleimon, about 100 yards east of the centre of Myrtou Myrtou village owes its development to its monastery of the St Panteleimon. The monastery played an important socio-economic role in the development of the village and the area in general. The story of the monastery's foundation has not been recorded, however, according to tradition, two monks from Lapithos, called Dorotheos and Dositheos, left their monastery of St Panteleimon at Mount Athos and returned to Cyprus to start a new monastery. With them they brought pieces of the holy bones of St Panteleimon. The two monks tried to find a quiet place in the Lapithos and Karavas area but with no result. They moved on to an area today called AERAS, which was full of wild vegetation. Tired and thirsty as they were they sat down and prayed to their Saint to help them. As they were praying they saw water coming from the marble stones next to them. They drank water and thanked St Panteleimon for his help. In the same place today you can find the Agiasma (holy water) of St Panteleimon. At first the two monks built a small church and two rooms for themselves. An icon of St Panteleimon was placed in the church together with his relics for believers to visit. The monastery is said to have been founded around 1600 A.D. The church has been greatly altered and enlarged and around 17th-18th centuries the original nave was demolished and rebuilt with a remarkable loggia of pointed arches and vaulting (south side). Between the nave and the loggia is the chapel of St Panteleimon of an ancient date. Gradually the monastery grew bigger, acquiring property, becoming one of the richest monasteries of the island, offering jobs to the people of the villages around the area. The monastery possessed many fields, used for cultivation, sheep, goats and cattle. Later the people working at the monastery formed a new village nearby, namely Myrtou. The feast of St Panteleimon is 27 July.

Born Mari Scott Henderson in Kensington, London, Bicknell began her career studying with Vera Trefilova in Paris, and later with Tamara Karsavina. She later danced with Sadler's Wells Ballet. In 1936, after her marriage to the architect Peter Bicknell, she began teaching ballet in Cambridge to young dancers aged from 10 to 20 years old. In 1950 Britten's Let's Make an Opera inspired her to create Let's Make a Ballet for her most talented students. The first performance took place at her home, Finella, in Cambridge in 1950, performed by a cast of dancers all under the age of 13. George (\\"Dadie\\") Rylands saw this production and suggested that she staged her ballets at the Cambridge Arts Theatre. In 1952 Mari Bicknell presented a programme of three ballets there: Dream Street, Elsie Piddock and The Happy Prince. Her fledgling company, Let's Make a Ballet, eventually became The Cambridge Ballet Workshop in 1968. After a season at the Lyric, Hammersmith (1961), from 1965 she based her productions for 20 years at the Theatre Royal, Bury St Edmunds, later adding a winter season in Cambridge (staged at the Mumford Theatre, CCAT). In 1977 the company took part in the Three Choirs Festival by appearing at the Swan Theatre, Worcester, presenting a Homage to Britten programme.Cambridge Ballet Workshop 1950-1985 Graphic Art (Cambridge) Ltd. Cambridge Ballet Workshop was a company rather than a dance school. Aged from five to 21, the 30 to 40 dancers were drawn from around 300 who attended her classes. Several original scores were commissioned specially for ballets created and performed by the company, including from the composers Joseph Horovitz (Les Rats, 1955; Through the Looking Glass, 1968), Peter Tranchell (Spring Legend, 1957), Geoffrey Wright (Love of Seven Dolls, 1960; The Canterville Ghost, 1979), Roger Vignoles – who also was a pianist for several productions (Six Characters in Search of a Choreographer, 1965), Hugh MacDonald (The Wedding, 1966) and Madeleine Dring (The Real Princess, 1971). Mari Bicknell gave her farewell season as director of the company in 1980. She was made MBE in 1986.

Pyle, J. Earle, and B. Greene in the western Pacific Ocean. This species comes from the genus Chromis which contains eighty species and counting, including C. abyssus, C. circumaurea, C. degruyi, and C. earina. Chromis brevirostris can be found in the Pacific Ocean, located as far north as the Marshall Islands to as far south as Fiji and Vanuatu, and spanning from Palau to Paluwat of the Caroline Islands. The species’ name, Chromis brevirostris, derives from Latin origin; brevis and rostrum mean “short” and “snout” respectively. It is generally abundant in its environment, living at depths of , tending to live in groups ranging in size from six to several dozen. Description The fish is around long, deep and are pale lavender-tinged grey in colour. Like other species of the genus Chromis, C. brevirostris has bright, colourful scales, as well as bright and colourful tail, dorsal, anal, and ventral fins. Adults of this species are pale lavender and grey in colour on the dorsal side, blue to white on the thorax, blue to grey on the ventral side. They also have golden scales and golden tails and fins. On the outer edges, the scales are golden yellow, but then gradually change to blue and gray as moved from outer to inner edges. Along with colour, the Chromis brevirostris can be distinguished from other Chromis species by its smooth and convex-shaped head, and the number of soft ray fins. Chromis brevirostris typically have 15–16 anal, 13–14 dorsal, 18–19 pectoral, and 2–3 spiniform caudal soft ray fins. Furthermore, they also have 14-16 lateral-line scales and 26–29 gill rakers. Their irises are golden in colour.  Location  Found in the mesophotic zone of the western Pacific Ocean typically at drop-offs, steep slopes and corals, Chromis brevirostris grow in communities of large abundance at depths of 90–120 metres. This depth is the lowest that they can thrive in. Although Chromis brevirostris was first observed at a depth of 100–103 metres deep around the Caroline Islands, dispersal has since resulted in a change in species distribution to depths as high as 60 metres and across the Pacific Ocean near Bali, Melanesia, and Micronesia in swarms of approximately one dozen individual Shortsnout Chromis.  Diet and foraging  The shortsnout chromis are deep water specialists. This means that because of high biodiversity in their habitat, this species is able to forage on a specific diet. The shortsnout chromis feed almost exclusively, if not entirely, on zooplankton that can be found floating in water columns. Etymology The name of this species was derived from the Latin words ' (meaning \\"short\\") and ' (meaning \\"beak\\" or \\"snout\\"). This is in reference to the very short snout of this species relative to other species in the genus Chromis.

He went through \\"recruit training\\" at Parris Island, South Carolina, then served at Marine Corps Base Quantico at Quantico, Virginia; Guantanamo Bay Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and Parris Island, attaining promotions to private first class, on 20 September 1940, to corporal on 1 September 1941, and to sergeant on 1 July 1942. When his unit, the 1st Marine Division, was sent to Guadalcanal in 1942, Sergeant Thompson went with it. There, his platoon took part in operations designed to drive the Imperial Japanese Armys 4th Infantry Regiment from a bridgehead at the mouth of the Matanikau River. On the evening of 8 October 1942, the Marines dug in for the night in the steaming jungle. Soon the Japanese launched a desperate counter-attack against the hastily prepared Marine positions, charging against the thinly held right flank of the American lines. Fierce fighting ensued. Small arms, automatic weapons, and hand grenades were the principal weapons. Desperate hand-to-hand combat took place in the night as the Japanese sought to escape envelopment.

He was a member of the Hungarian radical nationalist Jobbik political party between 2003 and 2012, which has been accused of anti-Semitism. In 2012, Szegedi gained international attention after acknowledging that he had Jewish roots. He was also accused of previous bribery to try to keep that revelation a secret, and subsequently resigned from all Jobbik political posts. Szegedi has since become a religious Jew. Personal life Szegedi was born in Miskolc. His father, Miklós Szegedi, a Christian ethnic Magyar, is a famous wood carving sculptor, and his mother, Katalin Molnár (née Meisels), was a software engineer born to Jewish parents. He has a brother, Márton Szegedi, who was Jobbik's mayoral candidate in Miskolc, but left the party in 2012. He graduated from Károli Gáspár University of the Reformed Church in Hungary. Between 1999 and 2010 he organized trips to Transylvania, a historic region belonging to Hungary until 1920. In 2002 he published a book on old Hungarian personal names. Between 2006 and 2012 he also had a clothing line called Turul, named after the mythical bird of Hungarian legends. Prior to the revelations of Szegedi's Jewish ancestry, Szegedi was notorious for his antisemitism. In June 2012, Szegedi reported that he had learned his maternal grandparents were Jewish: his grandmother a survivor of Auschwitz concentration camp and his grandfather a veteran of forced labour camps. Jewish custom is matrilineal, meaning, under religious law, Szegedi is Jewish. Szegedi was raised Hungarian Reformed and did not initially practice the Jewish religion. Szegedi said he had defined himself as someone with \\"ancestry of Jewish origin — because I declare myself 100 percent Hungarian.\\" He turned to Rabbi Slomó Köves, of the Lubavitch movement, for help. He adopted the name Dovid, wore a kippah, learnt Hebrew, visited Israel, and had himself circumcised.The truth about neo-Nazis, by the Jew who was one. Peter Popham. The Independent. Thursday 12 June 2014. https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/the-truth-about-neonazis-by-the- jew-who-was-one-9532478.html accessed 13 June 2014 Szegedi now lives as a practicing Jew, observing the Sabbath and attending synagogue.Ofer Aderet, 'Former anti-Semitic Hungarian leader now keeps Shabbat,' at Haaretz, Oct. 21, 2013. Szegedi is married with two sons; his wife supports his new identity and is in the process of converting to Judaism. In August 2012 he apologized to Rabbi Köves for his anti-semitic remarks, and in 2013 he traveled to Israel where he and his wife visited the Western Wall and the Yad Vashem museum. Recently he has been interested in arts; his paintings are influenced by his newly found religion. The 2016 biographical documentary film Keep Quiet documents his return to Judaism. Political career He became a member of Jobbik, the country's biggest far-right political force early in the party's history. In 2006 he became vice-president of the party. In 2007, he was a founding member of the Hungarian Guard, which was banned in 2009, at which time Szegedi joined the Jobbik party. Between 2005 and 2009 he was the leader of the party in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén county. From 2009 to 2014 he served in the European Parliament in Brussels. His political views have often been described as consisting of anti-EU, anti-Roma, and anti-Semitic characteristics by different press outlets. He outlined them in a book, I Believe in Hungary’s Resurrection. As an active Member of the European Parliament he openly advocated leaving the European Union and establishing a \\"new Turanian alliance\\" with Central Asian states as a supporter of Hungarian Turanism. Szegedi paid from the European Parliament budget three men – Előd Novák, Balázs Molnár and Roland Kürk – who according to Tamás Polgár, better known as Tomcat, were members of the editorial board of the kuruc.info, a racist website associated with Jobbik. All three received their salaries as \\"local assistants\\" to the member of parliament. Szegedi has also propagated the use of the Old Hungarian script. On 28 July 2012, Szegedi released a statement to the press, which was reproduced on the party's website that he had with immediate effect resigned from all the various positions still held in Jobbik. Szegedi expressed his wish to remain a Member of the European Parliament. The Jobbik statement confirmed that the news of his mother's Jewish ancestry \\"did not pose any threat to his positions in the party.\\" The statement went on to say that \\"Last week, in July, media reported that the MEP [Szegedi] had known about his origin for longer than he previously stated. Allegedly, in 2010, the MEP tried to stop news published about his origin by offering money [bribe], which the MEP categorically denies. This prompted Jobbik vice-president Elod Novak to call for Szegedi's full resignation, describing the MEP's actions as a 'spiral of lies'.\\" Jobbik says its issue is the suspected bribery, not his Jewish roots. Following his profession of Judaism, Szegedi obtained thousands of copies of his own book, and burned them. He now feels that Jobbik offers only the euphoria of hatred to people who are in despair.

In most jurisdictions, the law of intestacy requires that the property of a person who died without leaving a will must first go to that person's immediate family, such as a spouse, descendants, ascendants, or persons descended from the same parents or grandparents. Under the common law, if no such persons exist, the property passes to the nearest living person who can demonstrate some degree of kinship with the deceased, no matter how distant the relation. Some jurisdictions have a laughing heir statute, which cuts off the right of inheritance when the remaining relatives become too remote. In such jurisdictions, if no relative falls within the limitation set by the statute, then the property escheats to the state. In the United States, §2-103 of the Uniform Probate Code, which has been adopted by a number of states, sets the outer limits of the right to inheritance with grandparents, aunts and uncles, and first cousins. Under the code, heirs that are farther removed from the deceased are left with no claim to the estate at all. By contrast, some US states (such as Virginia) have extended the principle to cover the family of a predeceased spouse. In those states, if the decedent had been married, and their spouse had died before the decedent, and if the decedent had no blood relatives at all, then the decedent's property would pass to any living relatives of the spouse, no matter how remote.

(Why am I so miserable?) is the first album released by the German rock band Ton Steine Scherben. It includes—among other pieces—the song Macht kaputt, was euch kaputt macht (\\"Destroy what is destroying you\\"), which expressed the built-up anger and radicalization of the youth of the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Recording  In 1971, after the release of the first single \\"Macht kaputt, was euch kaputt macht\\", the band went to Klaus Freudigmann's studio in Berlin to record their first album. The setup for the recordings was not ideal, and the sound quality suffered as a result. This is not surprising, as all the band's output was self-produced. As such, the recording sessions were also not entirely satisfactory. In June, Agit 883 and Rote Hilfe—anarchist and leftist political organisations respectively—organised an \\"informational event\\" about the empty buildings on the Mariannenplatz in Kreuzberg. Ton Steine Scherben were invited to play, and the teach-in turned into a party which led to one of the first spontaneous squatting actions in Berlin. The recordings of the concert were used for the album's first side; the b-side consists of highlights of the studio recordings. The album's sound has been described as raw and energetic, but the sound quality is somewhat lacking.

Retrieved 2013-08-10. was an Austrian American musicologist, educator, and biographer of composers. He was educated in Vienna but at the beginning of the Nazi years he emigrated to England and ultimately the United States, where he had a lengthy and distinguished career at several universities. He was a noted authority on Brahms, Haydn, and the Bach family, and a prolific author. Life Geiringer was born in Vienna, the son of Louis and Martha (nee Wertheimer) Geiringer.http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/tomita/bachbib/review/bb-review_Freeman- Geiringer.html Published online on 17 May 2003Freeman et al. (1989) He studied music history at the University of Vienna under Guido Adler and Curt Sachs, and studied composition under Hans Gál. He also studied at the University of Berlin under Curt Sachs. He received his Ph.D. in musicology from the University of Vienna in 1923. The topic of his doctoral thesis was the musical instruments appearing in Renaissance painting. Following his degree he worked as an editor for Adler's journal Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Österreich; he remained on the editorial board of this publication for the rest of his life. In 1930 he won a top position in the musicological field, as the curator of the archives at the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna, a position previously held by his mentor Eusebius Mandyczewski and other distinguished scholars. The job gave Geiringer access to much valuable primary source material on Western music, which he used extensively in his scholarship. An unusual responsibility Geiringer bore at the Gesellschaft archives was the curatorship of Joseph Haydn's skull, which had been stolen from his grave in 1809. In the first English edition of his Haydn biography (1946), Geiringer reminisced about bringing forth the skull to show to visitors; see Haydn's head. In 1938, Austria was incorporated into Nazi Germany in the Anschluss. With the Nazi occupation, the Gesellschaft was closed.Anonymous (1989) Geiringer, although he had been baptized a Roman Catholic, was the child of Jewish parents; hence he and his family were in grave danger, and they fled the country. He first went to London, where he taught at the Royal College of Music and served as a broadcaster for the BBC. He also worked extensively as an editor for the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians; according to his later colleagues he was \\"in all but name a co-editor\\". In 1940, Geiringer moved to America, becoming an American citizen in 1945. (bio on back cover) He taught first for a year as a visiting professor at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y. The following year he took up a professorial appointment at Boston University, where he directed the graduate program and remained for 21 years. Among his students was H. C. Robbins Landon. His final academic appointment began in 1962, when he moved to the University of California at Santa Barbara, in order to establish the graduate program in musicology. Throughout this time, he continued to publish extensively. In 1973 he became an emeritus professor, but continued to be very active: his colleagues said of him, \\"His 'retirement' ... proved to be more of a technicality than a reality—his teaching and research continued unabatedly and were interrupted only by death itself.\\" He died in Santa Barbara at the age of 89 of complications from injuries sustained in a fall. Geiringer was twice married. His first wife, and longtime coauthor, was Irene Geiringer (1899–1983).Cole (2003, 436)The Opera Quarterly He was later married to Bernice Geiringer (née Abrams, 1918–2001), a concert pianist and student of Arnold Schoenberg.Cole (2003, 436); website of Arnold Schoenberg Center He had two sons, Martin and George. Scholarship Geiringer served twice as president of the American Musicological Society. In 1959 he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His last university, UC Santa Barbara, established a lecture program in his name in 1994 and named a concert hall in his honor.Geiringer talks bring top music scholars to UCSB As Crutchfield notes, \\"It was Mr. Geiringer's habit to take on the largest topics\\". His work included extensive biographies of Brahms, Haydn, and of the Bach family, which went through multiple editions. He also wrote many scholarly articles. He was responsible for the rediscovery of minor works by Brahms and by Hugo Wolf that had gone missing. Following his death, his colleagues assessed his research as follows: > [His] prolific scholarly output, when viewed in its totality, is remarkable > for its great scope and depth. His writings and editions span practically > the complete range of music history and all carry the mark of a discipline > he must have possessed as a student and an excellence we know he had as a > teacher. His most significant achievements, if they can at all be > pinpointed, lay in the areas of Bach and Haydn research, in his studies of > these two masters written, revised and enlarged over a period of a > halfcentury in collaboration with his brilliant first wife, Irene, and in > his lifelong effort to see that a collected edition of Haydn's works be > realized for the first time in our century.

Shalala = In this case, the plaintiff argued both for mandatory labeling on the basis of consumer demand, and that GMO foods should undergo the same testing requirements as food additives because they are \\"materially changed\\" and have potentially unidentified health risks. The plaintiff also alleged that the FDA did not follow the Administrative Procedures Act in formulating and disseminating its policy on GMO's. The federal district court rejected all of those arguments and found that the FDA's determination that GMO's are Generally Recognized as Safe was neither arbitrary nor capricious. The court gave deference to the FDA's process on all issues, leaving future plaintiffs little legal recourse to challenge the FDA's policy on GMO's.(pp. 755–756) Alliance for Bio- Integrity v Shalala, 116 F.Supp.2d 166 (D.D.C. 2000). = Diamond v.

The fact that the organism sought to be patented is alive is no bar to patentability. Revenue *Seed sales *Income from GMO crops **Genetically modified soybeans are a big part of the US agricultural economy **Genetically modified maize (there are also issues with cross-pollination) Opposition Numerous organizations based in the U.S. oppose or have concerns about genetic engineering for various reasons. Groups such as the Center for Food Safety, the nonprofit science advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists, Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund have expressed concerns about the FDA's lack of a requirement for additional testing for GMO's, lack of required labeling and the presumption that GMO's are \\"Generally Recognized as Safe\\" (GRAS). Some of these groups have questioned whether the FDA is too close to companies that seek approval for their products.Emily Marden, Risk and Regulation: U.S. Regulatory Policy on Genetically Modified Food and Agriculture 44 B.C.L. Rev. 733 (2003). Quote: \\"By the late 1990s, public awareness of GM foods reached a critical level and a number of public interest groups emerged to focus on the issue. One of the early groups to focus on the issue was Mothers for Natural Law (\\"MFNL\\"), an Iowa-based organization that aimed to ban GM foods from the market....The Union of Concerned Scientists (\\"UCS\\"), an alliance of 50,000 citizens and scientists, has been another prominent voice on the issue.... As the pace of GM products entering the market increased in the 1990s, UCS became a vocal critic of what it saw as the agency’s collusion with industry and failure to fully take account of allergenicity and other safety issues.\\" =Health concerns= Although there have been no recorded instances of harm to human health due to the consumption of genetically engineered foods, there is concern over their impact on health. One of the largest food recalls in US history, was the Taco Bell GMO recall, where a Bt corn plant not approved for human consumption due its risk as an allergen, had contaminated food products like the tacos at Taco Bell, and a huge percentage of US's seed supply. No health problems were linked to Starlink corn,CDC, National Center for Environmental Health. Investigation of Human Health Effects Associated with Potential Exposure to Genetically Modified Corn: A Report to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Atlanta,GA:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2001. and subsequent evaluations of the Bt trait determined that there is medium risk to human health. Regulation The USA is the largest commercial grower of genetically modified crops in the world. United States regulatory policy is governed by the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology.United States Regulatory Agencies Unified Biotechnology Website The United States is not a signatory to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. For a genetically modified organism to be approved for release it is assessed by the USDA, the FDA and the EPA. USDA evaluates the plant's potential to become weeds, the FDA reviews plants that could enter or alter the food supply and the EPA regulates the genetically modified plants with pesticide properties. Most developed genetically modified plants are reviewed by at least two of the agencies, with many subject to all three. Final approval can still be denied by individual counties within each state. In 2004, Mendocino County, California became the first and only county to impose a ban on the \\"Propagation, Cultivation, Raising, and Growing of Genetically Modified Organisms\\", the measure passing with a 57% majority. (See Mendocino County GMO Ban) =U.S. Department of Agriculture= The Biotechnology Regulatory Services program of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) agency within the USDA is concerned with protecting agriculture and the environment from potential pests under the Plant Protection Act of 2000 (part of the Agriculture Risk Protection Act) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Each transgenic event is regulated separately as the transgene insertion locus varies even when using identical constructs and host genotypes. This could result in different expression patterns or could affect the function of other endogenous genes within the host. The USDA is responsible for approving field trials of GM plants under either the notification or permit procedures. The notification procedure is a streamlined process for the simplest or most familiar genetically engineered plants that meet six criteria (is not a noxious weed, the function of the genetic material is known and characterized, stable integration, no significant risk of creating new viruses and that no animal or human pathogen sequences are present). Most field trials are approved under the notification procedure. The permit procedure is much more elaborate and is required for all genetically engineered organisms that do not meet the notification requirements or any plant-made pharmaceuticals or plant-made industrial products. APHIS officials are responsible for inspecting the field trials. At least one inspection is carried out for each state listed on a permit, while inspection of field trials authorized by notification is conducted based on the relative risk of each trial. For field trials of organisms that contain pharmaceutical or industrial compounds, inspections are carried out more frequently (five times during establishment and twice yearly after that). If the inspectors are satisfied that there are no regulatory concerns they issue a Notice of Compliance. If the regulations are not being adhered to the inspectors will issue a Notice of Non-Compliance requesting that the deviations be fixed, or for more serious breaches a warning letter requiring a written response and corrective action to be taken within a given time frame. Formal investigations are carried out on developers who may not be adhering to regulations, permit conditions, or other requirements, which can result in civil penalties or criminal charges. In 1993, the USDA proposal to remove regulatory oversight from GM organisms deemed environmentally benign was approved and four GM plants (Flavr Savr tomato, virus-resistant squash, bromoxynil-tolerant cotton and glyphosate-tolerant soybean) obtained non- regulatory status that year. Non-regulated status means that permits and notifications are no longer required for introductions of this organism. Applicants can petition APHIS for non-regulated status if the GM organism poses no more of a plant pest risk than an equivalent non-GM organism. APHIS will prepare at least two documents (an Environmental Assessment and a determination of non-regulatory status) under the NEPA while considering the application. Four federal district court suits have been brought against APHIS challenging their regulation of GM plants. Two involved field trials (herbicide-tolerant turfgrass in Oregon; pharmaceutical-producing corn and sugar in Hawaii) and the other two were the deregulation of GM alfalfa and GM Sugar Beet. APHIS initially lost all four cases, with the judges ruling they failed to diligently follow the NEPA guidelines. However, the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide ban on GM alfalfaMonsanto et al v Geertson Seed Farms et al, Supreme Court of the United States, Decision no 09-475, June 21, 2010, Retrieved November 13, 2011 and an appeal court allowed the partial deregulation of GM sugar beet crops.United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Retrieved November 5, 2012 =Food and Drug Administration= The FDA is responsible for the safety and security of human and animal food and drugs, including any that are genetically modified. The FDA was responsible for approving the first commercialized GMO, Genetech's genetically modified human insulin (Humulin) in 1982 and the first commercialized GM whole food, Calgene's Flavr Savr tomato in 1994. When evaluating new GM foods or feed the FDA looks for the presence of any new or altered allergens and toxicants and examines changes in the levels of nutritional and anti-nutritional substances. Food and feed that is identical or nearly identical in composition to current products is deemed to be substantially equivalent and is not required to undergo review by the FDA. The FDA has been criticized for using substantial equivalence, with a major accusation being that FDA review is essentially voluntary as almost all GM products are substantially equivalent. However, all GM food and feed currently on the US market (as of 2008) have undergone a FDA consultation, where the developer submits the compositional data and FDA scientist compare it to regular food and feed. The FDA consultation focuses on whether the new food or feed contains any new allergens or toxic substances and whether the nutritional components of the food or feed have increased or decreased. The developer submits documentation to the FDA describing the food or feed and a FDA assigned caseworker can then request additional information on expected dietary exposure, in particular if any risk groups (children, elderly etc.) might be exposed. As of 2007, the FDA has not identified any genetically modified foods with unexpected changes in the nutrient composition or levels of allergens or toxic substances. However, allergic proteins have been detected when some GM products have undergone testing. Pioneer Hi-Bred inserted a gene from the Brazil nut into transgenic soybean resulting in soy with an enhanced nutritional profile. The inserted gene did not translate into a known allergen at the time, but when tested with serum from people who are allergic to Brazil nut the allergenic nature of the protein was discovered. The development of the transgenic soybean expressing a Brazil nut allergen was stopped after these tests. The FDA consultation process is relatively (when compared to the other agencies regulating GM) informal and they do not approve new GM products. Instead they issue a memo stating whether the new food is the same as or different from the non-modified variety. The Center for Veterinary Medicine of the FDA regulates genetically modified animals in consultation with Centers at the FDA responsible for regulating pharmaceuticals or other medical products derived from biopharm animals. The FDA also has extra guidelines that apply to genetically modified animals that will be used in the manufacturing and testing of therapeutic products and xenotransplantation. The FDA guidance documents do not establish legally binding laws and are viewed as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. Any relevant federal, State, or local laws and regulations must also be adhered to. =Environmental Protection Agency= The EPA regulates substances with pesticide characteristics, looking at potential threats to human health or the environment. They claim not to regulate the genetically modified plants, but the pesticides produced by the plants or properties that change the usage of applied pesticides . This includes; plants engineered to produce resistance to herbicides (e.g. Roundup Ready), plants that produce their own pesticides (e.g. BT) and virus resistant plants. Authority to regulate the pesticide properties in genetically modified organisms was granted in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). The EPA published regulations in 1994 and begun acting on them in 1995. In 1994 they proposed the exemption of three categories of genetically modified plants under their regulation. These were plants where the genetic material originated in sexually compatible plants (cisgenic), plants that used physical barriers to prevent the target pest from attaching itself, and plants expressing viral coat proteins to protect against virus infection. In 2001, rules regarding exemption of cisgenic plants had been finalised. The other two proposed exemptions were still under review in 2010. The EPA evaluated each submission on a case-by-case basis. The EPA assesses data concerning the characterisation of the end-product of the engineered organism (presently all plants evaluated produce proteins), as well as data on mammalian toxicity, effects on non-target organisms and environmental metabolism. For Bt products the producer must also supply an insect resistance management program. For herbicide resistant plants the EPA co-ordinates with the USDA and FDA, but does not regulate the plant itself. Instead it regulates the herbicide and its use on the new cultivar. The EPA examines the construct used to transform the plant and the biology of recipient plant. The sequence of the resulting protein must be described, expression pattern and intencity verified and any modifications to the protein reported. The EPA considers the potential allergenicity of the product, issues surrounding gene flow into wild species, possible effects on non-target organisms, likelihood of it persisting in the environment and the potential for insect resistance developing when assessing submissions.

Life Josephine Sparre was born to Swedish noble colonel chamberlain Johan Alexander Artemis Sparre and the Norwegian Sofia Adelaide Rosalie Ancker. She was the sibling of politician Nils Gustaf Alexander Sparre and niece to minister Gustaf Adolf Vive Sparre. Sparre was hovfröken (maid of honor) to the Crown Princess of Sweden, Louise of the Netherlands, in 1851–59, kammarfröken (senior maid of honor) in 1859-62, and finally statsfru (Lady of the Bedchamber) in 1864-71. Sparre was described as so dominant that the Crown Princess and her maid of honor was said to have changed places with each other and Louise being the lady-in-waiting to Josephine Sparre rather than the other way around. Sparre was the mistress of Crown Prince Charles between 1852 and 1860. Prior to their relationship, Charles had a relationship with her relative Sigrid Sparre and then to the actress-courtesan Laura Bergnéhr. Fritz von Dardel described Sparre: :\\"The lady in question is a great favorite of the Crown Prince as well as with the Crown Princess, and she governs them both entirely in everything about their daily life. Gifted with an unusual talent to please and make herself indispensable, she has managed to capture the Crown Prince to a strange degree.\\" Robert Braun (1950).

ISBN (Swedish) page 99 All the sympathies were with Louisa, who in turn acted very tolerant toward Josephine and Charles and acted as if she had not noticed it. Josephine became unpopular within the court due to her way of demonstrating her relationship with Charles, following him around openly at court \\"like a patch\\", and the general lack of discretion around the ongoing relationship. Charles XV did, however, have several more temporary affairs in parallel, such as his reputed affair with Elise Hwasser in circa 1857. Sparre was engaged several times, once with foreign minister Oscar Björnstjerna, but broke the engagement in 1856 because she did not wish to leave the crown prince and the court. In about 1860, however, Charles XV entered in to his relationship with Hanna Styrell. In 1862, Sparre married Norwegian cabinet chamberlain Bredo Stang with the royal couple present. She returned to court in 1864, and served as lady in waiting to queen Louise until the queen's death in 1871. She died in 1892.  References  *Svenskt biografiskt lexikon * Lars Elgklou (1978).

Broadcasting radio shows on the internet is usually preferred to webcasting since it is not transmitted broadly through wireless means. It mainly works by Internet radio transmissions. (Internet radio services are usually accessible from anywhere in the world—for example, one could listen to an Australian station from Europe or America. Some major networks like Clear Channel in the US and Chrysalis in the UK restrict listening to in country because of music licensing and advertising concerns.) History In 1993, Carl Malamud launched Internet talk radio which was the \\"first computer-radio talk show, each week interviewing a computer expert.\\" This was Internet radio only insofar as it was conceptually a radio show on the Internet. As late as 1995, Internet talk radio was not available via multicast streaming; it was distributed \\"as audio files that computer users fetch one by one.\\" However Malamud was among the foremost proponents of multicasting technology. In late 1994, his Internet Multicasting Service was set to launch RTFM, a multicast Internet radio news station. In January 1995, RTFM's news programming was expanded to include \\"live audio feeds from the House and Senate floors.\\" A 1995 UK experiment in Internet talk radio was set up by the Open University's Knowledge Media Institute in collaboration with the BBC's Open University Production Unit. Called \\"KMi Maven Of The Month\\" (maven = expert or connoisseur), the events featured interviews with experts in Human Computer Interaction, New Media and Artificial Intelligence, and deployed a combination of streaming audio, web-chat, phone-ins and live video. The first event, an interview with Henry Lieberman of the MIT Media Lab, took place on 18 October 1995. That event used a mixture of least-common- denominator technology available at that time: 14.4kbit/s dialup modems, Netscape, RealAudio, CU-SeeMe, email, web forms and chat windows for questioners, and landline telephony to 'pull in' questioners after they had provided their phone numbers.

It represented male mule spinners in the cotton industry. History =Background= The first attempts to form a trade union for cotton spinners occurred in the late 18th century, and there were numerous attempts to establish local and national unions throughout the 19th century. There had been the Manchester Spinners Union and the Grand General Union of Operative Spinners of the United Kingdom formed in 1828, by John Doherty. It only lasted two years.. In 1845 several local associations in the North West and Yorkshire combined to form the Association of Operative Cotton Spinners, Twiners, and Self Acting Minders of the United Kingdom. This grew to 49 local affiliates, was able to appoint a full-time secretary, Thomas Brindle, and was central to the National Association of United Trades for the Protection of Industry. However, a downturn in the industry in 1849 led most of its affiliates to leave or dissolve entirely. It appears to have ceased to function after the Bolton union left in 1850, but maintained some nominal existence and revived from 1853 under Thomas Mawdsley. The association survived with around 4,000 members until, in 1870, it called a conference to found a new organisation, seeking to include local unions such as Oldham and Bolton which did not hold membership. =Growth= The Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners, Self-Actor Minders, Twiners and Rovers of Lancashire and Adjoining Counties was formed in 1870. The new union grew rapidly and by the late 1880s approximately 90 percent of cotton spinners were members. The union had 18,000 members at the turn of the century. By 1910 almost 100% of male mule spinners were members and its membership numbered 22000. The Amalgamation used the high level of union membership amongst mule spinners to restrict the supply of labour to employers, ensuring that their members were able to receive wages and working conditions significantly better than most British industrial employees. This elevated position within the industrial working class led to mule spinners being known as the Barefoot Aristocrats. Less skilled workers in the cotton industry were generally not allowed to join the Amalgamation, instead forming their own unions. Female ring spinners were represented by the expansionist Amalgamated Association of Card and Blowing and Ring Room Operatives while the powerloom weavers were represented by the Amalgamated Weavers Association which had 114,000 members. The Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners had a federal structure with strong central leadership where control was in the hands of a small group of paid officials. While many of its affiliates were small unions, based in a single town, others were organised in five provinces, each of which covered a wide area and had numerous branches: the Blackburn Province of the Operative Cotton Spinners' Association, Bolton and District Operative Cotton Spinners' Provincial Association, Oldham Operative Cotton Spinners' Provincial Association, Preston Provincial Operative Cotton Spinners' Association, and Yorkshire Province of Operative Cotton Spinners. Union dues were high, so the fighting fund was large and the officials were skilled in defending the complex wage structures. =Decline= From the 1950s mule spinning was gradually replaced in the British cotton industry with ring spinning as improvements in technology allowed it to process finer grades of cotton. The size of the British textile industry also declined dramatically during this period due to a decline in demand and competition from foreign industry. This process was accelerated dramatically by the Cotton Industry Act 1959 which encouraged Lancashire cotton producers to rationalise by replacing or retiring older machines, primarily spinning mules. This decline in available employment undermined the membership base of the Amalgamation and by December 1965 membership had fallen to 3,262. After considering amalgamation into the new Amalgamated Textile Workers' Union the decision was made to dissolve the union in 1970. The Amalgamation continued to function for several years, disbursing funds to former members and winding up the union's affairs, before it was finally deregistered in 1977.

She studied at the Imperial Ballet School in St Petersburg with Ekaterina Vazem and graduated in 1894. She later studied with Evgenia Sokolova, Nikolai Legat, Catarina Beretta and Enrico Cecchetti. She joined the ballet company at the Maryinsky Theatre in 1894 and was promoted to soloist in 1901. She created roles in Lev Ivanov's Acis and Galatea (1896), N. and S. Legat's The Fairy Doll (1903), N. Legat's The Blood-Red Flower (1907), and Mikhail Fokine's The Night of Terpsichore (1907). In 1906 she was promoted to prima ballerina, known for her 32 fouettés. She triumphed as Princess Aurora in Sleeping Beauty, but resigned in 1910, partly due to her dislike of Fokine's innovations, but above all due to a rivalry with the Maryinsky's reigning ballerina, Mathilde Kschessinska. In 1915 she made her debut as an actress at the Mikhailovsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. In 1917 she left Russia and opened a ballet school in Paris: among her pupils were Marina Svetlova, Mary Skeaping, Nina Vyroubova and Mari Bicknell. Diaghilev invited her to dance Aurora in his 1921 London production of The Sleeping Princess. In 1924, almost 50 years old, she danced Odette- Odile for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in Monte Carlo, still amazing audiences with her fouetté turns. She gave her final performance at His Majesty's Theatre in London in 1926. She had three husbands, the third of whom was the dance critic Valerian Svetlov.

But in a case of hard (emergency-)braking, the car will start to rotate over the wheelpath offering highest grip. Split friction may cause jack-knifing of articulated trucks, while trucks with towed trailers may experience trailer swing phenomena. Split friction may be caused by an improper road spot repair that results in high variance of texture and colour (thin ice on newly paved black spots thaws faster than ice on old greyish asphalt) across the road section. To some extent, the risk for split friction can be measured with a road profilograph, scanning the pavement texture in both the left and right wheel paths. A full analysis of the split friction issue requires a friction device that measures both the left and right wheel track at the same time. The ViaFriction skid device can be used for such a purpose.

Marwān (), better known as Abū al-Fidāʾ (, latinized Abulfeda; November 1273October 27, 1331), was a Mamluk era Syrian geographer, historian, Ayyubid prince and local governor of Hama.[ Encyclopedia of the History of Science, Technology and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures, (edited by) Helaine Selin, pp. 7-8, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Netherlands, 1997] Identifiants et Référentiels Sudoc Pour L'Enseignement Supérieur et la Recherche - Abū al-Fidā (1273-1331) The crater Abulfeda on the Moon, is named after him. He is Kurdish origin. Life Abu'l-Fida was born in Damascus,Chambers Biographical Dictionary, , page 5 where his father Malik ul-Afdal, brother of Emir Al- Mansur Muhammad II of Hama, had fled from the Mongols. Abu'l-Fida was thus a grandson of Al-Muzaffar II Mahmud, who was himself the grandson of Al-Muzaffar Umar, a nephew of Saladin and grandson of Ayyub (and as such originally of Kurdish extraction). In his boyhood he devoted himself to the study of the Qur'an and the sciences, but from his twelfth year onward, he was almost constantly engaged in military expeditions, chiefly against the crusaders. In 1285 he was present at the assault of a stronghold of the Knights of St. John, and took part in the sieges of Tripoli, Acre and Qal'at ar-Rum. In 1298 he entered the service of the Mamluk Sultan Malik al-Nasir and after twelve years was invested by him with the governorship of Hama. In 1312 he became prince with the title Malik us-Salhn, and in 1320 received the hereditary rank of sultan with the title Malik ul-Mu'ayyad. For more than twenty years all together he reigned in tranquillity and splendour, devoting himself to the duties of government and to the composition of the works to which he is chiefly indebted for his fame. He was a munificent patron of men of letters, who came in large numbers to his court. He died in 1331. Works =Geography= Taqwim al-Buldan (A Sketch of the Countries) is, like much of the history, founded on the works of his predecessors, including the works of Ptolemy and Muhammad al-Idrisi. A long introduction on various geographical matters is followed by twenty-eight sections dealing in tabular form with the chief towns of the world. After each name are given the longitude, latitude, climate, spelling, and then observations generally taken from earlier authors. Parts of the work were published and translated as early as 1650 in Europe. In his works Abu'l-Fida correctly mentions the latitude and longitude of the city of Quanzhou in China. The book also contains the first known explanation of the circumnavigator's paradox. Abu'l-Fida wrote that a person who completed a westward circumnavigation of the world would count one fewer day than a stationary observer, since he was traveling in the same direction as the apparent motion of the sun in the sky. A person traveling eastward would count one more day than a stationary observer. This phenomenon was confirmed two centuries later, when the Magellan–Elcano expedition (1519–1522) completed the first circumnavigation. After sailing westward around the world from Spain, the expedition called at Cape Verde for supplies on Wednesday, 9 July 1522 (ship's time). However, the locals told them that it was actually Thursday, 10 July 1522. =History= His Concise History of Humanity ( Tarikh al-Mukhtasar fi Akhbar al-Bashar, also An Abridgment of the History at the Human Race , or History of Abu al-Fida تاريخ أبى الفداء) was written between 1315 and 1329 as a continuation of The Complete History by Ali ibn al-Athir (c. 1231).

The behavior of this diving beetle has been compared to a scuba diver, since it carries with it a bubble of air as it dives down into the water. The beetle has recently become notable when it was discovered that its aquatic larval stage is the first ever recorded use of bifocal technology in the animal world. The beetle uses in its principal eyes two retinas and two distinct focal planes that are substantially separated, in the manner of bifocals to switch their vision from up-close to distance, for easy and efficient capture of their prey. Because of their bright colors, they are often displayed in zoos, sometimes together with Abedus herberti (also found together in the wild) and other aquatic beetles. Physical description An enclosure for sunburst diving beetles The adult beetle has a length of , with females slightly larger than males. The sunburst diving beetle has a black and streamlined carapace covered with bright yellow or golden spots. The male has a suction disk on each foreleg. Diet Sunburst diving beetles are predators and scavengers of small animals, especially invertebrates such as other aquatic insects and snails, but also small vertebrates such as young fish and tadpoles. If available, they prefer to feed on small, already dead soft-bodied animals. These beetles are useful because they eat mosquito larvae and pupae. They have also been observed swarming a prey item and feeding en masse. In captivity, these beetles will feed on flake fish food and live crickets. Behavior  = Swimming = Sunburst diving beetles live in water and swim well. The diving beetle swims by thrusting its hind legs simultaneously, and can remain underwater for extended periods of time by storing an air bubble beneath its wings. They inhabit various slow-moving freshwater habitats, especially shallow, temporary or intermittent pools and creeks (arroyos) with little or no aquatic vegetation. When their water source dries up they will fly to a new one. = Protection = The sunburst diving beetle's distinctive yellow spots also serve as a warning sign to predators that the insect can release a foul tasting chemical. The milky appearing chemical is ejected from specialized glands found behind the insect's head, and has been found to be made primarily out of the steroid hormones cybisterone and mirasorvone. It has been further hypothesized that mirasorvone functions as a fish deterrent.  Distribution  Sunburst diving beetles are found in extreme Southern California (mainly Peninsular Ranges), southern Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas (where first recorded in 1996), and Mexico.  Development  = Early development = Eggs that are laid by the mother are initially 3.5 to 4 mm in length and lack pigmentation or any special features – causing them to be white and opaque. As the embryo develops, it begins to appear more translucent. Around a third of the way into development, the eyes become externally visible, however, the head region will only become discernible nearly halfway into development. The larvae of the organism have legs, a soft body, antennae, and are aquatic - preying primarily on mosquito larvae and other aquatic animals. The beetles pupate on land, and can develop from an egg to an adult in 28 days.  Visual system  = Multiple retinas = Scientists have discovered the larval visual system of Thermonectus marmoratus have incredibly complex eyes that resemble a camera's bifocal capabilities. The beetle has a total of 12 eyes (six eyes on either side of its head), but a total of twenty eight retinas. Early in the organism's development, there are many conserved functions and cell lineages between the diving beetle and other insect species such as the fly (Drosophila). However, there are also some stark differences, including larger numbers of cells which will form the two retinas per eye, as well as a large scale reorganization of the eye tissues. This is especially observed with the migration of photoreceptors in later stages of development. The eyes are also not attached to any muscles, which restricts them from moving. Instead, the beetle scans its visual field by moving its head from side to side. The larvae eyes are mapped to six distinct neuropils (clusters of interwoven nerves) that function as the optic lobe. As the beetle reaches adulthood – these neurophils degenerate and are replaced with a mature optic lobe. Adult beetles develop compound eyes, similar to many other insects. = Eye patch = Along with the six eyes on either side of the head, larvae also have an eye patch. This eye patch does not have a lens, but is composed of retinal tissue. Scientists theorize that this functions in filling the gap in vision at the top of the head, and can alert the beetle larvae of a change in light – which may be indicative of an overhead predator. = Bifocal lens = The diving beetle has a unique bifocal lens which is asymmetric. The protein makeup of the middle of the lens is different from that along the edges. Scientists have found that this disparity in the lens goes hand-in-hand with the multiple retinas in each eye. The bifocal asymmetric lens allows for two images to be formed within the eye – each focusing on one of the retinas. The unfocused image is also shifted due to the asymmetry – causing only the focused image to be displayed on one retina – further enhancing resolution.

The move was opposed by neighbouring country of Indonesia, who believed that it was a ploy to increase British control over the region and would eventually threaten their independence. On 16 September 1963, an organised mob of several thousand demonstrators formed in the city of Djakarta, they sacked the Malaysian Embassy before marching on the British Embassy where Becke and Walker were on guard, they tore down the Union Jack and burnt the Ambassador's car, then threw stones and pieces of concrete through the fence breaking all the embassy windows. In what is now a legendary act Walker strode up and down in front of the building, dodging the missiles and relentlessly playing his bagpipes despite pleas from the police and the leader of the demonstrators, eventually the mob broke up and the battle was won.The Times, 17 September 1963 Two days later however the mob returned and broke through the fence besieging the building and eventually setting it on fire, Becke, Walker and the Ambassador Sir Andrew Gilchrist stood their ground taking a stand on British sovereign soil and defending the embassy strong room.

Fossils have been found in the Urumaco Formation in Urumaco, Venezuela and the Solimões Formation of Brazil. The strata from which remains are found are late Miocene in age, rather than Pliocene as was once thought. A possible member of this genus survived into the Late Holocene on Muyua or Woodlark Island in Papua New Guinea.  Description  Ikanogavialis had a dorsoventrally deep snout and a distinctive notch between the dentary and maxillary alveoli. The external nares projected anterodorsally from the rostrum. This can be seen as a plesiomorphic characteristic in crocodilians, but given that the earliest gavialoids possessed dorsally projecting external nares, this feature can be seen as having been a reversal from the gavialoid apomorphy back to the crocodilian plesiomorphy rather than having been directly obtained from an early crocodilian ancestor.  Species  The type species of Ikanogavialis is I. gameroi. It was named in 1970 from material found from the Urumaco formation. A Pleistocene gavialoid named Gavialis papuensis from Murua also known as Muyua or Woodlark Island, part of Papua New Guinea (erroneously considered part of the Solomon Islands in some sources), bears some vague similarities with Ikanogavialis and was referred to the genus in 1999, along with other slender-snouted forms from the Neogene of South America and Africa.  Paleobiology  Ikanogavialis may have lived in a coastal paleoenvironment along with other gavialids such as Gryposuchus. The strata of the Urumaco formation were deposited in both marine and fluvial settings, although it is unclear to which portion both genera belong. Other gavialoids such as Siquisiquesuchus and Piscogavialis are known to have lived in coastal environments, and it is likely that extant freshwater gavialoids such as Gavialis may have originated from these coastal forms. Ikanogavialis also existed with many other crocodilians in Venezuela during the late Miocene including the giant caiman Purussaurus and an extinct species of Melanosuchus. \\"Gavialis\\"/Ikanogavialis papuensis was similarly fully marine, having been found in association with sea turtles and sirenians.

The libretto is by Eugen Suchoň, Ivan Stodola and Jela Krčméry- Vrteľová and is loosely based on Stodola's play Kráľ Svätopluk, which was in turn based on events in the life of King Svatopluk I. Suchoň composed Svätopluk between 1952 and 1959. It was premiered on 10 March 1960 in the Slovak National Theatre, directed by Miloš Wasserbauer and conducted by Tibor Frešo. Synopsis The story of this opera takes place around year 894 in Great Moravia. The king Svatopluk I feels that he is going to die and hands over his reign to his two sons. The fictive story is partially based on historical events and real persons. =Act 1= Igric Záboj loves princess Ľutomíra who schemes to make Pannonian prince Braslav the king of the Great Moravia. Záboj reveals secret messages about Svätopluk concentrating his army behind Danube and preparing to attack Franks. Ľutomíra sends this important message using a dove to Pannonia. King Svätopluk ceremonially inaugurates new rulers of the kingdom - his sons Mojmír and young Svätopluk. Mojmír is a supporter of Konštantín a Metod's teaching and wants to raise people from enthrallment, void the kingdom of the Frank priests and abandon slavery. Young Svätopluk is, however, ambitious and wants to seize the throne himself with the help of Franks. Slave girl Blagota asks for help for her daughter Milena, which was captured by pagans who want to make her a living sacrifice to their gods. Svätopluk gives this for consideration to his sons. Mojmír wants to free the girl immediately and break up the pagans contrary to young Svätopluk who pleads for pagans and sees them mainly as good warriors and his allies. A struggle arises in which both sons attack the king with remorses for the death of the uncle Rastislav after he tells them about his plans to attack Francia. A soldier brings in a message found in a shot dove—it was the message sent by Ľutomíra. The king is outraged, orders his army to gather and leads the assault against Franks himself. =Act 2= Pagan cemetery. In the tradition of the old rites, a young girl must die at the burial of a youth of majestic descent, who deceased as a hero in fight, to become his after-life bride. Young Svätopluk arrives. Pagan prophets foretell him god Perún's will: kill the king, your father, and you will reign yourself. Young Svätopluk agrees and runs away. Suddenly a regiment of Mojmír's army arrives, breaks up pagans, destroys their idols and frees young Milena who gratefully offers herself into Mojmír's service. Soldiers appeal Mojmír to capture his father's castle and seize his throne, but Mojmír refuses to act against his father in any way, but he wants to meet with him and negotiate about further ruling over Great Moravia. Ľutomíra hearing everything decides to destroy Mojmír by a plot and desires to become the ruler of Great Moravia herself. =Act 3= Svätopluk's adviser Dragomír finds out about Mojmír's deeds and orders his imprisonment. Mojmír admits killing pagans, but refuses accusation of killing father. Then Ľutomíra comes in and trickily testifies that the letter which she wrote and which was captured by royal guard was written by Mojmír. This frustrates the king and he orders to imprison Mojmír. Milena who became his faithful companion falls down at kings' feet and appeals for Mojmír that she heard that not Mojmír, but his second son seeks to kill him. Nobody believes the girl, but in spite of that Dragomír strengthens royal guards. At the full moon, young Svätopluk attempts to kill his father, but guards prevent him from doing this. The king can't believe his eyes. He suffers from a deep personal and emotional crisis – both sons are against him and tried to kill him. In his madness, he sees a revelation of blood-stained eyes which reminds him his old betrayal of his uncle Rastislav. He is found in aberrance by his third son Predslav, a monk, arriving to encourage him and beg for his brothers to lift their death sentence. The king says: \\"It's not needed.\\" He feels that his life is ending, so he gathers people and his sons, forgives them and divides the reign. He takes rods and warns his sons against disunity. \\"Separately they bend easily, but join them together and nobody will break them.\\" The king dies and struggle between sons begins. Young Svätopluk is not satisfied with his task and attacks with sword Mojmír who became heir of the crown. Mojmír is saved by Milena who protects him by her own body and dies almost at the same time as the king. Young Svätopluk flees saying: \\"Mojmír, we'll meet at the battlefield later!\\" and the fate of the Great Moravia is now unavoidable.

This copy in the Archiv Sohm, Staatsgalerie Stuttgart. Fluxus 1 is an artists' book edited and produced by the Lithuanian-American artist George Maciunas, containing works by a series of artists associated with Fluxus, the international collective of avant-garde artists primarily active in the 1960s and 1970s. Originally published in New York, 1964, the contents vary from edition to edition, but usually contain work by Ay-O, George Brecht, Alison Knowles, György Ligeti, Yoko Ono, Robert Watts and La Monte Young amongst many others.Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Harry N Abrams p110 The work has become famous as an early example of conceptual art, and as one of the defining products of the Fluxus collective. Early fluxus A single page from An Anthology, by La Monte Young and Jackson Mac Low, 1963. Designed and printed by George Maciunas. =The AG Gallery and proposals for a Yearbox= Maciunas had originally set up the AG Gallery, 925 Madison Avenue, New York City, to exhibit abstract art and to sell ancient musical instruments; upon meeting La Monte Young and Richard Maxfield in late 1960, however, he 'was suddenly confronted with the most radical ideas in art.' Overnight, the gallery was transformed into a greenhouse for 'the germination of Fluxus',Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Harry N Abrams p22 hosting events by Dick Higgins, Jackson Mac Low, Yoko Ono, La Monte Young and others. All of these artists would be included in the forthcoming Fluxus 1; the first known mention of the name Fluxus came on the invitation cards to 3 events held at the gallery, Spring 1961, in which guests were asked to contribute $3 to 'help publish Fluxus magazine'.The Assault on Culture, Stuart Home The gallery had gone bankrupt by mid 1961; to avoid his creditors, Maciunas took a job working for the US Army as a freelance designer in Wiesbaden, West Germany. He took many of the scores collected by La Monte Young for AN ANTHOLOGY, and whilst working on the design and printing for that, also began work on his own anthology Fluxus 1. Modelled in many ways on An Anthology, both works would prove difficult to publish. AN ANTHOLOGY appeared in Spring 1963; Most of Fluxus 1 was printed by the same German printers contemporaneously, but Maciunas doesn't seem to have put any copies together until sometime in early 1964, by which time he'd left his job in Germany due to bad health and had returned to New York. His letters leave a paper trail of torturous dealings with German printers; Originally intended as a six-part series of yearboxes covering America (1), Northern Europe (2), Japan (3), 'Homage To The Past' (4), Southern Europe (5) and Eastern Europe (6), only Fluxus 1 was actually published; whilst predominantly anthologising American artists, both European and Japanese artists were included from material that had originally been intended for other volumes in the series. The book originally sold for $6, with a 'Luxus Fluxus' edition costing $12 containing 'film, tape, objects and accessories' cc Valise e TRanglE, Fluxus Newspaper no3, march 1964 quoted in Fluxus Codex, p108 =Fluxus, collectivism & Anti-art= Amongst many other influences, Maciunas was directly inspired by LEF, the communist journal founded by Mayakovsky and Ossip Brik; an artistic organisation aimed at unifying left-wing artists to help build the newly emerging communist state in Russia.\\"Fluxus objectives are social (not aesthetic). They are connected to the group of LEF group of 1929 (sic) in Soviet Union (ideologically) and concern itself with: Gradual elimination of fine arts (music, theatre, poetry, fiction, painting, sculpture etc. etc.) ... Thus Fluxus is definitely against art-object as non-functional commodity - to be sold & to make livelihood for an artist. It could temporarily have the pedagogical function of teaching people the needlessness of itself. It should not be therefore permanent ... Fluxus therefore is ANTIPROFESSIONAL (against professional art or artists making livelihood from art or artists spending their full time, their life on art.) Secondly FLUXUS is against artas medium or vehicle promoting artist's ego, since applied art should express the objective problem to be solved not artist's personality or his ego. Fluxus should therefore tend towards collective spirit, anonymity and ANTI-INDIVIDUALISM ..... These Fluxus concerts, publications etc - are at best transitional (a few years) & temporary until such time when art can be totally eliminated (or at least its institutional forms) and artists find other employment.\\" George Maciunas, January 1964 Quoted in Fluxus Codex, Hendricks, Harry N Abrams p37 Fluxus 1 was Maciunas' first attempt at creating a coherent collective voice, an attempt to erode the artist's status as heroic individual & his first attempt to 'communicate the concept of the self-sufficiency of the audience, an art where anything can substitute for an art work and anyone can produce it.' Michael Corris from Grove Art Online, quoted on MOMA online In a lecture given on the June 9, 1962, Wuppertal, West Germany, to coincide with the launch of the Brochure Prospectus for the Fluxus Yearboxes, Maciunas stated that; > The anti-art forms are primarily directed against art as a profession, > against the artificial separation of producer or performer, of generator and > spectator or against the separation of art and life. They oppose forms > artificial in themselves, models or methods of composition, of artificially > constructed phenomena in the various areas of artistic practice, against > intentional, conscious formalism and against the fixation of art on meaning, > against the demand of music to be heard and that of plastic art to be seen; > and finally against the thesis that both should be acknowledged and > understood. Anti-art is life, nature; true reality is the one and all. The > bird song is anti-art. The pouring rain, the chattering of an impatient > audience, sneeze noises ... or compositions like \\"letting a butterfly caught > in a net fly away\\" or \\"what an audience left to its own devices does for > amusement\\"- all of these examples may be viewed in this sense as anti- > art.Maciunas, Kleinen Sommerfest lecture June 9, 1962, quoted in Fluxus > Codex p23 Maciunas sent out requests for 'critical or non-critical, rational or irrational essays'; scores, instructions ... visual compositions for reproductions, collages, photographs ... solid objects, scraps, smears, junk, garbage, rags, ready-makes (sic), found objects ... or an object (like a flat painting) cut into 200 parts.' Fluxus Codex, p104 As the yearbox developed, Maciunas became increasingly interested in what he referred to as 'Concretism', derived from Duchamp's ideas about the 'readymade'. In effect, concretism refers to works that don't attempt to transform themselves; objects such as George Brecht's Exit that remains resolutely a sign indicating the exit. > The best Fluxus 'Composition' is a most non-personal, 'readymade' one like > Brecht's 'Exit'—it does not require any of us to perform it since it happens > daily without any 'special' performance of it. Thus our festivals will > eliminate themselves (and our need to participate) when they become total > readymades (like Brecht's exit) The book itself 2 versions of a single page from Fluxus 1, A Favorite Song by Joe Jones, next to a version of the same from a copy of the slightly later Fluxkit. These copies in the Silverman collection. The book consists of a number of envelopes bound together by metal bolts, each containing printed works by a single artist. Some copies have the names of the works and of the artists printed onto the envelopes; others are hand-stamped. There is a printed folded sheet attached featuring Maciunas' typographic representations of each artist's name, and the whole book is contained in a wooden case sprayed with the title. The box was used, in part, to facilitate sending the work by post. A number of copies have the recipient's address written directly onto the cover. Contents might include: a Finger Envelope by Ay-O featuring an envelope with a slit in it containing a nylon stocking; A Favorite Song by Joe Jones containing 'a scramble of used music typewriter ribbons';Fluxus Codex, p279 Disappearing Music for Envelopes by Mieko Shiomi consisting of a sequence of envelopes of diminishing sizes within each other; the music score for Trois Bagatelles by Györgi Ligeti; or An Opera (see ), a short story written on a long scroll by Emmett Williams. Copies of Fluxus 1 were assembled over a period of 13 years, and whilst the form and much of the content remained fairly stable, 'Maciunas' attitude toward certain artists and/or works in the anthology changed, some works got lost or mislaid, and others ran out of stock.' Fluxus Codex, p110 Marginal figures in Fluxus, such as Giuseppe Chiari and Sohei Hashimoto, were dropped in favour of artists such as Yoko Ono and the Hi Red Center, whilst Dick Higgins is noticeable by his absence after a feud with Maciunas over the setting up of the Something Else Press. There are thought to be more than a hundred boxes manufactured between 1964 and 1977 in New York, and a further one hundred or so pieced together in Amsterdam by Willem de Ridder, for sale in the european Flux Mail Order Shop.Sims and Reed, quoting Philpot and Hendricks, here External links * An Anthology of Chance pdf on Ubuweb * An excellent online archive of Fluxus 1, the Fluxkit and Flux Year Box 2 at MOMA =Notes= Category:Fluxus Category:Fluxworks Category:Artists' books Category:Conceptual art Category:American art ","title":"Fluxus 1"},{"id":"23135998","text":"Paul Neebe is an American classical trumpeter who performs widely as a soloist, orchestral musician, and chamber player.

Constantinople in the Early Eighth Century: the Parastaseis syntomoi chronikai, series Columbia Studies in the Classical Tradition (Leiden, 1984). that concentrates on brief commentary connected to the topography of Constantinople and its monuments,The Inheritance of Rome, Chris Wickham, Penguin Books Ltd. 2009, . p. 255. notably its Classical Greek sculpture, for which it has been mined by art historians. Content The Parastaseis, dedicated to a doubtless imaginary \\"Philokalos\\", the generic \\"lover of beauty\\", are generally interpreted on the simplest level as a kind of tourist's guide to the curiosities of Constantinople, in the manner of the later guides to Rome, Mirabilia urbis Romae and De mirabilibus urbis Romae. In Classical Greek, a description of a work of art is an ekphrasis, and when considered under this rubric, or compared with the later compilation of notes on Constantinople called the Patria of Constantinople,Edited by Gilbert Dagron, Constantinople imaginaire: Etudes sur le recueil des \\"Patria\\", 1984. the Parastaseis fail to give an objective description. Instead, the reader is offered anecdotal narratives about the statues, which had become foci for legends and wonder-working objects themselves. \\"Statues were perceived on both the intellectual and popular level as animated, dangerous and talismanic,\\" observes Liz James.James, \\"'Pray Not to Fall into Temptation and Be on Your Guard': Pagan Statues in Christian Constantinople\\" Gesta 35.1 (1996:12-20) p. 15. Few of these anecdotes were as extended as the first-person narration about a statue of \\"Maximian\\" in the theatre of the Kynegion, which fell upon the investigator's companion, killing him; the narrator, who had taken refuge in Hagia Sophia, was exonerated when a certain philosopher, Johannes, found a text attributed to Demosthenes, predicting that the statue was fated to kill a prominent man. The emperor Philippicus (reigned 711–13) then had the statue buried.Recounted by James 1996:12. Such anecdotes do not directly relate to the commonly attributed imperial motivations for displaying classical plunder, as manifestations of imperial splendor past, present and future,The Hippodrome, studded with antique statues, is seen by S.G. Bassett as \\"a neatly crafted ensemble that described a vision of power in its past, present and future manifestations\\" (Bassett, \\"The antiquities of the Hippodrome of Constantinople\\", Dumbarton Oaks Papers 45 [1991:87-96]); H. Saradi- Mendelovici, \\"Christian attitudes to pagan monuments in Late Antiquity and their legacy in later Byzantine centuries\\" Dumbarton Oaks Papers\\" 44 (1990:47-61 and may be too summarily dismissed merely as examples of Christian superstition with regard to \\"idols\\". Liz JamesJames 1996:12-20. reinterpreted the text as exemplifying Byzantine views of the daimones inhabiting such three-dimensional figural representations as potential sources of power, for those Christians who understood how to harness it. The objective assessment of a work of art was immaterial: what mattered to Byzantine writers was the \\"meaning\\" for which the statue served merely as a vehicle.Liz James and R. Webb, \\"'To understand ultimate things and enter secret places': Ekphrasis and art in Byzantium\\", Art History 14 (1991:1-17). With no sense of \\"Antiquity\\", the Byzantines did not distance themselves or their art from their East Roman forebears, and had no sense that their interpretations of subject matter, often given Christian reidentifications, or the artistic style in which these representations were dressed, had drifted; by contrast, \\"we notice the distance that separates the Byzantines from the original meaning of pagan statues\\", given new identities as Christian figures or Emperors.Saradi- Mendelovici 1990:58. More recently, Benjamin Anderson has argued that the Parastaseis represents an attempt by a group of a self-styled aristocrats to claim the statues as repositories of secret knowledge about the future of the empire, and thus to gain leverage in their dealings with the eighth-century emperors.Benjamin Anderson, \\"Classified knowledge: the epistemology of statuary in the Parastaseis Syntomoi Chronikai\\", Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies 35 (2011:1-19). Critics Its crabbed and elliptical Greek, full of solecisms, has made interpretation ambiguous.Even the sources given in the text prove elusive. Though it is virtually the only secular text from the Byzantine age of eclipse that preceded the Macedonian Renaissance, surviving in a single manuscript, its modern commentators have not esteemed it highly: Alan CameronCameron, Porphyrius the Charioteer (Oxford University Press) 1973:110. found it \\"so stuffed with such staggering absurdities and confusions (especially where Constantine is concerned) that it is seldom worth even attempting to explain them, much less sift out the few grains of historical fact behind them.\\" A reviewer of its modern edition even called it \\"the Byzantinist's Historia Augusta\\".Barry Baldwin, in a positive review in Speculum, 61.2 (April 1986:388). Classicists have been frustrated in not being able securely to identify in Parastaseis the great sculptures of Antiquity that had been removed to Constantinople by Constantine the Great and his successors, and which continued to represent continuity with the classical tradition by their prominent presence in Constantinople's public spaces. Fire and damage took their toll, but enough remained to form the subject of Nicetas Choniates's little pamphlet On the Statues destroyed by the Latins,Possible alterations by a later writer have complicated the study of this text. in which Nicetas described the destruction of the remaining statues by the Latin crusaders at the sack of Constantinople in 1204.Cyril Mango, \\"Antique statuary and the Byzantine beholder\\", Dumbarton Oaks Papers 17 (1963:55-59).

In it, a young beauty searches the battlefield for her betrothed husband and helps wounded Serbian warriors with water, wine and bread after the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 between Serbia and the Ottoman Empire. She finally finds the wounded and dying warrior Pavle Orlović who tells her that her fiancé Milan Toplica and his blood-brothers Miloš Obilić and Ivan Kosančić are dead. Before the battle they had given her a cloak, golden ring and veil for the wedding as a promise of safe return, but they were slain and Pavle pointed to the direction of the bodies. The poem finishes with; > \\"O wretch! Evil is your fortune! > If I, a wretch, were to grasp a green pine, > Even the green pine would wither.\\" The poem became greatly popular as a symbol of womanly compassion and charity.

The museum is designed to appeal to both a popular and scholarly audience, with a collection that emphasizes objects of regional interest. In addition to collections of Southern folk art, Greek and Roman antiquities, 19th century scientific instruments, and American fine art. Part of the museum complex is Rowan Oak, a historic literary legacy that was once the home of William Faulkner, Nobel and Pulitzer Prize-winning author. Rowan Oak was renovated and reopened to the public in 2001 and continues to draw international visitors each year. The Museum also owns the Walton-Young Historic House – once home to critic and satirist Stark Young. The Walton- Young House is not currently open to the public. History Walton-Young House The museum complex began with the opening of the Mary Buie Museum in 1939 as a result of the vision of Mary Skipwith Buie of Oxford, an avid collector and an academically trained artist. She left her personal art collection to the city of Oxford in her will, and these items are now in the Museum’s permanent collections. It also contained the collection of Mary's half-sister, Kate Skipwith, who possessed not only antiques, but such memorabilia as American Revolutionary War correspondence by notable Americans George Washington, John Hancock, and John Adams. Funding for the Museum came from the generosity of her family, the Adair Skipwiths, and government programs such as the Works Progress Administration. Oxford operated the original museum from 1939 through 1974, before deeding it to the University of Mississippi. With the help of a legislative appropriation and funds from the Skipwith Foundation, the Museum significantly expanded in 1977 with the opening of the Kate Skipwith Teaching Museum to house the David M. Robinson Memorial Collection of Greek and Roman Antiquities, along with the Millington- Barnard Collection of 19th Century Scientific Instruments. The Museum again grew in 1998 with the addition of the Seymour Lawrence Gallery to showcase the work of American Modernists, such as Georgia O’Keeffe, Arthur Dove, John Marin, and Marsden Hartley. Collectively, the Walton-Young Historic House, the Buie Museum and the Skipwith Museum were called the University Museums.

The book is notable as being one of the first English writings which named important emerging French Impressionists; for its literary criticism; and depictions of bohemian life in Paris during the 1870s and 1880s. Summary In writing style The Confessions of a Young Man is presented as a novel, with a hero named Dayne, but the reader assumes in essence it is an autobiography, a true \\"confession\\".Arnold Bennett. Fame and fiction. G. Richards, 1901. Page 236+ Dayne (i.e. Moore) went to Paris as a teenager, and almost becomes a full Parisian nearly forgetting the English language after 15 years. He sketches, with a frankness now jubilant, now cynical, the luscious \\"vie de Boheme\\" that Paris alone could offer the young man of health and wealth who loved art. Amid scenes splendid, squalid, or bizarre, move students, cabotins, painters, poets, pale enthusiasts starving for the sake of an idea, actresses, women of fashion, courtesans, clubmen, and spectators. Artistic endeavour and perfumed vice mingle in fraternity; everything is unusual, irregular, fantastic. Dayne emerges from the ordeal of this environment but little changed. For him the enticements of the flesh are not more powerful than those of art. One week he is beguiling the hours in some salon or alcove, the next he is incandescent with aspiration. So the years pass; and at last, having saturated himself with the French theories of literary and graphic art which are bound up with the names of Flaubert, Goncourts, Zola, Degas, and Manet, he one day learns with tragic certainty that he is not destined to be a painter, and he courageously admits that all this periodic, frenzied effort has been misdirected. Then we have interludes of philosophy and literary criticism; the philosophy perhaps not of much account; the criticism often original, epigrammatic, sometimes of an astounding penetration, and always literary. Later, Dayne is driven by adverse circumstances to London and to a lodging in the Strand, where the book ends. Dayne's ideas about art and his temperament can be seen in characteristic passages like the following: \\"For art was not for us then as it is now—a mere emotion, right or wrong only in proportion to its intensity; we believed then in the grammar of art, perspective, anatomy, and la jambe qui porte.\\" Significance Confessions of a Young Man was widely read for its energy and youthful outrage at hypocritical Victorian morality. The late nineteenth century English novelist George Gissing borrowed the book from the Grosvenor Library in April 1888 and described it as an \\"interesting but disgusting book\\". Coustillas, Pierre ed. London and the Life of Literature in Late Victorian England: the Diary of George Gissing, Novelist. Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, p.27. The Modern Library picked this book as one of its early re-prints in 1917. It is significant in part because Moore was one of the first to write about the emerging impressionist art scene in Paris. As Moore says in a later Preface: \\"The first eulogies written in England, I might also say in almost any language, of Manet, Degas, Whistler, Monet, Pissarro, are in this book of Confessions, and whoever reads will find himself unable to deny that time has vindicated them all splendidly.\\" Finally, Moore wrote insightful literary criticism of major authors of the 19th century the general sentiment of which concurred with the following generation of Modernists in the early 20th century.

Kansas has a gubernatorial election every four years. Members of the state's United States congressional delegation run for election or re-election at the times set out in the United States Constitution. Primary elections assist in choosing political parties' nominees for various positions. On a regional basis, elections also cover municipal issues. In addition, a special election can occur at any time. Voter qualifications Subject to such exceptions as the Kansas Legislature may prescribe, all citizens of the United States, over the age of eighteen and who are residents of this state, may register to vote as a qualified elector of Kansas. A special provision allows seventeen-year-olds to register to vote if they will be eighteen before the next statewide general election. This does not allow them to vote in the primary or at any other election before attaining the age of eighteen. Types of elections =General election= The general election for all elected state, district and country officers is held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November every two years. Those offices whose term expires the year following the general election must face election in that general election. For the statewide elected executive offices (the Governor of Kansas, Attorney General of Kansas, etc.), they must face election in the general election held two years after the last election for President of the United States. The most recent gubernatorial election in Kansas was held in 2018. Candidates for United States Senator and United States Representative are elected in either the state general election as their term expires. =Primary election= A primary election must be held for a political party to nominate its candidates for the offices to the filled at the next general election. Such primaries are held on the first Tuesday in August of each year in which a general election is to be held. No candidate's name may be printed on the general election ballot unless such candidate has been nominated by his political party by a primary election. However, nonpartisan candidates need not seek primary election nominations in order to appear on the general election ballot Kansas operates a closed primary system in which only voters who have affiliated with the given political party may vote in that party’s primary and runoff primary elections. However, the chairman of each political party may allow registered Independents to vote in the given political party. However, under no circumstance may an Independent vote in more than one political party’s primary elections. Registered voters not affiliated with either party 21 days before the election may choose to affiliate with a party on election day at the polling place. Election provisions =Substitute candidates= In the event of the death of a political party's nominee for office prior to the date of the general election, a substitute candidate is permitted to have his name placed on the general election ballot. If the nominee was a candidate for a state office, the state central committee of the party affected must the Secretary of the State Election Board of the name of an alternative candidate to be placed on the general election ballot. Such notice must be submitted in writing within five days after the death has occurred and must be signed by at least two members of the political party's state central committee. If the death of the political party’s nominee should occur five days or more following the Runoff Primary Election date, a special general election shall be called by the Governor of Kansas. For such special general election, the candidates for office are the substitute candidate named by the central committee, the nominee of other political parties nominated for office, and any previously filed independent candidates.

It was the first powerful tornado in the vicinity of Moscow since the tornado of 1984. By damage registered in photo and video materials, this tornado is categorised at F2 at its rise, and at F3 at maximum stage. Synopsis Late on June 3, 2009, a cold-core non-tropical low pressure area located over the Baltic Sea collided with a warm air mass, creating atmospheric instability. The result was a line of severe thunderstorms, also known as a squall line, in the Moscow area. One of the thunderstorms broke off and developed into a supercell thunderstorm about from Moscow, Russia. The supercell spawned a wide tornado in Krasnozavodsk. The tornado reached F3 intensity along its path. The tornado was the first intense tornado to impact the Moscow region in nearly 25 years. Upwards of of rain fell throughout the impacted regions. This is roughly half the monthly rainfall average. Impact The tornado damaged and destroyed numerous homes within the Moscow Region. The most severe damage took place in Krasnozavodsk where nine people were reportedly killed, one of whom was later confirmed, and 185 others were injured. The fatality occurred after a boy was pinned underneath a downed tree. Teachers rushed to pull the child from the fallen tree but were unable to free him. Paramedics declared him dead at the scene by the time they arrived. High winds produced by the thunderstorm that spawned the tornado cut power to 40,000 people throughout 250 towns in the area. Live power lines downed by the tornado sparked fires that destroyed ten structures. Damage from the fires amounted to 170 million RUB (US$5.3 million). In Moscow, winds up to downed 90 trees, damaged 25 advertisement billboards and several homes. Forty-two homes were damaged by the tornado, ranging from roof damage to severe interior damage, 60 vehicles were either thrown or damaged, and 360 trees were uprooted. Damages from the tornado were estimated at 350 million RUB (US$11.3 million). Aftermath Following the severe weather, emergency response teams were deployed to the affected regions. Cleanup crews also quickly began to remove debris from roadways and rebuild downed power lines. By June 11, all roads were cleared. By June 14, repair to the damaged homes were complete as all the roofs were replaced by city officials.

These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents or guardians, who suspect their child is eligible, may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Coordinator of Special Education. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. Brentwood Borough School District received a $772,185 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 46 or 3.47% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum through a push in model with the gifted instructor in the classroom with the regular instructor. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to honors and advanced placement courses, and dual enrollment with local colleges. The special education department works to connect students with local enrichment opportunities offered by groups in the region. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student’s building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Bullying and safety In 2009 the administrative reported there were 3 incidents of bullying in the district. The Brentwood Borough School Board prohibits bullying by district students and faculty. The policy defines bullying and cyberbullying. The Board directs that complaints of bullying shall be investigated promptly, and corrective action shall be taken when allegations are verified. No reprisals or retaliation shall occur as a result of good faith reports of bullying. The board expects staff members to be responsible to maintain an educational environment free from all forms of bullying. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Budget In 2009, the district employed 100 teachers.

Muhlenberg School District in Berks County received the highest with a 22.31% increase in funding. The state's Basic Education Funding to the Brentwood Borough School District in 2008-09 was $4,483,154.48 Pennsylvania Department of Education Report on Funding by school district October 2009 The amount of increase each school district receives is determined by the Governor and the Secretary of Education through the allocation set in the state budget proposal made in February each year.Pennsylvania Budget Proposal 2010, Office of Budget, February 2010. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 394 students received free or reduced-price lunches due to low family income in the 2007-2008 school year.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Funding Report by Local Education Agency., October 2009. Accountability Block Grant The state provides supplemental funding in the form of accountability block grants. The use of these funds is strictly focused on specific state approved uses. Brentwood Borough School District uses its $204,479 to fund all-day kindergarten and to reduce class size Kindergarten to 3rd grade. These annual funds are in addition to the state's basic education funding. Schools Districts must apply each year for Accountability Block Grants. In 2009-10 the state provided $271.4 million in Accountability Block grants $199.5 million went to providing all-day kindergartens. Classrooms for the Future Grants In 2008-09, Brentwood Borough School Board, applied for and received a grant from the PA Department of Education for over to purchase equipment to help reform the high school's core subjects instruction and to prepare students for future employment by using cutting-edge equipment and software. The district used the funds to purchase laptops for students, laptops for teachers, laptop carts and other digital equipment. The district also received substantial funds to upgrade our existing network infrastructure. The grant provided additional funding for a technology coach to instruct teachers in using the equipment to improve instruction. In 2006-07 the district did not apply for funding. In 2007-08, the district's application was rejected by the PDE. In 2008, the district received $76,390 for computers and related equipment. Since 2006, Pennsylvania's Classrooms for the Future program has distributed more than $150 million for laptops, interactive boards and other high-tech tools in 543 high schools. In 2009 the state funding program was terminated due to a deep state budget shortfall.Governor Rendell Signs Education Budget Preserving Pennsylvania's Academic Progress, Keeping Property Taxes Down, Governor's Press Office release, October 9, 2009 Federal Stimulus grant The district received $902,429 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was for 2009-10 and 2010-11 school years.

Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate.Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support Pennsylvania was not approved in the first round of the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. =Real estate taxes= The Brentwood Borough School Board set property tax rates in 2011-12 28,2700 mills. One mill in Brentwood School District generates about $338,000. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. *2009-10 - 28.2700 mills *2008-09 - 28.2700 mills. *2007-08 - 28.2700 mills *2006-07 - 28.2700 mills The Brentwood Borough School District offers an option for installment payments of real estate taxes on approved Homestead and Farmstead Property pursuant to the Taxpayer Relief Act (Act 1 of 2006). Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010-2011 school year is 2.9 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of 0.75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines. The School District Adjusted Index for the Brentwood Borough School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012. *2006-07 - 5.3%, Base 3.9% *2007-08 - 4.7%, Base 3.4% *2008-09 - 6.1%, Base 4.4% *2009-10 - 5.8%, Base 4.1% *2010-11 - 4.1%, Base 2.9% *2011-12 - 2.0%, Base 1.4% For the 2011-12 school year the Brentwood Borough School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the Brentwood Borough School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is publisher each year by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district’s index. Of the districts who sought exceptions 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. For the 2010-11 school year budget, the Brentwood Borough School Board did not apply for any exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. In 2009 the school board did not apply for any exceptions. Property tax relief In 2011, property tax relief was set at $243 for the 2,570 approved homesteads.Tax Relief per Homestead, Pennsylvania Department of Education, May 1, 2011 In Allegheny County, the highest tax relief went to Duquesne City School District which was set at $351. In 2010, property tax relief was set at $244 for 2,561 homesteads. In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Brentwood Borough School District was $247 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 2,533 property owners applied for the tax relief. Among Allegheny County school districts, Duquesne City School District received the highest tax relief at $346 in 2009. In Pennsylvania the highest tax relief was given to Chester Upland School District of Delaware County at $632 in 2009. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Allegheny County, 60% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, so people who make substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%). = Enrollment and Consolidation= The Pennsylvania Department of Education reported that the Brentwood Borough School District's enrollment had declined to 1238 pupils in 2010. In 2006, the enrollment had been 1327 pupils. The PDE projects that enrollment will continue to decline to 1002 students by 2019-2020. A proposal was made by David Wassell, a prominent resident and leader in Allegheny County, to consolidate Allegheny County school districts to save tax dollars, focus dollars on student achievement, and improve student services. The plan calls for a proposed district that includes: Brentwood Borough School District, Baldwin-Whitehall School District, Keystone Oaks School District and Mount Lebanon School District. The proposed district would serve the communities of: Baldwin, Baldwin Township, Brentwood, Castle Shannon, Dormont, Green Tree, and Mt. Lebanon.Wassel, David, The Next Page: For a New Allegheny County -- 26 school districts, 26 municipalities., The PostGazette.com. June 21, 2009 A Standard and Poors study found that an optimal school district size, to conserve administrative costs, was at least 3000 pupils. The report found that consolidation of the administration with an adjacent school district would achieve substantial administrative cost savings for people in the schools' communities. In February 2009, Governor Edward Rendell proposed reducing the number of school districts in Pennsylvania from 500 to 100. He asserted that consolidation of adjacent school districts, in each county, would achieve substantial administrative cost savings. His proposal stated that the savings could be redirected to improving lagging reading and science achievement, to enriching the academic programs or to reducing residents' property taxes.Pennsylvania Public School Enrollments by School District and LEA January 2009 Consolidation of the central administrations into one would not require the closing of any local schools. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants Fiscal Responsibility Task Force released a report which found that consolidating school district administrations with one neighboring district would save the Commonwealth $1.2 billion without forcing the consolidation of any school buildings. The study noted that while the best school districts spent 4% of the annual budget on administration, others spend over 15% on administration. More than 40 percent of elementary schools and more than 60 percent of secondary schools in western Pennsylvania are projected to experience significant enrollment decreases (15 percent or greater). Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity. In a survey of 88 superintendents of small districts, 42% of the 49 respondents stated that they thought consolidation would save money without closing any schools. Extracurriculars The district offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and sports. The school board determines eligibility policies to participate in these programs. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. The students must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. =Sports= The district offers high school students: Track and Field, Golf, Football, Girls' Volleyball, Girls' Basketball, Girls' Softball, Baseball, Cross Country, Soccer, and Swimming. Middle school - Swimming, Cheerleading, Basketball, as well as Track and Field. It also offers a combined Middle and High school marching band References Category:School districts in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Category:Education in Pittsburgh area ","title":"Brentwood Borough School District"},{"id":"23136547","text":"Josh or Joshua Holmes may refer to: * Josh Holmes (rugby union) (born 1987), Australian rugby union player * Josh Holmes (video game designer) (born 1973), Canadian game producer and video game designer ","title":"Josh Holmes"},{"id":"23136605","text":"Lectionary 126, designated by siglum ℓ 126 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering) is a Greek manuscript of the New Testament, on parchment leaves.

As a mineral, it is called perovskite, named after Russian mineralogist, L. A. Perovski (1792-1856). It is a colourless, diamagnetic solid, although the mineral is often coloured owing to impurities. Synthesis CaTiO3 can be prepared by the combination of CaO and TiO2 at temperatures >1300 °C. Sol-gel processes has been used to make a more pure substance, as well as lowering the synthesis temperature. These compounds synthesized are more compressible due to the powders from the sol-gel process as well and bring it closer to its calculated density (~4.04 g/ml). Structure Calcium titanate is obtained as orthorhombic crystals, more specifically perovskite structure. In this motif, the Ti(IV) centers are octahedral and the Ca2+ centers occupy a cage of 12 oxygen centres. Many useful materials adopt related structures, e.g. barium titanate or variations of the structure, e.g. yttrium barium copper oxide.

The film had its World Premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City in May 2003 and was broadcast nationally on PBS’s Independent Lens on June 8th, 2004. Details \\"Sumo East and West\\" tells the story of Wayne Vierra of Kahuku, Hawaii, who arrived in Japan in 1990 at the age of 18 to become a professional sumo wrestler alongside another teenaged Hawaiian, Chad Rowan of Waimanalo. The two became fast friends during the arduous apprenticeship as sumo novices but their paths soon diverged, as Wayne suffered a ruptured pancreas that ended his career and sent him back to Hawaii, while Chad—under the name Akebono—went on to become the first non-Japanese yokozuna (grand champion) in the two thousand-year history of sumo. \\"Sumo East and West\\" recounts how Wayne recovered from this crushing turn of events to become a star in the burgeoning world of amateur sumo, culminating in winning both the heavyweight and Open categories at the North American Amateur Sumo Championship in Los Angeles in 1999. Using Wayne's story as its spine, \\"Sumo East and West\\" tells the broader story of the culture clash between East and West seen through the prism of sumo, including sumo's role in Commodore Perry's opening of Japan in 1851; in the influx of Japanese immigrants to Hawaii at the turn of the 19th century; and in the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II; and in Japan's complex love-hate relationship with American pop culture in the postwar period. A principal focus is the state of sumo today, as the sport fights for relevance in modern Japan, while aficionados in the US are busily transforming it into Westernized form for tournaments in Las Vegas casinos and hoping for its inclusion in the Olympic Games. In addition to Akebono, the film also features interviews with two other Hawaii-born superstars of pro sumo who were at the forefront of the controversial transformation of the sport: Konishiki and Jesse \\"Takamiyama\\" Kuhaulua. Also featured are Emmanuel Yarborough of New Jersey, the 1995 World Amateur Sumo Champion and—at 750 lbs, the largest athlete in the world according to the Guinness Book of World Records; Henry \\"Sentoryu\\" Miller of St. Louis, Missouri, the only African-American to reach the top division of pro sumo; and Judge Katsugo Miho of Hawaii, a veteran of the fabled all-nisei 442d Regimental Combat Team who helped liberate the Dachau concentration camp and later negotiated the way for the first Hawaiian wrestlers to enter pro sumo in Japan.http://www.sumoeastandwest.com \\"Sumo East and West\\" was made by the husband-and-wife team Ferne Pearlstein (director/cinematographer/producer/editor) and Robert Edwards (writer/producer/editor).

Arkansas joined the union in 1836 right on the eve of the panic of 1837. The original Arkansas State constitution called for the creation of two banks. The State Bank of Arkansas, meant to loan money to individuals, and the Real Estate Bank of Arkansas, which was a land grant bank typical of those seen in other states such as Florida and Mississippi at the time. The two banks were chartered during the first legislative session and opened for business in 1838, but by 1840 the State bank had failed. Its bonds were then issued to the Real Estate bank. The Real Estate bank was unable to sell the bonds but was able to use them as collateral for $121,000 loan with the North American Banking and Trust Company of New York. The legality of this was questionable because they were being used below their face value, which was against the original bonds condition. Without waiting for the state to redeem the loan, and in a breach of good faith the bonds were sold to James Holford, a banker in London, England, for $325,000. Then after they were known as \\"The Holford Bonds\\". The New York trust company would soon fail having stolen over $200,000 from the state of Arkansas through this deal. Holford then sought to make back the money by suing the state of Arkansas for $250,000, filing in both Arkansas and New York. Then the Real Estate bank failed and the ownership of the bonds was transferred to the state. The question then became whether or not the state was legally obligated to refund these bonds at face value or even at all since they were now surrounded by legally questionable deals and bad faith. The ordeal turned the state against banking, and an amendment was added to the constitution in 1846 prohibiting the state from chartering another bank. In the reconstruction era, the issue of refunding the bonds along with the infrastructure bills would be the centerpiece of Republican policy. The bonds were tied up in a lot of real estate in the state and the carpetbagger government was looking for ways to fund infrastructure projects, many of which turned out to be phony ways to funnel money into their own pockets. The Arkansas legislature passed laws to refund the bonds on April 6, 1869 with 30 years interest. Afterward they were contested on the grounds of there being fraud and breach of faith in their sale by the trust company. Governor Baxter's veto of a refunding bill that included the Holford bonds would tip off the Brooks-Baxter War in 1874. It wasn't until 1884 that the Fishback Amendment, named for its author William M. Fishback of Fort Smith, Arkansas, was passed prohibiting their payment, and added to the Constitution of Arkansas.

The Grand Châtelet around 1800, looking south from the rue Saint-Denis The original building on the site may have been a wooden tower constructed by Charles the Bald in 870 to defend the then new Grand-Pont bridge (now replaced by the Pont au Change), but it is known that Louis VI built a stronger structure in stone, a châtelet ('small castle'), in 1130; it was called the Grand Châtelet in contrast to the Petit Châtelet built around the same time at the end of the Petit Pont, on the south bank of the Seine.Jacques Hillairet, Dictionnaire historique des rues de Paris, 8th ed. (Éditions de Minuit, 1985), Vol. 1, p. 331. It lost its defensive purpose in 1190 when Philip Augustus built a rampart around the perimeter of the city; from then on it served as the headquarters of the prévôt de Paris, the official \\"charged with protection of royal rights, oversight of royal administration, and execution of royal justice\\" in late medieval Paris.William W. Kibler and Grover A. Zinn, Medieval France: An Encyclopedia (Routledge, 1995: ), p. 758. The court of the Châtelet was always subordinate to the Parlement de Paris, but it had extensive criminal and civil jurisdiction, and treason cases were frequently tried there. For centuries, the magistrates of the Châtelet clashed with those of the Hôtel de Ville over jurisdiction.Léon Bernard, The Emerging City: Paris in the Age of Louis XIV (Duke University Press, 1970), p. 34. The Châtelet was rebuilt by Charles V, but by 1460 it had fallen into such disrepair that the sittings of the court were held at the Louvre, not returning until 1506; in 1657 the court was once again forced to move temporarily, this time to the convent of the Grands Augustins on the Rue Dauphine.The History of Paris, from the Earliest Period to the Present Day (A. and W. Galignani, 1825), pp. 100-01. In 1684 the structure was almost completely rebuilt by Louis XIV, taking on the form that it had until it was demolished after the Revolution. \\"The roadway which passed under the Chatelet (in effect the continuation of the Rue Saint-Denis) set apart the municipal prison on the eastern side of the structure from the various magisterial chambers to the west.\\"Bernard, The Emerging City, p. 34. Under the western side lay the city morgue; the prisons on the eastern side increased in number from nine to twenty over the years, ranging from dormitories where prisoners lived \\"à la pistole,\\" that is with beds, to those called \\"au secret,\\" ranging from a huge hall with straw mats to subterranean dungeons.Hillairet, Dictionnaire historique des rues de Paris, p. 332. > Like all edifices in the Old Regime connected with the administration of > justice, the Chatelet enjoyed a very sinister reputation, even worse than > the storied Bastille. Relatively few Parisians of common stock were ever > able to claim the dubious distinction that a relative or friend languished > in the dungeons of the Bastille; many more could make the claim for the dank > chambers of the Châtelet, inherently far more fearsome than the dry and > relatively comfortable prison a mile to the east.Bernard, The Emerging City, > p. 33. Among the famous prisoners who spent time in the Châtelet were Clément Marot, who composed his Enfer there; the famous highwayman Cartouche; the poisoner Antoine-François Desrues (1744-1777); and the marquis de Favras. The area around the Châtelet was physically unpleasant as well, due to the smell of drying blood from nearby slaughterhouses and \\"the effluent of the great sewers that oozed into the Seine between the Pont Notre-Dame and the Pont-au- Change.\\"David Garrioch, The Making of Revolutionary Paris (University of California Press, 2002: ), p. 18.

It consists of two side platforms, which serve the B branch's two tracks. The station is accessible, with raised platforms to allow level boarding onto low-floor trams and a high platform on the inbound side to serve high-floor trams. Boston University Central is one of only five accessible surface stations on the \\"B\\" branch (the others are Boston University East, Harvard Avenue, Washington Street, and the branch's terminus at Boston College). History A streetcar at the station in 1977 The station has the third-highest ridership on the B branch (after only Harvard Avenue and ). In the early 2000s, the MBTA modified key surface stops with raised platforms for accessibility. Portable lifts were installed at Boston University Central around 2000 as a temporary measure. Construction at Boston University Central and Boston University East was part of a $32 million modification of thirteen B, C, and E branch stations. During construction, an interim station with temporary platforms between the two stops was used. Construction began on March 18, 2002, a week behind schedule due to delays in finishing up similar work at Harvard Avenue and Washington Street. The project was then expected to be completed within six months. However, poor weather and limited work periods (as most work could only be done during the four hours at night that no trains used the line) delayed the completion date first to December 2002, then March 2003. The contractor informed the MBTA in early 2003 that they would be unable to complete the work; a new contractor was chosen in mid-2003, but work did not resume until September. The stations were completed and reopened on November 18, 2003. Around 2006, the MBTA added a wooden mini-high platform on the inbound side, allowing level boarding on older Type 7 LRVs. These platforms were installed at eight Green Line stations in 2006–07 as part of the settlement of Joanne Daniels-Finegold, et al. v. MBTA.

They have released two albums, the first one called ... And it Rained Machines in 2006 and the second one in 2008 titled The Silent Years. History =The beginning= Eudora was formed in Orange County, California, in 2005 by Robby Friend and Kevin Connor. They soon met Tim Markel through the social networking site MySpace and started rehearsing. It was soon evident that the three of them \\"clicked\\" and they commenced writing original songs. Through a friendship with the band National Product they were introduced to Actor/singer David Tom. With the addition of David as the lead singer and Peter Coranza as drummer, the band started playing shows in and around Southern California. The venue Chain Reaction in Anaheim became a home base of operation as they played there on regular bases while honing their original sound. In early 2006 the band began work on their first CD \\"... And it Rained Machines\\" A music video for the song \\"Breakfast of a Killer\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDL4wvyIguc was directed by Justin Janowitz. Eudora's CD ... And it Rained Machines received a distribution deal with World Artist Records, which made the CD available to a much larger audience by putting it on the shelves in Hot Topics, Amazon.com and iTunes. The CD earned the band enough attention that they were rewarded with their first spot on the annual Vans Warped Tour, playing both the Los Angeles and the Pomona dates of the 2006 tour on the DIY stage. All the while Eudora was having what would become a regular occurrence with a number of different musicians sitting on the drummers throne with Mike Crisis (also known as Mr. Pink Jackethttp://www.buddytv.com/michael-r.aspx) lasting the longest. About a year after \\"...and it rained machines hit shelves, the band went into the studio to demo some new songs for a potential Japanese record label that had interest in the band. Around December 2006 after the record-deal-talk dissipated, Eudora released those demos onto their myspace. Those 2 songs (Addiction, and Ruining a Movie You've Never Seen For a Group Of People You Dont Really Know) slowly worked their way into the band's live set, as songs like \\"Gold in the Storm\\", and \\"Mishaps and Circumstances\\" were the first (off the band's debut CD) that were retired from the live show. In October of that same year the band won a contesthttp://www.radiorevolt.com/news.php?extend.531 for a coveted opening slot for A Static Lullaby at The Troubadour in Hollywood. A small tour was planned for January 2007, but due to personal/professional and musical differences it was decided that David Tom would leave the band after one last December show at Chain Reaction. =Scarves & Barfs= The tour of the southwest happened as planned, with Tim and Mike sharing the vocal duties. The tour supporting fellow band, \\"Victory Within\\" started in Southern California and followed through Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Nevada giving the band their first taste of life on the road. Soon afterwards drummer Mike Crisis was asked to leave the band and they were was once again without a drummer and still without a lead singer. As luck would have it by early May 2007 they had played an acoustic show in Ridgecrest, California, with Brandon Ball as their front man and soon afterwards, Michael Stahl of the band \\"Four Alarm Fire\\" was found and agreed to join the band. The first show with the new line-up was at the Bunkhouse Saloon in Las Vegas on May 28, 2007. Once again Eudora earned a spot on the 2007 Pomona Vans Warped Tour date playing on the Ernie Ball Stage. =The Silent Years= While playing a number of shows in the Southland the band began work writing what would be their first full length CD The Silent Years. Not being signed to a label the entire recording process had to be financed by the band themselves by playing shows and selling merchandise whenever possible. The album The Silent Years was recorded between November 17, 2007, and April 27, 2008, at Black Studios in Los Angeles and WoodWorks Studios in Hollywood. Produced and co-mixed by Brent Woods. Soon after production on the CD was complete Michael Stahl announced that he was marrying the love of his life and would be leaving the band. Good friend and drummer, Justin McCarthy of the band Lunar Fiction agreed help out and play a number of live dates with the band. The band was featured on a KOCE-TV story about the Orange County music scene that appeared on the PBS show InsideOC on KOCE-TV. The May 11, 2008, release of The Silent Years was celebrated with a CD release show at Chain Reaction in Anaheim on May 10. Justin was soon recruited and wooed away to join Epitaph Records signed band \\"I Am Ghost\\" This time they didn't have to look too far for a new drummer, long-time friend Nick Derosa drummed for the band for a few months before officially being declared \\"In the band\\". Alternative Press magazine picked Eudora in their August 2008 Warped Tour issue as one of the Top 8 unsigned bandshttp://www.altpress.com/apr/152.htm that you should know about. With the new lineup in place the band was picked to play the on last five dates of the 2008 Vans Warped Tour on the Kevin Says Stage.http://www.solonglonesome.com/2009_04_25_archive.html Robby Friend was unable to play the first date in Fresno so Tony Kim of Lunar Fiction filled in on that date only. =Lifted and Gifted= In September 2008 the band left for tour on the road with Flight 409 and We Spell Disaster. Dubbed \\"The Lifted and Gifted Tour\\", The tour proved to be more a drudgery then a pleasure and only served to aggravated ongoing tensions already brewing in the band. The three- week tour passed through several locations in California, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico. The band ended the tour in Las Vegas, and wasted no time rushing home. The band took a long break returning for one more headlining show (in December) at Chain Reaction in Anaheim after which, Robby Friend left to join the band Frequency Five. =Present day= Preliminary writing had begun on what would have been Eudora's third CD. Powerslave Records has signed Eudora in May 2009 with plans to release \\"The Silent Years\\" on July 8, 2009 in Japan with a bonus track included. A music video for the song \\"Digging Up The Dead with John Edwards\\" has been shot and will be released shortly. It was announced in early June, that Eudora won a slot on the Ernie Ball Stage at the Pomona date of the 2009 Vans Warped Tour.http://warped.battleofthebands.com/contest.php?city=pomona Kevin Connor left Eudora to pursue a career in the freight industry, Tim Markel sang for the Metal band Beneath Paris, and continues to write music for his Solo Project, Nick has joined the Orange County based band The Derty and Brandon Ball and Tony Kim have begun writing and recording their first record together. Their new project is titled \\"Strangers At Dawn\\". Eudora have officially broken-up with no plans to record or perform together again. Tim Markel, and Robby Friend have begun writing and recording for a new project called \\"Hideouts\\" and expect to have a full length available online by summer 2012.

The station is located in the center median of Commonwealth Avenue, between Granby Street and the east end of Cummington Street, surrounded by the Boston University campus. It consists of two side platforms, which serve the B branch's two tracks. Boston University East is one of only five surface stations on the branch that are accessible (the others being BU Central, Harvard Avenue, Washington Street, and the B branch's terminus at Boston College). History An inbound tram at the station in the 1940s Owing to its location in front of Warren Towers dormitory and Boston University's College of Arts and Sciences, Boston University East has the sixth-highest ridership of any station on the B branch. In the early 2000s, the MBTA modified key surface stops with raised platforms for accessibility. Construction at Boston University Central and Boston University East was part of a $32 million modification of thirteen B, C, and E branch stations. During construction, an interim station with temporary platforms between the two stops was used. Construction began on March 18, 2002, a week behind schedule due to delays in finishing up similar work at Harvard Avenue and Washington Street. The project was then expected to be completed within six months. However, poor weather and limited work periods (as most work could only be done during the four hours at night that no trains used the line) delayed the completion date first to December 2002, then March 2003. The contractor informed the MBTA in early 2003 that they would be unable to complete the work; a new contractor was chosen in mid-2003, but work did not resume until September. The stations were completed and reopened on November 18, 2003.

Speer Cemetery is frequently confused with the present day Bergen Cemetery owned and operated by Old Bergen Church, a portion of which fronts Vroom St at Tuers Ave. The land Speer Cemetery sits on was originally part of the apple orchards owned by the Van Waganen family of Apple Tree House fame. After title to the property was transferred to Matthias DeMott, this three quarter acre portion of the DeMott estate was used as a burial ground for DeMott family members. The DeMotts were early settlers to New Netherland in Esopus(present day Kingston, NY) and later, Long Island, NY before later generations settled in Bergen, New Netherland in the 1770s. The earliest surviving gravemarker in the cemetery is dated 1756. The cemetery is named for Jane Speer and her husband, Abraham Speer, an undertaker and acting sexton for the church, who bought the land from the De Mott estate in 1857 and made it a public cemetery, selling burial plots for $16 each. Patients of Snake Hill(Laurel Hill) Sanitarium were interred during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in one of the two large catacombs in the cemetery. Cataloging of names from headstones and historical records collected by neighbors and volunteers make it possible to now verify many who are buried in the cemetery. Headstones indicate the burial of the veterans of the American Revolutionary War, War of 1812, American Civil War, and the Spanish–American War. Its last interments occurred during World War I.Harriet Phillips Eaton, Jersey City And Its Historic Sites, 1899 Plans to construct a building on a lot adjacent to the remaining cemetery grounds have been met with opposition, since it is believed that the land being developed was once part of the burial ground and contains human remains, possibly dating back to the 1660s; the developer has been ordered to hire an archeologist to validate that belief.http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2013/06/archaeologist_to_determine_if_jersey_city_construction_site_was_part_of_historic_cemetery.html#/0 See also * Hudson County Cemeteries * Van Wagenen House References External links * Find a Grave Category:Cemeteries in Hudson County, New Jersey Category:History of Jersey City, New Jersey ","title":"Speer Cemetery"},{"id":"23137124","text":"Eriogonum ternatum is a species of wild buckwheat known by the common name ternate buckwheat.

Rear: Grand Stewards The United Grand Lodge of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory is the main governing body of Freemasonry within the Australian state of New South Wales that also wholly encloses the Australian Capital Territory containing the national capital city, Canberra. It originated from the union in 1888 of the earlier 1845 provincial Grand Lodge under the United Grand Lodge of England and other district and provincial Grand Lodges of the Grand Lodge of Ireland and the Grand Lodge of Scotland. Organisation The Grand Lodge is led by an elected Grand Master, assisted by a Deputy Grand Master and an Assistant Grand Master, with a Grand Team. The Grand Lodge is further organised into 4 Regions, each led by a Regional Grand Counsellor (RGC), which are in turn organised into various Districts, led by a District Grand Inspector of Workings (DGIW), comprising groups of lodges based on geography. Lodges meet in various buildings, ranging from individual lodge buildings to major city or urban centres, such as in Canberra. The Grand Secretary heads the administration of the Grand Lodge from the headquarters at 279 Castlereagh Street, Sydney, on the north-west side of the corner with Goulburn Street. History Freemasonry came to New South Wales with the regiments of the British Army soon after the First Fleet in 1788. A Military Lodge sitting under Warrant No.1780, by then having admitted a number of civilians to membership, became Sydney No.l, formed with 39 brethren on 13 April 1845, the first Wor. Master Bro. Richard McGuffin and his Officers, being installed by Bro. Alexander. No.l, operated in Sydney until its closure in 1968. The first Grand Lodge was opened in Sydney in 1845, Bro. Robert Barr being the first Grand Master, and Bro. Andrew Alexander, the Deputy Grand Master. Bro. Alexander was the Grand Master the following year. The institution grew and prospered; No.2 Lodge was opened in 1845, No.3, No.4, and No.5 (in Kiama on the New South Wales South Coast) in 1846, No.6 and No.8 in 1847, No.7 in 1850. The Grand Lodge of Ireland and the Grand Lodge of Scotland were also warranting lodges in New South Wales, and creating their own provincial Grand Lodges. On 16 August 1888, after considerable consultation, the Masters and Wardens of the one hundred and eighty-three lodges assembled, the articles of union were again adopted, and the \\" United Grand Lodge of New South Wales \\" declared to be duly constituted and established.Proceedings of the Grand lodge of free and accepted masons of the state of New York, Grand Lodge of New York, 1890, accessed 2009-06-08 The first Grand Master was Lord Carrington, Governor of New South Wales.

The first prototype was completed in 2001, the second - next year. The first two examples of the howitzer (prototypes) are fitted with turret systems supplied by BAE Systems. It was planned to complete the first squadron in 2008, but the program was delayed due to financial reasons, and only in 2008 Polish Army ordered the first introduction batch of the squadron module, completed in 2012. It covers eight guns (six new-built and two upgraded prototype vehicles), command vehicles (on a much modernized MTLB chassis), plus ammunition vehicles and repair vehicles for the armament and electronics, as well as the fire control system etc. In the introductory and series products original British guns were replaced by those supplied by Nexter. Trial firing of another gun supplied by the maker is realized every month until the end of the year (the third gun was tested on 10 August in presence of representatives of the Armament Inspectorate and the Head Office of the Missile and Artillery Force of the Air Forces). These are realized at the Dynamic Trial Center of the WITU (Military Technical Institute of Armament) in Stalowa Wola. The first firing of the third complete Krab (which has also received new elements of on-board electronics, developed by WB Electronics) was carried out on 29 July 2011. Concentration of fire was tested, among others.Pozytywne Wyniki Badań Działa Dla Kraba.

It was first discovered near Bewick, England by Johnston in 1832. It is distinguished by its large, hexamerous size and shedding of tentacles. The nematocysts of the anemone can have dangerous effects, including the rupturing of human blood cells. The deeplet sea anemone was observed to have a symbiotic relationship with shrimp, as they cluster around its base in both temperate and Northwest Atlantic waters.  Habitat  The anemone is found from depths of 20 m to 2000 m in the sublittoral zone. It is found in closed off marine areas attached to hard substances such as stones, rocks, and shells. Normally it is found in the North Atlantic to the Arctic Circle and North America. It has been found recently in Scottish sea lochs. It is commonly found in the bathyal zone of the Laurentian channel in the area between Anticosti Island and Newfoundland, including all of the Strait of Belle Isle except for the upper 50 meters near Newfoundland. Also, it is present on all British and Irish coasts, but is harder to find on southern coasts, and able to dominate the Beryl oil platform.  Characteristics  In 1860, Philip Henry Gosse expanded on Johnston’s initial discovery of the anemone in 1832 and reported its physical description as having a pillar-like column, a smooth disc and surface, and short and thick tentacles. Its stomach is able to extend and change shape. As part of the genus Bolocera, the anemone has a developed muscle ring as the base of each tentacle but its column doesn’t have an outer muscular layer. Bolocera tuediae usually ranges from a brown to dull pink color. It is normally smooth and soft and its height varies, but it can grow up to 30 cm wide and develop up to 200 tentacles. Occasionally, the disc can have signs of a dark pattern around the base of the tentacles, but is distinguished from other similar species since it doesn't have a colored pattern on its disc. The tentacles are hexamerous, as they are organized in groups of rings where the first group has six tentacles, the next has twelve, and the next has twenty- four rings, etc. Its column, where its body is located, is featureless. It is able to shed its tentacles by pinching them off, so it has a grooved base for this purpose. It is distinguished by its large size compared to other sea anemones. Although it is similar to the white-spotted rose anemone (Urticina eques), it is separated by the fact that it has no pattern on its disc, its tentacles are arranged in patterns of six instead of ten, and it doesn’t have warts on its column.  Reproduction  The deeplet sea anemones have their largest gonads (sex glands) in late winter. The females have pink, spherical eggs with a membrane, and are large compared to other anemones. When its nucleus is fertilized, it will make several daughter nuclei. Each nuclei will spread until they are evenly distributed. As the eggs mature they will begin to go through segmentation (becoming covered with rounded masses or segments). The egg will grow and a membrane will form before taking on a more spherical shape. Next, they will go through gastrulation, where they develop multiple layers. The wall of the blastula will flatten and sink downwards, and the egg will often flatten itself again, becoming the gastrula made up of three layers. Cilia first appear during the middle blastula stage, followed by eight membranes inside the body. About twenty-five days after the eggs have been shed, fixation will occur. The base will form the shape of a disc and grow, the mouth opens, the larva shorten, and finally the anemones become largely dormant.  Defense  The deeplet sea anemone has many types of nematocysts capable of rupturing human red blood cells and, as tested in a 1977 study, killing mice. The lethal dosefor mice is 0.6 mg of nematocyst venom for a 20 g mouse, but when the venom is suspended in water, 3 mg of venom is able to kill a 20 g mouse. Venom from both the cell membranes and tentacles alike have these effects, but venom from membranes causes cell death in skin, blistering, and can cause blood to coagulate. Deeplet sea anemones have two polypeptides that are able to paralyze crabs, BTTX I and BTTX 2. BTTX II can interfere with the inactivation and activation of sodium channelsin the muscle membrane of rats. It decreases the membrane potential in muscle fibers in the back of the leg as well as muscles extended by contraction. Overall, it has an effect on the membrane electrical properties of skeletal muscles while increasing the time at which the action potential is depolarized.

He retired in 1935 and died in 1961, aged 88. Early life Julius Bruche was born on 6 March 1873 in North Melbourne to German-born parents. His father was William Julius Maximilian Bruche—a corn merchant—while his mother was Elise Dorothea Henrietta Bruche (née Goetz). As a youth he attended Scotch College before progressing on to the University of Melbourne where he studied law. In 1898 he qualified as a barrister in the Supreme Court of Victoria, but made the decision to pursue a military career instead.Dennis 1995, p. 127. Military career In 1891 Bruche took a part- time commission in the 1st Battalion, Victorian Rifles, a militia unit, before transferring to the Permanent Military Forces in 1898. Initially he served as a lieutenant, but was promoted to captain in February 1899. During the early part of the Boer War he served on exchange with the British Army, attached to the 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards, before serving as quartermaster for the Australian Regiment and then adjutant of the Victorian Mounted Rifles contingent. After returning to Australia in late 1900, he returned to South Africa late in the war, serving with the 2nd Battalion, Australian Commonwealth Horse. After returning from South Africa he held a number of administrative and instructional appointments. In between these appointments Bruche was married to Dorothy Annette McFarland, whom he wed in Sydney on 12 April 1904, and with whom he subsequently had twin daughters. In 1906 he was promoted to major before undertaking another exchange positing with the British Army in 1910. This lasted for a year and on his return he was appointed as the Deputy Assistant Adjutant General in Tasmania. In July 1912 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel before being transferred to Queensland, where he eventually became the Assistant Adjutant General. At the start of the First World War, concerns about Bruche’s German heritage led to him not being accepted for overseas service in the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) until June 1916 when he was appointed to the staff of the AIF headquarters in London. Later he served on the staff of 5th Division in France as a temporary colonel where he worked closely with General John Monash. Monash is said to have thought highly of Bruche’s administrative skills, so highly in fact that following the end of hostilities he made Bruche director of the non-military employment scheme that was set up in England as part of the repatriation process to provide soldiers with civilian skills that they could use on their return to Australia. Following his return to Australia in December 1919 Bruche was confirmed as a substantive colonel in 1920, before achieving the rank of major general in 1923.Rowell 1979, pp. 462–463. He then held a number of senior positions including commandant of the New South Wales and Queensland military districts, adjutant general of the Australian forces, senior military representative for Australia in London and on the Imperial General Staff and commandant of the Royal Military College, Duntroon. In October 1931 he became Chief of the General Staff (CGS), taking over from Major General Walter Coxen.Dennis 1995, p. 128. His tenure was marked by the austerity of the economic downturn of the Great Depression, and the general malaise that crept into Australian strategic thinking at the time.Grey 2008, pp. 123–143. He retired in 1935 at the rank of major general, being replaced as CGS by Lieutenant General John Lavarack. Throughout his career Bruche received many honours including: the Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG), Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB), and Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). During the First World War he was also mentioned in despatches five times. Death Bruche died in Melbourne on 28 April 1961, at the age of 88. He was survived by his wife and one of their two daughters.

It features black-and-white photographs by Bob Carlos Clarke. It is partially autobiographical, and is considered to be the chef's first memoir. The book is cited today as having influenced the careers of several Michelin starred and celebrity chefs, and was described by one critic as \\"possibly the most influential recipe book of the last 20 years\\". Description Initially published in 1990, White Heat was part autobiography of chef Marco Pierre White and part cookbook, which portrays White's \\"bad boy\\" chef image. White was introduced by actress Lowri-Ann Richards to her friend Bob Carlos Clarke. Clarke photographed White for a Levi jeans advert and went on to create the images for White Heat. Speaking following Clarke's death in 2006, Marco Pierre White said, \\"He was like my prop. Without Bob there would never have been White Heat.\\" White Heat is credited with changing the image of chefs to sex symbols. The photographs showed White in and out of the workplace, including smoking in the kitchen and working with his team, including a young Gordon Ramsay. One of the photographs featured White with a dead baby shark, which was laid across his lap in Clarke's garden for the shot. Clarke's wife, Lindsay, later said in an interview that Marco went on to gut the shark there and then in the garden, \\"The stench was unbelievable. I was pregnant at the time and the odour haunted me.\\" Another photograph featured White nude with a side of piglet in his lap. One of Clarke's images of White was included in a set of ten donated to the National Portrait Gallery, London, in 2013. Reception John Lanchester, for The Observer magazine supplement Life in 2003, described the book as \\"gastroporn\\". Sue Gaisford, reviewing the book for The Independent, described it as a \\"Marco Pierre White fanzine-with-recipes\\" and an \\"ego-trip\\". In 2005 food critic Jay Rayner called White Heat \\"possibly the most influential recipe book of the last 20 years\\". Legacy White Heat is credited as being the first chef memoir, and has been cited as influencing the future careers of Michelin starred chefs, including Sat Bains and Tom Kerridge, and celebrity chefs Curtis Stone and Jean-Christophe Novelli. The New York Times published an article on 13 May 1998 describing White's career, using a passage from White Heat to say that the chef had a \\"well-publicized bout with drugs and alcohol\\". It published an apology to the chef regarding this statement later that year on 16 September, describing the passage it had used from the book as \\"ambiguous\\". The passage described White going on a drink and drugs \\"bender\\", something that White later denied in court during the libel case, saying that he did not proofread his books as he is dyslexic. White's first appearance on the television show Hell's Kitchen in 2007 caused the price of second-hand copies of his old cookbooks to spike. White Heat had been seen as a collector's item, but after the television show, the price increased to as much as £250 for a signed first edition. In 2008 it was recommended by television chef Michael Symon, writing for Women's Health, despite being out of print in America at the time. Arthur Potts Dawson described it as a \\"rock'n'roll cookbook\\" in an interview with The Independent in 2012.

In December 2010, the District administration reported that 239 pupils or 17% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 54% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010–11 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 Bristol Borough School District received a $$897,934 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011–12 and 2012–13 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010–11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The District must apply for this added funding. =Gifted education= Bristol Borough School District Administration reported that 22 or 1.71% of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days’ public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2011, the average teacher salary in Bristol Borough School District was $78,520 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers received was $19,248 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $97,768 which is among the highest in Pennsylvania. According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers’ total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation, including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security. In 2012, the Bristol Borough School Board and Teachers Union agreed to a new contract which included annual raises. Under the new five-year contract, teachers did not received a pay raise for 2 years. On year three they will get a 1 percent raise. Year four and year five they will receive 2% raise. In the second year, they will also get step increases, based on educational credits and years of service. The remainder of the three years they will get full step increases in addition to percentage increases.Gema Maria Duarte., Bristol teachers work with a new contract, Courier Times, April 12, 2013 In 2009, Bristol Borough School District reported employing 106 teachers and administrators with a median salary of $74,874 and a top salary of $129,000. The teacher's work day is 7.25 hours with 189 days in the contract year. Additionally, the teachers receive a defined benefit pension, taxpayer funded health insurance, professional development reimbursement, paid personal days, 10 paid sick days, and other benefits. As of 2007, Pennsylvania ranked in the top 10 states in average teacher salaries. When adjusted for cost of living Pennsylvania ranked fourth in the nation for teacher compensation.PA Delaware County Times, Teachers need to know enough is enough, April 20, 2010. Bristol Borough School District administrative costs per pupil in 2008 was $900.97 per pupil, which ranked 104th among Pennsylvania's 501 public school districts. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil.Fenton, Jacob., Pennsylvania School District Data: Will School Consolidation Save Money?, The Morning Call, February 2009 The Pennsylvania School Boards Association collects and maintains statistics on salaries of public school district employees in Pennsylvania. According to the association's report, the average salary for a superintendent, for the 2007–08 school year, was $122,165. Superintendents and administrators receive a benefit package commensurate with that offered to the district's teachers' union. According to PSBA, the median Superintendent salary rose to over $130,000 in 2011. In 2008, Bristol Borough School District Administration reported that per pupil spending was $$14,647 which ranked 74th among Pennsylvania's 501 school districts. In 2010, the District's per pupil spending had increased to $$15,067.85. Among the states, Pennsylvania's total per pupil revenue (including all sources) ranked 11th at $15,023 per student, in 2008–09. In 2007, the Pennsylvania per pupil total expenditures was $12,759. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that Pennsylvania spent $8,191 per pupil in school year 2000–01. Reserves In 2008, the District's Administrators reported a balance of zero in its unreserved-designated fund. The unreserved-undesignated fund balance was reported as $1,021,940. The District reported just $$261,418 in its unreserved-undesignated fund in 2010. Pennsylvania public school district reserve funds are divided into two categories – designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. By law the state limits the total unreserved-undesignated fund balance at 8% of the annual budget for school districts that have budgets over $19 million a year. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 In January 2011, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the District. The findings were reported to the School Board and the District's administration. Tuition Students who live in the Bristol Borough School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Bristol Borough School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the District's schools. The 2012 tuition rates are Elementary School – $9,517.92, High School – $12,015.72. Bristol Borough School District is funded by a combination of: LST Tax 0f $52, a property tax, a service tax of $5, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. Interest earnings on accounts also provide nontax income to the District. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the level of the individual's personal wealth. The average Pennsylvania public school teacher pension in 2011 exceeds $60,000 a year plus they receive federal Social Security benefits: both are free of Pennsylvania state income tax and local income tax which funds local public schools. =State basic education funding= For the 2012–13 school year, Bristol Borough School District received $6,016,675. The Governor's Executive Budget for 2012–2013 included $9.34 billion for kindergarten through 12th grade public education, including $5.4 billion in basic education funding, which was an increase of $49 million over the 2011–12 budget.

The highest increase in 2010–11 went to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County which received a 23.65% increase in state funding. The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where each district received at least the same amount as it received the prior school year, even when enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward Rendell and then Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. This was the second year of Governor Rendell's policy to fund some public school districts at a far greater rate than others. In the 2009–10 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 4.25% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $6,180,725 to Bristol Borough School District.

This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010–11, Bristol Borough School District applied for and received $238,193 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The District uses the funding to provide full-day kindergarten (since 2004) and for additional teacher training. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. Bristol Borough School District did not apply to participate in 2006–07 or in 2007–08. Bristol Borough School District received $77,187 in 2008–09.

Science It's Elementary grant Snyder-Girotti Elementary School successfully applied to participate and received a Science It's Elementary grant in 2008–09. It was the only school to participate in Bucks County. For the 2008–09 school year, the program was offered in 143 schools reaching 2,847 teachers and 66,973 students across Pennsylvania.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Science: It’s Elementary Grantees Students in 143 Schools Benefit from Intensive Science Curriculum, July 22, 2008 In 2007, the Pennsylvania Department of Education initiated an effort to improve science instruction in the Commonwealth's public elementary schools. Called Science: It's Elementary, the program is a hands on instruction approach for elementary science classes that develops problem-solving and critical thinking skills.Patricia Vathis Pennsylvania Department of Education, Grants and Subsidies Science: It’s Elementary, 2006 To encourage schools to adopt the program's standards aligned curriculum, the state provided a grant to cover the costs of materials and extensive mandatory teacher training.Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2010 – 2011 Science: It’s Elementary Application Guidelines, July 2010 Bristol Borough School District was required to develop a three-year implementation plan for the participating school. They had to appoint a district liaison who was paid $3000 by PDE to serve as the conduit of all information between the district and the Department and its agents along with submitting orders and distributing supplies to implementing teachers. For the 2006–07 state education budget, $10 million was allocated. The 2006–07 State Education Budget provided $635 million in new spending for pre-K through 12th grades for the 2006–07 school year. This marks an 8-percent increase over 2005–06 public school funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Governor Rendell Commends Teachers for Enhancing Science Education in Pennsylvania, August 10, 2006 The grant program was expanded to $14.5 million in the 2008–09 budget. The grant was discontinued in 2010 by Governor Rendell due to a massive state budget crisis. Education Assistance grant The state's EAP funding provides for the continuing support of tutoring services and other programs to address the academic needs of eligible students. Funds are available to eligible school districts and full-time career and technology centers (CTC) in which one or more schools have failed to meet at least one academic performance target, as provided for in Section 1512-C of the Pennsylvania Public School Code. In 2010–11 the Bristol Borough School District received $32,962. Other grants The District did not participate in: PreK Counts preschool funding, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Environmental Education annual grants, 2012 Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant, nor the federal 21st Century Learning grants. =Federal Stimulus grant= Bristol Borough School District received an extra $2,049,800 in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) – Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009–10 and 2010–2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like: acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. =School Improvement Grant= U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan announced in March 2012, that the first-year data suggest student achievement is improving at campuses that participated in the School Improvement grant program. He reported that at nearly 60 percent of SIG schools, more students are demonstrating proficiency in reading and math. Nearly a quarter of those schools reported math improvement in the double digits, and close to 20 percent of schools saw double-digit gains in reading.US Department of Education, Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan remarks – “Working in the Nation’s Lowest-Performing Schools: A Progress Report”, March 19, 2012 In the summer of 2011, Bristol Borough School District administration did not apply for School Improvement Grant funding, from the federal government (over $9.9 million available). The high school was eligible for funding due to chronic low achievement. The grant stipulates the funds be used for improving student achievement using one of four federally dictated strategies. The strategies are: transformation, turnaround, restart with new faculty and administration or closure of failing schools. The Pennsylvania Education Secretary awarded $66 million to reform Pennsylvania's lowest-achieving schools in August 2011. The funding was for three years. Race to the Top grant Bristol Borough School District officials did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided over one million dollars in additional federal funding to improve student academic achievement.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Race to the Top Webinar powerpoint for districts December 2009, December 9, 2009 Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. =Real estate taxes= Property tax rates in 2012–13 were set by the school board at 154.0000 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate – land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75–85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When a Pennsylvania public school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2011–12 – 154.000 mills. *2010–11 – 138.000 mills *2009–10 – 120.000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports, 2010 *2008–09 – 120.000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports 2008–09 Real Estate Mills, 2009 *2007–08 – 114.000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006–07 – 101.4000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005–06 – 88.7500 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by Bucks County residents amounts to about 4.68% of their yearly income. Bucks County ranked 109th out of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Tax-rates.org., The 2013 Tax Resource County Property Taxes 2012, 2012 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008–09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances – Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010–11, 2011 Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above their annual Index unless they either: allow voters to vote by referendum or they receive an exception from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The base index for the school year is published by the PDE in the fall of each year. Each individual school district's Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as local property values and the personal income of district residents. Originally, Act 1 or 2006 included 10 exceptions: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of 0.75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The School District Adjusted Index for the Bristol Borough School District 2006–2007 through 2011–2012. *2006–07 – 5.2%, Base 3.9% *2007–08 – 4.6%, Base 3.4% *2008–09 – 5.9%, Base 4.4% *2009–10 – 5.3%, Base 4.1% *2010–11 – 3.8%, Base 2.9% *2011–12 – 1.8%, Base 1.4% *2012–13 – 2.2%, Base 1.7% Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2012–2013 School District Adjusted Index, May 2011 *2013–14 – 2.2%, Base 1.7% Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2013–2014 School District Adjusted Index, May 2012 For the 2013–14 budget year, Bristol Borough School Board applied for two exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index: School Construction Grandfathered Debt and the teachers' pensions. For 2013–2014, 311 Pennsylvania public school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 171 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 89 school districts received approval to exceed the Index in full while others received a partial approval of their request. For special education costs, 75 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit. For the exception for pension costs, 169 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. Eleven districts received an approval for grandfathered construction debts.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012–2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2012–13 budget year, Bristol Borough School Board applied for all 3 exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index: School Construction Grandfathered Debt, special education costs and for the teachers' pensions. For 2012–2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012–2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011–12 school year, the Bristol Borough School Board applied for four (4) exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index: School Construction Grandfathered Debt, Maintenance of Local Tax Revenue, Special Education costs and the teachers' pensions. Each year, the School Board has the option of adopting either: 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011–2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. Bristol Borough School Board applied for two (2) exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budget in 2011: School Construction Grandfathered Debt and Maintenance of Local Tax Revenue. For the 2009–10 school budget, the board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Index. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. Property tax relief In 2012, Bristol Borough School District approved homestead residents received $257 for 1,935 homesteads/farmsteads. This was the highest relief awarded to a Bucks County school district. The amount of property tax relief each public school district receives is announced by the PDE in May each year. It is dependent on the amount of tax revenue collected on the casino slots in the previous year. In 2010, property tax relief for approved residents of Bristol Borough School District was set at $269.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Tax Relief per Homestead, May 1, 2010 The highest property tax relief, among Pennsylvania school districts, went to the homesteads of Chester Upland School District of Delaware County which received $632 per approved homestead in 2010. Chester-Upland School District has consistently been the top recipient since the programs inception.Tax Relief per Homestead 2009, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report, May 1, 2009 The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption.Pennsylvania Auditor General Office, Special Report Pennsylvania Property Tax Relief, February 23, 2010. In Pennsylvania, the homestead exclusion reduces the assessed values of homestead properties, reducing the property tax on these homes. The homestead exclusion allows homeowners real property tax relief of up to one half of the median assessed value of homesteads in the taxing jurisdiction (county, school district, city, borough, or township). Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently people who have an income of substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This tax rebate can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. In 2012, Pennsylvania Secretary of the Treasury reported issuing more than half a million property tax rebates totaling $238 million.Elias, Joe., Pennsylvania Treasury Department to issue $238 million in property tax rebates, The Harrisburg Patriot-News, June 30, 2012 The program is funded by the Pennsylvania Lottery. Property tax rebates are increased by an additional 50 percent for senior households in the state, so long as those households have incomes under $30,000 and pay more than 15% of their income in property taxes.Pennsylvania Department of Revenue., Property Tax/Rent Rebate Program, June 2012 Extracurriculars Bristol Borough School District offers a variety of clubs, activities interscholastic sports.

The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 – 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Bristol Borough School District offers a free school breakfast and free or reduced-price lunch to low-income children. The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 References Category:School districts in Bucks County, Pennsylvania ","title":"Bristol Borough School District"},{"id":"23137505","text":"Charles Edward Eaton (June 25, 1916 – March 23, 2006) was an American poet and professor.

The band has been called Sweden's first Hard rock/heavy metal band.https://www.svt.se/sa-javla- metal/november-sveriges-forsta-hardrockband/ History They were known to play \\"as fast as they could\\" and with lots of guitar solos, but their style has not much in common with Speed Metal. Their music was instead partly inspired by American acid rock, but also heavy and blues based like a mixture of some early Uriah Heep hits like \\"Bird of Prey\\" and \\"Easy Livin\\", Cream and Led Zeppelin . November started in 1968 at Tegelhögen, a youth club in Vällingby (a Stockholm suburb). At this club Christer Stålbrandt and Björn Inge played together with two friends as The Imps. After a few months Stålbrandt left the group to form a new group called Train. Björn Inge joined shortly after. Train also included Snowy White on guitar. In the early autumn of 1969 Snowy decided to return to his native homeland, England, and Richard Rolf joined as their new guitarist. On 1 November 1969 they supported Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac at the Que-Club in Gothenburg, and therefore they decided to call themselves November. November was one of the first Swedish rock bands with Swedish lyrics. Most of the lyrics were written by Stålbrandt, influenced by the 60's flower power movement. Despite the Swedish lyrics, November was quite popular in England. While touring in England the lyrics was often translated to English, the crowd, however, insisted on the band performing with Swedish lyrics. November recorded three albums which all reached high places on the Swedish charts. After their last concert at club Domino on New Year's Eve 1972 the band split up and had up until 2007, only performed once, namely during the release party for the CD November-Live 1993 (recorded on tour in 1971) on 30 Nov 1993. Christer Stålbrandt moved on starting the group Saga, Björn Inge joined jazz rockers Energy, and Richard Rolf was one of the forming members of Bash and later on joined Nature. On 27 January 2007, they performed at the Mellotronen 20th anniversary party. More gigs have been played. In Sweden, November is considered to be one of the most legendary bands within a smaller circle of people from age 40, and not only in their home city Greater Stockholm. = November and \\"Progg\\" = In the early 1970s most of the Swedish rock bands were in media put together to what is known as progressive rock, which very soon became \\"Progg\\". The times, with demonstrations against the American involvement in Vietnam, wildcat strikes (with the best example in the northern minefields in 1969 http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=1602&artikel;=3244414https://www.marxists.org/svenska/tidskrifter/ri/ri69-2.html and the harbour workers in Gothenburg,https://www.marxists.org/svenska/tidskrifter/ri/ri69-2.html who struck both their employers and against the common working class trade union LO (or Landsorganisationen which translates to \\"the Land's Organisation\\" or \\"the Country's Organisation\\") after Marxistic and revolutionary agitation. Close to a dozen of Communist parties participated in the general elections 1968, 1970 and 1973. All tried to be \\"more or better communists\\" than all the others (Only the old VPK received enough votes for parliamentary seats though). During this times, with a very loud (but not equally large) group of red agitators, who at daily basis through radio and television reached in particular the Swedish youth. And it more or less was declared that all \\"Progg-music\\" was political and red (\\"standing on the working class' side\\"), while ABBA and dance music bands soon became the \\"commercial exception\\". But in reality November was far from all bands political at all, and had not asked to be put in the \\"progg-category\\" at all. November's music is instead related to heavy instrumental rock, and bands like Cream, early Uriah Heep and Mountain. November, like a few other bands and solo-artists was put in the \\"progg-category\\" by media, for no reason at all. Still today are November confused with the red \\"progg\\"-music, but they certainly never played political music. Nor did they attempt to deceive the Swedish youth into becoming communists of any kind. November was just very loosely connected with the far wider anti Vietnam war hippies movement and liked to play hard rock fast. Discography =Studio albums= * En ny tid är här...

She also served in the Soviet Navy as EK-21 and in the Colombian National Armada as ARC Almirante Brión (F 14). Construction and commissioning Burlington originally was authorized as a patrol gunboat with the hull number PG-159, but she was redesignated as a patrol frigate with the hull number PF-51 on 15 April 1943. She was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract as Maritime Commission Type T. S2-S2-AQ1 Hull 1462 on 19 October 1943 at the Consolidated Steel Corporation shipyard in Wilmington, California. She was launched on 7 December 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Florence E. Conrad (wife of Max Conrad, the mayor of Burlington), acquired from the Maritime Commission by the U.S. Navy on 31 March 1944, and commissioned on 3 April 1944, with a United States Coast Guard crew and with Lieutenant Commander Edgar V. Carlson, USCG, in command. Service history =U.S. Navy, World War II, 1944-1945= Following shakedown and post-shakedown shipyard availability, Burlington got underway from San Pedro, California, on 1 August 1944. Her first assignment took her to Espiritu Santo, where she performed patrol and escort duties in support of operations in western New Guinea. Then, from 16 October 1944 to 18 November 1944, she escorted convoys between New Guinea and the Philippine Islands in support of the invasion of Leyte. She departed the war zone on 3 December 1944 to return to California and arrived at San Francisco, California, on 25 December 1944 for repairs. After repairs and preparations for cold-weather operations, Burlington departed San Francisco on 18 February 1945 for five months of patrol and escort duty in the Aleutian Islands. Selected for transfer to the Soviet Navy in Project Hula - a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy at Cold Bay, Alaska, in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against Japan - Burlington received orders early in the summer of 1945 to proceed to Tacoma, Washington, for repairs and alterations in preparation for her transfer. After undergoing repairs between 18 July 1945 and 2 August 1945, she headed north on 8 August 1945 for Cold Bay, where she soon began training her new Soviet crew.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet- American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 39. =Soviet Navy, 1945–1949= Following the completion of training for her Soviet crew, Burlington was decommissioned on 26 August 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend- Lease immediately along with her sister ships , , , , and . Commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, Burlington was designated as a storozhevoi korabl (\\"escort ship\\") and renamed EK-21 in Soviet service. She soon departed Cold Bay bound for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union, where she served as a patrol vessel in the Soviet Far East. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II. On 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned, EK-21 among them. Negotiations for the return of the ships were protracted, but on 14 November 1949 the Soviet Union finally returned EK-21 to the U.S. Navy at Yokosuka, Japan.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 37-38, 39. =U.S. Navy, Korean War, 1951-1952= Reverting to her original name, Burlington remained inactive in the Pacific Reserve Fleet at Yokosuka until after the Korean War broke out on 25 June 1950. She was then overhauled and recommissioned on 5 January 1951 at Yokosuka. After shakedown and training exercises in the Yokosuka area, Burlington deployed to the waters off Korea. From 14 March 1951 to 24 April 1951, she operated in Wonsan Harbor and off Songjin, bombarding shore targets, serving as harbor entrance control vessel, and performing patrol and escort duties. After a brief repair period in Sasebo Navy Yard, Sasebo, Japan, Burlington returned to the combat zone and from 11 May 1951 to 8 June 1951 carried out shore bombardment and patrol duties from Wonsan to Chongjin. During the summer of 1951, she served with Task Force 92 and Task Force 77, performing escort duty in the underway replenishment area off the east coast of Korea. Burlington entered Yokosuka Navy Yard for overhaul late in September 1951 and returned to escort duty in Korean waters on 5 December 1951. Until early July 1952, she continued combat operations, periodically returning to Sasebo for repairs and training. Burlington departed Sasebo on 3 July 1952 bound for the Philippine Islands, where she participated in exercises off the west coast of Luzon and cruised as far south as Davao on Mindanao. She departed Manila Bay on 3 September 1952 to return to Yokosuka, where she was decommissioned on 15 September 1952. Her name was stricken from the Navy List on 28 May 1953. =Colombian Navy, 1953-1968= The United States sold Burlington to the government of Colombia on 26 June 1953. She operated with the Colombian Navy under the name ARC Almirante Brión (F 14). Almirante Brión was scrapped in 1968. Honors and awards The U.S. Navy awarded Burlington two battle stars for her World War II service and five battle stars for her Korean War service.

It is located on the old Wheat Road, a gravel road (accessible from Blair Road (SR 327)) that follows the historical roadbed of a one-time local thoroughfare. The church building and the road are owned and maintained by the U.S. Department of Energy.Oak Ridge sprouted where Wheat once thrived, Knoxville News Sentinel, 2007-06-10. Accessed 2009-06-10. Motorized travel on the road is limited to government vehicles, but the road is open to pedestrians and bicycles as a public greenway trail. George Jones Memorial Baptist Church was one of six Oak Ridge properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. This listing reflects its significance as the only existing physical remnant of the Wheat community, a physical representation of rural life in the area in the 19th century and the early decades of the 20th century, and an example of vernacular church architecture.

Minesweeping in these areas began in December 1945 and was completed in August 1948. One ship, the Bathurst class corvette HMAS Warrnambool, was sunk during these operations. History During World War II both the Allies and Japanese laid mines in Australian and New Guinean waters. The RAN's minelayer, HMAS Bungaree, laid almost 10,000 mines in Australian waters alone, and further mines were laid around Australian ports. Following the war Australia was legally responsible for clearing mines from its territorial waters as part of an international minesweeping effort coordinated by the Mine Clearance Board in London.Fogarty (1998), p. 123 The RAN's 20th Minesweeping Flotilla was assigned the task of sweeping Australian waters for mines. The flotilla was based at Cairns, Queensland and was commanded from the sloop HMAS Swan. Clearance operations began in December 1945, and were generally conducted by Bathurst class corvettes. Ships involved included HMAS Swan, Ararat, Cowra, Deloraine, Echuca, Katoomba, Lithgow, Mildura and Warrnambool as well as harbour defence motor launches 1323, 1328, 1329 and general purpose vessels 960 and 963.Fogarty (1998), pp. 123–124 Over 1,200 sailors were involved in the operation. Minesweeping was arduous and dangerous and the sailors involved were granted danger money of 6d per day.Fogarty (1998), p. 124 On 13 September 1947 Warrnambool struck a mine off North Queensland which had been laid by Bungaree in November 1943 and sank shortly afterwards with four sailors killed and another 25 wounded. Warrnambool is the only RAN warship to have ever been sunk by a mine.Cooper (2006), p. 157 The 20th Minesweeping Flotilla completed its task in August 1948. By this time 1,816 mines had been swept. Eleven officers and sailors were recommended for honours and awards for their role in the operation, with all recommendations being fully endorsed by Vice Admiral John Collins, the First Naval Member, Australian Commonwealth Naval Board. Some of the awards were delayed and others never granted, however, due to disagreements between the RAN and the Government over whether post-war minesweeping constituted 'operational' service.Fogarty (1998), pp. 124–125 See also * Clearance Diving Branch (RAN) Notes References minesweeping after World War II minesweeping after World War II Category:Aftermath of World War II in Australia ","title":"Royal Australian Navy minesweeping after World War II"},{"id":"23137776","text":"America is a ghost town in southeastern McCurtain County, Oklahoma, United States. It was located 7 miles southeast of Haworth. The town was named after America Stewart, wife of Tom Stewart, a local resident. History America grew around a sawmill built by William Spencer and his three brothers in 1907. The Spencer family built 40 houses to lease to sawmill workers, and by 1910 there were 200 people living in America. In 1911, after all the timber had been cut, Spencer opened a cotton gin and general store and became a cotton buyer. Cotton grown on the cleared land was shipped out by the Arkansas and Choctaw Railway (a predecessor of the Frisco) that ran through the town. After cotton production declined in the 1920s, most residents moved out. The cotton gin closed in 1933, around the time when the Great Depression was at its worst. Buck and Blanche Barrow, associates of Bonnie & Clyde were married in America on July 3, 1931. The post office, established since July 24, 1903, was disestablished on February 15, 1944. The general store closed the next year, completing the decline. Today, part of the former townsite of America is in the Ouachita National Forest. Only two old houses and a railroad marker remain.

Bradley was responsible for moving the federal government's post office from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to the new capital at Washington, D.C., hosting the national post office in his own home for a period. The continuity brought by Bradley's long employment during the tenure of five different United States postmasters general helped establish the budding postal service as a reliable provider; Bradley drew detailed and innovative postal route maps which contributed significantly to the office's efficiency. Bradley's original work of 1796 was one of the first comprehensive maps of the United States as it existed, which \\"represented the first clear cartographic break in European- dominated map making and introduced a new, more distinctly American style of cartography to the United States.\\"Ristow, Walter W. (1985). American maps and mapmakers - Commercial Cartography in the nineteenth century quoted in Early life Born in Litchfield, Connecticut, Abraham Bradley was the fourth consecutive scion of the colonial family established by early Guilford, Connecticut, pioneer Stephen Bradley to bear the surname Abraham. Abraham Bradley's father Abraham was himself a Yale College graduate who listed his various employments: \\"... a surveyor of land, master of a vessel, selectman, town treasurer, representative in the state legislature, justice of the peace, a zealous Whig, captain in the Revolutionary War, judge of the court, town clerk, and something of a scribbler in prose and verse.\\", p. 124 The son Abraham Bradley showed promise as a student and graduated from the celebrated law school run by Litchfield attorney Tapping Reeve. Tapping Reeve's Law School Postal career Bradley moved to the Wyoming Valley of frontier Pennsylvania in 1788 and established himself in private law practice. While briefly serving as a county judge in Wilkes-Barre, he made the acquaintance of local judge Timothy Pickering. Bradley accompanied him as a personal clerk when Pickering was appointed postmaster general by President George Washington and moved to Philadelphia in 1791. Bradley was described by a contemporary as \\"an unassuming man, modest and retiring almost to diffidence, yet a lawyer of competent learning, with a clear and discriminating mind, and an industry that knew no relaxation when there was a duty to perform ...\\"Bradley, The Bradley Family ..., p. 130 =Philadelphia= As one of his many responsibilities as clerk to the postmaster general, Bradley began to compile information for a complete postal service map, including routes, stations, and distances between each. Handicapped by his lack of training in the fields of topography and cartography, Bradley utilized cartographic knowledge imparted in earlier maps by Robert Erskine and Thomas Hutchins. When Postmaster General Pickering was succeeded by Joseph Habersham in 1795, Bradley's postal route maps and voluminous knowledge of the department made him an irreplaceable figure. Bradley's first postal road map of 1796 Map of 1796 In September 1796 Bradley published the first combined map of the post office stations, routes, and distances between. The map included a remarkable and innovative table that indicated times and days of the week to expect mail at various important postal coach stops along the primary eastern route. By this chart it could be determined that a letter posted in northernmost station at Brewer, Maine, could be expected to reach St. Marys, Georgia, in six weeks plus four days, 46 days of travel. Bradley spent much of his career improving, expanding, and refining U.S. postal maps during the rapid westward expansion of America in the early 19th century. Appointed assistant postmaster general by Habersham in 1799, he would serve in the office until 1828. =Washington, D.C.= In 1800, the seat of U.S. government was transferred from urban Philadelphia to the newly surveyed, mostly rural District of Columbia. Under Habersham, Bradley was assigned the task of moving the General Post Office Department files and furniture to a location in the nation's new capital.Bradley, The Bradley Family ..., p. 131 Bradley acquired a three-story house at the northeast corner of 9th and E streets NW, installed his family in the top floor, Habersham's and his own offices on the second story, and the clerks' offices on the ground level.Bradley, The Bradley Family ..., p. 132 Bradley found property rents and prices in Washington, D.C., unnecessarily high, roughly 500 houses scattered over a ten square mile tract, but believed the scale of the enterprise guaranteed the new capital's success. Bradley invited his brother, Wilkes-Barre physician Phineas Bradley, to join him in bringing his family to the budding village, soon to be a thriving seat of government; Phineas became one of Washington's first town councilmen. In 1802, Bradley and his wife Hannah had a son they would name Joseph Habersham Bradley after the Georgia postmaster and family friend. Bradley's U.S. postal route map of 1804 Map of 1804 As a Federalist, Bradley desired the re-election of John Adams in 1800;, p. 71 the new president, Thomas Jefferson, appointed Gideon Granger to the office of postmaster general. Granger kept the sober and reliable Bradley as his assistant. By the time of the purchase of Louisiana in 1803, the old postal road map was vastly outdated, and with the assistance of British cartographer Aaron Arrowsmith, Bradley prepared a new map, published in 1804. The 1804 map, produced in color, reflected the enormous changes the service and the country had undergone in the eight years between the two maps' creation. The Ohio Country and the Louisiana and Mississippi territories were well marked, and the postal routes of the new states of Kentucky and Tennessee fully developed. Like the original 1796 version, copies of this map were printed and distributed to be displayed in every large post office in the United States. Bradley continued to create maps during Postmaster General Granger's tenure, publishing a significant revision in 1810, but the War of 1812 made reliable mail delivery a much more hazardous enterprise. Return J. Meigs Jr., former governor of Ohio, was appointed to replace the retiring Granger in March 1814; again the incoming postmaster general kept the first assistant. As the wartime threat to Washington, D.C., grew, Bradley began looking for a farm away from the city where he and his wife could raise their children; in 1814 Bradley acquired a farm in Montgomery County, Maryland near the tiny community of Chevy Chase. During the burning of Washington in 1814, many of the postal records and a few public officials were transferred for safety to the Bradley farmhouse, north of the White House.Bradley, The Bradley Family ..., p. 133 Bradley's 1825 postal route map Map of 1825 In 1823, Meigs was in ill health, and was replaced by John McLean, also from Ohio. McLean, who was later to become an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, proved an industrious and creative postmaster general. McLean, like his predecessors, kept Bradley as his chief assistant. Bradley and his brother Dr. Phineas Bradley managed an office of thirty postal clerks and serviced several thousand local post offices. By 1825, the map Bradley had assembled included postal routes in the newly acquired states of Arkansas, Illinois, and Missouri, while still providing accurate cartographic information on areas such as Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin territories. The completed map measured roughly four feet high and five feet wide, and included an inset map depicting the known extent of the North American continent. In the election of 1828, Bradley and his brother supported the incumbent president, John Quincy Adams, but when Andrew Jackson was elected instead, Jackson partisans called for the ouster of Bradley. Jackson seems to have viewed the Bradley brothers as being corrupted by their high government salaries and their unique positions to decide the winners of lucrative mail contracts. First Abraham, then brother Phineas were removed from their positions in 1829, months after Jackson's inauguration. Legacy After his removal, Bradley made no attempt to defend himself from partisan attack, but he did make several public communications pointing out what were in his view defective actions by the new administration in regards to postal service. Bradley became for a time secretary of the Franklin Insurance Company. When Abraham Bradley died in his home in Washington, D.C., May 7, 1838, he left eight children, including lawyer Joseph H. Bradley, best known for his successful defense of John Surratt, accused of attempting to assassinate Abraham Lincoln. The younger Bradley inherited the Chevy Chase farm and himself had a namesake son, also a Washington, D.C., attorney who assisted the Surratt defense team. Bradley's service to the country as assistant postmaster general is regarded as influential. Bradley's postal routes and schedules, enforced rigidly over a thirty-year period, gave the Post Office Department a rapid and reliable engine for delivering information across vast distances, instilling in citizens the importance of the connectedness they shared with their distant neighbors. The numerous maps Bradley published, while later discarded and redrawn by the new Jackson administration, created in their time a sense of the immensity of American territory.

Harrison’s rasping, yet soulfully blue, voice is perfect for Night Time, Your Good Thing Is About To End and I’ve Got Dreams To Remember. It’s an album of warm surprise for those who recall when Harrison was dubbed ‘the white Ray Charles’ (he really gets his hand into the glove of the master’s Drown In My Own Tears).

Collins wrote short stories, fiction, poetry, a radio play, and a memoir of his childhood in Sydney. Life Alan Collins was one of a small group of Jewish writers of his generation who were born in Australia. He wrote extensively about the Anglo-Jewish community and his work reflects their struggles to survive in two disparate, and sometimes hostile, worlds. Collins was unusual in that his family had been in Australia for generations. Both parents emanated from Western, rather than Eastern, European backgrounds. The Collins side derives from the Van Kollum family who were Amsterdam printers in the 17th century. One branch moved to London and, in the 1840s, Mark and Lydia Collins emigrated with their three sons to Sydney. Alan Collins was their great-great-grandson. Alva Davis was his mother and a branch of the Davis family – the Cortissos line – can be traced back to Barcelona at the time of the Spanish Inquisition in the 15th century. There is a young convict in the Davis tree, Samuel Davis, who was transported to Sydney in 1831. Both families must have moved to England in the late 18th century and would have left the London of Charles Dickens to seek a better life in Australia.Reference 1Reference 2 Author Judah Waten said in his introduction to Troubles (1983) (a critically acclaimed collection of 21 short stories), that \\"Alan Collins ... has recorded movingly, the lives of Jews without money [without being] cynical or misanthropic\\". Collins' mother died the day she gave birth to him in Sydney. Relatives were unable or unwilling to care for him, and he was sent to a number of children's homes until he was returned to his father, who subsequently remarried. The archetypal cruel stepmother ill-treated the boy to such a degree that a magistrate ordered that he be sent to the Isabella Lazarus Home that had been established to accommodate Jewish refugee children. Collins' appalling childhood is described graphically in his confronting yet surprisingly funny memoir Alva's Boy. He reconstructs his early life in the Scarba Baby Home and the Ashfield Infants Home. His chaotic life as an urchin on the streets of Bondi is vividly recalled, as is the description of the social life of working-class Jews at the end of the Great Depression and the beginning of World War II. The novel The Boys from Bondi is based on his time in the Isabella Lazarus Home. It is here that the meeting of the two Jewish cultures – the 'reffos' and the 'anglos' – is so graphically described. When he was 14, Alan was sent out into the world as an apprentice printer, living on lowly wages in crude rooming houses – and worse followed when he left to work in what he succinctly described as the 'inferno' of a glass factory. He had a talent for writing and, after working at Nock and Kirby (a hardware store) in their advertising department, he joined the Sydney Sun as a young reporter, and later became editor of the Sydney Jewish News. He gave himself an education by reading in public libraries and through second-hand books. In 1953, he left Sydney for Melbourne, where he became advertising manager for Rockmans Stores. Like many young Australians in the 1950s, he travelled overseas. He met and married Rosaline Fox in London in 1957 and they returned to Melbourne where he resumed work at Rockmans. Home was a rented flat in the beach-side suburb Elwood, where their eldest son, Daniel, was born. With the dream of having a real home for the first time in his life, he took the family to the raw outer-Melbourne suburb of Box Hill, where his sons Peter and Toby were born, and where he and Ros later fostered a young boy named John from a war-torn background. Collins worked in advertising agencies as a copywriter and then formed his own business, Collins Advertising, in a home-made office he built in his garden. In the short story The Value of a Nail (Meanjin, 1984), Collins eulogised that great Australian institution the hardware store, and in real life he gained creative pleasure from woodworking, establishing the 'Toby Toys' range for preschool children. He wrote articles and short stories for magazines and newspapers, many of which are published in anthologies, and a radio play called Shabbatai!, which is an irreverent take on a bizarre character in Jewish history. A prize-winning short story, The Balconies, provided the impetus for The Boys from Bondi, published by the University of Queensland Press in 1987. But readers wanted to know what happened next. The sequel, Going Home, was published in 1993, and Joshua (1995) completed the trilogy. The three titles were published in 2001 as the single-volume A Promised Land? The book was described as one of the significant family sagas of Australian youth. Collins chose the title to reflect the complex feelings his central characters have towards Australia and Israel. The sea, beach and sun were always the restorative elements in his life. As a neglected child, the beach had been his haven from the often confusing world around him. In Melbourne, he and Ros returned to Elwood for their last 20 years together with their family and another of his great pleasures, sailing. In 1999, they became members of the newly formed Kehilat Nitzan congregation, founded on the egalitarian principles of Conservative Judaism (Masorti). He also became an enthusiastic student at the Florence Melton Adult Education School where he attended courses in Jewish history, philosophy, literature, and culture. He considered himself a secular Jew but also wrote: > Am I a Jewish fiction writer or a writer of Jewish fiction? They are, for > me, one and indivisible – without my sense of Jewish history, I would not be > a writer… I believe, too, that my writing….has its genesis in our Australian > ethos; it would be most peculiar if it did not… It is the Australian–Jewish > environment that takes priority and provides the parameters for my work… Collins is outlived by his wife Ros; sons Daniel, Peter and Toby; daughter-in- law Rhonda; grandsons Joshua, Eli and Isaac; and foster son John.

Excluding a cover of \\"Hey Joe\\", all songs on the album were written by Kennedy. This is the first album he has written and recorded in his native Northern Ireland. This album features songs that were inspired by Kennedy's childhood memories of growing up with the influence of the popular American music rock icons Elvis Presley and Jimi Hendrix and the country music of Hank Williams. The songs also relate to 1960s American political figures: John F. Kennedy and to events: the 1969 moon landing and with Kennedy's childhood obsession with the American Dream. Although the worldwide release was August 3, 2009, the album was released in Northern Ireland on July 4, 2009, with Kennedy's appearance at the Black Box in Belfast. Henry McCullough, the only Irishman to play at the Woodstock Festival, plays guitar on Kennedy's rendition of the Hendrix classic, \\"Hey Joe\\". Kennedy's wife, singer-songwriter Brenda Kennedy, performs as backing vocalist on the album. Songs Kennedy's inspiration for most of the songs on the album came forty years ago when the American astronauts on Apollo 11 landed on the moon on July 20, 1969, when Kennedy was a seven-year-old boy living in Belfast. A month later, Jimi Hendrix's appearance as the final act at the Woodstock Festival with a performance of \\"Hey Joe\\" served as further inspiration. The opening song on the album, \\"America\\", reflects on Kennedy's childhood memories dreaming of all things American and when cowboys and the astronauts of the Apollo 11 spacecraft were his heroes. The Skinny comments that \\"Album opener America is a sentimental look across the ocean with a slow and smooth acoustic-driven beat with laid back vocals that unsurprisingly declare, ‘All I want to do/Is to be like you’. \\"Cold War Country Blues\\" namechecks more of Kennedy's boyhood heroes, Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, John F. Kennedy and Apollo 8 astronaut Jim Lovell. Critic Nic Oliver calls the song, \\"pure Hank Williams honky-tonk, all toe-tapping melody and acoustic guitar\\". The song \\"Brave Captain\\" is dedicated to the Apollo 8 crew and on \\"The Heart of Universal Love\\", Kennedy imagines the earth as seen from the view of an astronaut standing on the moon and looking up at the illuminated planet in the darkness of space. \\"The Ballad of Neil Armstrong\\" celebrates Apollo 11's mission commander Neil Armstrong and the song \\"Irish Moon\\" is Kennedy's ode to another of the three astronauts, Michael Collins, who piloted the spacecraft as the other two astronauts landed on the moon. \\"The Blue One\\" is named for the Earth's image as seen on a photo taken by Voyager 1. Promotion A video of \\"Hey Joe\\" is a feature on YouTube videos at Kennedy's Official Films: . This song was previously best known as the debut single by The Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1966. Kennedy's 2009 cover was reviewed and given a four and one-half star rating by Leeds Music Scene with the reviewer commenting on Kennedy's cover: \\"While some of the lead guitar parts are very 'Hendrix-esque' the overall feel of the song is lot more uplifting than well known predecessor. Kennedy performed on the Acoustic Stage at the Glastonbury Festival on June 27, 2009, featuring songs from the album, with the official launching in Northern Ireland on July 4, 2009, with Bap Kennedy and his band's appearance at the Black Box in Belfast. Kennedy will appear on the Today with Derek Davis radio show on July 26, 2009, on RTÉ Radio 1. As a promotion before the album's release, Kennedy's website offered a free download of the title track, \\"Howl On\\". Critical response Howl On has been well received by music critics with mostly favourable reviews. MusicOMH calls the album \\"another object lesson in economic songwriting and solid musicianship.\\" Hot Press rated it four stars and summarizes the album: \\"Howl On is a lovingly-crafted set of tunes – one giant leap for a talented Belfast man.\\" The LIst also rated it four stars and refers to the album as \\"his best so far\\".

Muḥammad Abu 'l-Faras̲h̲ b. al-Jawzī, often referred to as Ibn al-Jawzī (Arabic: ابن الجوزي, Ibn al-Jawzī; ca. 1116 – 16 June 1201) for short, or reverentially as Imam Ibn al-Jawzī by some Sunni Muslims, was an Arab Muslim jurisconsult, preacher, orator, heresiographer, traditionist, historian, judge, hagiographer, and philologist who played an instrumental role in propagating the Hanbali school of orthodox Sunni jurisprudence in his native Baghdad during the twelfth-century. During \\"a life of great intellectual, religious and political activity,\\" Ibn al-Jawzi came to be widely admired by his fellow Hanbalis for the tireless role he played in ensuring that that particular school – historically, the smallest of the four principal Sunni schools of law – enjoy the same level of \\"prestige\\" often bestowed by rulers on the Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanafi rites. Belonging to a wealthy family, which descended from Abu Bakr,Ibn al-Jawzi, Sincere Counsel to the Seekers of Sacred Knowledge, Daar Us-Sunnah Publications Birmingham (2011), p. 88 Ibn al-Jawzi received a \\"very thorough education\\" during his adolescent years, and was fortunate to train under some of that era's most renowned Baghdadi scholars, including Ibn al-Zāg̲h̲ūnī (d. 1133), Abū Bakr al- Dīnawarī (d. 1137-8), Sayyid Razzāq Alī Jīlānī (d. 1208), and Abū Manṣūr al- Jawālīkī (d. 1144-5).Ibn Rajab, Dhayl ʿalā Ṭabaqāt al-ḥanābila, Cairo 1372/1953, i, 401 Although Ibn al-Jawzi's scholarly career continued to blossom over the next few years, he became most famous during the reign of al- Mustadi (d. 1180), the thirty-third caliph of the Abbasid Caliphate, whose support for Hanbalism allowed Ibn al-Jawzi to effectively become \\"one of the most influential persons\\" in Baghdad, due to the caliph's approval of Ibn al- Jawzi's public sermonizing to huge crowds in both pastoral and urban areas throughout Baghdad. In the vast majority of the public sermons delivered during al-Mustadi's reign, Ibn al-Jawzi often presented a stanch defense of the prophet Muhammad's example, and vigorously criticized all those whom he considered to be schismatics in the faith. At the same time, Ibn al-Jawzi's reputation as a scholar continued to grow due to the substantial role he played in managing many of the most important universities in the area, as well as on account of the sheer number of works he wrote during this period. As regards the latter point, it is important to note that part of Ibn al- Jawzi's legacy rests on his reputation for having been \\"one of the most prolific writers\\" of all time, with later scholars like Ibn Taymīyyah (d. 1328) studying over a thousand works written by Ibn al-Jawzi during their years of training. As scholars have noted, Ibn al-Jawzi's prodigious corpus, \\"varying in length\\" as it does, touches upon virtually \\"all the great disciplines\\" of classical Islamic study. Life Ibn al-Jawzi was born between 507–12 H./1113-19 CE to a \\"fairly wealthy family\\" in Baghdad.Ibn Rajab, Dhayl ʿalā Ṭabaqāt al-ḥanābila, Cairo 1372/1953, i, 399–434;Merlin Swartz, Ibn al-Jawzī’s Kitāb al-Quṣṣāṣ wa-’l-mudhakkirīn, Recherches publiées sous la direction de l’Institut de lettres orientales de Beyrouth, Série 1, Pensée arabe et musulmane, 47 (Beirut: Dar el-Machreq, 1971), 15. His parents proceeded to give their son a \\"thorough education\\"Laoust, H., \\"Ibn al-D̲j̲awzī\\", in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, ed. P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. in all the principal disciplines of the period, whence Ibn al-Jawzi had the good fortune of studying under such notable scholars of the time as Ibn al-Zāghūnī (d. 1133), Abū Bakr al-Dīnawarī (d. 1137-8), Shaiykh Saiyed Razzaq Ali Gilani (d. 1208), Abū Manṣūr al-Jawālīkī (d. 1144-5), Abu 'l-Faḍl b. al-Nāṣir (d. 1155), Abū Ḥakīm al-Nahrawānī (d. 1161) and Abū Yaʿlā the Younger (d. 1163).Ibn Rajab, Dhayl ʿalā Ṭabaqāt al-ḥanābila, Cairo 1372/1953, i, 401 Additionally, Ibn al- Jawzi began to be heavily influenced by the works of other scholars he read but whom he had never met personally, such as Abu Nu\`aym (d. 1038), a Shafi'i Ashari mystic, al-Khatib al-Baghdadi (d. 1071), a Hanbali who had changed to Shafi'ism, and the prominent Hanbali thinker Ibn \`Aqīl (d. ca. 1120), whom Ibn al-Jawzi would both praise and criticize in his later writings. He was an adherent of the Ashari school of dialectical theology, an aspect of his thought that would later distinguish him from many of his fellow Hanbali thinkers, In his early works he criticized speculation in theology, in particular modernizing trends among the Sufis. Ibn al-Jawzi began his career proper during the reign of al-Muqtafi (d. 1160), the thirty-first caliph of the Abbasid Caliphate, whose Hanbali vizier, Ibn Hubayra (d. 1165), served as a patron of Ibn al-Jawzi's scholarship. Beginning his scholarly career as a teaching assistant to his mentor Abū Ḥakīm al-Nahrawānī, who taught Hanbali jurisprudence in two separate schools, Ibn al-Jawzi succeeded al-Nahrawānī as \\"master of these two colleges\\" after the latter's death in 1161.Ibn Rajab, Dhayl ʿalā Ṭabaqāt al-ḥanābila, Cairo 1372/1953, i, 404 A year or so prior to this, however, Ibn al-Jawzi had already begun his career as a preacher, as Ibn Hubayra had given him free rein to deliver his passionate sermons every Friday in the vizer's own house.Ibn Rajab, Dhayl ʿalā Ṭabaqāt al-ḥanābila, Cairo 1372/1953, i, 402 After al-Muqtafi's death, the succeeding caliph, al- Mustanjid (d. 1170), called upon Ibn al-Jawzi to preach his sermons in the Caliph's Palace mosque – one of the most prominent houses of worship in the whole of Baghdad – during the three military interventions of the Fatimid Dynasty in the city. In these sermons, Ibn al-Jawzi is said to have \\"vigorously defended the prophetic precedent and criticized, not only all those whom he considered to be schismatics, but also the jurists who were too blindly attached to their own schools of law.\\" During the reign of the succeeding Abbasid caliph, al-Mustadi (d. 1180), Ibn al-Jawzi began to be recognized \\"as one of the most influential persons in Baghdad.\\" As this particular ruler was especially partial to Hanbalism, Ibn al-Jawzi was given free rein to promote Hanbalism by way of his preaching throughout Baghdad. The numerous sermons Ibn al-Jawzi delivered from 1172 to 1173 cemented his reputation as the premier scholar in Baghdad at the time; indeed, the scholar soon began to be so appreciated for his gifts as an orator that al-Mustadi even went so far as to have a special dais (Arabic dikka) constructed specially for Ibn al-Jawzi in the Palace mosque. Ibn al-Jawzi's stature as a scholar only continued to grow in the following years. By 1179, Ibn al-Jawzi had written over one hundred and fifty works and was directing five colleges in Baghdad simultaneously. It was at this time that he told al-Mustadi to engrave an inscription onto the widely venerated tomb of Ibn Hanbal (d. 855) – the revered founder of the Hanbali rite – which referred to the famed jurist as \\"Imām.\\"Ibn Kat̲h̲īr, Bidāya, Cairo 1351-8/1932-9, xii, 28–30 After the ascendancy of the new caliph, al-Nasir (d. 1235), to the Abbasid throne, Ibn al-Jawzi initially maintained amicable relations with the state power by way of his friendship with the caliph's Hanbali vizier, Ibn Yūnus (d. 1197). However, after the latter's dismissal and arrest – for unknown reasons – the caliph appointed as his successor the Shia Ibn al-Ḳaṣṣāb (d. ca. 1250). Although the reasons for the matter remain unclear in the historical record, al-Nasir eventually sentenced Ibn al-Jawzi to live under house arrest for five years. One of the possible reasons for this may be that Ibn al-Jawzi's relationship with the caliph had soured after the scholar had written a direct refutation of the ruler's policy in a particular matter. After five years in exile, Ibn al-Jawzi was eventually set free due to the pleading of al-Nasir's mother, whom the various chronicles describe as \\"a very devout woman\\" who pleaded with her son to free the famous scholar. Soon after his return to Baghdad, however, Ibn al-Jawzi died, being seventy-four years old. Views and thought =Polemics= Ibn al-Jawzi was a noted polemicist, and often attacked with great zeal the works of all those whom he deemed to be heretical innovators in the religion. His criticisms of other schools of thought appears most prominently in Talbīs Iblīs (The Devil's Delusion), \\"one of the major works of Hanbali polemic,\\" in which he staunchly critiqued not only numerous sects outside Sunni Islam, such as the Mutazilites and the Kharijites, but also particular schools of thought within Sunnism whom he believed had strayed from the right path. Due to some of Ibn al-Jawzi's remarks against some of the \\"wayward Sufis\\" of his time in this work, contemporary Muslim movements opposed to traditional Sufism, such as Salafism and Wahhabism, often cite the work as evidence of their position in the present day. Despite this, scholars have noted how Ibn al-Jawzi never actually attacks Sufism as such, but always makes a clear distinction in his works \\"between an older purer Sufism\\" and what he deems to be corruptions in Sufi practice. It is clear that Ibn al- Jawzi never intended his attacks on certain Sufi groups contemporaneous with him to constitute a condemnation of Sufism as a whole. =Relics= Ibn al- Jawzi was an avid supporter of using the relics of Muhammad in personal devotion, and supported the seeking of blessing through them in religious veneration. This is evident from his approved citing of a tradition narrated by Ibn Hanbal's son Abdullah, who recalled his father's devotion towards the Prophet's relics thus: \\"I saw my father take one of the Prophet's hairs, place it over his mouth, and kiss it. I may have seen him place it over his eyes, and dip it in water and then drink the water for a cure.\\"Ibn al-Jawzī, The Life of Ibn Hanbal, XXIV.2, trans. Michael Cooperson (New York: New York University Press, 2016), p. 89 In the same way, Ibn al-Jawzi also commended Ibn Hanbal for having drunk from the Prophet's bowl (technically a \\"second- class\\" relic) in order to seek blessings from it. =Saints= Ibn al-Jawzi supported the orthodox and widespread classical belief in the existence of saints, as is evident from his major work on the lives of the early Muslim Sufi saints entitled Sifat al-ṣafwa (The Characteristic of the Elect) – actually an abridgment of Abu Nu\`aym's (d. 1038) Ḥilyat al-awliyāʼ (The Adornment of the Saints) – in which he explicitly praises such important Sufis as Hasan of Basra (d. 728), Ibrahim ibn Adham (d. ca. 782), Sufyan al-Thawri (d. 778), Rabi\`a Basri (d. 801), Ma\`ruf Karkhi (d. ca. 820), and Bishr the Barefoot (d. ca. 850), among many others. While Ibn al-Jawzi did criticize charlatans who masquerade as holy men, he unreservedly states that true \\"saints do not violate\\" orthodox belief, practice, and law.Jonathan A. C. Brown, \\"Faithful Dissenters: Sunni Skepticism about the Miracles of Saints,\\" Journal of Sufi Studies 1 (2012), p. 162 Regarding saints, Ibn al-Jawzi said: > The saints and the righteous are the very purpose of all that exists (al- > awliya wa-al-salihun hum al-maqsud min al-kawn): they are those who learned > and practiced with the reality of knowledge... Those who practice what they > know, do with little in the world, seek the next world, remain ready to > leave from one to the other with wakeful eyes and good provision, as opposed > to those renowned purely for their knowledge.\\"Ibn al-Jawzi, Sifat al-safwa > (Beirut ed. 1989/1409) p. 13, 17. =Sufism= Ibn al-Jawzi evidently held that Sufism or tasawwuf was an integral aspect of Islamic practice. As has been noted by scholars, his Talbīs Iblīs, which criticizes innovations in all the major Islamic sciences including tafsir and fiqh, is by no means a rejection of Sufism as a whole.https://www.abc.se/home/m9783/ir/f/ts/Tasawwuf%20shuyukh.htm#18 On the contrary, the Hanbali jurist wrote many books on the merits of the early mystics and saints, including Manaqib Rabi\`a al-\`Adawiyya, Manaqib Ma\`ruf al- Karkhi, Manaqib Ibrahim ibn Adham, Manaqib Bishr al-Hafi, and others. Ibn al- Jawzi was also a staunch supporter of the teachings of Ghazali, and many of the former's works dealing with Sufism are influenced by Ghazali's most famous work, the Iḥyāʾ ʿulūm al-dīn. As a matter of fact, Ibn al-Jawzi frequently adopted the actual \\"methodology and language of\\" Ghazali in his own works, in addition to writing about the same subject matter. Among the topics Ibn al- Jawzi covered in his mystical works were: the meaning of passionate longing for God; the taking of one's nafs to account for its deeds; the berating of the nafs for its shortcomings; and the castigating of the nafs.  Theology  Ibn al-Jawzi is famous for the theological stance that he took against other Hanbalites of the time, in particular Ibn al-Zaghuni and al-Qadi Abu Ya'la. He believed that these and other Hanbalites had gone to extremes in affirming God's Attributes, so much so that he accused them of tarnishing the reputation of Hanbalites and making it synonymous with extreme anthropomorphism. Ibn al- Jawzi stated that, \\"They believed that He has a form and a face in addition to His Self. They believed that He has two eyes, a mouth, a uvula and molars, a face which is light and splendor, two hands, including the palms of hands, fingers including the little fingers and the thumbs, a back, and two legs divided into thighs and shanks.\\" And he continued his attack on Abu Ya'la by stating that, \\"Whoever confirms that God has molars as a divine attribute, has absolutely no knowledge of Islam.\\" Ibn al-Jawzi's most famous work in this regard is his Bāz al‐ašhab al‐munqadd 'alà muhālifī al‐madhab (The Gray Falcon Which Attacks the Offenders of the [Hanbalī] School). = God is neither inside nor outside the Universe = Ibn Jawzi states, in As-Sifat, that God neither exists inside the world nor outside of it.Swartz, Merlin. A Medieval Critique of Anthropomorphism, pg. 159. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2001. To him, \\"being inside or outside are concomitant of things located in space\\" i.e. what is outside or inside must be in a place, and, according to him, this is not applicable to God. He writes: > Both [being in a place and outside a place] along with movement, rest, and > other accidents are constitutive of bodies ... The divine essence does not > admit of any created entity [e.g. place] within it or inhering in it. Front cover of Al-Radd 'Ala al-Muta'assib al-'Anid al-Mani' Min Thamm Yazid published by Dar ul-Kutub al-Ilmiyah.  Works  Ibn al-Jawzi is perhaps the most prolific author in Islamic history. Al-Dhahabi states: \\"I have not known anyone amongst the 'ulama to have written as much as he (Ibn al-Jawzi) did.IslamicAwakening.Com: Ibn al-Jawzi: A Lifetime of Da'wah Recently, Professor Abdul Hameed al-Aloojee, an Iraqi scholar conducted research on the extent of ibn al Jawzi's works and wrote a reference work in which he listed Ibn al Jawzees's works alphabetically, identifying the publishers and libraries where his unpublished manuscripts could be found. Some have suggested that he is the author of more than 700 works. In addition to the topic of religion, Ibn al-Jawzi wrote about medicine as well. Like the medicinal works of Al-Suyuti, Ibn al-Jawzi's book was almost exclusively based on Prophetic medicine rather than a synthesis of both Islamic and Greek medicine like the works of Al-Dhahabi.

It is a style parody of the Doors, and contains lyrics inspired by postings at the online classified advertising service, Craigslist. Yankovic described the idea of the song coming about thinking how it would be \\"anachronistically weird\\" for Jim Morrison to scream about Craigslist. Yankovic opted to use Craigslist as an example of something big in both the popular culture and his own life, and spent time exploring its listings to compose the lyrics. The song was released shortly after the closure of the Michael John Anderson (Craigslist Killer) case, a factor Yankovic considered \\"unfortunate timing\\". Founding Doors member and keyboardist Ray Manzarek played keyboards on the studio recording of the song.Yankovic's video of the 2009 recording session The single was the first of four new singles that were being released as part of the Internet Leaks EP. Craigslist was released digitally on June 16, 2009. Composition As a \\"style parody\\", the song does not take directly from any single Doors tune, but instead transposes bits from various songs (especially from their first, self-titled album) and combines them. The intro guitar and organ riffs are similar to \\"Soul Kitchen\\" and \\"When the Music's Over\\", while the verses are reminiscent of \\"Twentieth Century Fox\\" and a short section of scat singing as in \\"Roadhouse Blues\\". Discrete sections in the guitar solo recall \\"When the Music's Over\\", \\"The End\\" and \\"Light My Fire\\", and the \\"snotty barista\\" section is a softer parody of the Oedipus complex from \\"The End\\". Personnel *\\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic - vocals *Jim \\"Kimo\\" West - guitars *Jon \\"Bermuda\\" Schwartz - drums and percussion *Ray Manzarek - keyboards Reception The music style of \\"Craigslist\\" has been considered to be a \\"dead-on parody of the Doors\\". Marc Hirsh of NPR noted that the composition and performance of \\"Craigslist\\" are evidence that Yankovic is a \\"Stealth Pop Musicologist\\", able to deconstruct a genre of work and recreate it into something new without being unrecognizable. Craigslist founder Craig Newmark, after being asked how he felt about the song, responded, \\"The thing's pretty funny!\\" Music video The song has an associated video produced by Liam Lynch and was released on the same day as the single, though AOL previewed the video a day before. The budget for the video was much lower than Yankovic's \\"White & Nerdy\\" and was shot in Lynch's garage. Yankovic stated that the low budget video \\"dovetails well\\" with the concept of the song. The video incorporates similar imagery seen in the Doors' videos, including stock footage and art house effects. Yankovic dressed as Morrison, having to lose some weight to look like the singer at age 24, and performed in front of a green screen to allow effects to be added afterward.

The monthly newspaper was published from August 1887 to August 1888 and from January to August 1890. 50- to 32-page newspaper had circulation of about 1,000. A special 72-page supplement was published in 1888. Influence of Šviesa was not very significant as it did not last and did not offer new ideas. After the first national Lithuanian newspaper Aušra ceased its publication due to financial difficulties, Lithuanian students in Moscow and young priests, disappointed by secular Aušra, organized publication of Šviesa. They sought to take leadership of the Lithuanian National Revival and propagate Catholic ideals. Edited by priest Antanas Vytartas and Jonas Kriaučiūnas, Šviesa was geared towards a common villager and included many practical articles about farming, husbandry, forestry. Other articles explained Christianity, promoted education, developed nationalistic ideas. Šviesa did not protest Russification or other policies of the Russian Empire. It also had conflicting views of Polish culture: sometimes it would criticize Polonized Lithuanians and argue for distinctively Lithuanian culture, but in other cases common Catholic faith would take precedence against Russian Orthodoxy. Contributors included Antanas Baranauskas, Jonas Jablonskis, Petras Leonas, Pranas Mašiotas, Maironis.

It was identified by British physiologist and biophysicist Sir Alan Lloyd Hodgkin. The Hodgkin cycle represents a positive feedback loop in which an initial membrane depolarization leads to uncontrolled deflection of the membrane potential to near VNa. The initial depolarization must reach or surpass a certain threshold in order to activate voltage-gated Na+ channels. The opening of Na+ channels allows Na+ inflow, which, in turn, further depolarizes the membrane. Additional depolarization activates additional Na+ channels. This cycle leads to a very rapid rise in Na+ conductance (gNa), which moves the membrane potential close to VNa. The cycle is broken when the membrane potential reaches to the sodium equilibrium potential and potassium channels open to re-polarize the membrane potential. This positive feedback loop means that the closer these voltage-gated Na+ channels are to each other, the lower the threshold of activation. Importance in cell physiology An understanding of membrane physiology is needed in order to understand how cells communicate with one another. Signalling between cells, such as neurons for example, revolves around changes in the electrical potentials across their membranes. In a healthy cell at rest, the intracellular area is usually negatively charged relative to the extracellular region. Depolarization refers to when the intracellular region is neutralized to be at the same voltage relative to the extracellular region. The concentration of sodium ions is intimately related to the electrical potential across a membrane. Depolarization often occurs via the influx of sodium ions to the intracellular region. Given that sodium ions have a positive charge, the intracellular region becomes less negatively charged relative to the extracellular region.

Like other species in the same genus, Strombus pugilis has a robust, somewhat heavy and solid shell, with a characteristic stromboid notch. It has a well-developed body whorl and a short and pointed spire. It presents 8 to 9 whorls, each of them having a single row of subsutural spines, becoming larger towards the last whorl. These spines, however, may be less conspicuous or even absent in some populations. Its aperture is relatively long and slightly oblique. The posterior angle of the outer lip is distinct, projecting in the posterior direction in an erect fashion.Cervigón, F. et al. (1993): FAO species identification sheets for fishery purposes. Field guide to the commercial marine and brackish-water resources of the northern coast of South America. Rome, FAO. 513 p. The operculum is sickle-shaped, similar to several other Strombus snails. The shell color varies from salmon-pink, cream or yellow to light or strong orange, and the interior of the aperture is usually white. The anterior end presents a dark purple stain, which is one of the diagnostic characters of this species, and is absent in Strombus alatus. This species is closely similar to Strombus alatus, which has a more northerly range. Strombus alatus shells have less prominent subsutural spines and a slightly more projected outer lip. Some scientists have treated the two as distinct species; others as subspecies.

In an extensive study of the Stromboidea in 2005, Simone provisionally treated them as distinct species, but observed that \\"no spectacular morphological difference was found [and] all related differences, even those of the genital system, can be regarded as extreme of variation of a single, wide distributed, variable species.\\" Simone (2005): Comparative Morphological study of representatives of the three families of Stromboidea and the Xenophoroidea (Mollusca, Caenogastropoda), with an assessment of their phylogeny , p. 169.

Life Born John Thomas Barber on 21 December 1774 in the parish of St Marylebone, London, he assumed in 1812, for unknown reasons, the additional name of Beaumont (which was retained by his descendants) and was often known as \\"Barber Beaumont\\". =Artist= An accomplished painter, Barber Beaumont focused on history painting and miniature painting. He had his works displayed at the Royal Academy of Arts in London and was appointed miniature painter to the Duke of Clarence, the future king William IV of Great Britain. His pupils included Henry Thomas Alken. David Collins by Anthony Cardon, from a miniature by John Thomas Barber. =Rifle corps= In 1803, when Napoleon threatened to invade England, Beaumont raised a rifle corps named The Duke of Cumberland's Sharp Shooters. His troops were reported to be such accurate shots that on one occasion he held a target in Hyde Park, London while the corps fired at it from a distance of 150 yards. In 1835 the corps changed its name to Royal Victoria Rifle Club and then later became Queen Victoria's Rifles. =In business= Beaumont established in 1806 the Provident Institution and Savings Bank in Covent Garden. In 1807 he founded the County Fire and the Provident Life insurance offices. In 1816–8 he took on Thomas Bignold of Norwich Union in a costly publicity war. Beaumont was a supporter of Caroline of Brunswick in her long-running dispute with George IV, and had the County Fire office in Regent Street decorated with lamps to celebrate her tactical victory over the royal divorce bill in 1820.Robin Pearson, Insuring the Industrial Revolution: fire insurance in Great Britain, 1700-1850 (2004), p. 158; Google Books. He resisted a fraudulent claim made on the fire company in 1823 by Thomas Thurtell, and ultimately secured the committal of Thurtell and associates to Newgate Prison. John Thurtell, the brother of Thomas, took up the quarrel, and made an attempt to murder Beaumont, which failed. Beaumont also took an active part in the exposure of a fraudulent insurance office, the West Middlesex, writing a letter to The Times about it in 1839.John Francis, Annals, Anecdotes and Legends: a chronicle of life assurance (1853); archive.org. Beaumont, an investor in South America and supporter of its independence from colonial rule, knew Bernardino Rivadavia, during his stay in London, and set up the Rio de La Plata Agricultural Association, with shares held also by Rudolph Ackermann. In 1825 British emigrants sailed to what is now Argentina, settling at Entre Ríos and San Pedro. The Cisplatine War, between the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata and the Empire of Brazil, intervened to make further settlement and even communication difficult. The troubled affairs of the intended colony were described in an 1828 book Travels in Buenos Ayres written by John Augustus Barber Beaumont, son of Barber Beaumont, who had tried to help the remaining colonists.Joselyn M.

The opening was on 29 October 1840, with a temperance meeting led by Philip Henry Stanhope, 4th Earl Stanhope.James Dawson Burns, The Temperance Dictionary (1861), p. 202; Google Books. The Institution comprised a museum, reading-room, and chapel. When Beaumont died in 1841 he left £13,000 for the maintenance of the institute. In 1844 the museum offered geology, mineralogy, and conchology, and there were singing classes and concerts.Phrenological Journal vol. 17 (1844), p. 58; archive.org.

The Institution was administered by the Beaumont Trust: the initial trustees were Fellowes with Henry Churchill, John Elliotson, Alexander Henderson, Charles Hennell, and Henry B. Kerr. In its original form it closed down in 1879.Deborah E. B. Weiner, Architecture and Social Reform in Late-Victorian London (1994), p. 186; Google Books. Its successor, the People's Palace, was opened in 1887; it was built by the Trust on the Mile End Road site of the old Bancroft's School, under the influence of Walter Besant, and to a design by Edward Robert Robson. It later came under the control of East London College. In 1931 fire damage necessitated the construction of the New People's Palace on an adjacent site; it was opened in 1937.British Listed Buildings, The Former New Peoples Palace, BowArchives in London and the M25 area, Beaumont Institution and People's Palace. In the longer term the Institution was one of the organisations leading up to the founding of Queen Mary, University of London, which now has a Barber Beaumont Chair of Humanities, currently occupied by Quentin Skinner.Queen Mary official page, Professor Quentin Skinner, FBA Barber Beaumont Professor of the Humanities. Family Beaumont's descendants include the ruling family of Sark. One of Beaumont's grandsons was William Spencer Beaumont, who served in the 14th King's Hussars. In 1887 he published a private account of his grandfather's life, A Brief Account of the Beaumont Trust, and its founder, J. T. B. Beaumont.

This program broadcasts on the hour, 24 hours a day. History NHK Newsline started as Day Line Japan in April 1997, with a length of 10 minutes, and airing several times a day. In 2000, the program's name was changed to Newsline. The English spoken portions of the program would gradually expand with time. On January 30, 2009, News Watch 9 - an English-dubbed news program - was removed from the NHK World line-up. On February 2, 2009, Newsline was re-formatted in order to fill the gap left by News Watch 9, by changing to a news and information program. Newsline's time slot also changed to air at the top of every hour, 24 times a day. The length of the program was typically 30 minutes during the week, and 10 minutes on weekends and Japanese holidays. The program has been referred to as NHK Newsline since Late March 2016. On April 1, 2019, NHK Newsline changed to a 15-20 minute format on weekdays at most times, while other Newsline-branded programs fill the remaining time until the bottom of the hour. These include Newsline In Depth, which features a variety of feature stories, and Newsline Biz, with business news. At 13:00 and 14:00 JST, a 30-minute program called Newsline Asia 24 reports on the headlines from Japan and around Asia. Newsline is replaced by the daily news program Newsroom Tokyo on weekdays, except holidays, at 20:00 JST (replaying at 3:00 JST the following morning).NHK World-Japan Broadcast Schedule On March 30, 2020, NHK implemented a new policy for referring to Japanese names, following the common practice in the Japanese language of listing the surname first followed by the given name. The new policy extends to all of NHK's English-language programming, including NHK Newsline. For example, Shinzō Abe (the former Prime Minister) is referred to as Abe Shinzō under the new policy. Format NHK Newsline updates viewers on the latest hard news with a focus mainly on Japan, the rest of Asia, and then finally around the world. Some editions feature segments focusing on Southeast Asia hosted by an anchor based in Bangkok. Feature segments follow, with business news and a global weather forecast. NHK Newsline is anchored by established NHK news presenters. The anchors speak entirely in English. English dubbing or occasional English subtitling if needed (previously just English subtitles until after 2011) are used in video footage when the spoken language is other than English. All measurements, including temperatures, are given in metric. Monetary figures are measured in Japanese yen, and figures in United States dollars are often also included. During periods of breaking news, Newsline is usually extended past it's normal time slot.

Biography Leopold Lawrence Stern was born in Brighton in 1862. His father was a German violinist and conductor of the Brighton Symphony Society, and his mother an English pianist. He initially studied chemistry at the South Kensington School of Chemistry, while studying the cello privately with Hugo Daubert. He worked in a business in Thornliebank near Glasgow from 1880 to 1883, but abandoned chemistry and entered the Royal Academy of Music, where he studied cello under Alessandro Pezze and then Carlo Alfredo Piatti. He later had lessons in Leipzig from Julius Klengel and Karl Davydov. He appeared with Adelina Patti (in her 1888 tour), Émile Sauret and Ignaz Paderewski, and in Paris played with Jules Massenet, Benjamin Godard and Francis Thomé. He was a favourite of Queen Victoria and often played at Windsor Castle, Balmoral Castle and Osborne House. In 1895 he visited Prague, where his playing became well known to Antonín Dvořák. Although Dvořák's recently completed Cello Concerto in B minor was dedicated to Hanuš Wihan and Dvořák wanted nobody but Wihan to play it in public for the first time, it was Leo Stern who was given the honour (there are conflicting versions of how this came about). The premiere occurred on 19 March 1896 at the Queen's Hall, London, under the composer's baton. Stern played the concerto in Prague (three weeks later, again conducted by Dvořák, ) at the Leipzig Gewandhaus (he was the first Englishman ever invited to play there) and with the Berlin Philharmonic. He was later summoned to play for Kaiser Wilhelm II at Potsdam. In 1897-98 he toured the United States (where he played with Theodore Thomas's orchestra in Chicago, the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic Society) and Canada. He played the New York premiere of Dvořák's Cello Concerto on 5 March 1897. Leo Stern died in London on 10 September 1904, aged 42. Stern used three cellos in his career: * a cello by Johannes Florenus Guidantus * the General Kyd Stradivarius, described as \\"the largest cello in existence\\", which was presented to him by a group of admirers headed by Lord Amherst of Hackney * the \\"Baudiot\\" Stradivarius (later owned by Gregor Piatigorsky). There is now a Leo Stern Award, the Royal College of Music's senior cello award. Marriages Leo Stern was married twice, both times to American-born women. In 1894 he married Nettie Carpenter (c. 1869-?), a former child prodigy violinist who had gained first prize at the Paris Conservatory and studied under Pablo de Sarasate, who was the godfather to her child (presumably from her first marriage). Sarasate had also given her a gold-embossed violin bow. Stern was Nettie Carpenter's second husband. They divorced, and in 1898 he married Suzanne Adams, a well-known coloratura soprano. He wrote some light songs, one of which ('Coquette') was recorded by Suzanne Adams.

He worked for Yaakov Turner's election campaign, which ended with Turner's victory. In return, Turner appointed Danilovich to serve as his deputy. Political career Danilovich's 2009 election victory over Turner was described as an \\"Oedipal story.\\" Turner often referred to Danilovich as his designated successor.

During the campaign, bogus death notices announcing Turner's supposed demise were put up on walls throughout the Negev city.Mayoral elections Shortly after his election, Danilovich was forced to contend with Grad missiles falling on his city during Operation Cast Lead. Following the operation, Danilovich presented a ten-year plan (2010–2020) for his city to transform it into an important metropolitan area in Israel. The plan includes improvements to education, infrastructure, job opportunities, etc. In the Municipal elections that were held in Israel on October 30, Danilovich continues for a third term with 91.97 percent (68,400) of the vote. His party, \\"Derech Hadasha,\\" increased its power in the city council and won 16 of the 27 seats available, compared to the 14 seats it won in the previous election.

This neighbourhood is the first of its kind in North America. Originally a part of the Saint-Michel neighbourhood, the late 1990s marked the beginning of the neighbourhood's Maghrebi flavour. This was a product of the opening of the Dar Al-Arkam Mosque on the corner of Jean-Talon and 17th Avenue and the arrival of thousands of immigrants from Algeria, Morocco, Libya, and Tunisia.

It is a tributary of the Upper Fraser River and it originates near Robson Pass, which divides the Robson River and the headwaters of the Smoky River drainage. There are three lakes along the river’s course as well as four waterfalls. Course =Robson Lake to Berg Lake= The Robson River begins in Robson Lake, which is located at the toe of the Robson Glacier. After exiting the lake, the river flows northwest then southwest before entering Berg Lake. Before entering Berg Lake, the river widens and splits into many small streams before flowing into the northeast end of Berg Lake. =Berg Lake to Kinney Lake= The river exits the southwest end and flows west for about until dropping over spectacular Emperor Falls, a plunge at the head of a canyon in which the river thunders over two more waterfalls. The first is Falls of the Pool, which comes about halfway down the gorge and at the end of the canyon is White Falls, a multi- tiered waterfall that cannot be seen in its entirety from the main trail. All these falls are collectively known as the Valley of a Thousand Falls. The river continues south from White Falls for another before entering Kinney Lake, which sits directly at the base of the Robson River’s namesake peak, Mount Robson. Between Berg and Kinney Lakes, the river loses of elevation, much of which is lost in the gorge between Emperor and White Falls. Once again, prior to entering another lake, this time Kinney, the river spreads out very wide & divides into many braids before flowing into the lake. =Kinney Lake to the Fraser River= The Robson exits Kinney Lake at its south end and flows southwest for about to its confluence with the Fraser, about below Overlander Falls and about above the mouth of Swiftcurrent Creek. About halfway between Kinney Lake & the Fraser is Knowlton Falls, the first waterfall seen on the Berg Lake Trail. About above the Fraser, the Yellowhead Highway crosses the river. In total, the river loses of elevation between Robson Lake and the Fraser River, three-quarters of which is lost between Berg and Kinney Lakes. Hiking The main hiking trail in the area is the Berg Lake Trail, which begins at the Yellowhead Highway near the mouth of the Robson. It goes all the way to its namesake lake, where the trail splits into more trails. Reaching Berg Lake is usually a multi-day trip. However, it is possible and it is done in a single day by some. Not everyone chooses to go all the way to Berg Lake though. Some will settle with a much quicker but still satisfying trip to Kinney Lake. Bikes are permitted all the way up to Kinney Lake and a ways beyond. Part way down the shore of the lake is a bike lock-up. From here, anyone continuing to go further upriver has to go on foot. The Berg Lake trail also gives hikers looks at the Robson’s waterfalls. Knowlton Falls is seen about halfway between the trailhead and Kinney Lake while hikers can stare into the canyon at White Falls and Falls of the Pool as the trail climbs toward Berg Lake.TrailPeak.com: Berg Lake Trail See also *List of British Columbia rivers References Category:Rivers of British Columbia Category:Tributaries of the Fraser River Category:Robson Valley Category:Rivers of the Canadian Rockies ","title":"Robson River"},{"id":"23138710","text":"Deportivo Coopsol is a Peruvian football club, playing in the city of Chancay District, Huaral, Lima.

History by Year = 1989= Rutger's Formula Team organized and several members attended the 1989 event at South West Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. Design of the first car began in the Fall of 1989 alongside fund raising activities. Ford Motor Company was the first monetary supporter of the team with a $5000. Dean Dill soon followed with a donation from the school's Alumni Association fund. SAE Metropolitan Section was another key early sponsor that got Rutger's FSAE program going. SAE's shop took residence in a cleaned up section of the boiler room off of the main MAE lab. Also during this same time frame, Rutger's MAE department bought a new Bridgeport Mill and Harrison Lathe. =1990= Major design and fabrication work on the first car was completed in 1990. The car utilized a Ninja 600 engine and 10 inch wheels. Wheelbase was 61 inches and the track was 60 inches front 58 inches rear. The car was not ready for the 1990 competition; however, the rolling chassis was brought to the event which was held at Lawrence Tech. =1991= The 1991 competition was held at the GM Proving Grounds aka \\"Black Lake.\\" This was the first entry for a Rutgers car into the Formula SAE competition. A modified Ford ECU was being used to control the engine, but it never really worked. The car never ran on its own power with this ECU installed. This car won the \\"Best Suspension Award\\" which was judged by Terry Satchell. Bill Mitchell's suspension software was awarded to the team. =1992= The 1992 Formula SAE competition was held at Ford's Research and Engineering campus in Dearborn, MI. The 1991 car was updated with an Electromotive ECU. Approximately 60 hours of dyno testing was performed on this motor and numerous track sessions. Rear wheel Hp was 73. This car earned 3rd Place in Acceleration. The car completed all events except the second heat of endurance due to the failure of a suspension linkage eye end. =1993= Rutgers did not compete in the Formula SAE competition in 1993. =1994= Rutgers entered its first carbon fiber monocoque in the 1994 competition at the Pontiac Silverdome. The front half of the car was constructed of pre-preg carbon fiber with a Nomex honeycomb core. 3 sandwich panel aluminum bulkheads were used to mount the front suspension and master cylinders. The rear half of the car was constructed of 4130 steel tubing. One of the most dramatic features of the car was the use of very long lower A-Arms. They were so long, that there was only about 1 inch of space between the left and right mounts on the chassis. The composite construction made use of very simple molds made primarily from sheetmetal and wood. There were no compound curves to any of the molds for the monocoque. Shifting was performed by steering wheel push buttons via pneumatics (an FSAE first). The brakes used 200mm OD cast iron vented rotors. The engine was a naturally aspirated Kawasaki Ninja 600R, making 73 RWHp. Result Highlights: Presentation - 7th Place, Design - 13th Place, Acceleration - 13th Place, Skid Pad - 5th Place, Autocross - 3rd Place, Endurance - 7th Place (22 Cones and 3 spin outs), Economy - 6th, Overall - 9th This car earned the \\"Best Prototype Fabrication Award\\" =1995= Car #9 - This was the second year entry of the 1994 car. Carbon fiber wheels were custom built for the car. 1995 Competition Results: Cost: 31 points Presentation: 14.2 points Design: 82 points Acceleration: 46.25 points Skid pad: 34.4 points Autocross: 130.4 points Endurance: 171.1 points Economy: 22.5 points Overall: 22nd / 531.9 points =1996= Rutgers did not compete in the Formula SAE competition in 1996. =1997= Car #68 1997 Competition Results: Cost: 54.53 points Presentation: 60.5 points Design: 110 points Acceleration: DNF Skid pad: 5.59 points Autocross: 45.0 points Endurance: 153.0 points Overall: 22nd / 428.67 points =1998= Car # 22 First time an entirely new car was designed and fabricated from scratch at Rutgers in a school year. The car earned a spot in design semi finals. Utilized a 600CC Honda F3 motor. First time a motor was semi stressed in this program. Incorporated outboard shocks, which seemed to be going a step back, but they worked quite well. CV joints were applied after a long hiatus since the first car. Switched to a single inboard rear brake rotor. All three aluminum brake rotors failed during the morning heat of endurance. New rotors were made by the afternoon, but the car ultimately did not finish endurance due to a throttle control issue (jam nut came loose). 1998 Competition Results: Cost: 65.0 Points Presentation: 63.8 Points Design: 127.0 Points Acceleration: 48.26 Points Skid Pad: 29.97 Points Autocross: 98.05 Points Endurance: DNF Total: 32nd / 432.12 points =1999= Car #67 The 1998 car was utilized for a second year with slight improvements and adjustments to meet the current years rules. The changes included: Adjustable pedals, conversion from the air shifter to a mechanical lever arm for enhanced reliability, new differential mounting brackets to ease chain adjustments, new main roll hoop to meet new chassis regulations, and a full carbon fiber foot box, also to meet new chassis regulations. The car weighed just over 500 lbs. The differential failed during endurance due to lack of safety wire on the main bolts. Early model Tosen differentials are assembled with three main bolts that hold the two housing together in the axial direction. These bolts loosened during the endurance event, which created a large gap between the two main gears and the friction washer. This car is currently undergoing a full restoration by Rutgers FSAE alumni 1999 Competition Results: Cost: 59.14 points Presentation: 31.26 points Design: 65 points Acceleration: 51.94 points Skid Pad: 17.51 points Autocross: 109.5 points Endurance: DNF Overall: 40th / 334.4 points =2000= Car # 67 The year 2000 car marked the return to inboard suspension. However, the mounting posts for the bell cranks caused cracks in the main frame tubes. This car utilized the same engine, differential, and rear chassis subframe configurations as the 1998 and 1999 cars. However, a new rear upright and half shaft designs were implemented to eliminate cv joint failure and to reduce overall weight. The remainder of the chassis was fully redesigned from the engine forward. Earned a 3rd place Bosch powertrain award for a novel variable length intake runner system. =2001= Car #56 The 2001 car featured upgrades and lessons learned from the 2000 car which include improved bellcrank mounting and lighter front uprights. New rear suspension geometry (new rear subframe) was also introduced this year. 2001 Competition Results: Cost: 78.4 points Presentation: 30.9 Points Design: 60.0 Points Acceleration: 47.18 Points Skid Pad: 39.24 Points Autocross: 62.28 Points Endurance: 290.12 Points Overall: 15th / 608.1 Points =2002= Car #36 The 2002 Car was a revised version of the 2001 Car, with the engine changed from the Honda to the 2001 Yamaha R6. A coil on plug was implemented by wiring the coils directly to the output blades on the TEC II (the pins that normally connect to the GM coils). The team placed 17th overall. Taking home the Highest Horsepower Award(NA) The team and car were featured in a RU-TV News Segment. The 2002 Car was ultimately wrecked in early 2003 in the Stadium Lot during new upgrades testing for the 2003 car. This occurred when the driver, using the new paddle operated electronic shifter, pulled multiple downshifts at high speed, shifting into first gear and causing a loss of control due to virtual lock-up of the rear wheels. The car hit a curb, shearing the dropped seat bottom off the car, and then hit a small tree. The chassis was badly damaged. The driver was bruised and sore, but had no major injuries. The helmet he was wearing hit the steering wheel and was thus retired. 2002 Competition Results: Cost: 17th / 79.6 points Presentation: 27th / 54.7 points Design: 76th / 60 points Acceleration: DNF Skid Pad: 41st / 16.75 points / 5.759 Autocross: 18th / 91.19 points / 81.4 secs Endurance: 13th / 252.07 points / 1770.9 secs Total: 17th / 554.271 points =2003= Car #42 Completion of the car was very far behind. The car was ultimately able to pass all parts of tech inspection in time to be the very last car to run endurance. The chain fell off in the next to last lap of the event (second driver) due to the retaining clip on the master link falling off. This car had a chain which rubbed a friction surface on an interfering chassis tube, which may have contributing to knocking the clip off. After the competition the interfering tube was cut out with a reciprocating saw and a diagonal tube was welded in so that the chain did not interfere. This setup lasted many drive days until eventually causing a crack in one of the original chassis tubes. The car used a custom designed electronic shifting actuator made from a standard RC car motor and a planetary gear box from a power drill. While the actuator was very powerful, the system required an electronic controller because the motor could not be turned on for more than a quarter second without damaging the brushes or windings. The overall actuator weight was around 1.2 lbs. There were positive and negative results of the system. With new brushes in the motor and proper tweaking it was capable of very fast shifts (~15 ms), and was able to perform very well for automatic up-shifting during acceleration runs. However, the brushed motor was unreliable in this implementation (very low rev, turning only a few turns at a time, commonly stalled), which meant that the motor required constant tinkering. Further problems included the use of 1st gear on this car which led to frequent neutral-out conditions. 2003 Competition Results: Cost: 40th / 77.7 points Presentation: 32nd / 54.1 points Design: 71st / 60 points Acceleration: DNF Skid Pad: DNF Autocross: DNF Endurance: DNF Overall: 85th / 191.8 Points =2004= Car # 29 The ECU was switched from the Electromotive TEC2 to the relatively new Performance Electronics ECU. The custom built Backseat Driver telemetery and data acquisition system was first used this year. It was a dashboard mounted unit with a rudimentary on-board LED display, and entirely through-hole based circuit board with a remote mounted accelerometer and telemetry radio. The car did not finish endurance. The second driver was black flagged for missing a blue (pass) flag. Later review of video revealed a track worker in a low visibility location waving the blue flag. After the penalty time, with engine off, the engine would not start. The battery was drained after continued cranking without firing. Based on telemetry, coolant temperature was in the high 250 range during this period. It was later noted that the PE ECU's starting enrichments cut off after 255 degrees (the maximum setting). 2004 Competition Results: Cost: 43rd / 75.1 Points Presentation: 44th / 54 Points Design: 48th / 80 Points Acceleration: 10th / 63.1 Points / 4.343 secs Skid Pad: 20th / 38.2 Points / 5.412 secs Autocross: 16th / 103 Points / 52.225 Secs Endurance: DNF OVERALL: 40th / 413.4 Points =2005= Car # 54 In response to previous years rear subframe issues along with changing competition trends, 2005 was first year to utilize an aluminum plate rear subframe created via water jet. This design provided quick and accurate creation of subframe and also maintained precise suspension points. Power plant was still the 2001 Yamaha R6 with a new drivetrain design utilizing the same Torsen Differential housed in a single piece housing to increase reliability. 2005 Competition: Car was driven through competition without roll bars due to trouble with fabrication / and longevity. Summer testing after competition T-style rear sway bar was created and worked reliably. RFR '05 started competition utilizing previous mentioned \\"RC motor style\\" shifter, but due to reliability issues shifter was switched to a mechanical stylethe night before endurance and ensured car finished endurance event. During the event there were still hard shifting characteristics due to zero to no testing on shifter or driver training. 2005 Competition Results: Cost - 41st / 80.8 points Presentation - 19th / 63.0 Points Design - 14th / 100 Points Acceleration - 27th / 51.9 points / 4.486 sec Skid Pad - 67th / 18.0 points / 5.794 Sec Autocross - 17th / 98.1 points / 60.226 Secs Endurance - 23rd / 245.6 points / 1608.599 secs OVERALL - 17th / 657.512 points Note: Endurance Economy 1.111 Gallons used =2006= Car # 48 2006 car was a completely new chassis and component car. 2005 & 2006 were rolling side by side. Optimization of the 2005 package yielded a car 30 lbs lighter, weighing in at roughly 465 lbs fully fueled and ready to drive. A number of improvements were made based on experience with the previous car and recommendations from design judges. The changes recommended by the design judges included the addition of floating brake rotors and the removal of rod ends at the outboard ball joints. Improvements to the car included: Reworked method for rear differential adjustment. Diff was the same style except further optimized to reduce weight Reworked front camber adjustment. Shifter was a mechanical push/pull cable paddle shifter. Performance in the acceleration and skidpad events was limited by running in wet conditions with 1 season old rain tires. All other dynamic events were run in the dry. 2006 Competition Results: Cost: 47th / 80.6 points Presentation: 18th / 61.7 points Design: 40th / 70 points Acceleration: 48th / 33.3 points / 5.027 secs Skid pad: 40th / 2.5 points / 6.247 secs Autocross: 21st / 104.5 points / 49.348 secs Endurance: 9th / 331.9 points / 1553.229 secs OVERALL: 16th / 684.4 points Note: Endurance Economy 1.283 gallons used =2007= Car # 58 2007 Competition Results: Cost: 48th / 77.5 Points Presentation: 83rd / 34.9 Points Design: 38th / 80 Points Acceleration: DNF Skid Pad: DNF Autocross: DNF Endurance: DNF Total: 87th / 192.3 points =2008= Car #58 Competition Results: Cost: 34th / 80.5 points Presentation: 90th / 33.7 points Design: 37th / 80 points Acceleration: 19th / 56.9 points Skid Pad: 56th / 18.2 points Autocross: 66th / 41.4 points Endurance: DNF Total: 60th / 310.7 points =2009= Official Model of the RFR-09. There was notable redesign of most systems creating an overall new \\"platform\\". The Yamaha R6 engine was replaced with the 2007 Honda CBR 600rr. The aluminum rear subframe was scrapped and the chassis was reverted to a one piece steel tube design. The team competed in two competitions, VIR and MIS. Highlights were 3rd place in Acceleration at VIR, and a tie for 3rd place in Design at MIS. The MIS Design finish was originally a tie with one other team for 5th place after semi-finals, two of the Design finalists had a 35-point penalty for not passing the new template rules, causing the first place team to tie with the two 5th place teams for 3rd place in points. A paddle actuated hydraulic clutch was designed which had a custom master cylinder concentric with the steering shaft. Shifting was originally via a large off-the-shelf electric solenoid (actually two solenoids inline which acted in opposite directions), but the windings for one of the internal solenoids burned out the Sunday before the VIR competition (the team left on the Tuesday morning after this). Parts were gathered from old (~10 years previous or more) pneumatic shifting setups that were stored in various places, and the following day CO2 tanks and various other parts were bought at a paint ball supply store and a pneumatic shifter was on the car by 4am Tuesday morning. This system used the same switches that actuated the original shifter, which were mounted on a collar on the steering shaft. The shift paddles pushed small pushrods which were in holes drilled in the quick release and protruded when the paddle was pulled to push the microswitch levers. The car weighed in at 499 lbs with a carbon fiber aerodynamic undertray at VIR, and was reduced to 465 at MIS after the undertray was removed and other components streamlined. VIR Endurance The first driver completed the first half of the event, with about 4 cones and no off course penalties. The car was overheating and the overflow tank was venting steam. The car was inspected by the event officials and allowed to go back out. At the end of the driver change the coolant temperature was around 265, and with some hesitation the engine started. The second driver locked up the front wheels going into the corner after the first straight, and ended up stalling the engine. With a coolant temperature around 275 degrees, the engine would not restart. It cranked very slowly although the battery voltage was showing a full charge. After the Endurance course was closed, the now cooled down car was brought back to the paddock where it fired up immediately with no charging of the battery. MIS Endurance Due to the problems in the VIR Endurance and in testing, a larger battery was added to the car for this event (14 amp-hour), and a second fan was installed on the radiator as well as a duct in front of the radiator. After about 7 laps by the first driver the downshift microswitch got stuck and held the pneumatic actuator in the down- shift position. The transmission ended up in first gear, and would not come out of first because the up-shift solenoid could not overcome the already actuated down-shift solenoid. At the end of the 10th lap, the coolant temperature was around 270F. At the final turn of the final lap, the checkered flag was displayed approximately 1 second before the car reached the official holding the flag (based on video slow-motion). The driver did not see the flag and continued around the course. Based on telemetry data, it is evident that there was a loss of oil pressure by about 90% while the coolant temperature was around 270 during this 11th lap. By the ½ way point of the 11th lap the engine began to misfire badly and the driver decided to pull over. At this point the overflow tank was still steaming. The driver was instructed by track workers to cut the engine, and the car was immediately towed away. After watching the video of the event, it was decided that the team leaders would make a complaint to the event organizers regarding the late flag. The whole situation was explained to one of the main organizers, and he informed them that missed flags occur constantly and they just can't do anything about it. He went on say that if the driver was not given the 3-minute period stipulated in the rules to restart the engine and continue driving, that it may have been a mistake on their part, and he would talk to the event captain and see what could be done. After 10 minutes he returned to the paddock and explained that the event captain wanted us to return to the course with our second driver and attempt the second half of the event. He further explained that he and the track workers would later inspect the notes and any video evidence, and only if there was definitive proof that the driver was not offered his 3-minute restart period would they consider the second driver's laps and give us point for the event. The car was immediately returned and the second driver entered the track. The second driver immediately noticed that the sound of the engine was off, and after the first slow section of the course shifted into 3rd gear for the remained of the first lap. At the start of the second lap, the car was passed, and upon pulling onto the course again the driver noticed an increase in the vibration from the engine. The driver then shifted into 4th gear to further reduce the engine RPM. Before the half-way point of the 2nd lap (right before the back sweeper) a loud bang was heard from the engine, and the car began shaking violently. The driver continued through the back sweeper and then pulled off the side of the course. Before being towed back, the driver was handed a small, oily chain by one of the track workers who believed that it came from our engine (which it did). Upon inspection there was a hole in the front bottom of the engine near the #1 cylinder. Other notable events and facts from 2009: First time the shop in the Packaging Engineering Building was used as a main shop. The chassis was built in this shop and carried through the single door before the final assembly of the car. The RFR-03 chassis and body mounted to the roof of one of the shops. Addition of the \\"car on the roof\\". This is the chassis and body of the 2003 car which has been strapped to the roof of the shop with wire rope. The team unofficially adopted Africa by ToTo as the theme song for the 2009 season. Testing at the Goodyear facility in Akron, Ohio in October, 2008. VIR Car #14 VIR Competition Results: Cost: 20th / 44 points Presentation: 18th / 52.3 points Design: 9th / 75 points Acceleration: 3rd / 59.5 points Skid Pad: 10th / 30.1 points Autocross: 13th / 72.2 points Endurance: DNF Overall: 13 th / 333.1 points MIS Car #26 MIS Competition Results: Cost: 20th / 78 points Presentation: 4th / 68.8 points Design: 3rd / 115 points Acceleration: 27th / 50.8 points Skid Pad: 45th / 17.5 points Autocross: 64th / 17.8 points Endurance: DNF Overall: 40th / 347.8 points =2010= =2011= 2011 was a significant year for Rutgers Formula Racing. The team gained exceptional recognition in tri- state and among other clubs at Rutgers University. The 2011 team was given the Outstanding Organization of The Year Award. The team has also exhibited at the annual New York International Auto Show. The overall design of the car did not see a notable difference although the manufactured parts and bodywork have considered to deem the RFR11 the best looking car the team has built to the date. The team competed in two competitions just as in 2010, FSAE East, in Michigan (MIS) and FSAE West, in California (ACS). 2011 is the first year team has started using the Drexler Salisbury type differential. The car weighed in at 460 lbs at Michigan International Raceway, and was increased to 465 at Autoclub Speedway. FSAE Michigan 2011 Dynamic Events The day before the competition was the first drive of RFR11 which ended up with the Electromotive ECU crank position sensor to move slightly inside the crank case, hitting the crank trigger wheel, which led to an engine failure. The sensor was replaced overnight and a new wheel was welded on. The engine was not fired until the 2nd day of the competition after the technical inspections. On the 3rd day, the engine fired ok for the first acceleration event but the starter wheel gave out (possibly due to a misalignment during installation). The team replaced the engine within 1.5 hours to make it to the AutoX event in the afternoon, but had to skip Skid-Pad event. First driver successfully completed the AutoX run and the second driver did not complete his 2nd run after the engine started over-heating due to an electrical failure on the radiator fan. FSAE Michigan 2011 Endurance The first driver completed the first half of the event with no problems. As he was getting out of the car, he instructed the second driver to be cautious and take it slow. The second driver conducted his stint at mainly part throttle and through corners would hold the clutch in and then keep the RPMs high due to the belief that the engine was dying. The car was running ok but the 2nd driver was black flagged and had to pull in because of a malfunctioning brake light switch. As pulling in the pit lane, the driver quickly realized the problem and was able to pull back the brake pedal with his foot in order to be able to finish the rest of the race. For the remaining of the race, the driver pulled the brake pedal back with his foot every time he hit the brakes, which resulted him with very slow laptimes. Since the car was not tuned well for the RPM range that the driver was keeping the car at, the car ran out of fuel and DNF'ed from Endurance 2 laps before it could finish. Other notable events and facts from MIS 2011: The president of RFR has received the Most Valuable Member of the Year Award from SAE International. FSAE California 2011 Dynamic Events Due to the problems in the MIS Endurance, the new team has excessively tested the car and made the necessary adjustments under 8 days, before the car was shipped to Fontana, California. All dynamic events, including Endurance were successfully completed. FSAE California 2011 Endurance An extra fan was added to the radiator and all rod-ends were replaced before endurance. Because of a loose connection on the car's telemetry system (Back Seat Driver), the car had no RPM readings visible to the driver for the entire competition. The tune of the car was significantly different than the week after FSAE Michigan, therefore more tuning adjustments were completed before endurance.

This proposal looked at an overall platform change in order to ready the team and the vehicle to be able to implement a full aerodynamic package that was starting to trend among the top teams of the Formula SAE. Due to massive restrictions in cost, timing, manpower, and manufacturing technologies available to the team, this drive for a platform redesign was tabled as a future undertaking of the Rutgers Formula Racing team and a new sub-team was launched to begin design and development activities for aerodynamics. However, the perfect opportunity would come sooner than originally expected only weeks after FSAE Michigan 2014. RFR15 would serve as the new platform to push the team towards an implementation of a full aerodynamics package. * All-new aerodynamic package. * All-new powertrain system. * Redesigned suspension system with space-frame chassis. The new team philosophy would include added focus for additional activities: * Implementation of New Funding Goals and Objectives * Implementation of New Recruitment Strategy * Renewed Relations and Support with the Rutgers Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering * Increased Support from Rutgers School of Engineering and the Rutgers Engineering Governing Council Formula SAE Michigan Car #61 Results Cost: 70.4 / 65th Presentation: 59.9 / 27th Design: 50 / 104th Acceleration: DNA Skid Pad: DNA Autocross: DNA Endurance: DNA Overall: 180.4 / 90th =2016= Exhibition of the team including past vehicles and current build in progress. =2017= Formula SAE Michigan Car #50 Results Cost: 64.97 / 53rd Presentation: 57.9 / 25th Design: 100 / 18th Acceleration: 54.55 (Best Time: 4.899 s) / 64th Skid Pad: 37.87 (Best Time: 5.339 s) / 37th Autocross: 66.15 (Best Time: 48.797 s) / 33rd Endurance: 11 (Best Lap Time: 62.436 s)/ DNF (Failed to restart) Overall: 392.4 / 54th Formula North 2017 Car #30 Results Cost: 42 / 18th Presentation: 50 / 18th Design: 85 / 14th Acceleration: 41.65 (Best time: 4.871 / 20th Skid Pad: 40.51 (Best time: 5.514) / 13th Endurance: 250 / 3rd Overall: 603.29 / 6th Organization Rutgers Formula Racing is a 100% student-run organization, and as of 2017 has the following administrative structure: Team President President is the external face of Rutgers Formula Racing.

Ūkininkas was printed in Tilsit (current Sovetsk) and Ragnit (current Neman) in German East Prussia and smuggled into Lithuania by the knygnešiai. The two newspapers shared staff and similar ideology, but Ūkininkas was geared towards less educated peasants and had larger circulation of 1,000–2,000 copies. It contained few political or cultural discourses and concentrated on practical advice regarding farming, husbandry, and forestry. It also published short news from various locations across Lithuania, helping to develop the idea of Lithuania as a single entity. Various writers, including Jonas Biliūnas, Vincas Kudirka, Gabrielė Petkevičaitė-Bitė, Sofija Pšibiliauskienė, contributed their fiction. After publication of Ūkininkas was discontinued, it was replaced by weekly Lietuvos ūkininkas (The Lithuanian Farmer), published in Vilnius.

It was broadcast every day, usually on the hour, and was available in English, German, Spanish and Arabic. These were broadcast via satellites to different parts of the world, but all these channels could be viewed via the media centre on DW's website and are often relayed via local broadcasters/channels. The Journal was first broadcast on 1 April 1992 when RIAS-TV became DW. Major rebrands of the Journal took place in 1994, 1999, 2002 and 2006. The Journal ended on 22 June 2015 after DW-TV reorganized and the programme succeeded by DW News (German: DW Nachrichten, Spanish: DW Noticias).Deutsche Welle launches global news channel - Broadband TV News, 22 June 2015  Editions  There were three, 15 and 30-minute editions of the Journal throughout the day at differing times. = Weekdays = For the 30 minute broadcast, two news anchors were relaying the news. These editions also offered a business news segment, complete with on-screen ticker depicting European and German stocks, shares and commodity changes. The English-language Journal was 30 minutes long during weekdays at 0100, 1400 and 1900 UTC. The Spanish-language Journal was half-an-hour long at 2200 and 0100 UTC (prime- time for Latin American viewers). The 30-minute Journal in German could be seen at 1300 and 2100 UTC. = Weekends = Similar to the weekday edition, apart from sports news were shown, rather than business. Also, the last 15-minute segment of each 30-minute broadcast was allotted to one of the following: * Journal - Interview (German Interview, Spanish: Entrevista) * Journal - Reporters (German and Spanish: Reporter) * Journal - The Week (German: Die Woche, Spanish: La Semana) * Journal - Business Review (German: Wirtschaftsbilanz, Spanish: Semana de Economia)  2006 Revamp  The Journal was revamped in June 2006. This included moving to a new studio, new theme music, and new lower-third graphics.  2009 new look  The programme was again revamped in 2009. On weekdays, Journal With Business or Journal mit Wirtschaft in German, was aired alongside Journal with In Depth (in German: Journal mit Tagesthema). A new edition, Journal with Business Review or in German, Journal mit Wirtschaftsbilanz broadcast along with three editions such as Journal with Interview or Journal mit Interview in German, was broadcast on weekends. Journal with The Week (in German: Journal mit Die Woche) and Journal with Reporters (in German:Journal mit Reportern).  2012 new look  As of 2012, the Journal has new format following the rebrand of DW-TV to DW in February 2012. Spanish-language programming was limited to two hours per day until this rebrand and now DW offers 24-hour coverage in Spanish. The Arabic- language output has also increased. In order to facilitate these extra commitments, the Journal was no longer always 30 minutes in any language. There were three-minute summaries (most common), 15-minute editions and full 30-minute programmes.

Dhammacaris follow four training vows in addition to the traditional Five Precepts that all lay devotees follow. Dhammacārī literally means a person who forms his or her thinking and behavior according to the Dhamma. Dhamma is the knowledge that enhances the quality of life. It is the knowledge and understanding of the true nature of things: the knowledge that all things are causally conditioned. After realizing the causes and conditions of things one can generate a desired effect by changing the causes and conditions as necessary. This is the same principle that is used to improve things in science and technology. Dhammacārī applies this method to improve things related to human behavior. “Dhammacārī” (one who follows Dhamma) is committed to putting effort towards understanding how life works (Dhamma) and reforms the lifestyle and thinking patterns according to this understanding. The goal is the reduction of discomfort of life and becoming more and more effective in handling ups and downs of life. Buddha has taught Dhamma in many different ways and his teachings help us to understand the many subtle details regarding the nature of life. Dhammacārī is convinced that learning the teaching of the Buddha makes learning “life” much easier. Dhammacārī Initiation = Ti-Sarana & Life-long Eight Precepts = • Namo Tassa Bhagavato Arahato Sammā Sambudhassa (3 times). Homage to the blessed One, the Perfected One, the Fully Awakened One (3 times). • Buddham Saranam Gacchāmi I go to the Buddha for refuge. • Dhammam Saranam Gacchāmi I go to the Dhamma for refuge. • Sangham Saranam Gacchāmi I go to the Sangha for refuge. • Dutiyampi Buddham Saranam Gacchāmi For the second time, I go to the Buddha for refuge. • Dutiyampi Dhammam Saranam Gacchāmi For the second time, I go to the Dhamma for refuge. • Dutiyampi Sangham Saranam Gacchāmi For the second time, I go to the Sangha for refuge. • Tatiyampi Buddham Saranam Gacchāmi For the third time, I go to the Buddha for refuge. • Tatiyampi Dhammam Saranam Gacchāmi For the third time, I go to the Dhamma for refuge. • Tatiyampi Sangham Saranam Gacchāmi For the third time, I go to the Sangha for refuge. = Life-long Eight Precepts = • Pānātipātā veramanī, sikkhāpadam samādiyāmi. I undertake the training step to abstain from taking life. • Adinnādanā veramanī, sikkhāpadam samādiyāmi. I undertake the training step to abstain from taking what is not given. • Kāmesu micchācārā veramanī, sikkhāpadam samādiyāmi. I undertake the training step to abstain from sexual misconduct. • Musāvādā veramanī, sikkhāpadam samādiyāmi. I undertake the training step to abstain from lying. • Pisunāvācā veramanī, sikkhāpadam samādiyāmi. I undertake the training step to abstain from divisive speech. • Pharusāvācā veramanī, sikkhāpadam samādiyāmi. I undertake the training step to abstain from harsh speech. • Samphappalāpā veramanī, sikkhāpadam samādiyāmi I undertake the training step to abstain from idle chatter. • Micchā ājīvā veramanī, sikkhāpadam samādiyāmi. I undertake the training step to abstain from wrong livelihood. The Meanings of Taking Refuge Buddha: The term Buddha means ultimate human perfection, the perfection of insight and compassion. It is also the absence of fear and all other defects of the human mind. Any one can achieve Buddha-hood by using the correct method. Taking refuge in the Buddha means setting oneself in the direction of perfect wisdom and compassion. Dhamma: Dhamma is the necessary information regarding the method that gradually leads us toward human perfection. After carefully verifying the accuracy of this method, all Buddhas make that information available to others for their benefit. Dhamma is the knowledge that is utilized and verified by individuals who seek to refine the quality of life. Taking refuge in Dhamma is committing oneself to study and practice it for the benefit of oneself and others. Sangha: Sangha is the numerous men, women and children who have tested the method and proved that gradual improvement and final personal perfection is possible. They were average people who achieved perfect wisdom and compassion, by following Dhamma. They became free from sorrow, frustration, stress, fear, and other mental weaknesses that make life difficult. Taking refuge in the Sangha means looking up to them as role models. History In the early 1990s Bhante Madawala Seelawimala of American Buddhist Seminary in West Sacramento and Bhante Walpola Piyananda of Dhamma Vijaya Buddhist Vihara in Los Angeles decided to establish this formal initiation ceremony to train future American Buddhist leadership. Dhammacārī Initiation is designed to encourage the students of Dhamma to study and practice Dhamma deeply and more seriously. Additionally, they are encouraged to teach Dhamma School for children, give introductory talks on Buddhism, give public Dhamma talks on simple topics, conduct basic meditation sessions and organize Dhamma study groups. The American Buddhist Seminary may even certify Dhammacārīs who have the proper background and in-depth knowledge of Dhamma for Buddhist counseling.

Its cleaning method is hot water extraction. The operator would park the van near the premises, connect the vacuum hose and solution line hose into the machine, bring the hoses into the building, and connect a carpet cleaning wand to the end of the hoses.  Benefits to the operator and the client  Typical small machines start off at and range up to . Van powered power take-off (PTO) units are available on the market. = Heat exchanger = The heat exchanger method uses heat naturally generated by the normal operation of the engine and in some cases, vacuum pump components of the system. Typically, water is routed through a heat exchanger, which consists of two separate sections. In one section, the heat is routed. In the second section, the water passes through. The two sections share two sides of common surfaces inside the exchanger; therefore heat is transferred from the \\"heat side\\" section with higher temperature to the \\"solution side\\" section with lower temperature. There are two basic types of heat exchangers. One, named, \\"shell and coil\\", has fluid passing through a coil of tubing which is contained in a \\"shell\\", or container, through which heat is routed. The other, called \\"shell and tube\\", contains several parallel tubes running from one end of the \\"shell\\" to the other. In the shell and tube configuration, heat travels through the parallel tubes and water travels through the shell. = Power = Traditionally, truckmount carpet cleaning machines have been more powerful than portable carpet cleaning units. Although recent changes in technology have allowed portable manufacturers to approach the power of truckmount carpet cleaning machines, to date truckmounts are more powerful as they produce the cleaning power from an engine and electric portables generate the cleaning power from an electrical socket in the customers home. The primary advantage of a truckmount lies with the carpet cleaning customer, as truckmounts do not need to use the customer's electricity or hot water so it means no costly electric and gas bills in the post long after the carpet cleaning company have left your home. Truckmounts also have a waste tank fitted so the technician can take the dirty water away and it does not end up down your sink or toilet, quick setup and easy use of the truckmount makes it preferable among professional cleaners. Regrettably only a small percentage of carpet cleaning companies use truckmounts as the cost is usually between $10,000 to $35,000 US, and is therefore out of reach for many small companies and professionals. Currently, it is estimated that only 28% of professional carpet cleaners use truckmount carpet cleaning machines. Many truckmount manufacturers are making environmental improvements such as LPG conversions or changes to make the machines use less petrol or diesel which makes them more environmentally friendly Most carpet manufacturers recommend a regular cleaning by hot water extraction, which is the method for carpet cleaning that is employed by truckmount carpet cleaners. Knockout truckmount propane heated  Main components of a truckmount  A petrol or diesel fueled engine powers a high pressure pump and vacuum blower by direct drive. The engine will generally have a starter motor fitted alone with a pull starter and an alternator that charges the battery and supplies 12 volt DC current to all the electrical components. An on demand electrical fuel pump is bolted to the fuel tank or the machine and supplies the carburetor or injectors on the engine with a fuel tank that is normally fitted to the chassis of the van to supply the fuel pump. A PTO or power take-off unit has the same driven components as a petrol or diesel driven unit except that the unit takes mechanical power from the vehicles engine via a specially fitted power take off unit which is usually fitted to the vehicle transmission. The power is usually transmitted via a drive shaft or hydraulic pump and motor. Heating the solution is either by a vehicle exhaust heat exchanger, coolant heater or LPG fired heater. The advantage is quieter running and lighter weight in addition to not having to maintain a second engine. The disadvantages are putting extra running hours on the vehicle engine and transmission. The PTO system is also usually vehicle specific so transferring the truckmount to another make or model of vehicle will require a new PTO system to be fitted. The vacuum blower lifts the dirty water from the carpet. The high pressure water pump pumps heated water and chemical onto the carpet. A heat exchanger or a water heater are fitted to the machine to heat the water up through the exhaust manifold system. Instead of a heat exchanger, some machines have a thermostat-controlled boiler that runs on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). A chemical injection system is in place that injects carpet cleaning chemical into the solution line on the low pressure or high pressure side, depending upon the model of the machine. Most machines have a mixer tank/water box which is a holding tank to store water for the high pressure pump on demand. Some machines have a magnetic water softener fitted to prevent buildup of minerals to protect the plumbing components. Some systems in America fit a deionizer to the plumbing to purify the water in order to protect the plumbing components and to give greater cleaning effect. A waste tank, fitted to the floor of the van, holds dirty water picked up by the suction hose powered by the vacuum blower. A vacuum hose connects to the carpet cleaning wand, delivering the dirty water to the waste tank, and a solution hose that pumps high pressure water and chemical from the high pressure system to the carpet cleaning wand.  Truckmount accessories  Cleaning tools connect to the vacuum and solution hose. Cleaning attachments such as upholstery tools for upholstery cleaning, and power heads and rotary tools for carpet, can also be used to further increase productivity and enhanced results on certain carpet types and soil conditions. The attachments to the machine are also an important factor in delivering the right amount of solution and also the extraction of the solution. A well-equipped operator will often have a large percentage of the cost of the machine invested in accessories, in order to achieve optimum results. A hose reel can be bolted to the floor of the van for storing the vacuum and solution hoses. Recently, electric rewind hose reels have been introduced to allow for quicker hose storage. A main water tank is often fitted to the floor of the van. It holds fresh water, supplying water directly to the high pressure pump or the mixer tank. When such a water tank is installed, an on-demand supply pump is bolted to the main water tank, supplying water to the mixer tank or high pressure pump. Where limited space is available, and a fresh water tank cannot be fitted, the machine will still retain its demand tank, but it will be fed from an outdoor \\"garden\\" water tap via a separate supply hose reel. This, of course, requires that the property has an external cold water tap, which can be hard to find on some commercial sites. However, by carrying a range of different fittings, a tap key (for taps that have their handle removed to avoid unwanted water usage), and enough hose on the reel, the cleaner will usually be able to handle this situation.

He is noted for work on several complex variables. One of his achievements is a classification of 2-dimensional bounded Reinhardt domains. He obtained a subsequent research fellowship with Professor Francesco Severi in Rome to explore how algebraic geometry could be integrated into the theory of functions of several complex variables.  International career  In 1952 he left Latin America for Switzerland where he worked at the International Labour Organization. After he retired from the ILO he went on to teach at the University of Fribourg. He considered returning to Germany at times, but had difficulty securing a position and regaining German citizenship.  Personal life  Peter Thullen was an enthusiastic Wandervogel and active in the Catholic youth movement and opposed the rise of Nazism. He at first studied in Italy on a grant, and was able to observe developments in Germany from abroad. He decided he would not return to Germany so long as Hitler remained in power. After marriage, he moved to Quito, Ecuador with his wife. At the time he left for Ecuador he did not even know where Quito was located.

At first he collaborated with local ceramic producers (Marazzi Group) and with Industries D'Agostino in Salerno, Italy. In 1954, after selling an innovative patent to Ceramiche Marazzi (biscuit selection unit), he was able to initiate startup of his own equipment supply business. Leo Morandi's innovations, knowledge, and experience aided growth and advancement throughout the Sassuolo ceramic companies, which in the 1960s constituted the worldwide known Sassuolo tile district. Impact on industry In particular, he used two electrodes to select the biscuit; the passage of electricity through the material showed that it was not suitable for the successive glazing. The production chain for ceramic tiles was then mainly handcrafted and labour-intensive, but Leo Morandi's inventions started the successful automation of various units. After the initial years he was able to open a distinct efficient production unit. Morandi was a reserved man and did not like publicity. He involved his workers and customers in the improvement of his inventions and innovations. left Ceramic industry equipment examples include: automated floor tile edge glaze remover, automated packaging (floor tiles where historically bound with thin iron wire, before shipment), specialized silk screen machines, the peristaltic pump, the transport line, the hydraulic press, tile overturning mechanism, press reception unit, and glazing applications done with disk booths. These basic tile processing elements are still in use. Leo Morandi began exporting these proven automated Italian ceramic industry innovations to Spain, allowing advancement of two primary ceramic industry clusters.

R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. The term is equivalent to the term Miðgarðr of Norse mythology, describing the human-inhabited world, that is, the central continent of the Earth in Tolkien's imagined mythological past. Tolkien's most widely read works, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, are set entirely in Middle-earth; \\"Middle-earth\\" has also become a short-hand for the legendarium and Tolkien's fictional take on the world. Middle-earth is the main continent of Earth (Arda) in an imaginary period of the Earth's past with the end of the Third Age about 6,000 years ago. Tolkien's Middle-earth stories mostly focus on the north-west of the continent. This part of Middle-earth is suggestive of Europe, the north-west of the Old World, with the environs of the Shire intended to be reminiscent of England (more specifically, the West Midlands, with Hobbiton set at the same latitude as Oxford). Context: Tolkien's legendarium Arda began as a symmetrical flat disc, and was repeatedly transformed through cataclysmic interventions by the Valar and by the creator, Eru Iluvatar. Tolkien's stories chronicle the struggle to control the world (called Arda) and the continent of Middle-earth: on one side, the angelic Valar, the Elves and their allies among Men; on the other, the demonic Melkor or Morgoth (a Vala fallen into evil) and his minions, mostly Orcs, Dragons and enslaved Men.The Silmarillion, ch. 3 \\"Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor\\" In later ages, after Morgoth's defeat and expulsion from Arda, his place was taken by his lieutenant Sauron, a Maia.The Silmarillion, \\"Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age\\" The Valar withdrew from direct involvement in the affairs of Middle-earth after the defeat of Morgoth, but in later years they sent the wizards or Istari to help in the struggle against Sauron. The most important wizards were Gandalf the Grey and Saruman the White. Gandalf remained true to his mission and proved crucial in the fight against Sauron. Saruman, however, became corrupted and sought to establish himself as a rival to Sauron for absolute power in Middle-earth. Other races involved in the struggle against evil were Dwarves, Ents and most famously Hobbits. The early stages of the conflict are chronicled in The Silmarillion, while the final stages of the struggle to defeat Sauron are told in The Hobbit and in The Lord of the Rings. Conflict over the possession and control of precious or magical objects is a recurring theme in the stories. The First Age is dominated by the doomed quest of the elf Fëanor and most of his Noldorin clan to recover three precious jewels called the Silmarils that Morgoth stole from them (hence the title The Silmarillion). The Second and Third Age are dominated by the forging of the Rings of Power, and the fate of the One Ring forged by Sauron, which gives its wearer the power to control or influence those wearing the other Rings of Power (hence the title The Lord of the Rings). Etymology In ancient Germanic mythology, the world of Men is known by several names, such as Midgard, Middenheim, Manaheim, and Middengeard. The Old English middangeard descends from an earlier Germanic word and so has cognates such as the Old Norse Miðgarðr from Norse mythology, transliterated to modern English as Midgard.Letters, #165 to the Houghton Mifflin Co., 30 June 1955 =Use by Tolkien= Tolkien first encountered the term middangeard in an Old English fragment he studied in 1914: > Éala éarendel engla beorhtast / ofer middangeard monnum sended. > Hail Earendel, brightest of angels / above the middle-earth sent unto men. This is from the Crist poems by Cynewulf. The name Éarendel was the inspiration for Tolkien's mariner Eärendil,Letters, #297 draft for a letter to a 'Mr Rang', August 1967 who set sail from the lands of Middle-earth to ask for aid from the angelic powers, the Valar. Tolkien's earliest poem about Eärendil, from 1914, the same year he read the Crist poems, refers to \\"the mid-world's rim\\". Tolkien considered middangeard to be \\"the abiding place of men\\",Letters, #151 to Hugh Brogan, 18 September 1954; #183, Notes on W. H. Auden's review of The Return of the King, 1956; and #283 to Benjamin P. Indick, 7 January 1966 the physical world in which Man lives out his life and destiny, as opposed to the unseen worlds above and below it, namely Heaven and Hell.Letters, #211 to Rhona Beare, 14 October 1958 He began to use the term \\"Middle-earth\\" in the late 1930s, in place of the earlier terms \\"Great Lands\\", \\"Outer Lands\\", and \\"Hither Lands\\". The term \\"Middle-earth\\" appears in drafts of The Lord of the Rings, and the first published appearance of the word \\"Middle-earth\\" in Tolkien's works is in the Prologue to that work: \\"Hobbits had, in fact, lived quietly in Middle-earth for many long years before other folk even became aware of them.\\" =Extended usage= Arda versus \\"Middle- earth\\": Middle-earth is in geographic terms the name of the continent inhabited by Elves, Dwarves and Men, while Arda is the name of the world. However, \\"Middle-earth\\" is widely used for the whole of Tolkien's legendarium. The term Middle-earth has come to be applied as a short-hand for the entirety of Tolkien's legendarium, instead of the technically more appropriate, but lesser known terms Arda for the physical world and Eä for the physical reality of creation as a whole. This wider use is reflected in book titles such as The Complete Guide to Middle-earth, The Road to Middle-earth, The Atlas of Middle- earth, and the series The History of Middle-earth. =In other works= There are allusions to Middle-earth in the work of other writers both before and after him. William Morris's translation of the Volsung Saga calls the world \\"Midgard\\". The poem \\"The Gray Magician\\" (1918) by Margaret Widdemer says: \\"I was living very merrily on Middle Earth / As merry as a maid may be / Till the Gray Magician came down along the road / And flung his cobweb cloak on me...\\" C. S. Lewis's Space Trilogy, calls the home planet \\"Middle-earth\\" and specifically references Tolkien's legendarium. Geography Within the overall context of his legendarium, Tolkien's Middle-earth was part of his created world of Arda (which includes the Undying Lands of Aman and Eressëa, removed from the rest of the physical world), which itself was part of the wider creation he called Eä. Aman and Middle-earth are separated from each other by the Great Sea Belegaer (analogous to the Atlantic Ocean). The western continent, Aman, was the home of the Valar, and the Elves called the Eldar.The Silmarillion, ch. 3 \\"Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor\\" The eastern side of Middle-earth was washed by the Eastern Sea. Most of the events in Tolkien's stories take place in the north-west of Middle-earth. In the First Age, further to the north-west was the subcontinent Beleriand; it was engulfed by the ocean at the end of the First Age. =Maps= Tolkien prepared several maps of Middle-earth. Some were published in his lifetime. The main maps are those published in The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion, and Unfinished Tales, and appear as foldouts or illustrations. Tolkien insisted that maps be included in the book for the benefit of readers, despite the expense involved.Letters #137 to Rayner Unwin, 11 April 1953; #139 to Rayner Unwin, 8 August 1953; #141 to Allen & Unwin, 9 October 1953; #144 to Naomi Mitchison, 25 April 1954; #160 to Rayner Unwin, 6 March 1955; #161 to Rayner Unwin, 18 April 1955 The definitive and iconic map of Middle-earth was published in The Lord of the Rings, and refined by the illustrator Pauline Baynes into a stand-alone poster, \\"A Map of Middle-earth\\". =Cosmology= The Downfall of Númenor and the Changing of the World. The intervention of Eru Ilúvatar cataclysmically reshaped Arda into a sphere. In Tolkien's conception, Arda (the Earth) was created specifically as \\"the Habitation\\" (Imbar or Ambar) for the Children of Ilúvatar (Elves and Men). It is envisaged in a flat Earth cosmology, with the stars, and later also the sun and moon, revolving around it. Tolkien's sketches show a disc-like face for the world which looked up to the stars. However, Tolkien's legendarium addresses the spherical Earth paradigm by depicting a catastrophic transition from a flat to a spherical world, in which Aman became inaccessible to mortal Men. =Correspondence with the geography of Earth= Tolkien described the region in which the Hobbits lived as \\"the North-West of the Old World, east of the Sea\\",The Fellowship of the Ring, \\"Prologue\\" and the north-west of the Old World is essentially Europe (including Britain). However, as he noted in private letters, the geographies do not match, and he did not consciously make them match when he was writing:Letters, #169 to Hugh Brogan, 11 September 1955 In another letter, Tolkien made correspondences in latitude between Europe and Middle-earth: He did confirm, however, that the Shire, the land of his Hobbit heroes, was based on England.Letters, #190 to Rayner Unwin, 3 July 1956 In the Prologue to The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien writes: \\"Those days, the Third Age of Middle-earth, are now long past, and the shape of all lands has been changed...\\"The Fellowship of the Ring, \\"Prologue\\" The Appendices make several references in both history and etymology of topics 'now' (in modern English languages) and 'then' (ancient languages); Both the Appendices and The Silmarillion mention constellations, stars and planets that correspond to those seen in the northern hemisphere of Earth, including the Sun, the Moon, Orion (and his belt),The Silmarillion, p. 44 \\"Menelmacar with his shining belt\\" Ursa MajorThe Silmarillion, p. 45 \\"And high in the north as a challenge to Melkor she set the crown of seven mighty stars to swing, Valacirca, the Sickle of the Valar...\\"The Fellowship of the Ring, book 1, ch. 8 \\"Strider\\" \\"The Sickle [The Hobbits' name for the Plough or Great Bear] was swinging bright above the shoulders of Bree-hill.\\" and Mars. A map annotated by Tolkien places Hobbiton on the same latitude as Oxford, and Minas Tirith at the latitude of Ravenna, Italy. He used Belgrade, Cyprus, and Jerusalem as further reference points. History Tolkien imagined Arda as the Earth in the distant past. With the loss of all its peoples except Man, and the reshaping of the continents, all that is left of Middle-earth is a dim memory in folklore, legend, and old words. The outlines of the continents are purely schematic. The history of Middle-earth, as described in The Silmarillion, began when the Ainur entered Arda, following the creation events in the Ainulindalë and long ages of labour throughout Eä, the fictional universe.The Silmarillion, \\"Ainulindalë\\" Time from that point was measured using Valian Years, though the subsequent history of Arda was divided into three time periods using different years, known as the Years of the Lamps, the Years of the Trees and the Years of the Sun.The Silmarillion, ch. 1 \\"Of the Beginning of Days\\" A separate, overlapping chronology divides the history into 'Ages of the Children of Ilúvatar'. The first such Age began with the Awakening of the Elves during the Years of the Trees and continued for the first six centuries of the Years of the Sun. All the subsequent Ages took place during the Years of the Sun.The Silmarillion, ch. 3 \\"Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor\\" Arda is, as critics have noted, \\"our own green and solid Earth at some quite remote epoch in the past.\\" As such, it has not only an immediate story but a history, and the whole thing is an \\"imagined prehistory\\" of the Earth as it is now. Peoples and their languages =Ainur= The Ainur were angelic beings created by Ilúvatar. The cosmological myth called the Ainulindalë, or \\"Music of the Ainur\\", describes how the Ainur sang for Ilúvatar, who then created Eä to give material form to their music. Many of the Ainur entered Eä, and the greatest of these were called the Valar. Melkor, the chief agent of evil in Eä, and later called Morgoth, was initially one of the Valar. With the Valar came lesser spirits of the Ainur, called the Maiar. Melian, the wife of the Elven King Thingol in the First Age, was a Maia. There were also evil Maiar, including the Balrogs and the second Dark Lord, Sauron. Sauron devised the Black Speech (Burzum) for his slaves (such as Orcs) to speak. In the Third Age, five of the Maiar were embodied and sent to Middle-earth to help the free peoples to overthrow Sauron. These are the Istari or Wizards, including Gandalf, Saruman, and Radagast.Unfinished Tales, p. 388 =Elves= The Elves are known as \\"the Firstborn\\" of Ilúvatar: intelligent beings created by Ilúvatar alone, with many different clans. Originally Elves all spoke the same Common Eldarin ancestral tongue, but over thousands of years it diverged into different languages. The two main Elven languages were Quenya, spoken by the Light Elves, and Sindarin, spoken by the Dark Elves. Physically the Elves resemble humans; indeed, they can marry and have children with them, as shown by the few Half-elven in the legendarium. The Elves are agile and quick footed, being able to walk a tightrope unaided. Their eyesight is keen. Elves are immortal, unless killed in battle. They are re-embodied in Valinor if killed. =Men= Men were \\"the Secondborn\\" of the Children of Ilúvatar: they awoke in Middle-earth later (indeed much later) than the Elves. Men (and Hobbits) were the last humanoid race to appear in Middle-earth: Dwarves, Ents and Orcs also preceded them. The capitalized term \\"Man\\" (plural \\"Men\\") is used as a gender-neutral racial description, to distinguish humans from the other human-like races of Middle-earth. In appearance they are much like Elves, but on average less beautiful. Unlike Elves, Men are mortal, ageing and dying quickly, usually living 40–80 years. However the Númenóreans could live several centuries, and their descendants the Dúnedain also tended to live longer than regular humans. This tendency was weakened both by time and by intermingling with lesser peoples. =Dwarves= The Dwarves are a race of humanoids shorter than Men, and larger than Hobbits. They are mortal like Men, but live much longer, usually several hundred years. A peculiarity of Dwarves is that both males and females are bearded, and thus appear identical to outsiders. The language spoken by Dwarves is called Khuzdul, and was kept largely as a secret language for their own use. Like Men and Hobbits, Dwarves live exclusively in Middle-earth. They generally reside under mountains, where they are specialists in mining and metalwork. =Hobbits= Tolkien identified Hobbits as an offshoot of the race of Men. Another name for Hobbit is 'Halfling', as they were generally only half the size of Men. In their lifestyle and habits they closely resemble Men, and in particular Englishmen, except for their preference for living in holes underground. By the time of The Hobbit, most of them lived in the Shire, a region of the northwest of Middle-earth, having migrated there from further east. =Other humanoid peoples= The Ents were shepherds of trees, their name coming from an Old English word for giant. Orcs and Trolls (made of stone) were evil creatures bred by Morgoth. They were not original creations but rather \\"mockeries\\" of the Children of Ilúvatar and Ents, since only Ilúvatar has the ability to give conscious life to things. The precise origins of Orcs and Trolls are unclear, as Tolkien considered various possibilities and sometimes changed his mind, leaving several inconsistent accounts. Late in the Third Age, the Uruks or Uruk-hai appeared: a race of Orcs of great size and strength that tolerate sunlight better than ordinary Orcs. Tolkien also mentions \\"Men-orcs\\" and \\"Orc- men\\"; or \\"half-orcs\\" or \\"goblin-men\\". They share some characteristics with Orcs (like \\"slanty eyes\\") but look more like men. =Dragons= Dragons (or \\"worms\\") appear in several varieties, distinguished by whether they have wings and whether they breathe fire (cold-drakes versus fire-drakes). The first of the fire-drakes (Urulóki in Quenya)The Silmarillion index entry Urulóki was Glaurung the Golden, bred by Morgoth in Angband, and called \\"The Great Worm\\", \\"The Worm of Morgoth\\", and \\"The Father of Dragons\\".The Silmarillion, ch. 24 \\"Of the Voyage of Eärendil\\" =Sapient animals= Middle-earth contains sapient animals including the Eagles,The Fellowship of the Ring, \\"The Council of Elrond\\" Huan the Great Hound from Valinor and the wolf-like Wargs. In general the origins and nature of these animals are unclear. Giant spiders such as Shelob descended from Ungoliant, of unknown origin.The Two Towers, book 4, chapter 9: \\"Shelob's Lair.\\" Other sapient species include the Crebain, evil crows who become spies for Saruman, and the Ravens of Erebor, who brought news to the Dwarves. The horse-line of the Mearas of Rohan, especially Gandalf's mount, Shadowfax, also appear to be intelligent and understand human speech. Beorn had a number of animal friends about his house. Books Adaptations =Films= The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, both set in Middle-earth, have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and live-action shorts were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an animated TV special in 1977. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated The Lord of the Rings. The rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios. New Line Cinema released the first part of director Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film series in 2001 as part of a trilogy; it was followed by a prequel trilogy in The Hobbit film series with several of the same actors playing their old roles. Collectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 Academy Award nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. There have been several fan films of Middle-earth such as The Hunt for Gollum and Born of Hope, uploaded to YouTube on 8 May 2009 and 11 December 2009 respectively. =Games= Numerous computer and video games have been inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien's works set in Middle-earth. Titles have been produced by studios such as Electronic Arts, Vivendi Games, Melbourne House, and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Aside from officially licensed games, many Tolkien-inspired mods, custom maps and total conversions have been made for many games, such as Warcraft III, Minecraft, Rome: Total War, Medieval II: Total War, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. In addition, there are many text-based MMORPGs (known as MU*s) based on Middle-earth. The oldest of these dates back to 1991, and was known as Middle-Earth MUD, run by using LPMUD.Groups.google.com, rec.games.mud.lp Newsgroup, 1 June 1994 After Middle-Earth MUD ended in 1992, it was followed by Elendor and MUME (Multi-Users in Middle-earth).For a (rather long) list of all the Tolkien inspired MU*s go to The Mud Connector and run a search for 'tolkien'.

He was distinguished for leading the Indian 17th Infantry Division during almost the entire Burma Campaign. Early career and inter-war years Cowan was educated at Reading School and Glasgow University. He was commissioned into the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in 1915. Awarded the Military CrossLondon Gazette 25 August 1916 as a Second Lieutenant and mentioned in despatches, he was attached to the Indian Army in 1917, his appointment being confirmed in March 1918 whilst serving with the 4th battalion 3rd Gurkha Rifles.London Gazette 26 March 1918 He later joined the 6th Gurkha Rifles. Between the wars, he served on the North-West frontier (where he was again mentioned in despatches for service in Waziristan) and in various staff positions. From 1932 to 1934, he was the Chief Instructor at the Indian Military Academy and in 1937 he was once more mentioned in despatches during a further tour of duty in Waziristan. By the outbreak of World War II, he was in command of the 1st Battalion 6th Gurkha Rifles. World War II He was appointed a General Staff Officer, 1st grade in India from 18 September 1940 to 17 February 1941.Half Yearly Army List January 1946 Appointed acting brigadier, he was Director of Military Training in India from 18 February 1941 to 30 September 1941, then Deputy Director of Military Training in India 1 October 1941 to 14 December 1941, then Director of Military Training in India from 15 December 1941 to 1 March 1942.Half Yearly Army List January 1946 When the Japanese invaded Burma, he was posted to Rangoon, initially as a staff officer in Burma Army HQ with rather ill-defined duties, but was appointed acting Major-General and commander of the Indian 17th Infantry Division when its previous commander, Jackie Smyth VC, was relieved after a bridge was blown behind the retreating division and much of it was cut off. He remained in command of the division for the rest of the Burma Campaign: during the retreat into India, the fighting around Tiddim in 1943, the Battle of Imphal in 1944 and the drive into Central Burma in 1945. Early in 1945, his son was killed whilst serving as an officer in Cowan's old unit (1/6 Gurkha Rifles). He fought the decisive Battle of Meiktila having suffered this loss, although only a few close friends were aware of it. For his leadership in Burma he was twice awarded the Distinguished Service Order. His army commander, Bill Slim, was later to write about Cowan's handling of the Meiktila battle: He was promoted to the rank of substantive Major-General on 12 February 1945.Half Yearly Army List January 1946 A fine picture of the soldier's life, fighting in his Division, is found in George MacDonald Fraser's memoir \\"Quartered Safe Out Here\\" (London, Harvill 1993). He was intended to lead the Indian army contingent of the Commonwealth Corps being tentatively formed to participate in the planned invasion of Japan. The surrender of Japan changed these plans, and Cowan instead led the joint British-Indian division BRINDIV, part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, in Japan. In 1947, he handed over command of this force and retired from the army.

Their territory included the entire region between the rivers Asamus and Eordaicus (whose union forms the Apsus), the plateau of Korça locked by the fortress of Pelion and, towards the north it extended to Lake Lychnidus up to the Black Drin.

One of the most important settlements in their territory was established at Selcë e Poshtme near the western shore of Lake Lychnidus, where the Illyrian Royal Tombs were built.; The Dassaretii were one of the most prominent Illyrian tribes of southern Illyria, which formed the ancient Illyrian kingdom that was established in this region.; . According to a number of modern scholars the dynasty of Bardylis, which is the first attested Illyrian dynasty, was Dassaretan.; ; ; ; ; ; . From the 3rd century BC onwards they were attested as one of the largest Illyrian tribes of the region, and in different periods they changed their rulers, being alternatively under the Illyrian (Ardiaean/Labeatan) kingdom, the Madedonian kingdom and the Roman Republic. In Hellenistic times the Dassaretii minted coins bearing the inscription of their ethnicon. Name The tribal name Dassaret- is of Illyrian origin, stemming from Illyrian *daksa/dassa (\\"water, sea\\") attached to the suffix -ar. It is related to Illyrian personal names Dazos and Dassius and is also reflected in the toponym of Daksa island and the river Ardaxanos, which is mentioned by Polybius (2nd century BC) in the hinterland of modern Durrës and Lezhë. The tribal name Sessarethes (or Sesarethii), mentioned for the first time by Hecataeus (6th century BC) as an Illyrian tribe holding the city of Sesarethus in the territory of the Illyrian Taulantii, seems to have been a variant of Dassaretes. The variant Sesarethii is also mentioned by Strabo (1st century BC – 1st century AD) as an alternative name of the Enchelei. The tribal name Dexaroi, recorded as a Chaonian tribe by Stephanus of Byzantium (6th century AD) citing Hecataeus, has likely the same root as the Illyrian Dassaretii. According to a mythological tradition reported by Appian (2nd century AD), the Dassaretii were among the South-Illyrian tribes that took their names from the first generation of the descendants of Illyrius, the eponymous ancestor of all the Illyrian peoples. The Illyrian Dassaretii are often mentioned by Polybius (The Histories) and Livy (Ab Urbe Condita Libri) in their accounts of the Illyrian Wars and Macedonian Wars. They are also mentioned by Strabo (Geographica. VII. p. 316), Appian (Illyrike. 1), Pomponius Mela (De situ orbis libri III. II. 3), Pliny (Natural History. III. 23), Ptolemy (Geography. p. 83) and Stephanus of Byzantium (Ethnica. \\"Δασσαρῆται\\"). Their name appears also on coins of the Hellenistic period bearing the inscription ΔΑΣΣΑΡΗΤΙΩΝ. Geography = Territory = The territory inhabited by the Dassaretii has been documented in literary sources dating from the Roman period. The Dassaretii were located between the tribes of Parthini (who dwelled in the Shkumbin valley) and Atintanes (who inhabited in the mountain ranges between Asamus and Aous rivers). The extent of the territory of Dassaretii seems to have been considerable, since it included the entire region between the rivers Asamus and Eordaicus (whose union forms the Apsus), the plateau of Korça locked by the fortress of Pelion and, towards the north it extended to Lake Lychnidus up to the omonym city. Although Lake Ohrid and Lake Prespa are usually called \\"Dassaretan Lakes\\", only Ohrid was part of Dassaretan territory, while the region of Prespa was likely part of Macedon. The territory inhabited by Dassaretii was thus a central area of southern Illyria, directly in contact with the regions of Orestis and Lynkestis of Upper Macedonia. Livy (1st century BC) reports that following the victory of 167, the Roman Senate decided to give freedom to \\"Issenses et Taulantios, Dassaretiorum Pirustas, Rhizonitas, Olciniatas\\", rewarded because they abandoned the Illyrian kingdom of Gentius a little before his defeat. For a similar reason Daorsi too gained immunitas, while half of the tax had to be paid by \\"Scodrensibus et Dassarensibus et Selepitanis ceterisque Illyriis\\" (\\"the inhabitants of Scodra, Dassarenses and Seleptani, as well as by other Illyrians\\"). Some scholars have suggested that Livy's material follows exclusively Polybius (2nd century BC). However, it is contradicted by the fact that Lyvian texts reports Illyrian toponyms and ethnonyms principally located in the core of the Illyrian kingdom (Ardiaean–Labeatan dynasty), north of Via Egnatia, except for Taulantii and Dassaretii, a situation different from that of the 2nd century BC. An evident relation between the Pirustae and Dassaretii appears in the text, but the Pirustae are thought to have been located much further north of Dassaretii. This could be explained by the possibility that Pirustae had various locations in different periods, the presence two homonym tribes or with a similar name, or by an unknown and hypothetical Dassaretii expansion to the north. = Settlements = Polybius mentions Pelion, Antipatreia, Chrysondyon, Gertous and Creonion as Dassaretan cities in the 2nd century BC. The precise location seems to have been found however only for Antipatreia, identified with modern Berat. The city of Lychnidos located on the edge of the omonym lake, was the chief city of the Illyrian tribe of Dassaretii. The settlement of Hija e Korbit in the Korça plain at the Devoll river (ancient Eordaicus) has been probably one of the relevant commercial and military sites of the Illyrian Dassaretii. One of the most prominent settlements in the region of Illyrian Dassaretii was established at Selcë e Poshtme, where the Illyrian Royal Tombs were built. Culture =Language= The idiom spoken by the tribe of Dassaretii belonged to the southeastern Illyrian linguistic area. =Religion= Several cult-objects with similar features are found in different Illyrian regions, including the territory of the Illyrian tribes of Dassaretii, Labeatae, Daorsi, and comprising also the Iapodes. In particular, a 3rd century BC silvered bronze belt buckle, found inside the Illyrian Tombs of Selça e Poshtme near the western shore of Lake Lychnidus in Dassaretan territory, depicts a scene of warriors and horsemen in combat, with a giant serpent as a protector totem of one of the horsemen; a very similar belt was found also in the necropolis of Gostilj near the Lake Scutari in the territory of the Labeatae, indicating a common hero-cult practice in those regions. Modern scholars suggest that the iconographic representation of the same mythological event includes the Illyrian cults of the serpent, of Cadmus, and of the horseman, the latter being a common Paleo-Balkan hero. The cult of Artemis under the epithet Άγρότα, Agrota was practiced in southern Illyria, in particular during the Hellenistic and Roman Imperial times. The worship of Artemis Agrota, \\"Artemis the Huntress\\", is considered an Illyrian indigenous cult since it was widespread only in southern Illyria, stretching from the Illyrian Dassaretan territory up to Dalmatia, including also the territory of Apollonia. In later Roman times, the cult of Diana Candaviensis, which has been interpreted as \\"Artemis the Huntress\\", was practiced up to the region north of Lake Shkodra (ancient lacus labeatis), including also the territory of the Docleatae. Political organization =Illyrian Realm= Royal tomb III, Selca e Poshtme near the western shore of Lake Lychnidus, Albania. Dassaretii were one of the tribes forming the ancient Illyrian kingdom that was established in the region of southern Illyria. Ancient sources and modern scholars hold that one of the first kingdoms established in this region was that of the Enchelei. It seems that the weakening of the kingdom of Enchelae resulted in their assimilation and inclusion into a newly established Illyrian realm at the latest in the 5th century BC, marking the arising of the Dassaretii, who appear to have replaced the Encheleans in the lakeland area (Ohrid and Prespa). According to a historical reconstruction, Bardylis founded a powerful Illyrian dynasty among the Dassaretii in the 5th century BC, and established a realm centered in their territory that comprised the area along Lychnidus and east to the Prespa Lakes, which was called \\"Dassaretis\\" later in Roman times. A fragment of Callisthenes ( 360 – 327 BC) which places Bardylis' realm between Molossis and Macedonia, well determines the position of that Illyrian kingdom in the area of Dassaretis. Bardylis' expansion in Upper Macedonia and Molossis, and his son Cleitus' revolt at Pelion in Dassaretis against Alexander the Great make this localization of the core of their realm even more plausible. The establishment of a tribal realm centered in the rich region of the Illyrian Dassaretii seems supported also by numismatic and epigraphic evidence. The Illyrian Royal Tombs of Selca e Poshtme are located in the Illyrian Dassaretan region. The site of Selcë was in the past a flourishing economical centre more developed than the surroundings because it occupied a predominant position inside the region currently called Mokër, and because it controlled the road which led from the Adriatic coasts of Illyria to Macedonia. A helmet reporting the inscription of the name of the Illyrian king Monunius was found in the area of lake Lychnidus in the territory of the Illyrian tribe of Dassaretii. It has been interpreted as a possible component of the equipment of a royal special force, suggesting also a financial activity of this king. Dating back to the 3rd century BC, the inscriptions of Monunius are considered the oldest known in the area. Before the year 229 the Illyrian tribe of Dassaretii had been under the rule of the Illyrian kingdom of the Ardiaei, and they controlled the mountain passes eastwards over the Pindus on the border with Macedon. The retreat to the north and in later times the destruction of the Illyrian kingdom highlighted numerous communities in southern Illyria – including the Dassaretii – that were organized in koina, as evidenced by historical sources, coins and epigraphic material. Illyrian dynasty The following is a list of the members of Bardylis' Illyrian dynasty recorded as such in ancient sources, whose realm was centered in the territory of the Dassaretii as claimed by a number of modern scholars:; ; ; ; ; ; . *Bardylis I ( 448 – 358 BC) *Cleitus ( 335 BC), son of Bardylis I *Bardylis II ( 300 BC), son of Cleitus Grabus I ( 5th century BC) and Grabus II ( 357 – 356 BC), who most likely was the son of the former, should also have ruled in the same region of southern Illyria, however there are not enough historical elements to determine whether or not they were of the same dynasty as Bardylis I. The same observation applies in the case of Monunius I ( 280 BC) and Mytilus ( 270 BC). =Roman times institutions= Ancient historian Polybius ( 2nd century BC) describes peoples of Illyria, like the Dassaretae and the Ardiaei, using the term ethnos, with the meaning of \\"tribes\\" within wider national units. After defeating the Macedonians in 196 BC, Roman consul Titus Quinctius Flamininus assigned to the Illyrian (Labeatan) king Plauratus, son of Skerdilaidas, the regions of the Parthini and Lychnis, which were previously occupied by Philip V of Macedon, and the territory of the Dassaretii was also likely detached from Macedon. Thus, after the Roman campaigns in Macedonia the Dassaretii were declared independent as Roman allies, like the Orestae, and they established autonomous political entities under the Roman protectorate. The Dassaretioi were mentioned in Imperial times in many inscriptions as either having an executive power or as dedicants. The official of the highest rank was, most likely, the strategos, whose seat seems to have been located in Lychnidos. However, the Dassaretioi were not mentioned in a single inscription together with the polis of Lychnidos. This indicates that from the Hellenistic period they seem to have been separate political entities. It has been suggested that the tribe of Dassaretioi and the city of Lychnidos might have formed some kind of political confederation (similar to a koinon) based on the unification of various tribes or various towns and villages. This type of political organisation were quite widespread in the Balkans during the Classical and Hellenistic periods. Some of these confederations survived until Imperial times, such as that of the Bylliones. Stephanus of Byzantium () describes the Dassaretai as an Illyrian ethnos and does not associate them with a city. He seems to have used the term ethnos to describe the Dassaretan community in conformation to Anthony Snodgrass' definition: “In its purest form the ethnos was no more than a survival of the tribal system into historical times: a population scattered thinly over a territory without urban centres, united politically and in customs and religion, normally governed by means of some periodical assembly at a single centre, and worshipping a tribal deity at a common religious centre”. Snodgrass presents indeed the ethnos as the prehistoric precursor of the polis describing it “no more than a survival of the tribal system into historical times”. Economy The region of the Illyrian tribe of Dassaretii bordered the regions of Macedonia and Molossia. Including the valleys of Osum and Devoll rivers, stretching to the east into the Korçë Plain, and comprising the area around lake Ohrid, the Illyrian Dassaretan region was rich in natural resources and was located in a strategic geographical position that aroused the political wishes of the neighbours and the interest of the Greek merchants. The prosperous site of Selcë was important in the region, because it occupied a prominent military and commercial position and predominated in the area near Via Egnatia, which was established in Roman times. Some of its natural resources were the stone quarries. The area was likely also close to the silver mines of Damastion. The Dassaretii minted coins in Hellenistic times. Coins bearing the inscription ΔΑΣΣΑΡΗΤΙΩΝ (DASSARETION) have been found in the region of Lake Lychnidus. In Roman times the Dassaretii may have practiced transhumance in southern Illyria.

His writings became particularly influential for the development of theoretical biology in Russia and several other countries. In 1925 he moved from Hungary to Russia. Since 1933 he lived in Leningrad. His first wife was a writer Margit Kaffka (who died in 1918), and his second wife was a mathematician Stefánia Szilárd.

The Hungarian Quarterly 178: 123-131.  Research  Ervin Bauer formulated the principle of stable non-equilibrium state which he considered as the basic characteristics of living matter. According to Bauer, living systems function in the expense of non-equilibrium, and the external energy is used not directly to perform work but to support the stable non-equilibrium state. Bauer's principle is incorporated into non-linear thermodynamics of irreversible processes. Living systems in this framework cannot support their organization only due to the influx of external energy, i.e. the ordering internal factor is involved. The activity of living system is fully determined by the internal pattern of its non-equilibrium state and any work performed by the biological system appears as the work of its structural forces. The process of evolution, according to Bauer, corresponds to the increase in external work, which aims to exploit additional resources to maintain living state of evolving biosystems.

Martin was the son and heir of Sir John Fortescue ( 1394 – c. 1480) of Ebrington in Gloucestershire, Chief Justice of the King's Bench of England and the author of De Laudibus Legum AngliæFoss (1870) p.278 and was the nephew of the latter's elder brother Sir Henry Fortescue (fl. 1426), Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in Ireland.Vivian, p.353 Education Fortescue was educated at Barnstaple Grammar School in North Devon, where he met the poet John Gay (1685–1732), who become a lifelong friend. He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford in 1705. Judicial career The early death of Fortescue's wife prompted him to become a barrister, and he was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1714, and transferred to the Inner Temple later in the same year before his call to the Bar in July 1715. Fortescue was a \\"sound and businesslike\\" barrister, and a \\"good lawyer\\", and built up a strong practice. He first became involved in politics in 1724 when Robert Walpole, Chancellor of the Exchequer, employed him as his secretary. In 1727 he was returned as a Member of Parliament for Newport, on the Isle of Wight, and despite his duties in Parliament and as secretary to Walpole he continued his practice as a barrister. In 1730 he became a King's Counsel, and in the same year was made Attorney General to the Duchy of Cornwall. On 9 February 1736 he was appointed a Baron of the Exchequer, having resigned as an MP and as Attorney General. He was transferred to the Court of Common Pleas on 7 July 1738, replacing John Comyns,Foss (1865) p.77 and on 5 November 1741 he succeeded Sir John Verney as Master of the Rolls and became a Privy Councillor on 19 November. He remained Master of the Rolls until his death on 15 December 1749. Literary career As well as his work as a barrister and judge, Fortescue was also involved in the London literary scene, having been introduced by his school friend John Gay to Alexander Pope, and he became a founding member of the Scriblerus Club. He was a co-author with Pope of \\"Stradling versus Stiles\\", and Pope dedicated his Imitation of the First Satire of Horace to him. Marriage and children On 7 July 1709 he married his cousin, Mary Fortescue (d.1710), daughter of Edmund Fortescue (1660–1734) of East Allington, from a junior branch of the Fortescues of Fallapit in the parish of East Allington,Vivian, p.360; p.366, Fortescue of Fallapit Devon, descended from Sir Henry Fortescue (fl. 1426), Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in Ireland, who had married the heiress of Fallapit. Mary died an early death on 1 August 1710 and her monument exists in St Andrew's Church, East Allington.Vivian, p.360 She bore him a daughter and sole heiress: *Mary Fortescue (1710–1752), who inherited the estate of Fallapit from her mother. She married John Spooner and produced an only daughter Mary Fortescue (d.1747) who died an infant.

Blue Java banana in Maui, Hawaii. The Blue Java (also known as blue bananas, Ice Cream banana, Hawaiian banana, Ney Mannan, Krie, or Cenizo) is a hardy, cold- tolerant banana cultivar known for its sweet aromatic fruit, which is said to have an ice cream-like consistency and flavor reminiscent of vanilla. Taxonomy and nomenclature The Blue Java banana is a triploid (ABB) hybrid of the seeded banana Musa balbisiana and Musa acuminata. Its accepted name is Musa acuminata × balbisiana (ABB Group) 'Blue Java'. Synonyms include: * Musa acuminata × balbisiana (ABB Group) 'Ice Cream' In Hawaii it is known as the 'Ice Cream banana' and in Fiji as the 'Hawaiian banana'. It is also called 'Krie' in the Philippines and 'Cenizo' in Central America. Description Blue Java bananas can grow to a height of 4.5 to 6 meters (15-20 ft). They are cold-tolerant and, like tall bananas of the ABB Group, are wind-resistant because of their strong pseudostems and root systems. The leaves are silvery green in color. The fruit bunches are small, bearing seven to nine hands. The fruit are 18 to 23 cm (7-9 in) in length and exhibit a characteristic silvery blue color when unripe. The fruit turn a pale yellow when ripe, with white creamy flesh. They bloom around 15 to 24 months after planting and can be harvested after 115 to 150 days.

Also known as Inner- Mountain Highway (內山公路), the road travels through the mountain towns in Western Taiwan and was the major route for the area until NH 3 was built. Route Description The route is also known as Zhongfeng Highway (中豐公路) between Longtan and Fengyuan, Zhongtan Highway (中潭公路) between central Taichung City and Caotun, and Yunmi Armaments Road (澐密戰備道路) between Zhongpu, Chiayi and Nansi in Tainan City. Since the highway runs roughly parallel to Freeway 3 for the majority of its length, it is now primarily a highway providing local access as well as a scenic alternative route to the freeway. The highway begins in Taipei City near Executive Yuan. After a brief concurrency with PH 1 along Zhongxiao West Road (忠孝西路), highway 3 continues along Zhonghua Road (中華路) and Heping West Road (和平西路) before leaving for Banqiao in New Taipei City via Huajiang bridge (華江橋). In Banqiao the highway is known as Wenhua Road (文化路), one of the busiest roads in the district. At Banqiao Station, the road had a brief concurrency with County Route 106 before turning south as Zhongshan Road (中山路) and Sichuan Road (四川路) towards Tucheng. The road goes through downtown Tucheng and bypassing downtown Sanxia before entering Taoyuan City. In Taoyuan the highway passes through old town Daxi, which is also the terminus of North Cross-Island Highway (北部橫貫公路), or PH 7. After a brief concurrency with PH 4, the highways split in Daxi. Highway 3 continues southwest to Longtan before entering Hsinchu County. In Hsinchu the highway serves as a scenic alternate to Freeway 3, passing through the rural parts of Guanxi, Hengshan, Zhudong, Beipu, Emei, and continues to Miaoli County. In Miaoli the highway had a brief concurrency with County Route 124 in Sanwan before highway 3 splits and continues south. The highway passes through mountainous townships of Shitan, Dahu, and Zhuolan before entering Taichung City. In Taichung highway 3 passes through more mountainous districts in Dongshi, which is also the terminus of Central Cross-Island Highway (中部橫貫公路), also known as PH 8, and Shigang before entering Fengyuan, a suburb in northern Taichung. The highway then becomes an urban road, going through the suburb of Tanzi and central Taichung as Zhongshan Road (中山路), Beitun Road (北屯路), Jinhua Road (進化路), and Jiancheng Road (建成路). The highway then exits central Taichung and enters the southern suburbs of Dali and Wufeng before leaving for Nantou County. Highway 3 is an important highway in Nantou, connecting Caotun and Nantou City, the two main population centers in the county. The highway then passes through Mingjian and Zhushan before entering Yunlin County. In Yunlin the highway goes through Linnei and bypassing downtown Douliu. After passing through Gukeng the highway enters Chiayi County. In Chiayi the highway connects the mountain towns of Meishan, Zhuqi, Fanlu, Zhongpu, and Dapu. Beginning from Zhongpu to Nansi, the highway becomes a winding mountainous road known as Yunmi Armaments Road (澐密戰備道路), as the road was initially built for wartime preparations. The highway passes through Zengwen Dam in Dapu, the largest reservoir in Taiwan by volume, and enters Nansi in Tainan City. In Tainan City, the highway goes through Nansi, Yujing, and Nanhua. The highway has a concurrency with PH 20 from Yujing to Nanhua before the latter turns east and becomes Southern Cross-Island Highway (南部橫貫公路). The highway then enters Kaohsiung City, passing through the downtowns of mountainous districts of Neimen and Cishan. Highway 3 goes through Jiuru and Ligang in Pingtung County before ending at the intersection with PH 1 in Pingtung City. Spur Routes *: The route connects Caotun, Nantou and Nantou City.

Dadra and Nagar Haveli were small Portuguese overseas territories, part of Portuguese India from 1779 until 1954. The territories were enclaves, without any access to the sea, administered by the Portuguese Governor of the Daman district. After India attained independence in 1947, some residents, with the help of volunteers of organisations such as the United Front of Goans (UFG), the National Movement Liberation Organisation (NMLO), the Goa People's Party (affiliated to Communist ideology), the undivided Communist Party of India, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Azad Gomantak Dal occupied Dadra and Nagar Haveli in 1954 and displaced Portuguese rule. The territories were subsequently merged into the Indian Union in 1961.  Background  Map of Dadra and Nagar Haveli in the 1950s. After Indian independence in 1947, pro-India activists in the Portuguese Indian provinces, as well as Indians from other places, proposed of removing Portuguese control of Goa, Daman, Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and integrating them with India.P S Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, Published by Usha P. Lele, 1987, This was in line with the ideology of Mahatma Gandhi, who had, before India's independence, affirmed that \\"Goa cannot be allowed to exist as a separate entity in opposition to the laws of the free State [of India]\\".M.K. Gandhi, H, 30-6-1946, p. 208 Appasaheb Karmalkar, a bank employee with the Goa government took the reins of the National Liberation Movement Organization (NLMO) for the liberation of the Portuguese-ruled Indian territories. Simultaneously the AGD (led by Vishwanath Lavande, Dattatreya Deshpande, Prabhakar Sinari and Gole) and volunteers of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (led by Raja Wakankar and Nana Kajrekar) had been planning an armed assault for freeing Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Wakankar and Kajrekar visited the area around Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman several times in 1953 to study the topography and to get acquainted with the local workers and leaders who were agitating for the liberation of the Portuguese territory. Separately, the Goa People's Party and the then-undivided Communist Party of India had also been mobilising among Warli Adivasi in neighbouring districts since the mid-40's. Com. L.B. Dhangar, Roopji Kadu and 'Godutai' Godavari Parulekar led the Warli communists during the Dadra Nagar Haveli liberation struggle against Portuguese colonialism, around the slogan of 'Land to the tiller!' In April 1954 the NLMO, AGD and RSS agreed to form a United Front for liberation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli. At a meeting in Elphinstone garden, an armed assault was planned. Independently, another organisation, United Front of Goans (UFG), also pursued similar plans. J.D. Nagarwala, DIG of the Special Reserve Police, which had been deployed along the territory, had been sympathetic with the nationalists. He had himself visited the area often and advised the nationalists on the next moves. = Liberation of Dadra = The UFG, led by Francis Mascarenhas, Viman Sardesai and others, attacked the police station in Dadra on the night of 22 July 1954, assassinating Aniceto Rosário, sub-inspector at Dadra Police Station. The next morning, the Indian flag was hoisted and Dadra was declared a free territory. A panchayat led by Jayanti Bhai Desai was formed for the administration of Dadra. = Liberation of Naroli = On 28 July some 20 to 25 RSS volunteers led by Wakankar and 8 to 10 AGD volunteers led by Sinari crossed the Darotha river and reached Naroli. The Portuguese police officers in Naroli police station were asked to surrender. The Chief and his constable surrendered. Thus on 28 July 1954 Naroli was liberated from Portuguese rule. On 29 July the Gram Panchayat of Free Naroli was established. = Liberation of Lohari = On 30 July, close to two lakh Communist protestors rallied to the Indian side of the Dadra Nagar Haveli borders. The police was unable to restrain them and a detachment went into Lohari village to liberate it from the Portuguese. 35 other villages in the Damanganga area were liberated by the Adivasi people on that day. While the Indian troops were supportive of the liberation struggle, the Morarji Desai-led Congress government was wary of allowing Communists to lead the struggle. The undivided CPI was the biggest national opposition party at the time and the union government was anxious to contain its sphere of influence. Top leaders, including Com. Roopji Kadu, were arrested from Silvassa and the Special Reserve Police deployed at the borders would not allow Communist detachments to enter. Instead, it was the RSS,(On February 4, 1948, the government banned the RSS The ban was lifted unconditionally.statement to the Bombay Legislative Assembly on September 14, 1949 (Proceedings p2126) the Home Minister Morarji Desai admitted that the ban on RSS was no longer considered necessary; it was lifted unconditionally;) a banned organizations (it was not banned)at the time due to its role in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, that was transported by Indian Police forces to the vacated capital of Silvassa. = Liberation of Silvassa = After Naroli had been captured, the Portuguese police, under the leadership of Nagar Haveli Administrator, Captain Virgílio Fidalgo, was concentrated at Silvassa. The nationalists led by volunteers of the RSS and the AGD took the opportunity and captured Piparia. Captain Fidalgo was asked by the nationalists (led by Karmalkar) to surrender, but as there was no response from the Administrator the nationalists decided to march towards Silvassa. Two units were led by RSS and the third was led by AGD. All three units moved from three different directions to Silvassa. Fidalgo with 150 Police personnel fled to Khanvel, hence the nationalists were offered no resistance as they entered Silvassa on 2 August and declared the territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli liberated. The RSS's Kajrekar was placed in charge of the unit, while the AGD's Lavande was put in charge of treasury. =Surrender of Captain Fidalgo= Rumours were circulating that Portuguese reinforcements were coming to Nagar Haveli from Goa via Daman, so Kajrekar immediately contacted Nagarwala and requested a wireless set to enable the nationalists to keep in contact with the Indian SRP Headquarters. The wireless set obtained from the Indian SRP was installed in one of the houses by the riverside; Bandu Karkhanis, an RSS volunteer, who knew how to operate the wireless set was put in charge. He was under instructions that in case of emergency, he should throw the set in the river, cross the river and take shelter in the Indian territory which was just nearby and protected by Indian SRP. Captain Fidalgo who was moving deep in Nagar Haveli with his 150 men were constantly followed by the volunteers. While the Portuguese set up rearguard defences on the river bank, the Indian volunteer forces crossed the flooded river with local ferries on 10 August, assaulting the Portuguese forces at Khandvel and forcing them to retreat. The Portuguese unit eventually surrendered to the SRP at Udva on 11 August 1954. At a public meeting, Karmalkar was chosen as the first administrator of Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Integration into India The integration of Dadra and Nagar Haveli into India was not recognised by any other countries before 1974. In the decision of 12 April 1960 in the \\"Case Concerning Right of Passage Over Indian Territory\\", the International Court of Justice clearly stated that Portugal had sovereign rights over the territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli but India had the right to deny passage to armed personnel of Portugal over Indian territories. The residents of the former colony requested the Government of India for administrative help. K.G. Badlani, an officer of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) was sent as the administrator. From 1954 to 1961, the territory was administered as Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli by a body called the Varishta Panchayat of Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli.Constitution of India, 10th AmendmentUmaji Keshao Meshram & Ors v. Radhikabhai w/o Anandrao Banapurkar AIR 1986 SC 1272: this judgment mentions the Administration of Dadra and Nagar Haveli in this period During the years the territories enjoyed de facto independence, mail from Dadra and Nagar Haveli was routed through the Indian town of Vapi close to the border. Initially, remaining stocks of stamps of Portuguese India were overprinted LIBERATED AREAS in two lines. A single revenue stamp was also issued by Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli. In 1961 when Indian forces took over Goa, Daman, and Diu, Badlani was, for one day, designated the Prime Minister of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, so that, as Head of Government, he could sign an agreement with the Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, and formally merge Dadra and Nagar Haveli with the Republic of India. This was done by the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution of India. The territory was only recognised as part of the Indian Union, together with all the other former Portuguese possessions, after the recognition of that fact by Portugal, after the Carnation Revolution of 1974. A treaty was signed on 31 December 1974 between India and Portugal on recognition of India's sovereignty over Goa, Daman, Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli.Treaty Between the Government of India and the Government of the Republic of Portugal on Recognition of Portugal of India's Sovereignty Over Goa, Daman, Diu, Dadra, and Nagar Haveli and Related Matters 1974 Until 2006, Portugal continued to grant Portuguese citizenship to all natives of Dadra and Nagar Haveli who wished to have it. In that year, this was amended to include only those who had been born before 19 December 1961.

Since its formation in 1997, The Ocean Project has grown from a handful of founding North American aquariums into the world's most extensive network for advancing ocean education and action. Its growing network includes more than 2,000 partner aquariums, zoos, science, technology, and natural history museums (ZAMS), youth groups, and other education and conservation organizations, in 140 countries that together serve hundreds of millions of visitors each year. The Ocean Project does not market itself, instead \\"supporting and highlighting\\" partners by broadcasting their \\"innovative conservation-related activities.\\" To help its network of partners achieve their missions, The Ocean Project has conducted public opinion and market research since 1998. The Ocean Project works with its partners to apply the research, provide strategic communications insights, and implement innovative public engagement programs and campaigns to collaboratively create a better future. Primary Strategies: 1) Enhance capacity at partner institutions \\\\- Support and empower the communications, education, outreach and activation capacities of ZAMs and other partners to effectively engage their members and visitors, as well as leaders in the public and private sectors 2) Scale solutions within and beyond The Ocean Project network \\\\- Develop and expand partner network, sharing successes and catalyzing more effective approaches, ensuring these efforts add maximum value to local, regional, national, and global conservation movements Activities The Ocean Project seeks to complement and build upon the work of existing institutions and organizations and has three primary initiatives: Priority Initiatives: 1) Collaborative Conservation Campaigns Based on 20 years of comprehensive public opinion and market research, The Ocean Project works in partnership with leading ZAMs and others to develop, implement, and evaluate innovative conservation campaigns. The emphasis is on improving public engagement and increasing both the number of participating institutions and the impact of their efforts. This work builds upon the success of The Ocean Project's Innovative Solutions Grants + program developed with NOAA, as well as other initiatives, including those supported by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the SeaLife Trust, and UN Environment. 2) World Oceans Day The Ocean Project has been growing World Oceans Day since 2002 as a way to raise the profile of the ocean and rally the world every 8 June, with expanded involvement and action year-round. Under The Ocean Project leadership, World Oceans Day has grown from a handful of events in a few countries before 2002 into a global celebration of our ocean. The Ocean Project uses this day with the help of its network to promote restoring and protecting the ocean. Their Annual Report from 2019 shows more than 2000 events in over 140 countries throughout the year. In 2019, the campaign's theme was Gender and the Ocean, pushing for both ocean protections and promote gender equality. The goal for their 2020 campaign is \\"to call on world leaders to protect 30% of our blue planet by 2030.\\" The project is now recognized by the United Nations. 3) Youth Initiative Based on The Ocean Project market research that underscores the importance of engaging younger generations in conservation, The Ocean Project collaborative youth initiative helps to develop a broad, diverse, active, and united youth constituency. Connecting with ZAM partners and other youth- focused organizations, the initiative seeks to accelerate youth engagement and leadership worldwide. The Ocean Project empowers youth to become ocean champions and provides opportunities to connect directly with policymakers and corporate leaders. Among The Ocean Project youth activities, the World Oceans Day Youth Advisory Council shapes and grows development of World Oceans Day and leads conservation action year-round. The Sea Youth Rise Up annual advocacy campaign was started on World Oceans Day in 2016, and is designed to connect youth from within and beyond The Ocean Project network and provide a platform for youth to express their ideas directly with decision-makers. The Ocean Project argues that \\"with nearly half of the world's population under the age of 25, it is imperative that young people step up as leaders at an early age.\\" References External links *Official website * World Oceans Day website Category:Environmental organizations based in the United States Category:Marine conservation organizations Category:Environmental organizations based in Rhode Island ","title":"The Ocean Project"},{"id":"23139720","text":"Michael John Clark (February 12, 1922 – January 25, 1996) was an American professional baseball player.

R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium. Both of his parents, Eärendil and Elwing, were half-elven, having both Men and Elves as ancestors. He is the bearer of the elven-ring Vilya, the Ring of Air, and master of Rivendell, where he has lived for thousands of years through the Second and Third Ages of Middle-earth. He is introduced in The Hobbit, where he plays a supporting role, as he does in The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion. Fictional biography =First Age= Elrond was born in the First Age at the refuge of the Mouths of Sirion in Beleriand, the son of Eärendil and Elwing, and a great-grandson of Lúthien. Not long afterwards the havens were destroyed by the sons of Fëanor, who captured Elrond and his brother Elros. Their parents feared that they would be killed, but instead they were befriended by Fëanor's sons Maedhros and Maglor.The Silmarillion, ch. 24 \\"Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of Wrath\\" Like his parents but unlike his brother, Elrond chose to be counted among the Elves when the choice of kindreds was given to him. When Beleriand was destroyed at the end of the First Age, Elrond went to Lindon with the household of Gil- galad, the last High King of the Noldor. =Second Age= During the War of the Elves and Sauron in the Second Age, Gil-galad sent Elrond to the defence of Eregion against Sauron. Sauron destroyed Eregion and surrounded Elrond's army, but Durin and Amroth attacked Sauron's rearguard, causing the Dark Lord to turn and drive them back to Moria. Elrond was able to retreat north to a secluded valley, where he established the refuge of Imladris, later called Rivendell; he lived there through the Second and Third Ages.The Return of the King, Appendix B, \\"The Tale of Years\\", \\"The Second Age\\" Near the end of the Second Age, the Last Alliance of Elves and Men was formed, and the army departed from Imladris to Mordor, led by Elendil and Gil-galad, who were both killed in the Siege of Barad-dûr. Elrond served as Gil-galad's herald; Elrond and Círdan were entrusted with the two Elven Rings that Gil-galad held. Elrond and Círdan were the only ones to stand with Gil-galad when he fell.The Silmarillion, \\"Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age\\" =Third Age= Elrond married Celebrían, daughter of Celeborn and Galadriel, early in the Third Age. The place and date of Celebrían's birth are not specified.Unfinished Tales, p. 234 In the version of their history that describes Galadriel and Celeborn as rulers of Eregion in the Second Age, Galadriel and Celebrían left Eregion for Lórinand as Sauron's influence over Eregion grew.Unfinished Tales, p. 237. According to one account, Celebrían and her parents later dwelt for many years in Rivendell (Imladris).Unfinished Tales, p. 240. Celebrían and Elrond had three children: the twins Elladan and Elrohir,The Return of the King, Appendix B \\"The Tale of Years\\", \\"The Third Age\\" and Arwen Undómiel (Evenstar). On a trip from Rivendell to Lórien, Celebrían was waylaid by Orcs in the Redhorn Pass on Caradhras in the Misty Mountains. She was captured and tormented and received a poisoned wound. She was rescued by her sons and healed by Elrond, but \\"after fear and torment\\"The Peoples of Middle-earth, pp. 235-236 she could no longer find joy in Middle-earth, so she passed to the Grey Havens and over the Sea to Valinor in the following year. Elrond was an ally of the North- Kingdom of Arnor. Following its fall, Elrond harboured the Chieftains of the Dúnedain (the descendants of the Kings of Arnor) and the Sceptre of Annúminas, Arnor's symbol of royal authority. When Aragorn's father Arathorn was killed a few years after Aragorn's birth, Elrond raised Aragorn in his own household and became a surrogate father to him. Aware of his daughter Arwen's feelings for Aragorn, Elrond would permit their marriage only if Aragorn could unite Arnor and Gondor as High King.The Return of the King, Appendix A, 1, v, The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen In The Hobbit, Elrond gave shelter to Thorin Oakenshield and his company, after which Elrond and Bilbo Baggins became friends. He received Bilbo as a permanent guest when Bilbo left the Shire some 60 years later.The Hobbit, ch. 3 \\"A Short Rest\\" Elrond headed the Council of Elrond, at which it was decided that the One Ring should be destroyed where it was forged at Mount Doom in Mordor.The Fellowship of the Ring, book 2, ch. 2 \\"The Council of Elrond\\" Elrond reluctantly accepted his personal loss (Arwen's choice of mortality) for the greater good of Man, as she would help to renew the declining lineage of the Dúnedain. When the Grey Company found Aragorn and the Rohirrim during their journey to Gondor, Elrond's son Elrohir told Aragorn, \\"I bring word to you from my father: The days are short. If thou art in haste, remember the Paths of the Dead.\\" Aragorn took Elrond's advice, using the Paths of the Dead to reach Gondor in time to come to its aid.The Return of the King, book 5, ch. 2 The Passing of the Grey Company Elrond remained in Rivendell until the destruction of both the Ring and Sauron in the War of the Ring. He then travelled to Minas Tirith for the marriage of Arwen and Aragorn, now King of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor. Three years later, at the approximate age of 6,520, Elrond left Middle-earth to go over the Sea with the Ring-bearers, never to return. Tolkien said that \\"after the destruction of the Ruling Ring the Three Rings of the Eldar lost their virtue. Then Elrond prepared at last to depart from Middle-earth and follow Celebrían.\\"The Peoples of Middle-earth, p. 243. Thus Elrond and Celebrían were finally reunited, but they were sundered forever from their daughter Arwen. Adaptations Elrond in Ralph Bakshi's animated version of The Lord of the Rings Cyril Ritchard voiced Elrond in the 1977 Rankin/Bass animated film adaptation of The Hobbit. In Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated adaptation of The Lord of the Rings, Elrond was voiced by André Morell. When Rankin/Bass attempted to finish the story (left incomplete by Bakshi and his financial backers) with The Return of the King in 1980, actor Paul Frees voiced Elrond. Carl Hague portrayed Elrond in National Public Radio's 1979 radio production of The Lord of the Rings. Hugh Dickson portrayed Elrond in BBC Radio's 1981 serialisation of The Lord of the Rings. In the 1993 Finnish television miniseries Hobitit, Elrond is played by Leif Wager. In the 2006 Toronto musical adaptation of The Lord of the Rings, Elrond was portrayed by Victor A. Young. Hugo Weaving as Elrond in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring In The Lord of the Rings film trilogy and The Hobbit trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, Elrond is portrayed by Hugo Weaving. In The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Elrond holds Men in lesser regard after witnessing Isildur's failure to destroy the One Ring. Unlike the book, he is more skeptical of Aragorn both in terms of his ability to lead the Men of the West and the courtship of his daughter. As shown in the flashback scene in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, he forces Aragorn to end his engagement to Arwen so that she could leave to the Undying Lands, though she eventually makes the decision to stay with Aragorn in Middle-Earth. Later, he sends a \\"surprisingly well-drilled army\\" to the Battle of Helm's Deep, an act the Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey writes was made to fit a 21st Century view of politico-military expectations. Weaving reprised his role as both Elrond and the narrator in video games The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II (2006) and The Lord of the Rings: Conquest (2009). In the 2002 video game adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring Elrond is voiced by Jim Piddock, who later reprised the role for The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest (2010) and The Lord of the Rings: War in the North (2011). Elrond is one of the major characters in The Lord of the Rings Online (2007).

Life Michał Falkener was born in Silesia to a family of wealthy burghers. In Latin—the language favored by medieval European scholars, and used in his works—he is sometimes referred to as \\"Vratislaviensis\\" or \\"Wratislaviensis\\" (\\"the Wrocławian\\") in addition to \\"Michaelis de Vratislauia\\" (\\"Michael of Wrocław\\"). In Polish he is, respectively, \\"Wrocławczyk\\" and \\"Michał z Wrocławia\\" (\\"Michael of Wrocław\\"). In German, the place identifier is \\"of Breslau\\"—\\"von Breslau\\" or \\"aus Breslau.\\" Falkener entered the arts faculty of the Kraków Academy in 1478, earning his bachelor's in 1481 and defending his master's thesis in 1488. Later he lectured there on astronomy, astrology, mathematics, physics, logic, grammar, and rhetoric, as well as scholastic and Aristotlian philosophy. His students included Nicolaus Copernicus. In 1495 he entered the Collegium Minus, and in 1501 the Collegium Maius. In 1512 he joined the theological faculty, where he earned a doctorate in 1517. He twice (1499 and 1504) served as rector of the faculty of arts. For several years he headed the Bursa Niemiecka, succeeding John of Głogów. Falkener was a Thomist but an incomplete one since, in addition to Peripatetic-Thomist proofs for the existence of God, he also accepted St. Anselm's proofs. In addition to more medieval pursuits, Falkener was interested in humanism: he knew and taught on classical and humanist authors, appreciating their linguistic and artistic abilities in particular. He published and edited important introductions to and commentaries on song collections and religious texts. Falkener's first printed astrological predictions were published for the years 1494–95; 1506 saw the first edition of his Introductorium astronomiae Cracoviensis elucidans almanach. He bequeathed his personal library to the Kraków Academy. See also *History of philosophy in Poland *List of Poles *Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke  Works  *Iudicium Cracoviense.

Overview Shimizudani is one of the oldest high schools in Osaka with a history of over 100 years. The school was founded in 1900, and named as Osaka Prefectural First Girls’ High School (traditional Japanese: 大阪府第一高等女學校). \\"Shimizudani\\" was named from a place of Shimizu (清水, which means \\"pure water\\" or \\"clear stream\\") and Tani (Dani) (谷, which means 'valley'), which means the place that the clear stream flows through. Shimizudani High School is located on the northern part of \\"Uemachi Plateau\\" that is the center of Osaka from ancient times, and the South-West of Osaka Castle, and the south side of the Naniwa Palace. Therefore, it is said that there's \\"Suzaku Avenue\\" under the Shimizudani. In former times, Shimizudani was the elite school, and place of the cultivation of many an upper class young lady. For example, famous graduates of this school include Kawashima Itoko (grandmother of Princess Akishino; great- grandmother of Prince Hisahito of Akishino), Tanizaki Matsuko (wife of Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, and a model in Tanizaki's novel \\"The Makioka Sisters (novel)\\"--portrait of the daily life of the upper class of Kansai). The number of Shimizudani graduates is more than 30,000 people. Shimizudani is the origin school of the \\"School uniform\\" in Osaka. The Sailor suit style uniform is called \\"Shimizudani blue\\", and designed with three line of bright white by a light blue collar cover. \\"Shimizudani blue\\" is very popular in Japan, and appeared in the TV drama Asadora (\\"Morning Drama\\") on NHK (Japan's National Broadcasting Corporation) many times. Miho Kanno, Juri Ueno, Satomi Ishihara wore \\"Shimizudani blue\\". Shimizudani is famous for not only the entrance into a school of higher grade to the famous university, but also the Classroom (Homeroom) and Club activities, like the Chorus Club, the Orchestra Ensemble Club, etc. History = Brief history = Shimizudani took a role as the symbol of \\"the girl's education\\" in Japan. The early days of \\"The (1868–1912 ; Japan started its modernization) , Japan's \\"the girl's education\\" was a low level, insufficient at degree to give necessary \\"Sewing and Cooking\\" for real life. It would be changed by \\"the girls' high school law\\" in February, 1899. The Shimizudani was decided to undergo the opening of a school by Ministry of Education notification 194 as the Osaka prefectural management first girls' high school. The site of Shimizudani was a construction site of the Japan Women's University by Jinzoh Naruse, at first. Therefore, the passion of the educational front for Shimizudani as the Osaka's first girls' high school was hot. The placement of the teacher was regarded as important, too. Ōmura Chujiro described as \\"the incarnation of the girl education in Japan\\" took office as Shimizudani's first principal. What you should mention specially is Nagai Koji who started for its new post as a music department teacher. Even music education brought up Shimizudani in the palace, but \\"the girl music textbook\\" which he edited as the teaching materials came to be used as a standard book in girls' high schools in Japan. Nagai will found \\"Osaka music school\\" (Osaka College of Music) later. Japanese Celebrities cooperated from the various fields to raise culture and the judgment of the Shimizudani's student and gave a lecture. Including Ōkuma Shigenobu (the 8th and 17th Prime Minister of Japan) and Shibusawa Eiichi ( known as the \\"father of Japanese capitalism\\"), more than 120 visit the Shimizudani just to win through up to a record of 20 years after foundation ( Refer to the following chronological). In addition, Prime minister Prince Kinmochi Saionji wrote to the Shimizudani's alumnus Hall \\"Saibikan\\" to show the thought of \\"the serious consideration to the girl education\\". Because, Saionji interchanged with Naruse ( = a friend of Omura, the Shimizudani's principal) and supported it as an establishment promoter of Naruse's \\"Japan Women's University\\". Therefore, popularity of Shimizudani was too very high, and the students who were not able to enter it appeared one after another. So Shimizudani's alumnus organization \\"Seiyukai\\" founded a sister school \\"Seiyu high School\\" in Yao, Osaka. The Saibikan was built with the reinforced concrete construction for the Shimizudani's alumnus Hall in 1925.

He was the first and only native Goan to be appointed to this post in 451 years of Portuguese colonial and provincial governance. He was also one of the first elected representatives in the Portuguese Parliament from its overseas Indian colonies. Early life Bernardo Peres da Silva was born in Neura Island in Goa to José Tomás de Vila Nova Peres and Mariana Veloso and was orphaned at a very young age. His uncle, Caetano Peres, was a priest at Rachol seminary, and took him under his care. He completed secondary education at Rachol. He graduated from Escola Médico-Cirúrgica de Goa (School of Medical Surgery of Goa), which was attached to the Royal Hospital at Panelim. Medical practitioner After completing his education at the medical school, Peres was appointed as substitute professor in the medical school, having passed a competitive exam. When his teacher fell ill, Peres took up the job of teaching. During his term at the hospital, Peres opposed moves by the Viceroy, the Count of Rio Pardo, to streamline treatment available to patients. This made him popular with the people, but not with the viceroy. In 1820 he was dismissed from the Royal Hospital. Political career =The first insurrection= In 1821, Portugal issued a royal decree accepting constitutionalism. Rogério de Faria, a Goan businessman in Bombay and a friend or relative of Peres,), sent a copy to Peres. The events in Portugal inspired the Goans to seek greater political liberty. The Portuguese Viceroy of Goa, the Count of Rio Pardo, did not hold elections immediately, preferring, instead to wait for instructions from the Government Council in Rio de Janeiro. Peres led a popular insurrection in Goa that overthrew and imprisoned the Viceroy. Peres was offered a position in the provisional government but he refused. =First term as representative= The Goans now had an opportunity to vote representatives to the Portuguese Parliament. Portuguese officials supported mestiço candidates, but the Goans voted for their own. Peres participated in the elections and was voted to the Parliament in Lisbon, on 4 January 1822. Peres, along with Constâncio Roque da Costa and Dr. A. J. Lima Leitão (a Portuguese), became the first Goans in the Portuguese Parliament. On the way to Portugal, the three representatives were detained in Portuguese Mozambique. By the time they reached Lisbon, the Parliament had been dissolved, and the absolute monarchy restored. The new government appointed Peres as Intendente Geral da Agricultura da India, but did not give immediate effect to his appointment. During his first term, Peres sided with the liberals in Portugal. =Second term= In 1827, after a new liberal government was established, elections were held again. This time, Peres's opponent was the Governor of Goa. Peres won again, but on reaching Lisbon found that the parliament had been dissolved by King Dom Miguel. He went to Plymouth in England. During his stay there, he came to know that someone else had been appointed in his place as representative. Peres published a strongly worded letter protesting this move. After staying there for some time, he went to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. In order to survive, he started giving private tuition. During his stay at Janeiro, Peres wrote a book titled Dialógo entre um Doutor em Filosofia e um Português na Índia sobre a Constituição Política de Portugal (Dialogue between a Doctor of Philosophy and a Portuguese in India on the Political Constitution of Portugal). =Appointment as Prefect= Peres's son was serving in the Portuguese military. In 1834, he was part of an expeditionary force that took over Porto. A new constitutional monarchy was established with Prince Pedro as the regent of his daughter, Queen Maria II. Peres immediately left for Lisbon, where he submitted a memorandum to Pedro IV, pleading for greater liberties for the people of Portuguese India. For his son's participation, and his loyalty to the House of Braganza during the usurpation by Dom Miguel, Dona Maria II rewarded him by appointing Bernardo as Prefeito (Prefect) of Portuguese India on 7 May 1834. The post of Prefect was a new designation for the post of Governor, but it did not carry any military powers. =Prefect of Goa= Bernardo da Silva arrived in Goa on 10 January 1835, and took charge of his post on 14 January. The Goans were very happy that one of them had been appointed Governor. The whites and mestiços, however, were unhappy with Peres's appointment. He intended to clean up the administration of Goa. Within a week of arrival, Peres's brought new reforms and made new appointments to the Finance and Justice departments. He took some steps to benefit locals which irked the whites and mestiços. One of the first measures he took was to form a new city council. The members of the council were Manuel Correia da Silva e Gama, Brigadier José António de Melo Souto, and Major D. Teles José Maria de Castro e Almeida. He also reorganised the judicial services and abolished monastic orders. He made concessions to the communidades by removing the tax that they had to pay to the state, amounting to one-sixth of their income. He also tried to end the abuses by the privileged classes. =Deposition= The army in Goa at that time was dominated by whites and mestiços. They eventually organised a coup in Goa and removed Peres from his post on 1 February. He had been in power for just seventeen days when he had been deposed. Peres was arrested and exiled to Bombay. In his place, the previous Viceroy Manuel de Portugal e Castro was appointed Governor. =Army revolt= On 10 February, disturbances broke out in Goa in his favour. The leader of the revolt that had deposed Peres, fearing arrest had resigned and handed control over to the Chief Counselor of the Prefecture. On 3 March, a faction of the army, consisting of local soldiers loyal to him, revolted and demanded Peres' reinstatement as prefect. The military governor refused and ordered troops to move against the revolutionaries. His supporters took refuge at Fort Gaspar Dias (Terekhol Fort). After a pitched battle, most protesters were massacred. =Expedition to liberate Goa= In Bombay, Peres plotted to liberate Goa from his opposers. At first, he sought help from the British, as the British were allies of the Portuguese. He expected them to support him as the legal authority appointed by Portugal in Goa, but they refused. He spent the next five months preparing an expeditionary force to capture Goa. He recruited nearly three hundred men for the task. Rogério de Faria financed his mission. The expeditionary force, set out from Bombay harbour on 27 May, in five vessels. Unfortunately, they were forced to turn back due to the advancing monsoons on 6 June. =Provisional government in Daman= Peres left for Daman, another Portuguese enclave, north of Bombay. He was welcomed there by the constitutionalists and supporters who still recognised him as prefect. He established a provisional government that lasted until 1837. Peres received arms and armaments from Faria for the defence of Daman, should his opposer's have attacked Daman. In return, Faria was to receive customs exemptions. Being in debt, Rogério de Faria asked for his money back (a sum of Rs. 67,957). The bureaucrats of Daman refused to clear the bills. In 1836, the Portuguese conducted elections in the European-controlled constituencies, keeping four constituencies away. During Peres's absence, a provisional government headed by Rocha de Vasconcelos had been appointed. It was followed by the nomination of the Baron of Sabrosa as governor. =Return to Goa= Peres went back to Goa and made peace with the new governor, accepting his authority. On 9 November 1839, he was re-elected as representative from Goa to the Parliament. He returned to Portugal and continued to take part in the Parliament. He was appointed a member of the standing committee on colonies. He was re-elected to the parliament twice again till his death in 1842. He argued on behalf of his land in the Portuguese Parliament, even though no minister responded to his demands. He strongly defended the interests of Goa as well as other Portuguese colonies. In 1840, Peres delivered a speech in the parliament, defending his actions as Governor. He also asked for an investigation of his adversaries. He later published his speech entitled \\"Aos Representantes da Nação Portuguesa\\". He demanded that the military forces stationed in Goa be done away with. Death For most of his life, Peres lived in penury, and died a pauper. He had to sell off his household furniture to meet medical expenses. Bernardo da Silva died on 14 November 1844. He was buried in the Cemitério dos Prazeres in Lisbon. A portrait of Silva is displayed in the portrait gallery in Archaeological Museum in Panjim, Goa.

It is located in Farnborough, Hampshire in the United Kingdom. The company was formed in August 2006 by former SCi and Eidos creative director, Patrick O'Luanaigh. Since formation, the developer has worked on numerous projects for different video game platforms, most notably PlayStation Home, the virtual world on Sony's PlayStation 3 console, where they grew to become one of the leading publishers. From late 2013 nDreams began working on content for virtual reality (VR) headsets, such as Sony's PlayStation VR, Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear VR. They are developing VR games for these including Gunner and The Assembly, along with non-gaming VR experiences such as Perfect Beach. nDreams has stated that they are now entirely focused on developing content for virtual reality. Virtual reality Since 2013, nDreams has focused on developing content for virtual reality headsets. The first game released by nDreams for virtual reality was the tech demo SkyDIEving, which launched in 2013. This saw players freefalling through the sky until they inevitably crashed to their doom on the ground. Patrick O'Luanaigh stated that nDreams had seen \\"fantastic\\" reaction to SkyDIEving since it was released in 2013 and the demo received many plaudits. In June 2014 at the E3 video game show nDreams announced The Assembly, which is planned for release on the Oculus Rift and Sony PlayStation VR headsets. The Assembly is an adventure game where you uncover the morally dubious secrets of an unknown scientific organisation from the perspective of two different characters. Following the announcement of the Samsung Gear VR headset in September 2014, nDreams announced two titles that would be released for the headset. Gunner is a video game where the player wields a gun turret in outer space, shooting down the incoming enemy spacecraft. Perfect Beach is a relaxation experience where users sit on a tropical beach and take in vistas or listen to the meditation track. A demo for Gunner released in January 2015 on the Oculus Home store for the Samsung Gear VR headset. Full products of both Gunner and Perfect Beach are due to release in early 2015. In December 2014 nDreams announced a new partnership with VR filmmakers Virtual View Productions. The partnership would allow them to explore the crossover between VR video games and movies. nDreams has previously stated they also have other products in development for virtual reality headsets. They have also stated they are focused entirely on developing content for VR devices. VRFocus.com In early 2014, nDreams launched a consumer website focused on virtual reality called VRFocus. This is run on an independent basis and was founded by editor-in-chief, Kevin Joyce. In February 2016, VRFocus launched VRTV, a fortnightly web show presented by Zeena Al-Obaidi. PlayStation Home nDreams claimed to be one of the world's leading independent developers and publishers in PlayStation Home, the virtual world on Sony's PlayStation 3 console. The company created numerous games, virtual spaces and items for the platform between 2009 and 2014. The first project created by nDreams for PlayStation Home was the world's first console- based and virtual world-based alternate reality game, Xi. Xi was released on March 23, 2009 and lasted a total of 12 weeks, taking place within PlayStation Home, across the web and in the real world. nDreams next project for Home was a personal space called \\"The Pirate Galleon Apartment\\" which also released in 2009. This was the European Home's first personal space to have a mini-game with prizes. In 2010, nDreams released another personal space called \\"Musicality\\". In this space users could play a multiplayer music game. In 2011, nDreams released a new game space called \\"Aurora\\" where PlayStation Home users can visit and play various mini games, receive rewards and hang out with fellow users. Aurora has had over 18 million visits from 1.8 million unique players, making it nDreams' most successful project in PlayStation Home. nDreams also created numerous virtual items for use on a player's avatar as well as many more spaces.

At the time the closure was announced nDreams stated they would continue to release additional content ahead of the closure of the platform.https://www.facebook.com/ndreamers/posts/10152735474549907 On reflection of PlayStation Home's success, CEO Patrick O'Luanaigh stated that PlayStation Home \\"was a commercial success\\" for nDreams. Other projects In early 2008, nDreams completed a short piece of work on a project called iStories. It is a PC educational tool that allows users to create linear or interactive stories by piecing together images, sound and text. A screenshot of Venus Redemption. *Venus Redemption was an episodic video game that was in development by nDreams. The game was to cater primarily to a female audience around 30 years of age. It was to be released for Microsoft Windows, Mac, iPhone, Wii, and web browsers, but the game was put on hold while nDreams focused on other projects. The game was planned to be dialogue-heavy with a large mix of content with cutscenes, non-interactive in-game sequences, comic strip storytelling, and in-game conversations to develop the plot. Players would have needed to gather clues to solve puzzles, play bejeweled style mini- games and slide puzzles to complete the game. At the end of the season, players would have eventually taken down Keane Global Developments and solve the mystery behind their corporate motives. The story was being written by Kate Pullinger, with help from comic book writer Gordon Rennie, the music was to be composed by Tim Wright, and it was to be directed by Robin Shepperd. The first season of the game was to be composed of six ninety-minute episodes, and they were to be released on either a weekly or bi-weekly schedule. It was being developed with the Unity engine. After a great response to an early demo, Venus Redemption was put on hold while nDreams focused on other projects, such as PlayStation Home and other third party projects. It was initially announced in 2009, but no further updates on its status have been released as of , . *Project Y is currently in development for mobile phones running Android and iOS. It features a highly unique funding model and is a lifestyle application. *Friday Town is a groundbreaking new social game created through a partnership between Cadbury Crunchie and nDreams for Facebook. The game invites players into a virtual world, called Friday Town, and challenges them to help its inhabitants brighten up their lives with a series of puzzles that will unfold over the coming weeks and months. *Spirit of Adventure is the first ever soap opera on Facebook. It combines a compelling tale and strong characters with a variety of puzzles to create a unique narrative-driven Facebook experience. *StreetDance 3D, a Facebook app, is the first collaborative project between nDreams and Vertigo Films, and is an action-packed dance game inspired by the movie. The game features motion- captured dance moves (recorded at Pinewood Studios) and music from the film. * Lewis Hamilton: Secret Life is nDreams's second alternate reality game. It was not based in PlayStation Home like Xi was. The ARG was created for Reebok, who also co-developed the game. Wired called it 'one of the most engaging, interactive, and exciting games of 2010.' The game launched in March 2010 and ran until November 2010, with over 637,000 players from 154 countries taking part. They worked together to solve puzzles and complete tests online, on mobiles and in the real world. Live events took place across the globe including tasks in Spain, Lebanon, Malaysia, India and the UK. The game was run in nine languages (English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Turkish and Korean), which Guinness acknowledged as a world record for a game of this type in 2013. Funding In January 2015, nDreams announced a $2.75 million investment from Mercia Technologies. This investment is planned to allow the studio to expand and invest in research and development of virtual reality games. One of Mercia's leaders, former Sega CEO Mike Hayes, joined the nDreams board of directors in 2014.

SIA was founded in 1982 in Baltimore, Maryland by women survivors who believed their experience in other twelve-step fellowships (Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Overeaters Anonymous (OA) and Al-Anon) could assist in recovery from sexual trauma. In SIA, incest is defined broadly as any sexual encounter by a family member, or by an extended family member that damaged the child. \\"Extended family member\\" means a person that the child or their family has known over a period of time. This may be any family member, a family friend, clergy, another child, or anyone who betrayed the child's innocence and trust. SIA maintains that incest survivors were affected by the abuse whether it occurred once or many times since the damage was incurred immediately. In SIA, \\"abuse\\" is defined as any sexual behavior or contact with a child. Sexual contact may include verbal and/ or physical behaviors; penetration is not necessary for the experience to be defined as incest or sexual abuse. Covert incest within the family is also a theme many survivors explore in SIA. History In 1982, SIA was founded by three, women survivors of childhood sexual abuse in Baltimore, Maryland. Today, SIA operates from Hartford County, Maryland as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization. It helps survivors to connect with one another and carries a message of recovery to those who still suffer. For several years, SIA speakers have presented workshops at the Maryland Governor’s annual Conference on Child Abuse and Neglect. Meetings In addition to open and mixed gender meetings, SIA designates some meetings as \\"women only\\" or \\"men only.\\" SIA meetings are not open to past or current perpetrators of child sexual abuse. SIA traditionally defines a perpetrator as, \\"a family member or trusted individual who violates that position by seducing, or otherwise manipulating a child with overt or covert sexual behavior.\\" For a complete list of SIA meetings see the website siawso.org.

Master franchising is a method that has been employed by most franchise systems. The operational efficiency of these systems, with their distinctly complex organizational form, benefits from increased growth rates of the subfranchises. Business model In general, a franchise enables a product to be dispersed across more outlets and regions, solving many geographic concerns raised by large market companies. In doing so, it allows the company to retain the economies of a large chain, while allowing for the meticulous management of geographically dispersed individual stores. Generally, a master franchisor will grant the master franchisee, or subfranchisor, the right to third-party operations within a defined territory. And then, with respect to regional issues, the subfranchisor will assume the role of the franchisor, but they typically will not own or operate the franchise. They are removed from a direct management position. This duplication of the franchisor's role forms an additional layer of control in the general franchise system, which results in some small-scale inefficiencies on the small, local scale but greatly reduces the large-scale inefficiencies. Additionally, a master franchise allows the company holding the franchising permit to benefit from management talent and more and more accessible capital. Combined, these two factors translate into almost instant penetration into the market and a competitive advantage, both of which increase system growth rates. Managerial levels and hierarchical framework exemplify one competitive advantage. By allowing the franchisor to specialize in recruiting, screening and training of subfranchisors, who then develop their area in a similar way, the overall growth rate of chains increases. Other benefits include faster development, a more comprehensive financial base, specific expansion plans, access to capital and a regular cash flow, proximity to the customer, some independence, and the ability to address the demands of the customers as well as address the local competition. Drawbacks Although master franchising can be beneficial and advantageous, there are also setbacks, including legal problems and overly long contracts. One specific setback of master franchises is the increase in agency costs. Franchise agreements are needed to codify the enforcement of behavior. But, because all aspects of the franchise cannot be predicted, this requirement raises the opportunity for franchise shirking while reducing the overall ability to monitor all aspects of the franchise. Thus, some scholars hypothesize that \\"new franchise systems which employ master franchising are more likely to fail than are other new franchise systems.\\" Examples Generally, the types of business that would adopt a master franchise model are domestic cleaners, fast food restaurants, computer equipment, real estate agencies, and convenience food stores.

Finite size effects Hot spots are a manifestation of the finite size of the system: in subatomic physics this refers both to atomic nuclei, which consist of nucleons, as well as to nucleons themselves, which are made of quarks and gluons, Other manifestations of finite sizes of these systems are seen in scattering of electrons on nuclei and nucleons. For nuclei in particular finite size effects manifest themselves also in the isomeric shift and isotopic shift. Statistical methods in subatomic physics The formation of hot spots assumes the establishment of local equilibrium, which in its turn occurs if the thermal conductivity in the medium is sufficiently small. The notions of equilibrium and heat are statistical. The use of statistical methods assumes a large number of degrees of freedom. In macroscopic physics this number usually refers to the number of atoms or molecules, while in nuclear and particle physics it refers to the energy level density.Cf. e.g. Richard M. Weiner, Analogies in Physics and Life, World Scientific 2008, p. 123. Hot spots in nucleons Local equilibrium is the precursor of global equilibrium and the hot spot effect can be used to determine how fast, if at all, the transition from local to global equilibrium takes place. That this transition does not always happen follows from the fact that the duration of a strong interaction reaction is quite short (of the order of 10−22–10−23 seconds) and the propagation of \\"heat\\", i.e. of the excitation, through the finite sized body of the system takes a finite time, which is determined by the thermal conductivity of the matter the system is made of. Indications of the transition between local and global equilibrium in strong interaction particle physics started to emerge in the 1960s and early 1970s. In high-energy strong interactions equilibrium is usually not complete. In these reactions, with the increase of laboratory energy one observes that the transverse momenta of produced particles have a tail, which deviates from the single exponential Boltzmann spectrum, characteristic for global equilibrium. The slope or the effective temperature of this transverse momentum tail increases with increasing energy. These large transverse momenta were interpreted as being due to particles, which \\"leak\\" out before equilibrium is reached. Similar observations had been made in nuclear reactions and were also attributed to pre-equilibrium effects. This interpretation suggested that the equilibrium is neither instantaneous, nor global, but rather local in space and time. By predicting a specific asymmetry in peripheral high-energy hadron reactions based on the hot spot effect Richard M. Weiner proposed a direct test of this hypothesis as well as of the assumption that the heat conductivity in hadronic matter is relatively small. The theoretical analysis of the hot spot effect in terms of propagation of heat was performed in Ref. In high-energy hadron reactions one distinguishes peripheral reactions with low multiplicity and central collisions with high multiplicity. Peripheral reactions are also characterized by the existence of a leading particle which retains a large proportion of the incoming energy. By taking the notion of peripheral literally Ref.2 suggested that in this kind of reaction the surface of the colliding hadrons is locally excited giving rise to a hot spot, which is de-excited by two processes: 1) emission of particles into the vacuum 2) propagation of “heat” into the body of the target (projectile) wherefrom it is eventually also emitted through particle production. Particles produced in process 1) will have higher energies than those due to process 2), because in the latter process the excitation energy is in part degraded. This gives rise to an asymmetry with respect to the leading particle, which should be detectable in an experimental event by event analysis. This effect was confirmed by Jacques Goldberg in K− p→ K− p π+ π− reactions at 14 GEV/c. This experiment represents the first observation of local equilibrium in hadronic interactions, allowing in principle a quantitative determination of heat conductivity in hadronic matter along the lines of Ref.3 . This observation came as a surprise, because, although the electron proton scattering experiments had shown beyond any doubt that the nucleon had a finite size, it was a-priori not clear whether this size was sufficiently big for the hot spot effect to be observable, i. e. whether heat conductivity in hadronic matters was sufficiently small. Experiment4 suggests that this is the case. =Hot spots in nuclei= In atomic nuclei, because of their larger dimensions as compared with nucleons, statistical and thermodynamical concepts have been used already in the 1930s. Hans Bethe In this short abstract a forward-backward asymmetry in central collisions is considered. had suggested that propagation of heat in nuclear matter could be studied in central collisions and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga had calculated the corresponding heat conductivity. The interest in this phenomenon was resurrected in the 1970s by the work of Weiner and Weström who established the link between the hot spot model and the pre-equilibrium approach used in low- energy heavy-ion reactions.J. M. Miller, in Proc lnt. Conf. on nuclear physics, voL 2, ed . J. de Boer and H. J. Mang (North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1973) p. 398. Experimentally the hot spot model in nuclear reactions was confirmed in a series of investigations some of which of rather sophisticated nature including polarization measurements of protons and gamma rays. Subsequently on the theoretical side the link between hot spots and limiting fragmentation and transparency in high-energy heavy ion reactions was analyzed and “drifting hot spots” for central collisions were studied. With the advent of heavy ion accelerators experimental studies of hot spots in nuclear matter became a subject of current interest and a series of special meetings“Local Equilibrium in Strong Interactions Physics” (LESIP I), Eds. D. K. Scott and R. M. Weiner, World Scientific 1985 Hadronic Matter in Collision” (LESIP II) Eds. P. Carruthers and D.

M. Plümer, S. Raha and R. M. Weiner, World Scientific 1991. was dedicated to the topic of local equilibrium in strong interactions. The phenomena of hot spots, heat conduction and preequilibrium play also an important part in high-energy heavy ion reactions and in the search for the phase transition to quark matter. Hot spots and solitons Solitary waves (solitons) are a possible physical mechanism for the creation of hot spots in nuclear interactions. Solitons are a solution of the hydrodynamic equations characterized by a stable localized high density region and small spatial volume. They were predicted to appear in low-energy heavy ion collisions at velocities of the projectile slightly exceeding the velocity of sound (E/A ~ 10-20 MeV; here E is the incoming energy and A the atomic number). Possible evidence for this phenomenon is provided by the experimental observation that the linear momentum transfer in 12C induced heavy-ion reactions is limited.

R. R. Tolkien's writings, and one of the protagonists in The Lord of the Rings. Frodo is a hobbit of the Shire who inherits the One Ring from his cousin Bilbo Baggins and undertakes the quest to destroy it in the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor. He is mentioned in Tolkien's posthumously published works, The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales. Frodo is repeatedly wounded during the quest, and becomes increasingly burdened by the Ring as it nears Mordor. He changes, too, growing in understanding and compassion, and avoiding violence. Frodo's name comes from the Old English name Fróda, meaning \\"wise by experience\\". Commentators have written that he combines courage, selflessness, and fidelity, and that as a good character, he seems unexciting but grows through his quest, an unheroic person who reaches heroic stature. Internal history =Background= Frodo is introduced in The Lord of the Rings as Bilbo Baggins's relative and adoptive heir. In The Hobbit, Bilbo had been taken by the Wizard Gandalf and a party of Dwarves from his safe home, Bag End, in the Shire across the Misty Mountains and the dark forest of Mirkwood to recapture the Dwarves' ancient home and treasure under the Lonely Mountain. The treasure had been guarded by a dragon, Smaug. Through many adventures, Smaug had been killed and Bilbo had returned home with a substantial portion of the treasure. He lived the life of a rich eccentric for many years. Frodo's parents Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck had been killed in a boating accident when Frodo was 12; Frodo spent the next nine years living with his maternal family, the Brandybucks in Brandy Hall. At the age of 21 he was adopted by Bilbo, his cousin, who brought him to live at Bag End. He and Bilbo shared the same birthday, the 22nd of 'September'. Bilbo introduced Frodo to the Elvish languages, and they often went on long walking trips together.The Fellowship of the Ring book 1, ch. 1, \\"A Long-Expected Party\\" =The Fellowship of the Ring= Sketch Map of Middle- earth Frodo comes of age as Bilbo leaves the Shire for good on his one hundred and eleventh birthday. Frodo inherits Bag End and Bilbo's ring. Gandalf, at this time, is not certain about the origin of the ring, so he warns Frodo to avoid using it and to keep it secret. Frodo keeps the Ring hidden for the next 17 years, and the Ring gives him the same longevity it gave Bilbo. Gandalf returns to prove to him that it is the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron, who seeks to recover and use it to conquer Middle-earth.The Fellowship of the Ring book 1, ch. 2, \\"The Shadow of the Past\\" Realizing that he is a danger to the Shire as long as he remains there with the Ring, Frodo decides to take it to Rivendell, home of Elrond, a mighty Elf-lord. He leaves with three companions: his gardener Samwise Gamgee and his cousins Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took. They escape just in time, for Sauron's most powerful servants, the Nine Nazgûl, have entered the Shire as Black Riders, looking for Bilbo and the Ring. They follow Frodo's trail across the Shire and nearly intercept him.The Fellowship of the Ring book 1, ch. 3, \\"Three is Company\\"The Fellowship of the Ring book 1, ch. 4, \\"A Short Cut to Mushrooms\\"The Fellowship of the Ring book 1, ch. 5, \\"A Conspiracy Unmasked\\" The hobbits escape the Black Riders by travelling through the Old Forest.

The One Ring slips onto Frodo's finger inadvertently in the inn's common room, turning Frodo invisible. This attracts the attention of Sauron's agents, who ransack the hobbits' rooms in the night.The Fellowship of the Ring book 1, ch. 9, \\"At the Sign of the Prancing Pony\\" The group, under Strider's guidance, flees through the marshes.The Fellowship of the Ring book 1, ch. 10, \\"Strider\\" While encamped on Weathertop hill, they are attacked by five Nazgûl. The chief of the Nazgûl stabs Frodo with a Morgul-blade; Aragorn routs them with fire. A piece of the blade remains in Frodo's shoulder and, working its way towards his heart, threatens to turn him into a wraith under control of the Nazgul.The Fellowship of the Ring book 1, ch. 11, \\"A Knife in the Dark\\" With the help of his companions and an Elf-lord, Glorfindel, Frodo is able to evade the Nazgûl and reach Rivendell.The Fellowship of the Ring book 1, ch. 12, \\"Flight to the Ford\\" Nearly overcome by his wound, he is healed over time by Elrond.The Fellowship of the Ring book 2, ch. 1, \\"Many Meetings\\" The Council of Elrond meets in Rivendell and resolves to destroy the Ring by casting it into Mount Doom in Mordor, the realm of Sauron. Frodo, realizing that he is destined for this task, steps forward to be the Ring- bearer. A Fellowship of nine companions is formed to guide and protect him: the hobbits, Gandalf, Aragorn, the dwarf Gimli, the elf Legolas, and Boromir, a man of Gondor.

Frodo escapes by putting on the Ring and becoming invisible. This breaks the Fellowship; the company is scattered by invading Orcs. Frodo chooses to continue the quest alone, but Sam follows his master, joining him on the journey to Mordor.The Fellowship of the Ring book 2, ch. 10, \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship\\" =The Two Towers= Frodo and Sam make their way through the wilds, followed by the creature Gollum, who has been tracking the Fellowship since Moria, seeking to reclaim the Ring.

Shelob stings Frodo, rendering him unconscious, but Sam drives her off with Sting and the Phial of Galadriel.The Two Towers book 4, ch. 9, \\"Shelob's Lair\\" After attempting unsuccessfully to wake Frodo up, and unable to find any signs of life, Sam concludes that Frodo is dead and decides that his only option is to take the Ring and continue the quest. But he overhears orcs who find Frodo's body and learns that Frodo is not dead. The orcs take Frodo for questioning; Sam tries to follow but finds the door locked against him.The Two Towers book 4, ch. 10, \\"The Choices of Master Samwise\\" =The Return of the King= Sam rescues Frodo from the Orcs. After a brief confrontation in which Frodo becomes enraged that Sam has taken the Ring, Sam restores the Ring to Frodo.The Return of the King book 6, ch. 1, \\"The Tower of Cirith Ungol\\" The two of them, dressed in scavenged Orc-armour, set off for Mount Doom, trailed by Gollum.The Return of the King book 6, ch. 2, \\"The Land of Shadow\\" They witness the plains of Mordor empty at the approach of the Armies of the West. As the Ring gets closer to its master, Frodo becomes progressively weaker as its influence grows. When they run out of water, they leave all unnecessary baggage behind to travel light. As they reach Mount Doom, Gollum reappears and attacks Frodo, who beats him back. While Sam fights with Gollum, Frodo enters the chasm in the volcano where Sauron forged the Ring. Here Frodo loses the will to destroy the Ring, and instead puts it on, claiming it for himself. Gollum pushes Sam aside and attacks the invisible Frodo, biting off his finger. As he dances around in elation, Gollum loses his balance and falls with the Ring into the fiery Cracks of Doom. The Ring is destroyed, and with it Sauron's power. Frodo and Sam are rescued by Gandalf and several Great Eagles as Mount Doom erupts.The Return of the King book 6, ch. 3, \\"Mount Doom\\" After reuniting with the Fellowship and attending Aragorn's coronation as King of Gondor, the four hobbits return to the Shire.The Return of the King book 6, ch. 7, \\"Homeward Bound\\" They find the entire Shire in a state of upheaval. Saruman's agents—both Hobbits and Men—have taken it over and started a destructive process of industrialization. Saruman governs the Shire in secret under the name of Sharkey until Frodo and his companions lead a rebellion and defeat the intruders. Even after Saruman attempts to stab Frodo, Frodo lets him go.The Return of the King, book 6, ch. 8, \\"The Scouring of the Shire\\" Frodo and his companions restore the Shire to its prior state of peace and goodwill. Frodo never completely recovers from the physical, emotional, and psychological wounds he suffered during the quest to destroy the ring. Two years after the Ring was destroyed, Frodo and Bilbo as Ring-bearers are granted passage to Valinor, the earthly paradise where Frodo might find peace.The Return of the King book 6, ch. 9, \\"The Grey Havens\\" =Other works= \\"The Sea-Bell\\" was published in Tolkien's 1962 collection of verse The Adventures of Tom Bombadil with the sub-title Frodos Dreme. Tolkien suggests that this enigmatic narrative poem represents the despairing dreams that visited Frodo in the Shire in the years following the destruction of the Ring. It relates the unnamed speaker's journey to a mysterious land across the sea, where he tries but fails to make contact with the people who dwell there. He descends into despair and near-madness, eventually returning to his own country, to find himself utterly alienated from those he once knew. \\"Frodo the halfling\\" is mentioned briefly at the end of The Silmarillion, as \\"alone with his servant he passed through peril and darkness\\" and \\"cast the Great Ring of Power\\" into the fire.The Silmarillion, \\"Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age\\" In the poem Bilbo's Last Song, Frodo is at the Grey Havens at the farthest west of Middle-earth, about to leave the mortal world on an elven- ship to Valinor. \\"The Hunt for the Ring\\" in Unfinished Tales describes how the Black Riders travelled to Isengard and the Shire in search of the One Ring, purportedly \\"according to the account that Gandalf gave to Frodo\\". It is one of several mentions of Frodo in the book.Unfinished Tales, part 3, ch. 4 \\"The Hunt for the Ring\\" =Family tree= The Tolkien scholar Jason Fisher notes that Tolkien stated that hobbits were extremely \\"clannish\\" and had a strong \\"predilections for genealogy\\". Accordingly, Tolkien's decision to include Frodo's family tree in Lord of the Rings gives the book, in Fisher's view, a strongly \\"hobbitish perspective\\". The tree also, he notes, serves to show Frodo's and Bilbo's connections and familial characteristics. Frodo's family tree is as follows:Return of the King, Appendix C, \\"Family Trees\\", \\"Baggins of Hobbiton\\" Concept and creation Frodo did not appear until the third draft of A Long-Expected Party (the first chapter of The Lord of the Rings), when he was named Bingo, son of Bilbo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck.The Return of the Shadow, pp. 28–29. In the fourth draft, he was renamed Bingo Bolger-Baggins, son of Rollo Bolger and Primula Brandybuck.The Return of the Shadow, pp. 36–37. Tolkien did not change the name to Frodo until the third phase of writing, when much of the narrative, as far as the hobbits' arrival in Rivendell, had already taken shape.The Return of the Shadow, p. 309. Prior to this, the name \\"Frodo\\" had been used for the character who eventually became Pippin Took.The Return of the Shadow, p. 267. In drafts of the final chapters, published as Sauron Defeated, Gandalf names Frodo Bronwe athan Harthad (\\"Endurance Beyond Hope\\"), after the destruction of the Ring. Tolkien states that Frodo's name in Westron was Maura Labingi.The Peoples of Middle-earth, \\"The Appendix on Languages\\" Interpretations =Name and origins= Frodo is the only prominent hobbit whose name is not explained in Tolkien's Appendices to The Lord of the Rings. In a letter Tolkien states that it is the Old English name Fróda, connected to fród, \\"wise by experience\\".Letters, #168 to Richard Jeffrey, 7 September 1955 The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey suggests that the choice of name is significant: not, in Tolkien's phrase, one of the many \\"names that had no meaning at all in [the hobbits'] daily language\\". Instead, he notes, the Old Norse name Fróði is mentioned in Beowulf as the minor character Fróda. Fróði was, he writes, said by Saxo Grammaticus and Snorri Sturluson to be a peaceful ruler at the time of Christ, his time being named the Fróða-frið, the peace of Fróði. This was created by his magic mill, worked by two female giants, that could churn out peace and gold. He makes the giants work all day long at this task, until they rebel and grind out an army instead, which kills him and takes over, making the giants grind salt until the sea is full of it. The name Fróði is forgotten. Clearly, Shippey observes, evil is impossible to cure; and Frodo too is a \\"peacemaker, indeed in the end a pacifist\\". And, he writes, as Frodo gains experience through the quest, he also gains wisdom, matching the meaning of his name. =Character= Michael Stanton, writing in the J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia, describes Frodo's character as combining \\"courage, selflessness, and fidelity\\", attributes that make Frodo ideal as a Ring-bearer. He lacks Sam's simple sturdiness, Merry and Pippin's clowning, and the psychopathology of Gollum, writes Stanton, bearing out the saying that good is less exciting than evil; but Frodo grows through his quest, becoming \\"ennobled\\" by it, to the extent that returning to the Shire feels in Frodo's words \\"like falling asleep again\\". =Christ figure= Christian commentators have stated that there is no one complete, concrete, visible Christ figure in The Lord of the Rings, but that Frodo serves as the priestly aspect of Christ, alongside Gandalf as prophet and Aragorn as King, together making up the threefold office of the Messiah. =Tragic hero= The Tolkien scholar Jane Chance quotes Randel Helms's view that in both The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, \\"a most unheroic hobbit [Bilbo, Frodo] achieves heroic stature\\" in a quest romance. Chance writes that Frodo grows from seeing the threat as external, such as from the Black Riders, to internal, whether within the Fellowship, as shown by Boromir's attempt on the Ring, or within himself, as he struggles against the controlling power of the Ring. The Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger summarizes Frodo's role in Lord of the Rings: \\"The greatest hero of all, Frodo Baggins, is also the most tragic. He comes to the end of his story bereft of the Ring, denied in his home Shire the recognition he deserves, and unable to continue his life as it was before his terrible adventure.\\" =Providence= The Tolkien critic Paul H. Kocher discusses the role of providence, in the form of the intentions of the angel-like Valar or of the creator Eru Ilúvatar, in Bilbo's finding of the Ring and Frodo's bearing of it; as Gandalf says, Frodo was \\"meant\\" to have it, though it remains his choice to co-operate with this purpose. Adaptations Frodo in Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated version Frodo appears in adaptations of The Lord of the Rings for radio, cinema, and stage. In Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated version, Frodo was voiced by Christopher Guard. In the 1980 Rankin/Bass animated version of The Return of the King, made for television, the character was voiced by Orson Bean, who had previously played Bilbo in the same company's adaptation of The Hobbit. In the \\"massive\\" 1981 BBC radio serial of The Lord of the Rings, Frodo is played by Ian Holm, who later played Bilbo in Peter Jackson's film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings. In the 1993 television miniseries Hobitit by Finnish broadcaster Yle, Frodo is played by Taneli Mäkelä. Elijah Wood as Frodo in Peter Jackson's film trilogy In The Lord of the Rings film trilogy (2001–2003) directed by Peter Jackson, Frodo is played by the American actor Elijah Wood. Dan Timmons writes in the Mythopoeic Society's Tolkien on Film: Essays on Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings (Mythopoeic Press, 2005) that the themes and internal logic of the Jackson films are undermined by the portrayal of Frodo, which he considers a weakening of Tolkien's original. The film critic Roger Ebert writes that he missed the depth of characterisation he felt in the book, Frodo doing little but watching other characters decide his fate \\"and occasionally gazing significantly upon the Ring\\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone however states that Wood played the role with \\"soulful conviction\\", and that his portrayal matured as the story progressed. Wood reprised the role in a brief appearance in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. On stage, Frodo was portrayed by James Loye in the three- hour stage production of The Lord of the Rings, which opened in Toronto in 2006, and was brought to London in 2007. Frodo was portrayed by Joe Sofranko in the Cincinnati productions of The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002), and The Return of the King (2003) for Clear Stage Cincinnati.

There is no village centre, the parish consists of farms and hamlets such as Abwell, Breadstone, Halmore, Mobley and Wanswell. The westernmost portion of the parish boundary follows the River Severn, across which is the parish of Lydney in the Forest of Dean district. The other adjoining parishes are all in the Stroud district, these are: Hinton to the north-west; Slimbridge to the north- east; Cam to the east; Stinchcombe to the south-east; Alkington to the south; whilst both Ham and Stone and Berkeley lie to the south-west. Hamfallow was in Thornbury Rural District until the RDC was abolished in 1974. The greater part was transferred into the new county of Avon, as part of the new district of Northavon but a group of parishes in the north of the district, around Berkeley, wished not to transfer into the new county, but chose instead to remain with Gloucestershire, under the new Stroud District Council. These were the parishes of Hinton, Hamfallow, Ham and Stone, Alkington, and Berkeley itself. With the demise of Avon, in 1996, Hamfallow remained with the main county of Gloucestershire. Today, Hamfallow is represented by the county councillor for Berkeley Vale division and the two district councillors for Berkeley ward on Stroud District Council.

He was a descendant (the great-grandson) of mystic poet dervish Aşık Pasha (1272–1333). He was born in the region of Amasya and studied in various Anatolian towns before going to Hadj and stayed some time in Egypt. He later took part in various Ottoman campaigns, such as the Battle of Kosovo (1448), Fall of Constantinople and witnessed the circumcision festivities of Mustafa and Bayezid II the sons of Mehmed the Conqueror. Later in his life he started to write his famous history work Tevārīḫ-i Āl-i ʿOsmān. Works His main works are known under two names: Menâkıb-ı Âli-i Osman and Tevārīḫ-i Āl-i ʿOsmān. The works deals with Ottoman history from the beginning of the Ottoman state until the time of Mehmed II. It is a chronological history of the Ottoman Empire between the years 1298 and 1472. The work is written in Ottoman Turkish and is partially based on older Ottoman sources, it is more detailed at the events he witnessed personally. His work was used by later Ottoman historians and became a fashion.  Criticism  According to Halil Inalcik, in his works Aşıkpaşazade twisted his interpretation of the actual events to match his preconceptions. It was typical for him to simply merge two different stories to forge a new description of the battle. Some parts of \\"Cosmorama\\" or \\"Cihan-Nümâ\\", written by Neşri who was another prominent representative of early Ottoman Historiography, were based on the work of Aşıkpaşazade.

It is a common, wood-rotting species in Europe, typically growing on dead attached branches of oak. The fruit bodies are up to wide, shiny, black and blister- like, and grow singly or in clusters. Its occurrence elsewhere is uncertain because of confusion with the related species, Exidia nigricans. Taxonomy The species was originally described from France as Tremella glandulosa by Bulliard in 1789. It was subsequently placed in Exidia by Fries in 1822. Fries, however, modified Bulliard's species concept to include a second, effused, coalescing species—the name Exidia glandulosa serving for both. This combined concept was used until Neuhoff separated the two species in 1936. Unfortunately, Neuhoff gave the name Exidia glandulosa to the effused species, adopting the name Exidia truncata for Bulliard's original species. This error was pointed out by Donk in 1966, who proposed the name Exidia plana for the effused species, now replaced by Exidia nigricans. Molecular research has shown that Exidia glandulosa and E. nigricans, though similar, are distinct. The fungus is commonly known as \\"black witch's butter\\", \\"black jelly roll\\", or the \\"warty jelly fungus\\". Description Exidia glandulosa forms dark sepia to blackish, rubbery-gelatinous fruit bodies that are top-shaped (like an inverted cone) and around across. They are firm when fresh, but become lax and distorted with age or in wet weather. The fruit bodies occur singly or in small clusters. The upper, spore-bearing surface is shiny and dotted with small pimples or pegs. The undersurface is smooth and matte at first, but develops a dense covering of small, gelatinous spines. The fruit bodies are attached to the wood at the base. The spore print is white. When the fruit bodies are dried they can shrink to form a flattened black crust. =Microscopic characters= The microscopic characters are typical of the genus Exidia. The basidia are ellipsoid, septate, 15–25 by 8–13 µm. The spores are allantoid (sausage-shaped), with dimensions of 14–19 by 4.5–5.5 µm. Spores of Exidia glandulosa =Similar species= Exidia nigricans Bulgaria inquinans Exidia glandulosa is frequently confused with Exidia nigricans. The two are similar, but E. nigricans produces button-shaped fruit bodies in clusters that quickly become deformed and coalesce, forming an effused, lobed mass that can be or more across. The two species are indistinguishable microscopically, but DNA research indicates they are distinct. The closely related E. recisa has more erect fruit bodies without warts on the surface, lighter colors (ranging from yellowish brown to dark brown), and a small base. The ascomycete Bulgaria inquinans forms similar, rubbery-gelatinous, blackish fruit bodies on oak. Their upper surfaces are entirely smooth, however, and they produce copious black (not white) spore prints, often leaving a black stain if wiped with the hand. Habitat and distribution Exidia glandulosa is a wood-rotting species, typically found on dead attached branches of broadleaf trees, especially oak, occasionally hazel or beech. It is a pioneer species capable of colonizing living or recently dead wood. A study of the wood decay process in attached oak branches showed that E. glandulosa is a member of a community of eight basidiomycetous fungi consistently associated with the decay of dying branches on living trees. Specifically, its role is to disintegrate the tissue of the vascular cambium, which loosens the attached bark. It persists for some while on fallen branches and logs. Fruit bodies are normally produced in the autumn and winter. Its global distribution is uncertain because of confusion with E. nigricans, but it is present in Europe at least. Edibility Exidia glandulosa is reported to be edible.

Small Island is a 2004 prize-winning novel by British author Andrea Levy, her fourth novel. Characters The novel is based on four main characters—Hortense, Queenie, Gilbert and Bernard—and the story is told from each of their points of view. Mainly set in 1948, the plot focuses on the diaspora of Jamaican immigrants, who, escaping economic hardship on their own \\"small island\\", move to England, the Mother Country, for which the men have fought during World War II. While the novel focuses on the narratives of Gilbert and Hortense as they adjust to life in England, after a reception that is not quite the warm embrace that they had hoped for, the interracial relationship between Queenie and Michael is central to the plot and the connections that are established between all of the characters. As the story is narrated from various viewpoints, it is achronological, skipping around to discuss each character's life before the outbreak of WWII. =Character summaries= *Queenie Bligh: The level-headed character in the book. She is fair, open-minded and has a very big and kind heart. After her husband, Bernard, left for the war she opened her house for servicemen, which is when she met Gilbert. She is symbolic of England: Queenie comes with reference to the royal family (she was also christened Victoria - after Queen Victoria) and Bligh comes from Blighty, a slightly dated word for England. *Hortense: A very well-mannered woman who looks down her nose at other people. She comes from Jamaica and has moved to England with hopes of becoming a teacher, but she has a certain naiveté about what to expect when she arrives. Having been brought up in British colonial Jamaica, she has been taught very many exaggerated facts about the niceties of English living. It becomes quite ironic as she turns out to be more polite and well spoken than anyone she meets, despite being a little snobbish. *Michael Roberts: A Jamaican Air Force serviceman who grows up alongside Hortense. Michael is a charming and charismatic man, and his mischievous nature causes him problems with his religious father and the community in which he lives. When he leaves for the Air Force he stays at Queenie's boarding house in England and begins a relationship with her, resulting in Queenie's pregnancy. Queenie and Michael's relationship is brief and he is never aware of the baby, and neither Queenie or Hortense ever find out that they both know Michael. *Gilbert Joseph: A lovable and funny character who is always trying his hardest to please everyone. Very clumsy but honest, he is one of the more likable characters. He is quite laid back, but extremely intimidated by Hortense, his wife. *Bernard Bligh: An extremely reserved character who interacts very poorly with almost everyone, until the RAF which forces interaction upon him. He is however, and albeit awkwardly, in love with his wife Queenie, though their sexual life is, largely due to him, not good, a fact which has ramifications later. He has a deep-seated streak of racism and while Queenie appears to be free of this in some ways, both have complicated interactions with race, culminating in the book's climax.

On 5 November 2019 BBC News included Small Island on its list of the 100 most influential novels. It was described in The Guardian by Mike Phillips as Levy's \\"big book\\". Levy said in 2004: \\"When I started Small Island I didn’t intend to write about the war. I wanted to start in 1948 with two women, one white, one black, in a house in Earls Court, but when I asked myself, 'Who are these people and how did they get here?' I realised that 1948 was so very close to the war that nothing made sense without it. If every writer in Britain were to write about the war years there would still be stories to be told, and none of us would have come close to what really happened. It was such an amazing schism in the middle of a century. And Caribbean people got left out of the telling of that story, so I am attempting to put them back into it. But I am not telling it from only a Jamaican point of view. I want to tell stories from the black and white experience. It is a shared history.\\"Salandy-Brown, Marina, \\"ANDREA LEVY: 'THIS WAS NOT A SMALL STORY'\\", Caribbean Beat, Issue 70 (November/December 2004). In 2009, The Guardian selected Small Island as one of the defining books of the decade.\\"Your books of the decade: What we were reading\\", London: The Guardian, 5 December 2009.

On August 24, 1996, Hunziker was taken into custody by North Korean police after swimming into the country across the Yalu River from the People's Republic of China. Hunziker spent three months in North Korean custody before being released and returned to the United States thanks to the negotiation efforts of then-New Mexico congressman Bill Richardson. However, less than a month after his return, Hunziker committed suicide. Early life Hunziker's father, Edwin Hunziker, was an American veteran of the Korean War who had spent 12 years stationed in South Korea with the United States Forces Korea, and while living there, met Hunziker's Korean mother, Jong Nye, a South Korean citizen. The two later moved to the United States, settling in Tacoma, Washington, where they had three children, and Hunziker's father worked in a variety of jobs including as a bus driver and cement layer. Hunziker's father developed a drinking problem, and in 1974 Hunziker's father and mother divorced. Hunziker moved with his mother to Anchorage, Alaska, where he spent most of his childhood with various relatives of his mother's. Hunziker and his mother eventually moved back to Tacoma, where she opened the Olympus Hotel. In 1988 Hunziker graduated from Stadium High School in Tacoma. He went on to attend colleges in Yakima and South Seattle on a football scholarship, but began drinking and using drugs, and did not graduate. Hunziker later returned to Anchorage, where his mother was running a motel with her boyfriend, Kevin Hux. There, Hunziker helped out with the business, often driving guests to and from the airport. Hunziker's mother later introduced him to a young South Korean woman in the hopes that the two would develop a relationship, and they married soon after. However, Hunziker's drug and alcohol problems, combined with his increasing violence towards his wife and his relatives, led to the failure of his marriage in 1993. His mother applied for a restraining order against him in that same year, and Hux filed for another restraining order two years later after Hunziker allegedly stabbed him in the face with a pencil, and assaulted twelve motel employees and guests in the space of a month. In another incident, Hunziker attempted to forcibly remove his former wife from a hospital, and attacked a nurse when she attempted to intervene. From 1992 to 1996, Hunziker was arrested seven times on a variety of charges including assault, malicious destruction, and drunk driving. Hunziker reportedly converted to Christianity while in jail, and upon his seventh release, in 1995, fled back to Washington hoping to avoid being brought up on pending criminal assault charges that his mother had filed against him in Alaska. In mid-1996, Hunziker decided that he wanted to go to South Korea to find a job as an English teacher and evangelize. He borrowed money for an airline ticket to Seoul, and left the United States in July, staying with his cousin Yun Jae- hun. According to his parents, Hunziker could speak Korean well, and it would be his third trip to South Korea, including the first one during which he met his wife-to-be. From Seoul, he took a trip to the People's Republic of China beginning on August 16, spending one week in Beijing before proceeding to northeast China by train. Detention in North Korea On August 24, 1996, Hunziker swam across the Yalu River from Dandong on the China–North Korea border, on a dare from a friend with whom he had been drinking alcohol. North Korean farmers found him and summoned the police, who arrested him. Swedish diplomats were able to visit Hunziker once after his detention, on September 17. North Korea ignored later requests from the United States that Hunziker be allowed to receive regular visits. The North Korean government did not announce Hunziker's arrest until October 6, and analysts suspected they delayed the announcement until a more strategic time in an attempt to divert attention from two other international controversies: one regarding the unsolved murder of South Korean consul for the Russian Far East, Choe Deok- geun, in which North Korean involvement was suspected, and the other about the landing on South Korean soil of a North Korean submarine containing 26 commandos. On October 8, the North Korean government formally announced that they would charge Hunziker with espionage, a charge which could bring the death penalty. Edwin Hunziker called his congressman, Randy Tate, in an attempt to learn what, if anything, the United States government was doing for his son. Evan Hunziker was permitted to send a letter home on October 12, in which he stated that \\"I came across the border as a Christian man first and foremost to promote peace, and ... I have not confessed to being a spy\\". Soon after, Hunziker was moved from the hotel where he had been held initially to a detention center. Edwin Hunziker would later recall his son's description of the food, that it \\"was edible and it was sustainable, but it was lousy food\\". He reportedly signed several confessions, though under psychological duress. Release by North Korea Eventually, Bill Richardson, a New Mexico congressman who had a history of negotiating for the release of Americans held by countries with whom the United States had poor or no formal relations, arranged to go to North Korea to discuss the matter. Richardson went as a private citizen, but was accompanied by a representative of the United States Department of State, arriving in North Korea on November 24. According to Richardson, the North Korean mission to the United Nations in New York City initially demanded US$100,000 as a bail and fine for the release of Hunziker, whom they considered a spy and an illegal interloper. However, Richardson refused this demand as an unacceptable quid-pro-quo which would imply Hunziker's guilt. Eventually, the two sides settled on payment of $5,000 hotel costs for the period of Hunziker's incarceration, which Hunziker's family, rather than the government, paid. Richardson stated that the money was not the major trigger for Hunziker's release; rather, he speculated that the North Korean side realized they had made a major mistake during the incident where a submarine full of their commandos landed on South Korean soil, which occurred only weeks after Hunziker's arrest, and hoped to reduce tensions and regain aid. He also stated that the North Korean military had been opposed to Hunziker's release. Hunziker was first flown to Yokota Air Base in Japan for a medical examination on November 27, where he was found to have two red marks on his neck, possibly rope burns; North Korea claimed he attempted to hang himself while in custody. He arrived back in the United States via Seattle- Tacoma International Airport. Death After his release, Hunziker moved back to Tacoma, into the Olympus Hotel owned by his mother, as he could not return to Alaska due to the three outstanding warrants for his arrest by the Anchorage police. According to friends, relatives, and fellow hotel residents, he seemed happy, though not talkative. Hunziker often spent his nights in the hotel restaurant, where he was found dead on the morning of December 18, lying on a bench with a gunshot wound to the head and his cousin's .357 Magnum revolver lying next to him.

Early life  Govett was born in 1910 in the small suburb of Hawthorn in Melbourne, Australia, to parents Alexander and Helena Nellie Govett. During Govett's childhood, his family moved often due his father's job as a State Savings Bank Branch Manager. Govett studied art at the National Gallery School in Melbourne, and later at the Max Meldrum School from 1930 to 1939 while working as a bank clerk at the State Bank. His mother was also a painter and studied with Max Meldrum from 1931 to 1950. Govett served in the Army in the Pacific during World War II for five years, and was awarded the Pacific Star for his service. After the war, he moved to London, where he studied under Thomas Dugdale at the Chelsea School of Art in 1947.  Career  During his lifetime Govett lived in London and Melbourne, having a studio at 22 Cheyne Gardens, Chelsea, London in the early 1970s. While in London, he produced portraits of adults and children, as well as contemporary scenes of the city. He also did copies of old masters' works such as Rembrandt at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. One of his most famous portraits, \\"Portrait of Sir Charles Mackerras\\", was exhibited at Qantas Gallery, London. In later years, he returned permanently to Melbourne and resumed his residence at 22 Scenic Crescent, Kalorama, in the Dandenongs. He died on 11 July 1998 and was buried at the Kangaroo Ground Cemetery on 16 July 1998.

He has been Professor of Art at L'École supérieure des beaux-arts de Tours since 1979 and Visiting Professor of French Literature at the University of Southern California since 2005. He recently received the Kessel Prize for his novel Koba (Seuil, 2002), as well as the 70th Prix Apollinaire for his play Icare & I don't (Seuil). In 2010, Alain Borer was awarded the 10th Pierre Mac Orlan Prize for Le Ciel & la carte, carnet de voyage dans les mers du Sud à bord de La Boudeuse (Seuil), and the Maurice Genevoix Prize from the Académie Française in 2011. Alain Borer was made a Knight (1985), then Officer (1993) of Arts and Letters in the French Legion of Honour, and is President of the Printemps des Poètes association. Alain Borer additionally received the Édouard Glissant Prize in 2005, awarded by the University of Paris VIII for all of his achievements. Biography Alain Borer grew up in Luxeuil-les- Bains (Franche-Comté), before moving to Geneva to study at the Institut Florimont (1965–69), Nancy (Lycée Poincaré, 1970), Paris (Lycée Henri IV, 1971), the University of Paris (Université Paris Diderot) and Paris X-Nanterre. He lived for some time in Croatia (1974–80), and Rome (1986–89). He currently resides in the French town of Chaumussay, in Touraine. Works The name of Alain Borer is associated with that of Arthur Rimbaud, to whom he has devoted thirty years of his life. Aged 17, Alain Borer directed Le Bateau ivre, a student journal at the Institut Florimont in Geneva; aged 27 he travelled to Harar in Ethiopia (the same age as Rimbaud was when he arrived here) as part of a film-making expedition with Léo Ferré (the film \\"Le Voleur de feu\\" was aired on French television in 1978). Alain Borer is the author of two books which have become classic references in Rimbaud studies; an album- book Un sieur Rimbaud, se disant négociant, with Philippe Soupault (Lachenal & Ritter, 1984), and his combined essay and travel journal Rimbaud en Abyssinie (Fiction & Cie, 1984, et Points-Seuil, 2004). Aged 37 (the age of Rimbaud's death), Alain Borer completed his book publications on the man with the \\"soles of wind\\"; Adieu à Rimbaud and L'Œuvre-vie, 1991, is an original monument of a publication marking the centenary of Rimbaud's death and which sheds considerable new light upon Rimbaud's universe, and which breathed considerable life into scholarship on the poet. On reading the entirety of Rimbaud's work (the \\"rimbaldothèque\\") Alain Borer is not only the first to have traced the physical footsteps of Rimbaud's world journeys (in what he has termed the \\"Rimbaldie\\"), but also to have developed and forged the necessary concepts (the paradigm of the Oeuvre-Vie, \\"the major signifier\\") permitting him to theorize and unlock the secrets of \\"this wild parade\\" (Rimbaud, l'heure de la fuite, Gallimard, 1991, with an introduction by Hugo Pratt). Alain Borer is also a novelist (Koba, Seuil, collection \\"Fiction & Cie\\"), art critic (Dürer, 1980, Chambord, Monum, Hugo Pratt, Casterman), particularly on Joseph Beuys (Joseph Beuys, published by the Centre Pompidou, 1994, and La Bibliothèque des Arts, Lausanne, 2001), essayist (Saint-Martin ou la coupabilité, musée de Tours), playwright (Paul des oiseaux, Le Chant du Rien visible, Fourbis, Le Quadrige invectif, Le cercle d'art, 2005, assembled together in Icare & I don't, Seuil, 2007), and world traveler and travel- writer (Sarajevo, Gallimard, Liberia, Michalon, Los Angeles, Phébus, Pacific Palisades; with a work on the Pacific Palisades due to be published by Seuil). As a poet (Pour l'amour du ciel, CD Radio France, the Poétiques Collection), Alain Borer is joined by André Velter and Zéno Bianu in the Groupe Actéon. The group has three major preoccupations: an astrophysical obsession with \\"extreme travel\\" (Le Nuage de Magellan, Zone bleue), a \\"pataphysical\\" dimension (Bestiaire, Alexandrins fortuits), as well as poetic texts stripped to their bare essentials, which they have termed \\"noems\\" (Jeil, 2004, Loups plats, 2006). After François Coupé (1973), Alain Borer has made \\"book-objects,\\" collages (Calme, 1987), and numerous books in collaboration with artists (for example, on Touareg jewellery with Kaïdin), which he signs off under the pen name \\"Jaseur boreal.\\" An exposition of his photographs, La Sanglinière, was presented in the château de Tours in April 2007. It is poetry, however, which infiltrates all of Alain Borer's writings. His latest work, Icare & I don't (Seuil, 2007), \\"a metaphysical vaudeville,\\" illustrates this rare alliance of poetry and wit, of lightness and depth, whose tone should give life to works of \\"allegro serioso\\" – a program about which Roland Barthes wrote: \\"With you, the art of living and the art of writing merge.\\" His work includes a number of prefaces to books and art catalogues, book collaborations and collaborative reviews; a recent catalogue [G. Tran Din Mahe, 2008] lists approximately one thousand publications by one hundred publishers, in addition to forty television programs (Apostrophes in 1984 et Bouillon de culture in 1991), about a hundred radio shows (principally on France Culture), two hundred and fifty conferences and public lectures in one hundred different towns and thirty universities in about thirty countries. His work is the subject of more than six hundred press articles. Selected publications ;In the USA * Rimbaud in Abissinia.

Toyne, from Terang, made his way into the Geelong seniors for the first time in 1940 after serving his apprenticeship in the reserves. He spent the 1942 season at Fitzroy, as Geelong were forced into recess as a result of the war, but was out of action for the next two years due to his service with the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). Returning to Geelong in 1945, Toyne finished third in the club's 'best and fairest'. After getting married, Toyne moved to Sandringham in 1946 to live and work. Geelong granted him a clearance which allowed him to be appointed captain-coach of the Sandringham Football Club. The club had finished 11th the previous VFA season and had never reached the finals but Toyne steered them to a seven-point Grand Final win over Camberwell. Sandringham were runners-up in 1947 but struggled the following season, with Toyne getting suspended for three matches during the year after an altercation. Five rounds into the 1949 season, Toyne resigned, citing that he was being victimised by the umpires. He finished the year at Melbourne before crossing to Sturt, which he captain-coached in 1950 and 1951. His final port of call was Launceston for the 1953 Northern Tasmanian Football Association season. References *Holmesby, Russell and Main, Jim (2007). The Encyclopedia of AFL Footballers. 7th ed.

R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, the elder son of Elendil. He was born in Númenor, and fled with his father when the island was drowned. He became King of Gondor. He cut the Ring from Sauron's hand, but instead of destroying it, claimed it for his own. He was killed by orcs, and the Ring was lost in the River Anduin. Fictional history = In Númenor = In Isildur's youth Ar-Pharazôn, King of Númenor, was corrupted by the fallen Maia Sauron, who urged that Nimloth the White Tree be cut down. Isildur went to the court of the king in disguise and stole a fruit of the tree. He was severely wounded during his escape, but his sacrifice was not in vain: Nimloth was cut down and burned shortly afterwards, but the line of the White Tree continued by way of the stolen fruit. When Númenor was destroyed by Ilúvatar Elendil's family escaped in nine ships. The Silmarillion, \\"Akallabêth\\" = In Middle-earth = The refugees from Númenor fled east to the continent of Middle-earth. Isildur's father Elendil landed in the north and founded the realm of Arnor, while Isildur and his brother Anárion landed in the south, where they established the realm of Gondor, which they ruled jointly until Anárion was killed in Mordor. Isildur settled on the west bank of the Anduin and established the city of Minas Tirith. However, Sauron captured Minas Ithil and destroyed the White Tree. Anárion and his family escaped down the Anduin by boat, bearing with them a seedling of the tree. They sailed to Lindon, seeking the Elven King Gil-galad and Elendil in Arnor. Anárion bought time for Gondor by defending Osgiliath and driving the Dark Lord back to the mountains, while Elendil and Gil-galad marshalled their forces. As told in The Fellowship of the Ring, Isildur returned with Elendil and Gil-galad in the Last Alliance of Elves and Men. After the Alliance defeated Sauron's host at the Battle of Dagorlad they advanced into Mordor and laid siege to Barad-dûr. When Minas Ithil was recaptured Isildur sent his younger sons Aratan and Ciryon to man that fortress, which prevented Sauron and his forces from escaping that way. Isildur was accompanied throughout the war by his eldest son Elendur. The campaign in Mordor was long and bitter, and Anárion was killed by a stone from the Dark Tower. Besieged in the Dark Tower for seven years, the enemy was all but defeated, and Sauron himself appeared to challenge the king. During the final battle on the slopes of Mount Doom, Elendil and Gil-galad were both killed in combat with the Dark Lord, but Sauron's mortal form was destroyed as well. Letters, #131: Elendil and Gil- galad were \\"slain in the act of slaying Sauron.\\" The Second Age ended, and Isildur became King of both Arnor and Gondor. Isildur took up the hilt-shard of Narsil, Elendil's sword, and cut the One Ring from the hand of Sauron. Despite the urging of Elrond and Círdan, Gil-galad's lieutenants, Isildur did not throw the Ring into the fires of Mount Doom. He made a scroll with a description of the Ring and a copy of its fading inscription. This scroll was deposited in the archives of Minas Anor (later Minas Tirith) and was discovered by Gandalf nearly an Age later. After the fall of Sauron, the greater part of the army of Arnor returned home while Isildur stayed in Gondor for a year, restoring order and defining its boundaries. He planted the seedling of the White Tree in Minas Tirith in memory of Anárion. As his brother's helmet had been crushed during his death at Barad-dûr, Isildur left his own helmet as Gondor's crown. He installed Anárion's son Meneldil as King of Gondor, and returned north en route to Arnor with his three sons. He made first for Rivendell, where his wife and his fourth son, Valandil, had stayed throughout the War of the Last Alliance. =Isildur's death= yellow iris. At the Gladden Fields in the middle course of the River Anduin Isildur's party was ambushed by roaming Orcs from the Misty Mountains. It was 5 'October' in the second year of Isildur's reign, and the second year of the Third Age. Unfinished Tales, part 3, ch. 1 \\"The Disaster of the Gladden Fields\\", pp. 271–287 Tolkien wrote two differing accounts of the battle leading to Isildur's end. \\"Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age\\", at the end of The Silmarillion, is told from the point of the view of the Eldar. It states that Isildur had set no guard in his camp at night, deeming that all his foes had been overthrown, and orcs attacked him there. The Silmarillion, \\"Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age\\", pp. 293-295 In Unfinished Tales Tolkien gives a fuller account, writing that Isildur was ambushed on the march by orcs. Isildur had left Minas Anor with a party of some 200 soldiers. His men had to march, as their horses were mainly beasts of burden, not for riding. They had two dozen archers, but they were too few to be effective. Isildur chose the route along the Anduin rather than the safer but longer road North. Sauron, however, had deployed an army of orcs east of the Misty Mountains to attack stragglers of the Last Alliance. The orcs did not show themselves when the armies of the Elves and Men passed by, but they were more than a match for Isildur's small company. Isildur was assailed at sunset. Though the first orc sortie was beaten off, the orcs regrouped and surrounded Isildur's party to prevent his escape. When nightfall came the orcs assaulted him from all sides. The Dúnedain were surrounded and outnumbered. Ciryon was killed and Aratan was mortally wounded in a failed attempt to rescue Elendur, who urged his father to flee. Isildur put on the Ring, hoping to escape under the cover of invisibility. Fleeing to the Anduin, he cast off his armour and tried to swim to the other side of the river, but the Ring slipped (of its own volition) from his finger. Isildur felt that the Ring was missing and was momentarily dismayed, but with the burden of the Ring removed he rallied and made for the opposite bank. Despite the darkness, the Elendilmir that he was wearing betrayed his position to orcs on the far bank, who were seeking survivors from the attack, and they killed him with their poisoned arrows. Isildur's squire, Ohtar, saved Elendil's sword from the enemy, fleeing into the valley before the orcs encircled Isildur's company. Estelmo, Elendur's squire, was found alive under his master's body, stunned by a club. During the War of the Ring the Nazgûl searched the Gladden Fields, but failed to find any traces of Isildur's remains. Their efforts were hampered by Saruman, who had deceived the Nazgul, and who had got there first. After the overthrow of Saruman and the opening of Orthanc (in The Two Towers) Gimli found a hidden closet containing the original Elendilmir, which was presumed lost when Isildur died. Development In the short work The Fall of Númenor, written before 1937, Tolkien wrote of two brothers named Elendil and Valandil, who escaped the destruction of Númenor and founded two kingdoms in Middle-earth, Elendil in the north and Valandil in the south. Valandil was thus a precursor to the later Isildur, although in this work he was not Elendil's son but his brother.Christopher Tolkien (1987), The History of Middle-earth, The Lost Road; Soon afterwards Tolkien started a time-travel story, The Lost Road, in which a father and a son were to reappear time and again in human families throughout history. Only two chapters were written, one set in or near the present day, with the father named Oswin and the son Alboin, and one set in Númenor just before its fall, with the father named Elendil and the son Herendil. Here Valandil is the name of Elendil's father. It seems that Herendil (later Isildur) and his father were going to escape the destruction of Númenor as in The Fall of Númenor, but the story did not progress that far before it was abandoned. In one of the earliest manuscripts of The Lord of the Rings, written in 1938, in the chapter which came to be called The Shadow of the Past, Gandalf tells Frodo (then called Bingo) that his ring \\"fell from the hand of an elf as he swam across a river\\".Christopher Tolkien (1988), The History of Middle-earth, The Return of the Shadow; pp 78, 85, 261 Although Isildur was not an elf, this was the earliest germ of the story of Isildur's death. In the next version of this part of the story Isildur himself appears, first named Ithildor, then changed to Isildor. He is described as a man who cut the One Ring from Sauron's finger after his father (here named Orendil) defeated Sauron in single combat, then lost it while swimming across a river to escape Orcs. House of Elendil Reception Paul H. Kocher writes that whereas Isildur claimed the Ring as his own, Aragorn, on hearing Frodo's exclamation that since he is Isildur's direct descendant the Ring must be his, at once renounces all claim to it. Aragorn explains that he searched for it to help Gandalf as \\"it seemed fit that Isildur's heir should labour to repair Isildur's fault\\", an inherited wrong. Vedran Dodig writes that just as Jesus, in his role as king, is a descendant of King David, Aragorn is a descendant of Isildur. Nicholas Birns notes Isildur's survival, along with his father Elendil, of Númenor's catastrophic fall, an event that recalls to him Plato's Atlantis,the Biblical fall of man, and Noah's flood; he notes that Tolkien called Elendil a \\"Noachian figure\\", an echo of the biblical Noah. Tom Shippey writes that Gandalf's account to the Council of Elrond of Isildur's description of the Ring combines hints of the ancient time in which Isildur lived, with old words like \\"glede\\" (a hot coal) and obsolete endings as in \\"fadeth\\", and \\"loseth\\", but with a sudden reminder of Gollum's name for the Ring, with \\"It is precious to me, though I buy it with great pain.\\" His use of the \\"ominous word 'precious'\\" is, Shippey writes, quite enough for readers to guess that Isildur was already becoming addicted to the Ring. Adaptations In Ralph Bakshi's animated film version of The Lord of the Rings, released in 1978, Isildur is called Prince Isildur of the mighty Kings from across the Sea and appears as the events of the Last Alliance are portrayed in silhouette. He is called \\"the heroic shadow who slipped in\\" to chop off the One Ring from Sauron's finger. Later, as he sat at the base of a tree by the River Anduin examining the One Ring. he senses a disturbance, draws his sword, and is shot by Orc arrows a moment later. In Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy Isildur is played by Harry Sinclair. He briefly appears in the first scenes of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, and in an extended flashback scene later on. In the theatrical versions Anárion and heirs do not appear, nor are they mentioned, and Arnor does not figure either. In The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King Legolas refers to Isildur as \\"the last king of Gondor\\". However, in the extended edition both Arnor and the House of Anárion are mentioned, and it is clear that Isildur was not the last king. In the first film Isildur and Elrond go to the Crack of Doom where he refuses to destroy the Ring (Tolkien never wrote that he went to the Crack himself, only that he was advised to). In all versions of the films Isildur speaks only the one word \\"No\\" when he refuses to throw the ring into the Crack of Doom. This line was spoken not by Sinclair but by Hugo Weaving, who played Elrond. The Disaster of the Gladden Fields, too, is depicted in Jackson's first film: Isildur's column of mounted troops is ambushed on a dark forest road. Shippey writes that Jackson uses the voice-over to say of Isildur that he had \\"this one chance to destroy evil for ever\\", commenting that when Tolkien says \\"for ever\\", he at once indicates that that optimistic hope is wrong: Elrond says he recalls \\"when Thangorodrim was broken, and the Elves deemed that evil was ended for ever, and it was not so.\\" Shippey writes that there is a glimpse here of a sharp difference between Jackson's and Tolkien's concept of evil, and their respective media: Tolkien believed that even the best of men were fallen, victory always temporary, and portrayed that in his writings, whereas a dramatic medium like film required good on one side and bad on the other.

The stroke side is the port side of the boat. Stroke action The stroke is the set of actions to propel the boat, and comprises two main parts - the drive when pressure is applied through the oars to pull the boat through the water, and the recovery when the oars are lifted out of the water and returned to the start position. Stroke seat When the boat has more than one rower, the rower closest to the stern of the boat is referred to as \\"stroke\\". This is the most important position in the boat, because the stroke rower sets the stroke rate and rhythm for the rest of the crew to follow. Stroke seat has to be a very calm and yet very competitive individual. A good stroke will lead a team by bringing the best out of every rower in the boat. The rower at the opposite end of the boat is referred to as bow. Dudley Storey, double Olympic medallist for New Zealand and later the country's national coach, describes the required qualities of a stroke as follows: Stroke side Stroke side refers to the port side of the boat, which is on the left-hand side of a cox facing forwards, but on the right-hand side of a rower facing backwards. The usage derives from the tradition of having the stroke rower's oar be on the port side of the boat. However, the stroke seat oar in a sweep boat does not always emerge from port side, such as when the boat is starboard rigged.Argonaut The Arts of Rowing and Training, Edwin Brickwood 1866 p21] In Cornish pilot gigs, the stroke rower's oar is on the starboard (right) side and therefore stroke side refers to the starboard side of the boat.

William Somner, 1693 engraving by Michael Burghers. Life He was baptised in the church of St. Margaret, Canterbury, on 5 November 1598, but according to a statement of his widow and surviving relatives, the date of his birth was 30 March 1606. His father held the office of registrary of the court of Canterbury, under Sir Nathaniel Brent, commissary. After passing through the free school at Canterbury, he became clerk to his father, and Archbishop William Laud soon advanced him to be registrar of the ecclesiastical courts of the diocese. The archbishop demanded of him a yearly report on the conduct of the clergy in the diocese, but this Somner failed to supply. Somner devoted his leisure to studying law and antiquities, and shooting with the long bow. A royalist, after the execution of Charles I he wrote an elegy;The Insecuritie of Princes, considered in an occasional Meditation upon the King's late Sufferings and Death, London, 1648 (O.S). subsequently he published another such poem, to which was prefixed the portrait of Charles I, from the Eikon Basilike.The Frontispiece of the King's book opened with a Poem annexed, The Insecurity of Princes, &c.; He was imprisoned for some time in Deal Castle for endeavouring to obtain subscriptions to a petition for a free parliament in 1659. At the Restoration he was preferred to the mastership of St. John's Hospital in the suburbs of Canterbury, and he was appointed auditor of Christ Church, Canterbury, by the dean and chapter. He died on 30 March 1669, and was buried in the church of St. Margaret, Canterbury. He was three times married, and left several children. Somner acquired great reputation as an antiquary, and he numbered among his friends and correspondents Archbishops Laud and James Ussher, Robert Cotton, William Dugdale, Roger Dodsworth, Symonds D'Ewes, Edward Bysshe, Thomas Fuller, and Elias Ashmole. The Dictionarium Saxonico- Latino-Anglicum In 1657 John Spelman, at the suggestion of Archbishop Ussher, bestowed on Somner the annual stipend of the Anglo-Saxon lecture founded by his father, Sir Henry Spelman, at Cambridge. This enabled him to complete his principal work, the Dictionarium.Dictionarium Saxonico-Latino- Anglicum, voces, phrasesque praecipuas Anglo-Saxonicas . . . cum Latina et Anglica vocum interpretatione complectens . . . Aecesserunt Aelfrici Abbatis Grammatica Latino-Saxonica cum glossario suo ejusdem generis,' 2 pts, Oxford, 1659; 2nd edit, with additions by Thomas Benson, 1701. It shortly became a standard work in the teaching at the University of Oxford.David C. Douglas, English Scholars (1939), p. 66. Other works Somner's earliest work was The Antiquities of Canterbury; or a Survey of that ancient Citie, with the Suburbs and Cathedral, London, 1640, dedicated to Archbishop Laud (reissued 1662; 2nd edit, by Nicholas Batteley, London, 1703). At the suggestion of Meric Casaubon he acquired a knowledge of Anglo-Saxon, and then wrote Observations on the Laws of King Henry I, published by Roger Twysden in 1644, with a new glossary. He made collections for a history of Kent, but abandoned this undertaking; a portion of the work was published at Oxford in 1693 by the Rev. James Brome, under the title of A Treatise of the Roman Ports and Forts in Kent, with notes by Edmund Gibson, and a life of the author by White Kennett. Somner completed in 1647 a work on gavelkind.A Treatise of Gavelkind, both Name and Thing, published in London, 1660, 4to; 2nd edit. 1726, with the memoir by Kennett. He also made, but never published, an English translation of The Ancient Saxon Laws, which had been published in Latin by William Lambard in 1568. He composed, in reply to Jean Jacques Chifflet, a dissertation on Portus Iccius, the place where Julius Caesar embarked in his expeditions to Britain, and fixed it at Gessoriacum, now Boulogne-sur-Mer.This was first published in a Latin translation (Ad Chiffletii librum responsio) by Gibson in the latter's Julii Caesaris Portus Iccius Illustratus, Oxford, 1694. Somner also drew up Ad verba vetera Germanica à V. Cl. Justo Lipsio Epist. Cent. iii. ad Belgas Epist. XLIV collecta, Notae, published in the appendix to Meric Casaubon's 'De quatuor Linguis Commentatio,'1650. To the Historiae Anglicanae Scriptores Decem, edited in 1652 by Roger Twysden, he contributed a glossary of obscure and antiquated words. To William Dugdale and Roger Dodsworth's Monasticon Anglicanum he contributed materials relating to Canterbury and the religious houses in Kent, and he translated into Latin all the Anglo-Saxon documents, and many English records for the same work. His last antiquarian production was Chartham News; or a brief relation of some Strange Bones there lately digged up, in some grounds of Mr. John Somner's. This was edited by his brother John, London, 1680, and is reprinted at the end of the first part of the second edition of his Antiquities of Canterbury.Chartham News: Or a Brief Relation of Some Strange Bones There Lately Digged up, in Some Grounds of Mr John Somner's in Canterbury (January 1, 1700) p. 882. via JSTOR.

The survey also hosts events related to language revitalization and preservation. Origins The Survey was started as a pilot project by Berkeley linguistics professor Murray Emeneau and Mary Haas in 1953. It was established with an official budget on January 1, 1953. Haas was a particular influence on the early working culture of the Survey. One student, Brent D. Galloway, recalled how several of Haas' students had used a Natchez greeting, wanhetahnú·ʼis, and that \\"the tradition had apparently continued for over twenty years.\\" (Haas' first publication had been on Natchez.) The first project was a study of the Karuk language by William Bright, then a graduate student. Since its founding 80 doctoral dissertations have been written under the auspices of the Survey. Publications The Survey published a series of \\"Reports\\" beginning in 1981, covering a variety of topics related to languages of California as well as Native American languages elsewhere. Some volumes were standalone works such as dictionaries, others were collections of varied articles. Beginning in 1976 the Survey began publishing the proceedings of Hokan–Penutian Workshop, which addressed the proposed Hokan and Penutian language families. Both resources are available online. In 2011, a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities made it possible to merge online resources from the Survey of California and Other Indian Languages and the Berkeley Language Center (BLC) into a single website, the California Language Archive. Directors In addition to Haas, the Survey has been directed by Wallace Chafe and Leanne Hinton. The current director is Andrew Garrett.

Though she did not obtain any qualification, she became a teacher and later the principal of Cairns High School. She started a school in Bondi in 1910 initially for boys, but the school was later changed to girls. The school was advertised as being run along Royal Naval lines with a White Ensign being presented to the school in 1912 by the visiting HMS Drake.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb4817/is_1_91/ai_n29185757/pg_3/?tag=content;col1 During the First World War, Gibbins brother, Captain Norman Gibbins, was killed in action at Battle of Fromelles. She later moved her school to Epping, changing the name of her school from the Epping Ladies' College to Osborne Ladies' College, in honour of the Royal Naval College, Osborne, on the Isle of Wight. In 1923 Gibbins moved her school to its final location on near Blackhheath overlooking the Kanimbla and Megalong Valleys. The building was the former site of an unused hotel built in 1888. The average enrolment of the school was 50 students aged 7 to 16 years of age. Traditions The school uniform was in naval blue worn with Royal Navy buttons. Junior girls of the school were known as \\"Middies\\" from the term Midshipman, with prefects being addressed as Lieutenants, and the head girl being addressed as lieutenant commander.

An emphasis was placed on physical fitness, spartan living (only one room was heated at the school, the library), archery, shooting, sports, and dramatic arts. The school was closed in 1958 following the illness and death of Gibbins. The original building burned down in a fire in 1963.

R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. He is a Sindarin Elf of the Woodland Realm and one of the nine members of the Fellowship who set out to destroy the One Ring. He and the Dwarf Gimli are close friends. Commentators have noted that Legolas serves as a typical Elf in the story, demonstrating more-than-human abilities such as seeing further than anyone else in Rohan and sensing the memory of a long-lost Elvish civilisation in the stones of Hollin.  Fictional history  Legolas was the son of Thranduil, King of the Woodland Realm of Northern Mirkwood,The Fellowship of the Ring, book 2, ch. 2 \\"The Council of Elrond\\" who appeared as \\"the Elvenking\\" in The Hobbit.The Hobbit, ch. 8 \\"Flies and Spiders\\" Thranduil, one of the Sindar or \\"Grey Elves\\",Unfinished Tales, \\"The History of Galadriel and Celeborn\\", \\"Appendix B: The Sindarin Princes of the Silvan Elves\\" ruled over the Silvan Elves or \\"Wood-elves\\" of Mirkwood. Legolas is introduced at the Council of Elrond in Rivendell, where he came as a messenger from his father to discuss Gollum's escape from their guard. Legolas was chosen to be a member of the Fellowship of the Ring, charged with destroying the One Ring. He accompanied the other members in their travels from Rivendell to Amon Hen, serving as the company's archer.The Fellowship of the Ring, book 2, ch. 3 \\"The Ring Goes South\\" When the fellowship was trapped by a snowstorm while crossing the Misty Mountains, Legolas scouted ahead, running lightly over the snow, and told Aragorn and Boromir that the thick snow they were trying to push through was only a narrow wall. Back in the lowlands of Hollin, Legolas helped fend off an attack by Saruman's wargs. Gandalf then led the fellowship on a journey underground through Moria. In Moria, Legolas helped fight off Orcs and recognized \\"Durin's Bane\\" as a Balrog.The Fellowship of the Ring, book 2, ch. 5 \\"The Bridge of Khazad-dûm After Gandalf's fall, Aragorn led the Fellowship to the Elven realm of Lothlórien. Legolas spoke to the Elf-sentries there on behalf of the Fellowship.The Fellowship of the Ring, book 2, ch. 6 \\"Lothlórien\\" There was initially friction between Legolas and the Dwarf Gimli, because of the ancient quarrel between Elves and Dwarves, rekindled by Thranduil's treatment of Gimli's father. Legolas and Gimli became friends when Gimli greeted Galadriel respectfully. When the fellowship left Lothlórien, Galadriel gave the members gifts; Legolas received a longbow,The Fellowship of the Ring, book 2, ch. 8 \\"Farewell to Lórien\\" which he used to bring down a Nazgul's flying steed in the dark with one shot.The Fellowship of the Ring, book 2, ch. 9 \\"The Great River\\" After Boromir's death and the capture of Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took by orcs, Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli set out across Rohan in pursuit of the two captured hobbits.The Two Towers, book 3, ch. 1 \\"The Departure of Boromir\\" In the forest of Fangorn Legolas and his companions met Gandalf, resurrected as \\"Gandalf the White,\\" who delivered a message to Legolas from Galadriel. Legolas interpreted this as foretelling the end of his stay in Middle-earth: : \\"Legolas Greenleaf long under tree, : In joy thou hast lived, Beware of the Sea! : If thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore, : Thy heart shall then rest in the forest no more.\\"The Two Towers, book 3, ch. 5 \\"The White Rider\\" The three met with the Riders of Rohan, fought in the Battle of Helm's Deep, and witnessed Saruman's downfall at Isengard, where they were reunited with Merry and Pippin.The Two Towers, book 3, ch. 7 \\"Helm's Deep\\" Legolas and Gimli accompanied Aragorn and the Grey Company on the Paths of the Dead.The Return of the King, book 5, ch. 2 \\"The Passing of the Grey Company\\" After Aragorn summoned the Dead of Dunharrow to fight for him, Legolas saw them terrify the Corsairs of Umbar from their ships at Pelargir. Galadriel's prophecy was fulfilled: as Legolas heard the cries of seagulls, he experienced the Sea-longing — the desire to sail west to Valinor, the \\"Blessed Realm\\", latent among his people.The Return of the King, book 5, ch. 9 \\"The Last Debate\\" He fought in the Battle of the Pelennor FieldsThe Return of the King, book 5, ch. 6 \\"The Battle of the Pelennor Fields\\" and at the Black Gate,The Return of the King, book 5, ch. 10 \\"The Black Gate Opens\\" and watched as Sauron was defeated and Barad-dûr collapsed.The Return of the King, book 6, ch. 4 \\"The Field of Cormallen\\" After the destruction of the One Ring, Legolas remained in Minas Tirith for Aragorn's coronation and marriage to Arwen. Later, Legolas and Gimli travelled together through Fangorn forest and to the Glittering Caves of Aglarond, as Legolas had promised Gimli.The Return of the King, book 6, ch. 6 \\"Many Partings\\" Eventually Legolas brings south many Silvan Elves, and they dwelt in Ithilien, and it became once again the \\"fairest country in all the westlands.\\"The Return of the King, \\"Appendix A, Annals of the Kings and Rulers. They stayed in Ithilien for \\"a hundred years of Men.\\" After Aragorn dies, Legolas built a small ship and sailed West, reportedly taking Gimli with him.  Concept and creation  The name Legolas Greenleaf first appeared in the book \\"The Fall of Gondolin\\", one of the \\"Lost Tales\\", circa 1917. The character, who guides survivors of the sack of the city to safety, is mentioned only once.The Book of Lost Tales 2, The Fall of Gondolin The medievalists Stuart Lee and Elizabeth Solopova note that Legolas's lament over the stones of the Elvish land of Hollin: \\"Only I hear the stones lament them: deep they delved us, fair they wrought us, high they builded us; but they are gone,\\" recalls the Old English poem The Ruin. The Tolkien critic Paul Kocher writes of the same passage that it shows how Elves such as Legolas have senses keener than mortal Men: he can see further and can even hear the stones lamenting the passing of the Elves. In Kocher's view, Legolas is an \\"emissary for the Elves\\", as Gimli is for the dwarves; he suggests that the point Tolkien was making was that Legolas was a typical young elf. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey observes that Legolas, describing the great hall of Meduseld in the capital of Rohan, too far off for any but an Elf to make out clearly, speaks a line which is a direct translation of one from Beowulf: \\"The light of it shines far over the land\\", líxte se léoma ofer landa fela.The Two Towers, book 3, ch. 6 \\"The King of the Golden Hall\\"Beowulf, line 311  Adaptations  Legolas in Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated version of The Lord of the Rings Legolas was voiced by Anthony Daniels in Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated version of The Lord of the Rings. In the film, he takes Glorfindel's place in the \\"Flight to the Ford\\"; he meets Aragorn and the hobbits on their way to Rivendell and sets Frodo on his horse before Frodo is chased by the Nazgûl to the ford of Bruinen. Orlando Bloom as Legolas in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Legolas was voiced by David Collings in the 1981 BBC Radio 4 adaptation. In the 1993 Finnish miniseries Hobitit he was portrayed by Ville Virtanen. In Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movie trilogy (2001–2003), Legolas was portrayed by Orlando Bloom. He was presented as an unstoppable fighter, performing dramatic feats of battle. Bloom reprised his role as Legolas in Jackson's 2013 release The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. He displays Legolas's superhuman agility as an elf. He is attracted to the elf-woman Tauriel, a character created for the film trilogy. In a departure from the book, Legolas uses Thorin's Elven-forged sword Orcrist in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies to kill the chief goblin Bolg. In the West End musical, The Lord of the Rings: The Musical, Legolas was portrayed by Michael Rouse. Legolas appeared as a playable character in Lego Dimensions as an expansion character, bundled with an arrow launcher.

He created and developed two cable television networks: The A&E; Network and The History Channel. A&E; was formed in 1983 through the merger of ABC and Hearst's ARTS Network and NBC's Entertainment Channel, creating a partnership as unlikely as it has been successful. Career The son of Greek immigrants, Davatzes was born and raised in New York City, graduated from St. John's University and received an honorary Ph.D. from St. John's University. After 12 years with Xerox he was recruited to work for Gus Hauser at Warner Amex, which owned cable systems and programming services and where MTV and Nickelodeon were created. At Warner Amex Davatzes learned the basics of the cable business and helped develop some of the innovative cable systems that the company built in cities such as Dallas. He was given the experience of working with franchising, programming and building and running the interactive QUBE systems. He also touched on the activities of some of his colleagues such as Dick Aurelio and Larry Wangberg. In 1983 he was recruited to run a merger between two failed cable networks: the Entertainment Network, owned by RCA and the Rockefeller family and the ARTS Network, owned by Hearst and ABC. Out of the wreckage of these he built the A&E; Network, taking it to profitability in three years. Through the years he obtained distribution, product and establishing an identity for the new network with such hits as the Biography series, the Hornblower series, 100 Centre Street and A Nero Wolfe Mystery. In 1995 A&E; launched a second network, The History Channel, which also proved to be a quick success with viewers and advertisers. Davatzes was also involved in many of the legislative battles the cable industry fought in Washington over the years. Davatzes has been able to handle special issues attached to running a business owned by different partners for more than 17 years and has managed to keep all parties involved and satisfied. This has resulted in this team becoming the longest-running executive team in the television business. In recent years the cable company has also developed additional successful programming, including the Biography Channel, History Channel International and History Channel en Español. To most observers, Nick appears quiet and low-key, but he is passionate about his work and about social causes, especially education and job opportunities. He serves on the board of St. John's University, whose mission is to educate the children of the poor. Forty percent of students there, he says, are from homes with an income of less than $30,000 annually. \\"We need more institutions like that,\\" he believes. The History Channel has created a resource website for history teachers. Personal Nick grew up the son of Greek immigrants, on Eighth Avenue and 19th Street in New York's Chelsea district long before it was fashionable to live there. His apartment building had no central heating and had a bar on the first floor. He attended P.S. 11 Elementary School on 20th Street and Bryant High School in Astoria, Queens. Nick has been married for 38 years to his wife, Dorie. They have two sons – one a professor of structural geology at Temple University and the other a financial executive at GE Capital. The son of immigrants, a US Marine Corps veteran, whose father served in both the Greek and U.S. armies, Nick's success story personifies the values and opportunities that were unique to 20th century America. Davatzes is the recipient of the Marine Corps Historical Foundation Heritage Award for his support to the foundation. He received a National Humanities Medal from President George W. Bush and was admitted to the Phi Kappa Tau Hall of Fame in 2006. In October 2005, the Cable Center inducted Mr. Davatzes into the Cable Television Hall of Fame Class of 2005 honoring his significant contributions to the cable telecommunications industry.

He played his first match for St Kilda, against South Melbourne, on 7 May 1921 (round one). He played his last match for St Kilda, again against South Melbourne, on 5 August 1922 (round thirteen). In all he played 20 senior games for St Kilda (15 games in 1921, and 5 games in 1922).  VFA Football  = Prahran = On the basis that Kerley had been appointed to the position of captain-coach at Prahran Football Club, St Kilda granted him a clearance. He played well for Prahran in the first five games of the 1923 season; and then, for reasons that have never been revealed, Kerley and Prahran severed all connection with each other, and Thomas J. Bayliss assumed the coaching duties.Notes for Various Sources, The Sporting Globe, (Wednesday, 20 June 1923), p.9.Bayliss, Thomas, J., at VFA Project. = Port Melbourne = Granted a clearance from Prahran on 20 June 1923,Victorian Football Association, The Age, (Thursday, 21 June 1923), p.7. he transferred to Port Melbourne part-way through the 1923 season,They Say, The (Emerald Hill) Record, (Saturday, 23 June 1923), p.2. and played his first game for Port Melbourne, against Geelong Association, in round eight. He played in every match in the 1923 season, including the losing Grand Final against Footscray; and played twice in the 1924 season. He was captain of the Port Melbourne team on at least one occasion.Ports Comfortable Win, The (Emerald Hill) record, (Saturday, 11 August 1923), p.2. = Coburg = Kerley transferred to the Coburg at the beginning of the 1925 season. It was the club's first VFA season, having been admitted to the VFA competition (among other things, to keep an even number of teams and remove the problem of byes) following the move of Footscray, North Melbourne and Hawthorn to the VFL. Kerley was the team's captain in three successive premierships (1926, 1927, and 1928), and all in all he played 83 games for Coburg, mainly at centre half-forward, kicking 128 goals.Note that, in a number of (modern) references, Kerley is listed as having won the club's best and fairest awards in 1929 and 1930. However, on the basis of (i) his retirement at the end of the 1929 season, and (ii) that such awards were always given by the football clubs' annual meetings held in the February of the following year, one must conclude that, in fact, the claim is being made that he won the awards for his performance in the 1928 and 1929 seasons. Yet, a careful and thorough examination of all the available press reports of the Coburg Football Club annual meetings of 1926, 1927, 1928, 1929, and 1930, reveal no mention of any such award ever being made at all -- and, in fact, the only mention of Kerley in his time with Coburg is that, at the 1927 annual meeting, \\"a framed photograph group of the players was presented to H. Kerley (capt.)\\" (Coburg Club Meeting, The Age, (Tuesday, 15 February, 1927), p.13. He was appointed captain-coach for both the 1928 and 1929 seasons, but resigned the position on 16 July 1929, because \\"he considered that it interfered with his play\\".Coburg Coach Resigns, The Age, (Wednesday, 17 July 1929), p.16. \\"He said that he was not satisfied with the form the team had shown, and that, together with the fact that he had injured his hand at Brunswick (on 22 June}, had caused him to decide that it would be in the best interests of all concerned for him to drop out.K.

His resignation was accepted. Fred Chapman and Jim Jenkins were asked to supervise the team's training for the remainder of the 1929 season). Coburg, the 1926, 1927, and 1928 premiers, finished outside the final four in 1929 (in sixth position, with 14 wins from 22 matches).

He is the main antagonist of The Silmarillion, The Children of Húrin, and The Fall of Gondolin, and is mentioned briefly in The Lord of the Rings. Melkor was the most powerful of the Ainur, but turned to darkness and became Morgoth, the definitive antagonist of Arda from whom all evil in the world of Middle-earth ultimately stems. Sauron, one of the Maiar of Aulë, betrayed his kind and became Morgoth's principal lieutenant.  The name  Melkor was renamed \\"Morgoth\\" when he destroyed the Two Trees of Valinor, murdered Finwë, the High King of the Noldor Elves, and stole the Silmarils in the First Age.The Silmarillion, \\"Quenta Silmarillion\\", ch. 6 \\"Of Fëanor and the Unchaining of Melkor\\"The Silmarillion, \\"Quenta Silmarillion\\", ch. 9 \\"Of the Flight of the Noldor\\" The darker name was then bestowed by Finwë's son Fëanor, and the Elves called him thereafter by that name alone. The name Morgoth is Sindarin (one of Tolkien's invented languages) and means \\"Dark Enemy\\", \\"Black Foe\\", or \\"Black Foe of the World\\".Morgoth's Ring, pp. 194, 294 Bauglir is also Sindarin, meaning \\"Tyrant\\" or \\"Oppressor\\".The Lost Road and Other Writings, \\"The Etymologies\\" Fëanor actually named him in Quenya (another of Tolkien's languages), Moriñgotto or Moriñgotho, and this was later translated into Sindarin as Morgoth. \\"Morgoth Bauglir\\" is thus an epithet. His name in Ainulindalë (the creation myth of Middle-earth and first section of The Silmarillion) is Melkor, which means \\"He Who Arises In Might\\" in Quenya.The Silmarillion, Index entry for \\"Melkor\\" This too is an epithet since he, like all the Ainur, had another true name in Valarin (in the legendarium, the language of the Ainur before the beginning of Time), but this name was not recorded. The Sindarin equivalent of Melkor was Belegûr, but it was never used; instead a deliberately similar name Belegurth, meaning \\"Great Death\\", was employed.The History of Middle-earth, Vol. XII, The Peoples of Middle-earth. In earlier versions of Tolkien's legendarium the form of his name was Melko, simply meaning \\"Mighty One\\". Like Sauron, he had a host of other titles: Lord of the Dark, the Dark Power of the North and Great Enemy. The Edain called him the Dark King and the Dark Power; the Númenóreans corrupted by Sauron called him the Lord of All and the Giver of Freedom. He was called \\"Master of Lies\\" by Amlach of the House of Hador.The Silmarillion, ch. 17 \\"Of the Coming of Men into the West\\" http://www.dollypathak.com/ http://www.reenasexena.com/ http://www.escortsserviceinagra.com/ History =Ainulindalë= Before the creation of Eä and Arda (The Universe and the World), Melkor was the most powerful of the Ainur, the \\"angelic beings\\" created by Eru Ilúvatar (analogous to God). Melkor, dissatisfied that Eru had abandoned the Void, had sought to emulate his creator and fill the Void with sentient beings. This, however, required the Flame Imperishable, the Secret Fire, which belonged to Eru alone; though Melkor searched for this, he could not find it. In what he hoped would be an alternative expression of his own originality and creativity, he contended with Eru in the Music of the Ainur, introducing what he perceived to be themes of his own.The Silmarillion, \\"Ainulindalë\\" During the Great Music of the Ainur, Melkor attempted to alter the Music and introduced what he believed to be elements purely of his own design. As part of these efforts, he drew many weaker-willed Ainur to him, creating a counter to Eru's main theme. Ironically, these attempts did not truly subvert the Music, but only elaborated Eru's original intentions: the Music of Eru took on depth and beauty precisely because of the strife and sadness Melkor's disharmonies (and measures to rectify them) introduced. Unlike his fellow Ainu Aulë, Melkor was too proud to admit that his creations were simply discoveries made possible entirely by Eru. Instead, Melkor aspired to the level of Eru, the true creator of all possibilities. Since the Great Music of the Ainur stood as template for all of history and all of material creation in the Middle-earth cycle (it was first sung before Time, and then the universe was made in its image), the chaos introduced into the Music by Melkor's disharmonies was responsible for all evil in Arda, and everything in Middle-earth was tainted or \\"corrupted\\" by his influence. Tolkien elaborates on this in Morgoth's Ring, drawing an analogy between the One Ring, into which Sauron committed much of his power, and all of Arda—\\"Morgoth's Ring\\"—which contains and is corrupted by the residue of Melkor's power until the Remaking of the World (analogous to the Apocalypse).Morgoth's Ring, pp.398–401 =Quenta Silmarillion= After the Creation, many Ainur entered into Eä. The most powerful of them were called the Valar, or Powers of the World; the lesser, who acted as their followers and assistants, were the Maiar. They immediately set about the ordering of the universe and Arda within it, according to the themes of Eru as best they understood them. Melkor and his followers entered Eä as well, but he was frustrated that his colleagues would not recognize him as leader of the new realm, despite his having a greater share of knowledge and power than all the rest. In anger and shame, Melkor set about ruining and undoing whatever the others did. Each of the Valar was attracted to a particular aspect of the world that became the focus of his or her powers. Melkor was drawn to terrible extremes and violence—bitter cold, scorching heat, earthquakes, rendings, breakings, utter darkness, burning light, etc. His power was so great that at first the Valar were unable to restrain him; he single-handedly contended with the collective might of all of the Valar. Arda never seemed to achieve a stable form until the Vala Tulkas entered Eä and tipped the balance. Driven out by Tulkas, Melkor brooded in the darkness at the outer reaches of Arda until an opportune moment arrived, when Tulkas was distracted. Melkor re-entered Arda and attacked and destroyed the Two Lamps, which at the time were the only sources of light, along with the Valarian land of Almaren, which was wiped from existence. Arda was plunged into darkness and fire, and Melkor withdrew to his newly established dominion in Middle-earth. In the latter versions, Melkor also dispersed agents throughout Arda, digging deep into the earth and constructing great pits and fortresses, as Arda was marred by darkness and rivers of fire. After the fall of the Lamps, the Valar withdrew into the land of Aman in the far West. The country where they settled was called Valinor, which they heavily fortified. Melkor held dominion over Middle-earth from his fortress of Utumno in the North. In earlier versions, Melkor's first reign ended after the Elves, the eldest of the Children of Ilúvatar, awoke at the shores of Cuiviénen, and the Valar resolved to rescue them from his malice. The Valar waged devastating war on Melkor, and destroyed Utumno. Melkor was defeated by the Vala Tulkas, bound with a specially forged chain, Angainor, and brought to Valinor, where he was imprisoned in the Halls of Mandos for three ages. In the account published in The Silmarillion, Melkor had captured a number of Elves before the Valar attacked him, and he tortured and corrupted them, breeding the first Orcs.The Silmarillion, ch. 3 \\"Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor\\"Morgoth's Ring, pp. 72-73 Earlier and later versions of the story describe Orcs as corruptions of Men, or alternatively as soulless beings animated solely by the will of their evil lord. This last version illustrates the idea of Morgoth dispersing himself into the world he marred. His fortress Utumno dispersed deathly cold throughout Arda and brought on an endless winter in the north; for the sake of the Elves, the Valar waged a seven-year war with Melkor, defeating him after laying a grievous siege to Utumno. The battles fought there shaped and marred Arda even further, though Melkor was defeated by Tulkas and imprisoned by the Valar.Morgoth's Ring, pp. 416-21 Upon his release, Melkor was paroled to Valinor, though a few of the Valar mistrusted him. He made a pretence of humility and virtue, but secretly plotted harm toward the Elves, whose awakening he blamed for his defeat. The Noldor, most skilled of the three kindreds of Elves that had come to Valinor, were most vulnerable to his plots, since he had much knowledge they eagerly sought, and while instructing them he also awoke unrest and discontent among them. When the Valar became aware of this they sent Tulkas to arrest him, but Melkor had already fled. With the aid of Ungoliant, a dark spirit in the form of a monstrous spider, he destroyed the Two Trees of Valinor, slew the King of the Noldor, Finwë, and stole the three Silmarils, jewels made by Finwë's son Fëanor, which were filled with the light of the Trees. Fëanor thereupon named him Morgoth, \\"Black Foe of the World\\", and the Eldar knew him by this name alone afterwards. Morgoth resumed his rule in the North of Middle-earth, this time in Angband, a lesser fortress than Utumno, but not so completely destroyed. He rebuilt it, and raised above it the volcanic triple peak of Thangorodrim. The Silmarils he set into a crown of iron, which he wore at all times. Fëanor and most of the Noldor pursued him, along the way slaying their kin the Teleri and incurring the Doom of Mandos. On arriving in Beleriand, the region of Middle-earth nearest Angband, the Noldor established kingdoms and made war on Morgoth. Soon afterwards, the Sun and the Moon arose for the first time, and Men awoke if they had not done so already. The major battles of the ensuing war included the Dagor-nuin-Giliath (Battle Under the Stars, fought before the first rising of the Moon), Dagor Aglareb (Glorious Battle), Dagor Bragollach (Battle of Sudden Flame) at which the long-standing Siege of Angband was broken, and the battle of Nírnaeth Arnoediad (Unnumbered Tears) when the armies of the Noldor and the Men allied with them were routed and the men of the East joined Morgoth. Over the next several decades, Morgoth destroyed the remaining Elven kingdoms, reducing their domain to an island in the Bay of Balar to which many refugees fled, and a small settlement at the Mouths of Sirion under the protection of Ulmo. Before the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, the Man Beren and Elf Lúthien, the daughter of Thingol, entered Angband and recovered a Silmaril from Morgoth's crown after Luthien's singing sent him to sleep. It was inherited by their granddaughter Elwing, who joined those dwelling at the Mouths of Sirion. Her husband Eärendil, wearing the Silmaril on his brow, sailed across the sea to Valinor, where he pleaded with the Valar to liberate Middle-earth from Morgoth. During the ensuing War of Wrath, Beleriand and much of the north of Middle-earth was destroyed and reshaped. Morgoth summoned many Men to his side during the fifty-year conflict, which became the largest, longest, and bloodiest conflict ever fought in Arda's history. In the end, Morgoth was utterly defeated, and his armies were almost entirely slaughtered. The dragons were almost all destroyed, and Thangorodrim was shattered when Eärendil slew the greatest of dragons, Ancalagon the Black, who crashed upon it as he fell. The few remaining dragons were scattered, and the handful of surviving Balrogs hid themselves deep within the earth. Morgoth fled into the deepest pit and begged for pardon, but his feet were cut from under him, his crown was made into a collar, and he was chained once again with Angainor. The Valar exiled him permanently from the world, thrusting him through the Door of Night into the void, excluded from Arda until the prophesied Dagor Dagorath, when he would meet his final destruction. His evil remained, however, as \\"Arda Marred,\\" and his will influenced all living creatures. According to later texts, the Dagor Dagorath would be the apocalyptic final battle against Morgoth, prophesied by Mandos. According to this prophecy Morgoth would regain his power and find a way to break through the Door of Night. After passing through it into Arda he would resurrect all of his greatest servants and minions and rebuild his hosts, and in great wrath would wage war on Arda once more, destroying the Sun and the Moon. It would be either by Túrin Turambar or by Eönwë (as mentioned in the Hiding of Valinor) that Morgoth would be slain. According to Christopher Tolkien, the Dagor Dagorath concept as it was theorized was abandoned by Tolkien in his late essays. =Children of Húrin= In this more complete version of a story summarized in Quenta Silmarillion, Húrin and his younger brother Huor were leaders of the House of Hador, one of the three kindred of elf-friends. At Nírnaeth Arnoediad they covered the escape of Turgon to Gondolin by sacrificing their army and themselves. Huor was slain, but Húrin was brought before Morgoth alive. As revenge for his aid to Turgon and his defiance, Morgoth cursed Húrin and his children, binding Húrin to a seat upon Thangorodrim and forcing him to witness all that happened (using the long sight of Morgoth himself) to his children in the succeeding years. There is little additional information about Morgoth in this book, except in the encounter with Húrin, which is set out in more detail than in The Silmarillion and in a more connected narrative than in Unfinished Tales. It gives the first allusion to the corruption of Men by Morgoth soon after their awakening, and the assertion by Morgoth of his power over the entire Earth through \\"the shadow of my purpose\\". =The Cult of Melkor= After Morgoth's defeat, his lieutenant Sauron gradually rallied many of Morgoth's servants to his own cause, and during the Second Age established himself in the land of Mordor. Sauron lacked the raw power and malice of his master, but he seduced many to his allegiance with lies and false promises. In the Second Age, Sauron repeatedly used his fame among Men as Morgoth's erstwhile lieutenant to portray himself as Morgoth's representative and thus gain the allegiance of his former master's worshippers. Similarly, in Númenor following his capture, Sauron became very powerful by seducing Ar-Pharazôn to the worship of Melkor, establishing a Cult in which it was only natural that, as Melkor's foremost former disciple, he became high priest.Morgoth's Ring, p. 398 This cult exploited the Númenórean fear of death by claiming that human sacrifice to Melkor would grant the Men of Númenor immortality. In actuality, by turning away from Eru and the Valar they only dwindled more rapidly. Sauron used this religion among his means of encouraging Ar-Pharazôn's invasion of Valinor, which resulted in the destruction of Númenor by Eru. By the Third Age, Sauron came more often to propound himself, rather than Morgoth, as the object of worship for his servants and subjects, but in his pride, also portrayed himself as Morgoth returned when it was more convenient for him to do so.Letters, #183 notes on W. H. Auden's review of The Return of the King, footnote \\"†By a triple treachery\\" Appearance and characteristics The Ainu Melkor could initially take any shape, but his first recorded form was \\"...as a mountain that wades in the sea and has its head above the clouds and is clad in ice and crowned with smoke and fire; and the light of the eyes of Melkor was like a flame that withers with heat and pierces with a deadly cold\\". At the time he destroyed the Two Trees and stole the Silmarils, he took to himself the shape of a great \\"Dark Lord, tall and terrible\\". The diminution of his power in this time and his own desire for lordship destroyed his ability to freely change shape, and he became bound to this one terrible form. His hands were burned by the theft of the Silmarils, from which they never healed, and he carried evermore the burden of burning pain. In his fight with High King Fingolfin, he suffered several wounds; his foot was hewn by Fingolfin's Sword of Ice Crystal, Ringil. At the end of this battle, Thorondor, the great Eagle, swooped down and scarred Morgoth's face with his talons, a wound that also never healed. In battle, he wore black armour and wielded Grond, the Hammer of the Underworld. The great battering ram of Mordor was named for this weapon. He also wielded a black spear, and in early texts, a poison sword. Melkor's powers were originally immense, greater than those of any other single Ainu. He shared a part of the powers of every other Vala, but unlike them used it for domination of the whole of Arda. To accomplish this Morgoth dispersed his being throughout Arda, tainting its very fabric, and only Aman was free of it. His person thus became ever more diminished and restricted. Pity was beyond Morgoth's understanding, as was courage. As he alone of the Valar bound himself to a physical (and therefore vulnerable) body, he alone of the Valar knew fear. Followers Because Morgoth was the most powerful being in Arda, many \\"flocked to his banner\\". Morgoth's chief servants were Maiar he corrupted or monsters he created: Sauron, later the Dark Lord of Mordor and his chief servant; the Balrogs, including Gothmog, the Lord of Balrogs and High-Captain of Angband; Glaurung, the Father of Dragons; Ancalagon \\"the Black\\", greatest of the Winged Dragons; Carcharoth, the mightiest wolf that ever lived; Draugluin, Sire of Werewolves; and Thuringwethil, Sauron's vampire messenger. Ungoliant, a demon in spider form, helped Melkor destroy the Two Trees. This alliance was temporary, however; when Melkor refused to yield the Silmarils to Ungoliant, she attacked him. He had spread his power and malice too thin, and had weakened himself too much to fight back; he escaped only through the arrival of the Balrogs. When the race of Men awoke, Morgoth (or his servant, depending on the text consulted) temporarily left Angband to live among them. Some men worshipped him, banning Ilúvatar from their hearts. Morgoth was known to betray his own servants. After the Noldor were defeated, he confined all Men in his service to the lands of Hithlum, their only prize the pillage of that land, though they had fought to win richer lands in Beleriand.The Silmarillion, ch. 20 \\"Of the Fifth Battle: Nirnaeth Arnoediad\\" Since he could never fully dominate Men, he could never really trust them, and therefore feared them. Character development and history In the early versions of Tolkien's stories, Melkor/Morgoth was not seen as the most powerful Ainu. He is described as being equal in power to Manwë, chief of the Valar in Arda.Valaquenta, \\"Of the Enemies\\" But his power increased in later revisions of the story until he became the most powerful Ainu,The Silmarillion, Ainulindalë and in a late essay more powerful than all of the Valar combined. He developed from a standout among equals into a being so powerful that the other created beings could not utterly defeat him.Morgoth's Ring, pp. 390-393 http://www.dollypathak.com/]dollypathak.com Over time, Tolkien altered both the conception of this fallen Ainu and his name. The name given by Fëanor (Morgoth) was present from the first stories. He was for a long time also called Melko. Tolkien vacillated over the Sindarin equivalent of this, which appeared as Belcha, Melegor, and Moeleg. The meaning of the name also varied, related in different times to milka (\\"greedy\\") or velka (\\"flame\\").The Lost Road and Other Writings, The Etymologies, root MIL-IK-The Book of Lost Tales, p. 260 Similarly the Old English translations devised by Tolkien differ in sense: Melko is rendered as Orgel (\\"Pride\\") and Morgoth as Sweart-ós (\\"Black God\\").The Shaping of Middle-earth, pp. 281-283 Morgoth is once given a particular sphere of interest: in the early Tale of Turambar Tinwelint (precursor of Thingol) names him \\"the Vala of Iron\\".The Book of Lost Tales 2, \\"Turambar and the Foalókë\\", p. 73 Much of the text published in The Silmarillion was drawn from earlier, more completely written, drafts of the mythology—and thus reflects the older conception of Morgoth's power; there is less discussion of his marring all of Arda by diluting himself throughout it. In other sections, such as the 1950s draft used for Ainulindalë, the implication of his pervasive power remains clear. While not included in the published Silmarillion, other versions of the mythology hold that Melkor will escape the guardianship of Eärendil and return at the end of time. In the final battle, Melkor will be slain by either Túrin Turambar with his famous black sword or by Eönwë as mentioned in the Hiding of Valinor. \\"Morgoth\\" In late writings a distinction is made between the Ainu Melkor, the most powerful of Eru's created beings, and Morgoth, the diminished being that styled itself Dark Lord of Arda. This distinction is not limited to the change in name (\\"Arises in Might\\" to \\"Dark Enemy\\"). As described in the Ainulindalë, Melkor's discord marred the Music of the Ainur in Heaven. Melkor's thematic variations in that Music amounted to his own self-elaboration. (Each Ainu arose from a divine theme, existing beforehand only in the mind of Eru.) Eä, or the World that Is, is shaped after the Music. Thus, the evil that Melkor weaves into the Music was mirrored in Eä by the evil he wove into the fabric of reality. As a result, the world Arda was \\"Marred\\": the conceptions of the Valar never came about, and Melkor's very essence was present in all creation. Melkor's inability to perform true creation is tied to the idea that something of his actual being must pass into the things he \\"created\\", in order to give them an effective substance and reality. Melkor could not create anything, as he did not possess the Flame Imperishable; thus he could only create a mockery of those things in Arda. From his Trolls to the Sun (which was made from the fruit of a Tree poisoned by Ungoliant, and was thus itself imperfect), Melkor's power and essence was poured into Arda. Melkor's individual self was diminished as a consequence. He was reduced to Morgoth, the \\"Dark Enemy\\" (poetically elaborated as \\"The Black Foe of the World\\").Morgoth's Ring, \\"Myths Transformed\\" Morgoth, once the most powerful being in Eä, spent his will on his vast armies and followers, so that in the War of Wrath, as his armies were swept away before the host of Aman, he was captured by Eönwë and cast off his throne. Morgoth's spirit was cast out beyond the Walls of Night, yet his presence remains as the pervasive corruption of the world, \\"even until the End of Days\\". Interpretation Melkor has been interpreted as being analogous to Satan. Like Lucifer, he rebels against his creator. Also, just as in Christian tradition Satan leads humanity to become slaves of sin, Melkor creates an \\"iron hell\\" for his elven slave labourers. His greed for ever more power and his fondness for technology make him a symbol for the despotism of modern machinery. On the other hand, it has been observed that Melkor's rebellion against Eru is creative in itself, as Melkor is impatient for the void of the world to be filled with things. But his creativity becomes destructive because it had always been tainted with pride. \\"His desire to create other beings for his glory\\" turns into a desire for servants and slaves to follow his own will. This \\"temptation of creativity\\" is later echoed in Tolkien's work by Melkor's opponent Fëanor, who loves the Silmarils he created so much that he leads his entire people to a hopeless war when Melkor steals them. John R. Holmes, writing in the J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia, suggests that Melkor's nature resonates with John Milton's fallen angel in Paradise Lost.

Adolphe Danziger De Castro, also known as Gustav Adolf Danziger, Adolph Danziger, Adolphe Danziger and Adolphe De Castro, (November 6, 1859 – March 4, 1959) was a Jewish scholar, journalist, lawyer and author of poems, novels and short stories. Life Adolphe Danziger De Castro was born Abram Dancygier, the son of Symcha Jakub Dancygier and Chaja Szarka, near Dobrzyń nad Wisłą, Congress Poland. He claimed that the ancestor of the family Dancygier was a Portuguese Jew named Israel De Castro who migrated from Portugal to the Netherlands in the 16th century and whose descendants settled in Danzig, whence the surname Danziger originated. Danziger De Castro also claimed that he had received the rabbinical ordination by Rabbi Israel Jehoszua Trunk called 'R. Shiele Kutner' (1820–1893) around 1877 and had obtained a Ph.D. in oriental philology at the university of Bonn in 1882. In 1883 he emigrated to the U.S.A., where he first lived as a journalist and teacher in St. Louis and Vincennes (IN), before settling in San Francisco in November 1884, where he practiced as a dentist and free-lance journalist until 1900. In 1900 he moved to New York City to get a book published, abandoning his first wife and the children. In 1903-04 he served as vice-consul of the United States in Madrid. Since that time he worked as an attorney at law. In 1904-05 he lived in Aberdeen, Scotland, between 1905 and 1921 in California. On February 1, 1920, he was one of the thirty-nine founders of the Sephardic Community of Los Angeles (La Comunidad Sefardi) and was elected the first president of the congregation. Between 1921 and 1926 he spent some time in Mexico, between 1927 and 1936 he lived in New York City, since 1936 in Los Angeles. He was first married in to Bertha M. Levy (b. 1867) and had the children Beatrice Danziger (1891–1974, married to William K. Dolan) and Nathan Danziger (1894–1965), who changed his name to Nathaniel Dolan. He got married a second time - without having been divorced from his first wife - in 1907 to Georgina Sterling McClellan (1880–1935) and, after his second wife's death, a third time to Maria Paez Urquidi. Adolphe Danziger De Castro died at almost 100 years in Los Angeles, California on March 4, 1959. Works Danziger translated the story \\"Der Mönch von Berchtesgaden\\" (The Monk of Berchtesgaden), by German author Richard Voß, published in a German monthly magazine in 1891, into English and contracted Ambrose Bierce, who supported Danziger's literary ambitions between 1886 and 1894, to edit the story. It was published as \\"The Monk and the Hangman’s Daughter\\" first in serial form in a San Francisco newspaper in 1891 and republished in book form in 1892. In 1903, he wrote the academic book Jewish Forerunners of Christianity on the Jewish Patriarchs of the 2nd Temple Period from Hillel through Jesus Christ until Rabbi Juda the Prince, the compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud. H. P. Lovecraft, with whom Danziger De Castro corresponded between 1927 and 1936, revised two of his early short stories in the late 1920s; they were published in Weird Tales.Lovecraft judged Danziger De Castro: \\"Old Dolph is a portly, sentimental, & gesticulating person given to egotistical rambling about old times & the great men he has intimately known. … he entertained everybody with his loquacious egotism & pompous reminiscences of intimacies with the great. … [He] regaled us with tedious anecdotes of how he secured the election of Roosevelt, Taft, & Harding as Presidents.

Two production aircraft were completed in the late 1940s. Development In the 1930s, designer Ernest Oscar Tips of Fairey Aviation's Belgian subsidiary, Avions Fairey produced a series of light aircraft named after him, starting with the Tipsy S. These aircraft were not built by Fairey Aviation. The last to emerge before the Occupation of Belgium in 1940 was the Tipsy M ab initio trainer. Post war, the parent company decided, uniquely to produce this aircraft, calling it the Fairey Primer. Only one Tipsy M had been produced in Belgium and this became the Primer prototype. The Primer was a conventional single-engined, low-winged monoplane, constructed of welded metal tubes with wood in subsidiary structures like ribs and stringers, all fabric covered. The wings were quite symmetrically tapered and carried manually operated flaps across the centre section. Mild dihedral began outside the centre section. Each mainwheel, equipped with brakes was mounted on a single leg fixed at the end of the centre section. On the prototype the wheels were spatted, but these were removed on production aircraft. There was a small tailwheel below the fin. The rudder was horn balanced and the starboard elevator carried a trim tab. The enclosed tandem dual control cockpits merged into a raised decking behind them, giving the aircraft a smooth but slightly humped look. Both cockpits were over the wing. The engines used by Primers, the 145 hp (108 kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major 10 and the 155 hp (116 kW) Blackburn Cirrus Major 3 were inverted in-line engines and ran in similar cowlings. Operational history The Tipsy M, registered OO-POM and Gipsy powered, first flew at Avions Fairey's works at Gosselies about 1938 and it visited the parent company's works in England in June 1939. The Gosselies factory was destroyed by bombing on 5 May 1940 and at about that time all drawings and jigs for the aircraft were destroyed, deliberately or not. Before the German invasion in May 1940 the machine was taken apart and shipped to England, probably in September or October 1939; certainly it flew from Fairey Aviation's Great West Aerodrome (the site now covered by London Heathrow Airport) for five months after November 1940. It was then used as a company hack until September 1941, when it was put into store. Shortly after the war OO-POM went back to Belgium for small modifications at Fairey's suggestion; they then took over the Tipsy M with the aim of producing it under licence. Early in 1948, it was flying from White Waltham, still bearing its Belgian registration. The following year it received a UK registration (G-AKSX), but seems only to have flown with the experimental number G-6-1. It spent a period of assessment with service pilots at the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment, Boscombe Down. When returned from Boscombe Down, the Primer prototype had to be stripped down in order to recreate the lost drawings and jigs. The engine and some other parts were used to build the first production aircraft, though the CAA records G-AKSX as being sold abroad in Aug 1948; whether in flying condition or not is not noted. Fairey had intended to produce a run of ten, but only built two. The first of these, G-ALBL, gained its certificate of airworthiness in October 1948. Initially it had the Gipsy engine but this was later replaced by the Cirrus. It was dismantled in 1949; the CAA records it as destroyed in 1953. The second production aircraft, G-ALEW used this powerplant from the start, and was assessed against the de Havilland Chipmunk at Boscombe Down. The last of the line, it was dismantled in 1951.

The Library is based on the collection of Roja Muthiah, who accumulated one of the world's finest private libraries of Tamil publications. Roja Muthiah and RMRL Roja Muthiah Research Library (RMRL) is a resource and research hub for south Indian studies covering diverse fields from humanities, social sciences to popular culture. The RMRL holds a unique collection and is widely recognized as a model library in India. With beginnings as a small private collection by Roja Muthiah, the library now holds an impressive 3,00,000 items and aims at continually preserving and expanding the historic archive. The RMRL is what it is today thanks to the pioneering efforts of Roja Muthiah Chettiar from Kottaiyur. Muthiah began his career as a sign-board artist and soon became enthralled by antiquarian books. and started collecting classical Tamil literature in 1950. At the time of his death in 1992, the collection comprised nearly 1,00,000 items in Tamil which included books,periodicals and several other literary gems. Understanding the significance of the library and the need to preserve its valuable contents the University of Chicago bought the entire collection in 1994. However, with the library being deeply rooted in south Indian culture and tradition, it was decided that the collection would remain in Tamil Nadu to form the nucleus of a research library. RMRL Trust now maintains this rare private collection of Tamil imprints in collaboration with the University of Chicago.  Collections  The vast collection in RMRL is a direct reflection of Tamil print heritage and culture, spanning a period of over 200 years, the earliest title being a book, 'Kantarantati' published in 1804. The spectrum of subjects covers language and literature, indigenous medicine, religion, folklore, popular culture, metaphysics, Gandhian studies, women's studies and modern history. It also holds material such as oleographs, theater handbills, wedding invitations and private letters. It is this unique eclectic range that sets RMRL apart from other libraries and archives. Considering that Tamil is accorded the status of a classical language and that over sixty million people worldwide speak Tamil, the RMRL presents itself as a significant institution in the world of research and scholarship. In a bid to augment its already unique collection, the RMRL recently acquired gramophone records from the 1920 and 1930 from private collectors which supplement the existing gramophone song books available at the library. The collection has received and continues to receive generous donations from private collections, growing by almost 50 percent in the last decade.  Human Resources  The RMRL's collection, sought after by scholars in India and elsewhere around the world, is not its sole strength. The library's staff is world class, having been trained in premier institutions around the world and having adopted the latest in library techniques that its resources allow.  Indus Research Centre  The Roja Muthiah Research Library Trust (RMRLT), Chennai, established the Indus Research Centre (IRC) in January 2007 for undertaking scientific investigations into various aspects of the Indus or Harappan Civilisation, especially the Indus Scripts, which still remains undeciphered. Dr. Iravatham Mahadevan, a well known researcher in the Indus Scripts, is the Honorary Consultant to the Centre, which is open to all bona fide scholars who wish to undertake research in this field. The Indus Civilization flourished in the Bronze Age, approximately between 3100 - 1700 BCE. The civilization is famous for its large, well-planned urban complexes like Mohenjodara and Harappa (now in Pakistan), and Lothal, Kalibangan, Dholavira and hundreds of other large and small settlements in India, spread over a very large area extending up to Daimabad in the Godavari Valley in Deccan. The discoveries of Neolithic artifacts in South India bearing Indus Script-like characters has kindled the interest of south India and Tamil scholars who are especially interested in exploring the possibilities of deciphering the Indus Script, which would reveal the linguistic and cultural affinities of the Harappan people. IRC is intended as a forum for scientific investigations without any ideological bias. The collections at IRC include computerized data and files and card catalogues gifted by Iravatham Mahadevan, collection of Dr.Gift Siromoney on this subject donated by his wife Dr.Rani Siromoney, and other books, monographs and research papers collected from various sources in India and abroad. IRC is in the process of building an exhaustive specialized library covering the Indus Civilization in general, and the Indus Script, in particular.

In racial anthropology, the type was traditionally held to be most common among the populations native to Central Asia. The name is taken from the phylum of Turanian languages, which are the combination of the Uralic and Altaic families, hence also referred to as the term Ural–Altaic race.The Races of Europe by Carleton S. Coon The latter usage implies the existence of a Turanid racial type or \\"minor race\\", subtype of the Caucasoid race with some Mongoloid admixtures, situated at the boundary of the distribution of the Mongoloid and Caucasoid \\"great races\\".Racial and cultural minorities: an analysis of prejudice and discrimination, Environment, development, and public policy, George Eaton Simpson, John Milton Yinger, Springer, 1985, , p.32.American anthropologist, American Anthropological Association, Anthropological Society of Washington (Washington, D.C,), 1984 v. 86, nos. 3-4, p. 741. The idea of a Turanid race came to play a role of some significance in Pan-Turkism or \\"Turanism\\" in the late 19th to 20th century. A \\"Turkish race\\" was proposed as a Caucasoid subtype in European literature of the period. This literature was absorbed by the Ottoman elite, and was partly even translated into Ottoman Turkish, contributing to the idea of an essence of \\"Turkishness\\" (Türklük) the honour of which came to be protected under Turkish law until the revision of article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code in April 2008. The most influential of these sources were Histoire Générale des Huns, des Turcs, des Mongoles, et autres Tartares Occidenteaux (1756–1758) by Joseph de Guignes (1721–1800), and Sketches of Central Asia (1867) by Ármin Vámbéry (1832–1913), which was on the common origins of Turkic groups as belonging to one race, but subdivided according to physical traits and customs, and l’histoire de l’Asie (1896) by Leon Cahun (1841–1900), which stressed the role of Turks in \\"carrying civilization to Europe\\", as a part of the greater \\"Turanid race\\" that included the Uralic and Altaic speaking peoples more generally.Gülden z Kibris, Creating Turkishness: An Examination of Turkish Nationalism through Gök-Börü, Sabanci University (2005) There was also an ideology of Hungarian Turanism most lively in the second half of the 19th century and in the first half of the 20th century.

Crossley is the director of the Anne McDonald Centre near Melbourne, Victoria, which promotes the use of facilitated communication. The 1984 film Annie's Coming Out was made about her work with a facilitated communication patient named Anne McDonald. Many of her claims in legal cases and the media that certain nonverbal individuals can communicate through FC have been challenged and disproven. Advocacy controversies The Anne McDonald Centre, a centre for FC use in Melbourne directed by Crossley. In 1975, Crossley was working at St. Nicholas Hospital, Carlton, Victoria, which was run by the Mental Health Authority and housed children with intellectual disabilities. Concerned that the hospital schedule accommodated inflexible staffing arrangements, rather than the needs of the children, Crossley made a submission to a Victorian committee on mental retardation. She also raised questions with the Mental Health Authority about some of the children in the hospital, claiming that although they had severe physical disabilities, they were not intellectually disabled. Crossley is a controversial figure in the field of autism and disabilities. She has been praised by some; she received membership in the Order of Australia in 1986. However, many experienced speech therapy professionals said that Crossley was manipulating the hands of her clients, and the thoughts that were written were those of Crossley herself. Crossley established the DEAL (Dignity, Education, Advocacy, Language) Communication Centre,DEAL (Dignity, Education, Advocacy, Language) Communication Centre www.deal.org.au which was later renamed the Anne McDonald Centre. Douglas Biklen of Syracuse University, Division of Special Education and Rehabilitation, visited her in Australia, and went on to popularise facilitated communication in the US. In 2012, journalist Andrew Rule published two articles in the Melbourne Herald Sun about Crossley, under the titles 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'True Crime'. The latter claimed that Crossley falsely claimed facilitated communication was effective for McDonald, as McDonald did not have the capability to advocate for herself. The newspaper later published clarifications that they did not intend to convey the meaning that Crossley deliberately misled people, nor that she was a criminal. They removed both articles from the newspaper's website. Crossley claimed in the 1993 Frontline documentary \\"Prisoners of Silence\\" that a comatose man that she was working with could pick his own housing arrangement, but Frontline disproved this claim using digital overlays. Crossley has defended professor Anna Stubblefield against charges that she sexually assaulted a man with severe cerebral palsy, identified as D.J., by claiming that he could answer yes/no questions independently. Mark Sherry, a professor of sociology, claimed that Stubblefield manufactured D.J.'s communications. =Court Cases= Crossley was involved in multiple court cases concerning false abuse allegations made through facilitated communication. One involved the termination of an employee, and the other one involved forced removal of an intellectually disabled woman named Gina from her home. One of the clients consented to a hysterectomy through facilitated communication. She had attempted to go on trips with Leonie McFarlane, another individual who has cerebral palsy and is nonverbal, to a conference about disability in another state, but her application to the Supreme Court was not successful. McFarlane's parents opposed the request because they claimed that she could not communicate independently. Crossley had previously been banned from seeing McFarlane in 1980 at St Nicholas Hospital, but after the closure of the hospital, McFarlane had often gone on outings with Crossley and McDonald. Crossley also attempted to also give a woman named Angela Wallace the legal right to leave the institution she was at by using facilitated communication. However, based on an investigation by Dr. Peter Eisen, it was determined that Wallace would not have the ability to give consent. Additionally, it was found that Crossley helped create a false accusation of sexual assault through \\"Carla\\", who was purported to have claimed through FC that her father was abusing her. Authorship controversy Crossley is a co- author of Annie's Coming Out,Annie's Coming Out www.amazon.co.uk a story about a girl named Anne McDonald who Crossley claimed had learned to communicate through facilitated communication. McDonald's story went on to be made into a film titled Annie's Coming Out (also called A Test Of Love) in 1984 starring Angela Punch McGregor and directed by Gil Brealey. The screenplay for the film was written by Crossley's partner, Chris Borthwick, with both Crossley and McDonald credited as contributing writers. The film won Australian Film Institute (AFI) awards for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Adapted Screenplay. McDonald was born on 11 January 1961 in Seymour, Victoria. As a result of a birth injury, she developed severe athetoid cerebral palsy. Because she could not walk, talk or feed herself, she was diagnosed as having severe intellectual disability. At the age of three, she was placed by her parents in St. Nicholas Hospital, Melbourne, a Health Commission (government) institution for children with severe disabilities, and she lived there without education or therapy for eleven years. During McDonald's time in the hospital she was neglected and starved, and in a later court case the Health Commission conceded that at age 16 she weighed only 12 kilograms. In 1977, when McDonald was 16, Crossley reported that she was able to communicate with her by supporting her upper arm while she selected word blocks and magnetic letters. Crossley continued using similar strategies with McDonald and other individuals with disabilities, developing what has become known as facilitated communication training. Through Crossley, McDonald appeared to seek discharge from St. Nicholas. Her parents and the hospital authorities denied her request on the grounds that the reality of her communication had not been established. In 1979, when McDonald turned eighteen, a habeas corpus action in the Supreme Court of Victoria was commenced against the Health Commission in order to win the right to leave the institution. The court accepted that McDonald's communication was her own and allowed her to leave the hospital and live with Crossley. After leaving the institution, McDonald got a Higher School Certificate (University entrance) qualification from a night school and went on to receive a humanities degree from Deakin University in 1993. On the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, 3 December 2008, McDonald received the Personal Achievement Award in the Australian National Disability Awards. McDonald died of a heart attack on 22 October 2010. She received a posthumous award from the Australian Group on Severe Communication Impairment (AGOSCI). Annie's Coming Out depicts Crossley account of developing facilitated communication. Widespread controversy has continued to accompany its use in the autistic population,Biklen, Douglas. (2005). \\"Autism and the Myth of the Person Alone\\". New York, New York: University Press. with a number of peer reviewed scientific studies have concluded that the language output attributed to the clients is directed or systematically determined by the therapists who provide facilitated assistance.http://www.theeway.com/skepticc/archives15.html#results FACILITATED COMMUNICATION: MENTAL MIRACLE OR SLEIGHT OF HAND? (1994) By Gina Green, Ph.D. Some have questioned whether McDonald was actually communicating through Crossley.

Traditionally, Indian and East Asian architecture have been the most significant forms of foreign influence on Sri Lankan architecture and both have played a significant role in shaping it.The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume V: Historiography, pg 248 Architectural influences from Southeast Asia have also influenced the development of Sri Lankan architecture and vice versa.

Ancient architecture A Royal Palace in Polonnaruwa =Cave temples= 200px The earliest evidence of cave temples are found in the temple complexes of Mihintale.http://www.lonelyplanet.com/sri-lanka/the- ancient-cities/mihintale/introduction A unique feature in these caves was the use of a drip ledge carved along the top edge of the rock ceiling which stopped rainwater running into the cave. With time, doors, windows and walls of brick or stone were added. The roof and walls were plastered white and finished with decorative paintings, these are evident in the cave temples of Dambulla. Chipped material of the rock packed underneath the clay finished floor. Cave complexes of Dambulla and Situlpahuwa contained 80 caves each, The Kaludiya Pokuna, Mihintale cave temple is constructed with brick walls, granite window openings, and ceilings. The Gal vihara, Polonnaruwa and the cave temples of Dambulla were initially constructed as cave temples, later on, the cave temples were converted to image houses. =Dagobas or Stupas= Ruwanweli Saya Stupa in Anuradhapura The Kuttam Pokuna in Anuradhapura The dagobas or stupas are distinctive for many reasons. They are probably the largest brick structures known to the pre-modern world. Demala Maha Seya, which was never completed, had a circumference of . Jetavanaramaya is the largest stupa constructed in any part of the world. It is over 120 metres in height and has a diameter of . The foundations are deep. It needed bricks that could bear the load of 368 pounds. Jetavanarama was the third tallest building in the ancient world. Abhayagiri Dagaba (370 ft) ranked fifth and Ruwanwelisaya (300 ft) came seventh (the first, fourth and sixth places were held by the Pyramids of Giza). The structure The construction of a dagoba was considered an act of great merit. Dagobas were built to enshrine relics. They were constructed according to strict specifications. Entrances to stupas were laid out so that their centre lines pointed to the relic chambers. There was only one relic chamber initially, but a number of additional relic chambers were introduced when the stupas were rebuilt. The dagoba is admired today for its structural perfection and stability. Engineers who examined Jetavanaramaya in the 1980s said that its shape was ideal for the materials used. Stupas such as Jetavanarama, Abhayagiri, Ruvanveli and Mirisaveti Stupa were initially in the shape of a paddy heap. Other shapes such as the bubble, pot and bell developed later. It is suggested that the stupa at Nadigamvila digamvila was in the shape of an onion. An ornamented vahalkada was added to the stupa around the second century; the earliest is at Chaitya. The four vahalkadas face the cardinal points. They are ornamented with figures of animals, flowers, swans and dwarfs. The pillars on either side of the vahalkada carry figures of lions, elephants, horses or bulls, depending on the direction of the structure. Construction The bricks were bonded together using a clay slurry, called butter clay or navanita mattika. This was composed of finely crushed dolomite limestone mixed with sieved sand and clay. The stupa was thereafter covered with a coating of lime plaster. This was sometimes ten inches thick. There was a range of plasters, using different combinations of materials. The items used included lime, clay, sand, pebbles, crushed seashells, sugar syrup, white of egg, coconut water, plant resin, drying oil, glues and possibly even the saliva of white ants. Some of these items are mentioned in the Mahavamsa. The fine plaster at Kiri Vehera (2nd century) used small pebbles. Crushed seashells mixed with lime and sand were used in the stupas of the fifth to twelfth centuries. Expensive plasters were used sparingly, for specific purposes such as waterproofing. Stupas in other countries have been struck by lightning, but not in Sri Lanka. Mahavamsa speaks of lightning protection for the stupa. The conical metal cap and its vajra at the top of the dagoba were supposed to have earthing properties. The Mahavamsa also refers to laying a sheet of copper over the foundation and applying arsenic dissolved in sesamum oil on this sheet. This would have kept out white ants and helped prevent plant life growing inside the stupa. Colonial Period Dutch ramparts of the Galle fort The Neo-baroque style Old Parliament Building, which is now the Presidential Secretariat With the arrival of Western colonists to Sri Lanka, they established their own forms of architecture to the island. This is evident in the architecture of the period as well as in forms on influence in modern architecture. Very few buildings of the Portuguese era survives, but many building from the Dutch era could be found on the coastal parts of the island. For example, the old town of Galle and its fortifications built by the Dutch in the year 1663 make up a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Historic buildings, such as old churches, can be found in many Sri Lankan cities and towns. Many British-era buildings can be found at Colombo Fort and various other parts of Colombo. Many important historic buildings were built by the colonial governments. These were often built in a European architectural style that was in fashion at the time, such as the Palladian, Renaissance Classicism, or Neo-classical styles. Post Independence Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre by Kahawita De Silva & Associates Geoffrey Bawa's design for the University of Ruhuna campus In the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, architects like Geoffrey Bawa and Minnette de Silva were leading trends in what is today known globally as ‘Tropical Modernism’. The style emphasizes bringing together elements from different times and places in order to create something new and original, with a local aesthetic. Bawa has had a tremendous influence on design and construction in Sri Lanka and many of his trademark embellishments have now become typical in Sri Lankan homes and buildings. The boundaries between indoors and outdoors are often erased, moved, or made more subtle, in Bawa's work. Older Sri Lankan influences, like reflecting pools, colonnaded passages, and terra-cotta-tiled roofs, are fused with the modernist emphasis of flowing spaces and clean lines. His work has also been a significant influence on architecture across South and Southeast Asia.Beyond vernacular kitsch? The Sunday Times OnlineLegacy of a master The Sunday Times Online Today, tropical modernist architecture can also be found in Brazil, Puerto Rico, Hawaii and Ghana among other places.https://www.calvertjournal.com/features/show/5407/red-africa-ghana- architecture-communist- europehttp://au.phaidon.com/agenda/architecture/articles/2014/november/03/tropical- modernism-is-back-in-puerto-rico/http://blog.uniquehomes.com/tropical- modernism-a-comeback/https://www.architonic.com/en/story/susanne-fritz- tropical-modernism-the-masters-of-brazilian-modernism/7000479 Bawa's legacy is felt in the work of many Sri Lankan architects, who continue the traditions of Tropical Modernism. Architects, like Channa Daswatte, continue to design in this style, paying close attention to how the designed environment interacts with the climate and the needs of the users. By the 2000s and 2010s, there is also a presence of postmodernism, creating modern monumental architecture, through the incorporation of historical Sri Lankan cultural elements to convey meaning and context. The Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre in Colombo, by Kahawita De Silva & Associates, is an example of using a historical landscape design feature, the Nelum Pokuna in Polonnaruwa, to create a modern national monument to celebrate the country's arts. Several of buildings that are proposed/under-construction like the Altair Residential Towers,http://www.altair.lk/ Krrish Squarehttp://www.krrishcolombo.com/ and ITC Colombo Onehttp://www.gensler.com/projects/itc-colombo-one-hotel- residences have postmodern architectural designs. By the 2010s the idea of Sustainable architecture has appeared in Sri Lanka, the 186m(610 ft) tall Clear point Residencies building which is expected to be the world's tallest vertical garden and use harvested rainwater, recycled bathroom sink and shower water with a drip irrigation system to water the plants. The plants naturally cool the buildings and clean the air thus reducing the need for air conditioning.

In addition, The Wyndham Land Act of 1903 enabled the transfer of about 9 million acres (36,000 km²), up to 1914, from landlords to tenants. However, tenure and ownership of land was still a live issue on the eve of the Irish War of Independence. Shawe-Taylor family Frank Shawe-Taylor was a member of the Taylor family of Castle Taylor, Ardrahan. He was related to Lady Gregory, and was married with a family, living at Moorpark House, Coshla, Athenry. Another member of the family was Captain John Shawe-Taylor. Frank had served as High Sheriff of County Galway in 1915. The dispute Shawe-Taylor was a land agent to a local landlord, and was himself a tenant. Early in January 1920, a group of local IRA soldiers (including Mick Kelly, Bill Freaney and Larry Lardner) approached Shawe-Taylor on behalf of some local people who were requesting a road to travel to Mass. While Shawe-Taylor himself was amenable to their demands, his landlord refused them outright and made this known via Shawe-Taylor. The shooting On 3 March 1920, Shawe- Taylor and his driver, Barrett, were making their way to Galway to attend the fair. At 6 a.m. the coach reached Egan's Pub, Coshla, where they found the road blocked. The donkey cart of a local, Johnny Kelly, had been stolen and placed across the road. From behind the wall, at least two shooters fired at Barrett and Shawe-Taylor, wounding the former and killing the latter. This resulted in a huge security presence in the area, which in turn led to more unrest with the locals. This increased with the arrival of the Black and Tans, whose irregular methods resulted in shootings, assaults, rapes and deaths. Moorpark House was placed under Royal Irish Constabulary protection out of fear of further killings. Aftermath Other people who subsequently died as a result of the unrest in Galway included Ellen Quinn (1 November 1920), a pregnant mother of six and a tenant of Lady Gregory; Fr. Michael Griffin (14 November 1920); Tom Egan and Patrick and Harry Loughnane (two brothers). In addition, there were numerous incidents of violence, many of which were recorded with horror by Lady Gregory in her journal, who remarked that \\"the country has gone wild since the killing of Frank Shawe-Taylor.\\" Local republican Bill Freaney at one point planned to burn Moorpark House in 'revenge' for the death of Tom Egan (which itself was thought to be a reprisal for Shawe-Taylor's killing), but was dissuaded by Mrs. Egan. Freaney himself was burned to death in Athenry in 1921. No one was ever tried for Frank Shawe- Taylor's killing, though the identities of those involved were known to some locals at the time. His widow eventually sold their property, and with her young children moved to England. Shawe-Taylor is buried in St. Mary's graveyard, Athenry. The music critic, Desmond Shawe-Taylor (1907-1995) and British racing driver Brian Shawe-Taylor (1915-1999) were his sons. His grandson is Desmond Shawe-Taylor, Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures since 2005. See also * Land War * Three Fs * Irish Parliamentary Party References * Lady Gregory's Journal, v. 1.

He played as an outside right. Playing career Kirby was born in the Bordesley Green district of Birmingham. While serving in the Royal Army Medical Corps, he represented them at football and became a champion sprinter. In 1905 he joined Southern League club Fulham, for whom he played four league games. In the 1906 close season he joined Birmingham, for whom he made his only Football League appearance, on 6 September 1906 in the First Division match at home to Newcastle United which Birmingham lost 4–2.Matthews, p. 153. He later joined Blackpool, without appearing in the Football League, and played non-league football for Worcester City, Kidderminster Harriers and Willenhall Pickwick, before returning to Fulham in 1913. Coaching career Kirby retired from playing in 1918 and moved to Spain, where he became a referee and a football manager. He coached both CE Europa and FC Barcelona during the 1920s. He was appointed Europa manager in August 1922. In 1923 he guided Europa to the Campionat de Catalunya. After finishing level on points with Barcelona, Europa beat them 1–0 in a title play-off. They then represented Catalonia in the Copa del Rey and after defeating Sevilla and Sporting Gijón in earlier rounds, they lost 1–0 to Athletic Bilbao in the final at Les Corts. Kirby was subsequently appointed coach of Barcelona in December 1924, replacing Jesza Poszony. His first game in charge was a 2–0 win in a friendly against First Vienna on Christmas Day 1925. He remained in charge for 39 games. He joined Athletic Bilbao in September 1925, and returned to England in May 1926. Kirby later rejoined Europa and coached them during the 1930–31 La Liga season; however, they finished bottom of the table and were relegated.

He was the first Victorian player to captain his country in rugby union.Australian Rugby – The Game and the Players (Jack Pollard Syd, 1994) pp 123: Cowper, Denis Lawson \\"Dave\\" (1908–1981) Club career Born at Mosman, New South Wales Cowper was educated at Newington College in Sydney (1923–1927).Newington College Register of Past Students 1863–1998 (Syd, 1999) pp43 He played club rugby with the Northern Suburbs Rugby Club before relocating to Melbourne at age 21 where he continued at the Melbourne Rugby Union Football Club. He trialled for Australia as a sprinter, placing third in the national trials for the 100m held to select a team for the 1932 Summer Olympics. Representative career He made his representative debut in 1930 for Victoria against Great Britain scoring three tries in a narrow 36–41 loss. He was then selected in the 1931 full Australian side sent to New Zealand and captained by Syd Malcolm with Cyril Towers and Alex Ross in the senior playing group. They won three, drew one and lost six matches including the single Test. Cowper played in nine of the ten matches, three on the wing and the rest at centre. Cowper scored two tries in his Test debut in the Bledisloe Cup match played at Eden Park and was the second top- scorer of the tour with six tries.Howell p104 In 1932 he again met the All Blacks in three Test appearances when they came to Australia, scoring tries in two of those fixtures. Howell describes him as having \\"speed to burn, a great outside swerve, sound in defence and a born leader of men\\". In 1933, Cowper was in the squad that made Australia's first ever rugby tour of South Africa. He played in 17 of the 23 games including all five Tests and was the tour top scorer with 34 points from four tries, nine conversions and a dropped goal. He captained Australia in three tour matches and in three Tests, being first honoured as captain in the first Test of the tour when Malcolm and Ross were unavailable through injury. Though born in New South Wales, Cowper at that point became the first Victorian to captain the Wallabies.Howell p104 He made further state representative appearances for New South Wales and Victoria in 1934 and 1935. Coaching career He became an Australian selector and was assistant manager and coach of the squad for the 1957-58 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France. The tour was a disappointment with the Wallabies losing all five Tests. Howell writes that Cowper, \\"ever the gentleman, never criticised the players, even when he had every right to....he personified the true amateur, playing always to the rules with a strict code of ethics\\". Squad member Nicholas Shehadie was less complimentary in his published recollections, suggesting Cowper had limited imagination as a coach and their training was \\"devoid of variety which made it very tedious\\".Shehadie p194 His son Bob Cowper played Test cricket for Australia in the 1960s.

Beginning in 1910, when he entered the Escuela Politécnica Militar (Military Polytechnic School), Coronel Castellanos would spend over 26 active years in the Salvadoran military, eventually achieving the rank of Second Chief of the General Staff of the Army of the Republic. Subsequently he would serve as Salvadoran Consul General in the following locations: Liverpool, England, 1937; Hamburg, Germany, 1938; Geneva, Switzerland, 1941–45. =World War II= It was during his time as consul in neutral Switzerland that Colonel Castellanos was approached by a Transylvanian-born Jewish businessman named György Mandl who reiterated to him the grave situation in which he, his family, and countless of his coreligionists found themselves. Castellanos, moved to help Mandl, gave him the ad hoc post of First Secretary to the Consul and had papers of Salvadoran nationality prepared for him and his family. Following a close call with the Gestapo in which the faux position and papers saved the family (who now bore the Italianate name of Mantello) from being sent to Auschwitz, Mandl (with Castellanos's consent) proceeded to secretly issue at least 13,000 \\"certificates of Salvadoran citizenship\\" to Central European Jews (principally through the Swiss Consular Office of Carl Lutz). The documents granted the bearers the right to seek and receive the protection of the International Red Cross and, eventually, of the Swiss Consul in Budapest; these guarantees, in effect, saved thousands of \\"Salvadorans\\" of Bulgarian, Czechoslovakian, Hungarian, Polish, and Romanian extraction from Nazi depredations. 1929 In Geneva, Switzerland, Salvadoran lawyer and diplomat Dr. José Gustavo Guerrero places the first stone of the Palais des Nations, the headquarters of the League of Nations, today UN. Castellanos received help from another fellow Salvadoran, Jose Gustavo Guerrero,who was a Salvadoran judge who challenged the Nazis during Hitler's invasion on Europe. The distinguished Salvadoran jurist lived in Europe for many years in his career as a diplomat and as presiding judge of the Permanent Court of Justice International, based in The Hague, The Netherlands. In 1937, during the rise of Nazism in Europe, Doctor Guerrero took over as president, until he was forced to leave in 1940 by the Nazis. Precisely after the fall of Holland, on May 17, 1940, the Nazis tried to take the Palace of the Permanent Court of Justice in The Hague, but there they met the Salvadoran, the only judge who stayed with a group of Dutch officers. When a German general approached, the Presiding Judge told him: \\"The Court and its staff are inviolable. Only on my body can they enter the palace.\\" For this and others before courage in defense of Universal Law, Dr. Guerrero was twice nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Once established in Geneva, Dr. Guerrero was visited by the Consul General of El Salvador in Switzerland, Colonel José Castellanos Contreras, who had fled from Germany, where he served as Consul until El Salvador broke relations with the Hitler regime. Colonel Castellanos had already granted several visas to people of Jewish origin who were persecuted by the Nazis. However, now it was part of a larger project: the handing over of false documents of Salvadoran nationality to people of Jewish origin Castellanos then consulted Dr. Guerrero, who immediately agreed to that plan that saved the lives of thousands of Jews. According to the investigations, Dr. Guerrero would have contributed to writing the text of the document that was then given to them to save their lives. In 1945 San Francisco, California, a conference was held attended by more than 50 countries and on which the United Nations Organization (UN) was founded. Colonel Castellanos' efforts on behalf of the Jews of Central Europe have been recognized at various times by the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee, and the group Visas For Life. In 1999 the Jerusalem City Council honored Castellanos' granddaughter on the occasion of the inauguration of El Salvador St. in the neighborhood of Givat Masua. In 1995 President Bill Clinton, in a letter to the Anti-Defamation League, paid tribute to Colonel Castellanos and other members of the Salvadoran diplomatic corps, for their efforts in saving thousands from Nazi extermination. Castellanos, who hardly ever spoke of his role as rescuer during World War II, was interviewed by writer Leon Uris on the subject in 1972. After the Israeli Foreign Ministry and the Jewish Community of El Salvador have both asked (the \\"Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority\\"), José Arturo Castellanos Contreras was recognized with the title of \\"Righteous Among the Nations\\" by Yad Vashem in 2010.José Castellanos Contreras – his activity to save Jews' lives during the Holocaust, at Yad Vashem website Personal life Colonel Castellanos married Maria Schürmann, a native of Switzerland, with whom he had a daughter and two sons: Frieda, Paul Andree, and Jose Arturo Castellanos Jr. After the war, Castellanos lived a quiet life and played down his role. The writer Leon Uris tracked down the retired diplomat in 1972 and Castellanos gave a brief radio interview in 1976, but otherwise he remained anonymous and his contribution went unrecognised. He died in 1977. Colonel Castellanos' grandsons Alvaro Castellanos and Boris Castellanos composed and wrote THE RESCUE - A Live Film-Concerto (An Expanded Cinema Documentary work by Alvaro Castellanos and Boris Castellanos). ‘THE RESCUE - A Live Film- Concerto’ is a performative film experience that combines a 60-min documentary film with a live musical performance of its musical soundtrack - to recount the little-known story of 'Righteous' Colonel José Arturo Castellanos. Castellanos collaborated with his Jewish friend to save thousands of Jewish lives during the holocaust by issuing Salvadoran nationality certificates while working as a diplomat; putting his life and family at great risk. This ground-breaking Film-Concerto concept was developed by filmmakers Alvaro and Boris Castellanos, grandsons of Colonel Castellanos as an emotionally engaging and uplifting way to tell the story of their grandfather and as a pioneering narrative in holocaust education and commemoration of the 'Righteous among the nations'.

Examples of these issues can be problems speaking in full sentences, problems correctly articulating Rs and Ls as well as Ms and Ns, mixing up sounds in multi-syllabic words (ex: for animal, for spaghetti, for helicopter, for hamburger, for magazine, etc.), problems of immature speech such as \\"wed and gween\\" instead of \\"red and green\\". The characteristics of dyslexia have been identified mainly from research in languages with alphabetic writing systems, primarily English. However, many of these characteristic may be transferable to other types of writing systems. The causes of dyslexia are not agreed upon, although the consensus of neuroscientists believe dyslexia is a phonological processing disorder and that dyslexics have reading difficulties because they are unable to see or hear a word, break it down to discrete sounds, and then associate each sound with letters that make up the word. Some researchers believe that a subset of dyslexics have visual deficits in addition to deficits in phoneme processing, but this view is not universally accepted. In any case, there is no evidence that dyslexics literally \\"see\\" letters backward or in reverse order within words. Dyslexia is a language disorder, not a vision disorder. Poor working memory may be another reason why those with dyslexia have difficulties remembering new vocabulary words. Remembering verbal instructions may also be a struggle. Dyslexics who have not been given structured language instruction may grow to depend on learning individual words by memory rather than decoding words by mapping phonemes (speech sounds) to graphemes (letters and letter combinations which represent individual speech sounds).https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/experts/tracy-p-alloway-phd Listening, speech and language Some shared symptoms of the speech or hearing deficits and dyslexia: # Confusion with before/after, right/left, and so on # Difficulty learning the alphabet # Difficulty with word retrieval or naming problems # Difficulty identifying or generating rhyming words, or counting syllables in words (phonological awareness) # Difficulty with hearing and manipulating sounds in words (phonemic awareness) # Difficulty distinguishing different sounds in words (auditory discrimination) # Difficulty in learning the sounds of letters (In alphabetic writing systems) # Difficulty associating individual words with their correct meanings # Difficulty with time keeping and concept of time # Confusion with combinations of words # Difficulty in organization skills The identification of these factors results from the study of patterns across many clinical observations of dyslexic children. In the UK, Thomas Richard Miles was important in such work and his observations led him to develop the Bangor Dyslexia Diagnostic Test. Reading and spelling * Spelling errors — Because of difficulty learning letter-sound correspondences, individuals with dyslexia might tend to misspell words, or leave vowels out of words. * Letter order - People with dyslexia may also reverse the order of two letters especially when the final, incorrect, word looks similar to the intended word (e.g., spelling \\"dose\\" instead of \\"does\\"). * Letter addition/subtraction - People with dyslexia may perceive a word with letters added, subtracted, or repeated. This can lead to confusion between two words containing most of the same letters. * Highly phoneticized spelling - People with dyslexia also commonly spell words inconsistently, but in a highly phonetic form such as writing \\"shud\\" for \\"should\\". Dyslexic individuals also typically have difficulty distinguishing among homophones such as \\"their\\" and \\"there\\". * Vocabulary - Having a small written vocabulary, even if they have a large spoken vocabulary. *Seeing words backwards sometimes - a person sometimes might see the words backwards. Writing and motor skills Because of literacy problems, an individual with dyslexia may have difficulty with handwriting. This can involve slower writing speed than average, poor handwriting characterised by irregularly formed letters, or inability to write straight on a blank paper with no guideline. Some studies have also reported gross motor difficulties in dyslexia, including motor skills disorder. This difficulty is indicated by clumsiness and poor coordination. The relationship between motor skills and reading difficulties is poorly understood but could be linked to the role of the cerebellum and inner ear in the development of reading and motor abilities. Mathematical abilities Dyslexia and dyscalculia are two learning disorders with different cognitive profiles. Dyslexia and dyscalculia have separable cognitive profiles, mainly a phonological deficit in the case of dyslexia and a deficient number module in the case of dyscalculia. Individuals with dyslexia can be gifted in mathematics while having poor reading skills. They might have difficulty with word processing problems (e.g. descriptive mathematics, engineering or physics problems that rely on written text rather than numbers or formulas). Adaptive attributes A study has found that entrepreneurs are five times more likely to be dyslexic than average citizens.cass.city.ac.uk Entrepreneurs five times more likely to suffer from dyslexia Evidence based on randomly selected populations of children indicate that dyslexia affects boys and girls equally; that dyslexia is diagnosed more frequently in boys appears to be the result of sampling bias in school- identified sample populations.Shaywitz, Sally E., M.D., and Bennett A. Shaywitz, M.D. (2001) The Neurobiology of Reading and Dyslexia. National Center for the Study of Adult Learning and Literacy Focus on Basics, Volume 5, Issue A - August 2001. In the United States, researchers estimate the prevalence of dyslexia to range from three to ten percent of school-aged children though some have put the figure as high as 17 percent.Learning Disabilities: Multidisciplinary Research Centers, NIH Guide, Volume 23, Number 37, October 21, 1994, Full Text HD-95-005 (\\"LDRC longitudinal, epidemiological studies show that RD (dyslexia) affect at least 10 million children, or approximately 1 child in 5.\\") Recent studies indicate that dyslexia is particularly prevalent among small business owners, with roughly 20 to 35 percent of US and British entrepreneurs being affected.Cites a study by Julie Logan, professor of entrepreneurship at Cass Business School in London, among other literature.

Orcs were brought into modern usage by the fantasy writings of J. R. R. Tolkien, especially The Lord of the Rings. In Tolkien's works, orcs are a brutish, aggressive, ugly and malevolent race, contrasting with the benevolent Elves and serving an evil power, though they share a human sense of morality but technically are a race of elves themselves. Mythological monsters with names similar to \\"orc\\" can be found in the Old English poem Beowulf, in Early Modern poetry, and in Northern European folk tales and fairy tales. Tolkien stated that he took the name from Beowulf. Tolkien's concept of orcs has been adapted and imported into the fantasy fiction of other authors, and into role- playing and strategy games such as Dungeons & Dragons, Warhammer, and Warcraft. Etymology =Old English= Latin Orcus is glossed as Old English \\"Orc, þyrs, oððe hel-deofol\\" (\\"Goblin, spectre, or hell-devil\\") in the 10th century Cleopatra Glossary. The is glossed as \\"Orc, þyrs, oððe hel- deofol\\" (\\"Goblin, spectre, or hell-devil\\") in the 10th century Old English Cleopatra Glossary, about which Thomas Wright wrote, \\"Orcus was the name for Pluto, the god of the infernal regions, hence we can easily understand the explanation of hel-deofol. Orc, in Anglo-Saxon, like thyrs, means a spectre, or goblin.\\"(Repr. Sandpaper Books, 1998 ), Gloss #698: orcus orc (Épinal); orci orc (Erfurt).The Corpus Glossary (Corpus Christi College MS. 144, late 8th to early 9th century) has the two glosses: \\"Orcus, orc\\" and \\"Orcus, ðyrs, hel-diobul. The Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal defines ork in the closely related Old Dutch language as a verslindend monster (\\"devouring monster\\"), and points at a possible origin in the Old Dutch nork \\"petulant, crabbed, evil person\\". The term is used just once in Beowulf as the plural compound orcneas, one of the tribes alongside the elves and ettins (giants) condemned by God: {  :þanon untydras ealle onwocon :eotenas ond ylfe ond orcneas :swylce gigantas þa wið gode wunnon :lange þrage he him ðæs lean forgeald  :Thence all evil broods were born, :ogres and elves and evil spirits :—the giants also, who long time fought with God, :for which he gave them their reward  } Beowulfs eotenas ond ylfe ond orcneas, \\"ogres and elves and devil-corpses\\", inspiring Tolkien to create orcs and other races Orcneas is translated \\"evil spirits\\" above, but its meaning is uncertain. Klaeber suggested it consisted of orc < L. orcus \\"the underworld\\" + neas \\"corpses\\", which the translation \\"evil spirits\\" failed to do justice.: Orcneas: \\"evil spirits\\" does not bring out all the meaning. Orcneas is compounded of orc (from the Lat. orcus \\"the underworld\\" or Hades) and neas \\"corpses.\\" Necromancy was practised among the ancient German! It is generally supposed to contain an element -né, cognate to Gothic naus and Old Norse nár, both meaning 'corpse'. The usual Old English word for corpse is líc, but -né appears in nebbed 'corpse bed', and in dryhtné 'dead body of a warrior', where dryht is a military unit. If *orcné is to be glossed as orcus 'corpse', the meaning may be \\"corpse from Orcus (i.e. the underworld)\\", or \\"devil-corpse\\", understood as some sort of walking dead monster. =Early Modern= A monster called Orcus is mentioned in Edmund Spenser's 1590 Faerie Queene. The Oxford English Dictionary records an Early Modern period orke, meaning \\"ogre\\", in Samuel Holland's 1656 fairy tale Don Zara, a pastiche of Spanish romances such as Don Quixote.\\"Orc\\" Oxford English Dictionary It is presumed that 'orke'/'ogre' came into English via continental fairy-tales, especially from the 17th-century French writer Charles Perrault, who borrowed most of his stories and developed his \\"ogre\\" from the 16th-century Italian writers Giovanni Francesco Straparola (credited with introducing the literary form of the fairy tale) and Giambattista Basile, who wrote in the Naples dialect, stating that he was passing on oral folktales from his region. In the tales, Basile used huorco, huerco or uerco, the Neapolitan form of Italian orco, lit. \\"Ogre\\", to describe a large, hairy, tusked, mannish beast who could speak, lived in a dark forest or garden and might capture and eat humans. Tolkien Tolkien wrote that his orcs were influenced by the goblins in George MacDonald's 1872 The Princess and the Goblin. Illustration \\"The goblins fell back a little when he began, and made horrible grimaces\\" by Jessie Willcox Smith, 1920 =Stated etymology= Tolkien began the modern use of the English term \\"orc\\" to denote a race of evil, humanoid creatures. His earliest Elvish dictionaries include the entry Ork (orq-) \\"monster\\", \\"ogre\\", \\"demon\\", together with orqindi and \\"ogresse\\". He sometimes used the plural form orqui in his early texts. He stated that the Elvish words for orc were derived from a root ruku, \\"fear, horror\\"; in Quenya, orco, plural orkor; in Sindarin orch, plurals yrch and Orchoth (as a class). They had similar names in other Middle-earth languages: uruk in Black Speech (restricted to the larger soldier-orcs); in the language of the Drúedain gorgûn, \\"ork-folk\\"; in Khuzdul rukhs, plural rakhâs; and in the language of Rohan and in the Common Speech, orka. Tolkien stated in a letter to the novelist Naomi Mitchison that his Orcs had been influenced by George MacDonald's The Princess and the Goblin. He explained that his \\"orc\\" was \\"derived from Old English orc 'demon', but only because of its phonetic suitability\\", and Tolkien also observed a connection with the Latin word orcus, noting that \\"the word used in translation of Q[uenya] urko, S[indarin] orch is Orc. But that is because of the similarity of the ancient English word orc, 'evil spirit or bogey', to the Elvish words. There is possibly no connection between them.\\" =Description= Orcs are of human shape, and of varying size;The Return of the King book 6, ch. 1, \\"The Tower of Cirith Ungol\\" in The Hobbit they are called \\"goblins\\", though Thorin's Elvish sword from Gondolin is named as \\"Orcrist, Goblin-cleaver, but the goblins called it simply Biter\\".The Hobbit ch. 4, \\"Over Hill and Under Hill\\" They are depicted as ugly and filthy, with a taste for human flesh. They are fanged, bow-legged and long-armed; some have dark skin as if burned. Most are small and avoid daylight. In Isengard, the Wizard Saruman has bred a large and powerful kind of orc, the Uruk-Hai, who are not afraid of daylight. Orcs eat meat, including the flesh of Men, and may indulge in cannibalism: in The Two Towers, Grishnákh, an Orc from Mordor, claims that the Isengard Orcs eat orc-flesh. Whether that is true or spoken in malice is uncertain: an Orc flings Pippin stale bread and a \\"strip of raw dried flesh... the flesh of he dared not guess what creature\\". The orcs from Mordor speak the Black Speech, a language invented for them by Sauron, while those from Isengard speak other tongues; to understand each other, they use the Common Speech (Westron), such as Pippin overheard and understood. =In-fiction origins= Tolkien proposed several semi-contradictory theories for the origins of orcs. In The Tale of Tinúviel, Orcs originate as \\"foul broodlings of Melkor who fared abroad doing his evil work\\".The Book of Lost Tales book 2, part 1 \\"The Tale of Tinúviel\\" In The Fall of Gondolin Tolkien wrote that \\"all that race were bred by Melkor of the subterranean heats and slime.\\"J. R. R. Tolkien, The Fall of Gondolin In The Silmarillion, Orcs are East Elves (Avari) enslaved, tortured, and bred by Morgoth (as Melkor became known); they \\"multiplied\\" like Elves and Men. Tolkien stated in a 1962 letter to a Mrs. Munsby that Orc-females must have existed. In The Fall of Gondolin Morgoth made them of slime by sorcery, \\"bred from the heats and slimes of the earth\\". Or, they were \\"The Orcs were beasts of humanized shape\\", possibly, Tolkien wrote, Elves mated with beasts, and later Men. Or again, Tolkien noted, they could have been fallen Maiar, perhaps a kind called Boldog, like lesser Balrogs; or corrupted Men. Half-orcs appear in The Lord of the Rings, created by interbreeding of Orcs and Men; they were able to go in sunlight. The \\"sly Southerner\\" in The Fellowship of the Ring looks \\"more than half like a goblin\\"; similar but more orc-like hybrids appear in The Two Towers \\"man-high, but with goblin-faces, sallow, leering, squint- eyed.\\" =Alleged racism= alt=Tolkien's moral geography of Middle-earth, good in the west, evil in the east, simple in the north, sophisticated in the south. The Shire is in the northwest (simple/good) quadrant, Gondor in the southwest, and Mordor in the southeast The scholars of English literature William N. Rogers II and Michael R. Underwood note that a widespread element of late 19th century Western culture was fear of moral decline and degeneration; this led to eugenics. In The Two Towers, the Ent Treebeard says:The Two Towers, Lord of the Rings Book 3, Ch. 4, \\"Treebeard\\" The film- maker Andrew Stewart, writing in CounterPunch, cites this speech as an instance of \\"mid-twentieth century scientific racism .. which alarmingly spells out the notion of 'race mixing' as a great sin\\". Stewart notes, too, that the geography of Middle-earth deliberately pits the good West against the evil East; John Magoun, writing in the J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia, concurs, stating that Middle-earth has a \\"fully expressed moral geography\\". Any moral bias towards a north-western geography, however, was directly addressed by Tolkien himself in a letter to Charlotte and Denis Plimmer, who had recently interviewed him in 1967: In a private letter, Tolkien describes orcs as: alt=Poster showing fanged caricature of \\"Tokio kid,\\" a Japanese person pointing a bloody knife at a sign that reads \\"Much waste of material make so- o-o-o happy! Thank you!\\" A variety of critics and commentators have noted that orcs are somewhat like caricatures of non-Europeans. The journalist David Ibata writes that the orcs in Peter Jackson's Tolkien films look much like \\"the worst depictions of the Japanese drawn by American and British illustrators during World War II.\\" The literary critic Jenny Turner, writing in the London Review of Books, endorses Andrew O'Hehir's comment on Salon.com that orcs are \\"by design and intention a northern European's paranoid caricature of the races he has dimly heard about\\". O'Hehir describes orcs as \\"a subhuman race bred by Morgoth and/or Sauron (although not created by them) that is morally irredeemable and deserves only death. They are dark-skinned and slant-eyed, and although they possess reason, speech, social organization and, as Shippey mentions, a sort of moral sensibility, they are inherently evil.\\" He notes Tolkien's own description of them (quoted above), saying it could scarcely be more revealing as a representation of the \\"Other\\", says \\"it is also the product of his background and era, like most of our inescapable prejudices. At the level of conscious intention, he was not a racist or an anti-Semite\\" and mentions his letters to this effect. In a letter to his son, Christopher who was serving in the RAF in the Second World War, Tolkien wrote of orcs as appearing on both sides of the conflict: The scholar of English literature Robert Tally describes the orcs as a demonized enemy, despite (he writes) Tolkien's own objections to demonization of the enemy in the two World Wars. The Germanic studies scholar Sandra Ballif Straubhaar however argues against the \\"recurring accusations\\" of racism, stating that \\"a polycultured, polylingual world is absolutely central\\" to Middle-earth, and that readers and filmgoers will easily see that. The historian and Tolkien scholar Jared Lobdell likewise disagreed with any notions of racism inherent or latent in Tolkien's works, and wondered \\"if there were a way of writing epic fantasy about a battle against an evil spirit and his monstrous servants without its being subject to speculation of racist intent\\". =A shared morality= The Tolkien critic Tom Shippey writes that the orcs in The Lord of the Rings were almost certainly created just to equip Middle-earth with \\"a continual supply of enemies over whom one need feel no compunction\\", or in Tolkien's words from The Monsters and the Critics \\"the infantry of the old war\\" ready to be slaughtered. Shippey states that all the same, orcs share the human concept of good and evil, with a familiar sense of morality, though he notes that, like many people, orcs are quite unable to apply their morals to themselves. In his view, Tolkien, as a Roman Catholic, took it as a given that \\"evil cannot make, only mock\\", so orcs could not have an equal and opposite morality to that of men or elves. Shippey notes that in The Two Towers, the orc Gorbag disapproves of the \\"regular elvish trick\\" of seeming to abandon a comrade, as he wrongly supposes Sam has done with Frodo. Shippey describes the implied view of evil as Boethian, that evil is the absence of good; he notes however that Tolkien did not agree with that point of view, believing that evil had to be actively combatted, with war if necessary, the Manichean position. Other authors In the fantasy series The Harrow, author Philip Mazza includes a race of orcs or the Gulguthra in the ancient tongue. The Gulguthra are members of the Brood, or En' Rauko, an evil race that occupy a post-apocalypse fantasy world. They have low jutting foreheads, snouts, ray-green skin, reddish eyes, large canine teeth, and short pointed ears. As a response to their type-casting as generic evil characters or antagonists, some novels portray events from the point of view of the orcs, or present them as more sympathetic characters. Mary Gentle's 1992 novel Grunts! presents orcs as generic infantry, used as metaphorical cannon-fodder. A series of books by Stan Nicholls, Orcs: First Blood, focuses on the conflicts between orcs and humans, from the orcs' point of view. In Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, Orcs are a race that is close to extinction; in his Unseen Academicals it is said that \\"When the Evil Emperor wanted fighters he got some of the Igors to turn goblins into orcs\\" to be used as weapons in a Great War, \\"encouraged\\" by whips and beatings. In games Orcs based on The Lord of the Rings have become a fixture of fantasy fiction and role-playing games, where orcs and goblins are usually distinct races of goblinoids. In the fantasy tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, orcs were one of the earliest creatures introduced in the game, and were largely based upon those described by Tolkien.\\"'Orc' (from Orcus) is another term for an ogre or ogre-like creature. Being useful fodder for the ranks of bad guys, monsters similar to Tolkien's orcs are also in both games.\\" The D&D; orcs are a tribal race of hostile and bestial humanoids with muscular frames, large canine teeth and snouts rather than human-like noses. The orc appears in the first edition Monster Manual (1977), where it is described as a fiercely competitive bully, a tribal creature often living underground.Gygax, Gary. Monster Manual (TSR, 1977) The mythology and attitudes of the orcs are described in detail in Dragon #62 (June 1982), in Roger E. Moore's article, \\"The Half-Orc Point of View\\",Moore, Roger E. \\"The Half-Orc Point of View.\\" Dragon #62 (TSR, June 1982). and the orc is further detailed in Paizo Publishing's book Classic Monsters Revisited (2008), on pages 52–57.Baur, Wolfgang, Jason Bulmahn, Joshua J. Frost, James Jacobs, Nicolas Logue, Mike McArtor, James L. Sutter, Greg A. Vaughan, Jeremy Walker. Classic Monsters Revisited (Paizo, 2008). Games Workshop's Warhammer universe features cunning and brutal Orcs in a fantasy setting, who are not so much driven by a need to do evil but rather to obtain fulfilment through the act of war. In the Warhammer 40,000, a series of science-fiction games, they are a green-skinned alien species, called 'Orks'. Orcs are an important race in the Warcraft, a high fantasy franchise created by Blizzard Entertainment. They are variously savage or \\"savage but noble\\" warriors and shamans, prodigiously muscled, with broad noses and distinctive tusked mouths. Several Orc characters from the Warcraft universe are playable heroes in the crossover multiplayer game Heroes of the Storm. In Hasbro's Heroscape products, Orcs come from the pre-historic planet Grut. They are blue-skinned, with prominent tusks or horns. Several Orc champions ride prehistoric animals (including a Tyrannosaurus rex, a Velociraptor and sabre-tooth tigers, known as Swogs.

It was originally developed under the name iPACKMANiPACKMAN: High-Quality, Low- Complexity Textures Compression for Mobile Phones -- Jacob Ström (Ericsson Research), Tomas Akeinine-Möller (Lund University) and based on an earlier compression scheme called PACKMAN.PACKMAN: Texture Compression for Mobile Phones -- Jacob Ström (Ericsson Research), Tomas Akeinine-Möller (Lund University). ETC1 The original 'ETC1' compression scheme provides 6x compression of 24-bit RGB data. It does not support the compression of images with Alpha components, although there are work-arounds for this. ETC1 takes 4x4 groups of pixel data and compresses each into a single 64-bit word. The 4×4 pixel group is first divided into two 4×2 chunks - either horizontally or vertically. Each half is given a base color - either using 4/4/4 RGB or by giving one of them a 5/5/5 RGB and having the other be a 3/3/3 bit offset from that base. Each 4×2 region also has a 3-bit brightness range selection. Each pixel is then offset from the base color by adding one of four signed values to the base color for its half of the 4×4 group. This format is a part of the OpenGL ES graphics standard extensionsOES_compressed_ETC1_RGB8_texture, A description of the ETC1- compression algorithm and texture format in OpenGL ES extension registry for embedded devices such as mobile phones and has been approved by the Khronos Group for use in the WebGL graphics standard for browser-side World Wide Web graphics. Android version 2.2 (Froyo) includes support for ETC1.Release notes for Android 2.2 , (Froyo) ETC2 and EAC The 'ETC2' scheme expands ETC1 in a backwards-compatible way to provide higher quality RGB compressionPaper about ETC2: Texture Compression using Invalid Combinations, as well as compression of RGBA (RGB plus alpha), single channel (R11) and dual channel (RG11) data. The following ETC2 codecs are mandatory in OpenGL ES 3.0OpenGL ES Version 3.0 Specification and OpenGL 4.3:OpenGL Version 4.3 Specification * \`GL_COMPRESSED_RGB8_ETC2\` — Compresses RGB888 data, the followup of ETC1. * \`GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA8_ETC2_EAC\` — Compresses RGBA8888 data with full alpha support. * \`GL_COMPRESSED_RGB8_PUNCHTHROUGH_ALPHA1_ETC2\` — Compresses RGBA data where pixels are either fully transparent or fully opaque. sRGB variants of the above codecs are also available. EAC is built on the same principles as ETC1/ETC2 but is used for one- or two-channel data. The following four EAC codecs are included as mandatory in OpenGL ES 3.0 and OpenGL 4.3: * \`GL_COMPRESSED_R11_EAC\` — one channel unsigned data * \`GL_COMPRESSED_SIGNED_R11_EAC\` — one channel signed data * \`GL_COMPRESSED_RG11_EAC\` — two channel unsigned data * \`GL_COMPRESSED_SIGNED_RG11_EAC\` — two channel signed data The RGBA and RG11 formats are encoded in 128 bits per 4x4 block, while the rest are encoded in 64 bits per block. For RGBA, the RGB channels are encoded in a regular 64-bit block, while the A channel gets its own 64-bit block. RG11 formats are encoded similarly, with one 64-bit block per component.

On his return to Britain, Pollington again represented Pontefract between 1841 and 1847.Profile , leighrayment.com; accessed 16 May 2016. He was nominated as a candidate in a byelection in the borough in 1851, in his absence and without his knowledge. Pollington became a close friend of Benjamin Disraeli, and shortly after he married the \\"very wild and gay\\" Lady Rachel Walpole, daughter of Horatio Walpole, 3rd Earl of Orford in 1842, Disraeli featured the couple as 'Lord and Lady Gaverstock' in his novel Coningsby. Tragically Pollington's first wife died in June 1854. Peerage In 1860 he succeeded his father in the earldom. However, as this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to a seat in the House of Lords. Marriages and children He married twice: *Firstly in 1842 to Lady Rachel Katherine Walpole, a daughter of Horatio Walpole, 3rd Earl of Orford, by whom he had issue including: **John Horace Savile, 5th Earl of Mexborough (1843–1916), eldest son and heir. *Secondly, in July 1861 at St Mary's, Bryanston Square, London, he married Agnes Louisa Elizabeth Raphael (d.December 1898), a Roman Catholic and a daughter of John Raphael. In 1894 he converted to the Roman Catholic faith of his wife. Death & succession He died in Brighton in August 1899, aged 89, having survived his wife by only a few months. At the time of his death he was the last survivor from the pre-1832 Reform Act House of Commons.D.R. Fisher, History of Parliament 1820-1832, vol I, pg. 241. He was succeeded in the earldom by his son from his first marriage, John Horace Savile, 5th Earl of Mexborough (1843–1916).

They are notable as the first significant barrier on the River Teifi that salmon and migratory seatrout encounter on their return to their home river as they make their way upstream to spawn. Because of this, and the very attractive setting of the falls in a natural wooded valley, the falls have become a significant visitor attraction in Ceredigion, including in the autumn when the fish can be watched leaping up the falls. A dramatic painting of the falls was made by Frank Miles and is now at Nottingham City Museum. Miles's father inherited Cardigan Priory from his father, Philip John Miles, but lived in Nottinghamshire as Rector of Bingham. The less well-known Henllan Falls a few miles upstream of Cenarth provides similar opportunities to watch fish migration. In the 19th and early 20th centuries a leat drew water from behind the falls to power a watermill situated just upstream of the falls on the southern bank.

K., and L. M. Cohen. \\"Fluid mechanics, 638 pp.\\" Academic, Calif (1990).) is a wave in the ocean, which is affected by gravity and Earth's rotation (see Coriolis effect). For a non-rotating fluid, shallow water waves are affected only by gravity (see Gravity wave), where the phase velocity of shallow water gravity wave (c) can be noted as : c = (gH)^{1/2} and the group velocity (cg) of shallow water gravity wave can be noted as : c_\\\\mathrm{g}=(gH)^{1/2} i.e. c=c_\\\\mathrm{g} where g is gravity, λ is the wavelength and H is the total depth.  Derivation  When the fluid is rotating, gravity waves with a long enough wavelength (discussed below) will also be affected by rotational forces. The linearized, shallow-water equations with a constant rotation rate, f0, are Vallis, Geoffrey K. Atmospheric and oceanic fluid dynamics: fundamentals and large-scale circulation. Cambridge University Press, 2006. : \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} - f_0v = -g\\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial x}, : \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial t} + f_0u = -g\\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial y}, : \\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial t} + H(u_x+v_y) = 0, where u and v are the horizontal velocities and h is the instantaneous height of the free surface. Using Fourier analysis, these equations can be combined to find the dispersion relation for Sverdrup waves: : \\\\omega^2 = f_0^2 + gH(k^2 + l^2), where k and l are the wavenumbers associated with the horizontal and vertical directions, and \\\\omega is the frequency of oscillation.  Limiting Cases  There are two primary modes of interest when considering Poincaré waves: * Short wave limit : (k^2 + l^2) \\\\gg \\\\frac{f_0^2}{gH} \\\\qquad \\\\textrm{or} \\\\qquad (k^2+l^2) \\\\gg L_D^{-1}, where L_D = \\\\frac{(gH)^{1/2}}{f_0} is the Rossby radius of deformation. In this limit, the dispersion relation reduces to the solution for a non-rotating gravity wave. * Long wave limit : (k^2 + l^2) \\\\ll \\\\frac{f_0^2}{gH} \\\\qquad \\\\textrm{or} \\\\qquad (k^2+l^2) \\\\ll L_D^{-1}, which looks like inertial oscillations driven purely by rotational forces. = Solution for the one-dimensional case = For a wave traveling in one direction ( l = 0 ), the horizontal velocities are found to be equal to : u = \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{kH}H_0\\\\cos(kx-\\\\omega t) : v = \\\\frac{f_0}{kH}H_0\\\\sin(kx-\\\\omega t). This shows that the inclusion of rotation will cause the wave to develop oscillations at 90° to the wave propagation at the opposite phase. In general, these are elliptical orbits that depend on the relative strength of gravity and rotation. In the long wave limit, these are circular orbits characterized by inertial oscillations.

Design  There were 3 main designs proposed for this ship class, the 1938 design, the 1939 design and the 1940 design. The 1940 design was slightly larger and heavier however it was planned to install a slightly more powerful power plant to keep or exceed the 1938 design performance. Both main designs, along with a few design variations, planned the main artillery layout of 6-5.9 inch guns in 3 double turrets: one positioned on the bow and the remaining 2 on the stern. This was to allow a more offensive retreat, as these vessels were designed to scout ahead of the Plan Z battle groups. A design designated as 1939 introduced the plan to carry a sea plane in the mid ship area and no torpedoes to facilitate this. The catapult was suggested to be mounted between the 2 funnels of the design, however there never seemed to be line drawings, or blueprints that actually reflect this fact.  Construction  The first 3 ships were ordered in February 1941, these were designated SP1, SP2, and SP3, and formally named Z40, Z41, and Z42. The order was placed for the Germania Shipyard in Kiel to build these vessels. In December 1941, 3 engines for SP4, SP5 and SP6 were ordered but not the ships. SP1 was the only ship for which the keel was laid down and actual construction started. During an air raid in April 1942 the ship plans were destroyed and construction was halted. The metal was scrapped and used to build submarines and regular destroyers that were already further along in their build programs.

Silmarilli, radiance of pure light) are three fictional brilliant jewels composed of the unmarred light of the Two Trees in J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. The Silmarils were made out of the crystalline substance silima by Fëanor, a Noldorin Elf, in Valinor during the Years of the Trees. The Silmarils play a central role in Tolkien's book The Silmarillion, which tells of the creation of Eä (the universe) and the beginning of Elves, Men, and Dwarves. Fictional history  Tolkien describes the history of the Silmarils in his book The Silmarillion, published after but in fiction long preceding the events of The Lord of the Rings. Fëanor, son of Finwë, created the Silmarils—\\"the most renowned of all the works of the Elves\\"—from the light of the Two Trees. The Silmarils were hallowed by Varda, so that they would burn the hands of any evil creature or mortal who touched them without justly deserving possession. Together with the evil spider Ungoliant, the rebellious Vala Melkor destroyed the Two Trees. Later, at the healing effort of the Valar, one of the trees bore a silver flower, and the other bore a golden fruit before their death. They were sent to the sky, and became the Sun and the Moon, to illuminate Middle-earth against Melkor. But neither sphere radiated the original light of the trees, that was free of Ungoliant's poison. The Silmarils then contained all the remaining unmarred light of the Two Trees. Therefore, the Valar entreated Fëanor to give them up so they could restore the Trees, but he refused. Then news came that Melkor had killed Fëanor's father Finwë, the High King of the Noldor, and stolen the Silmarils. After this deed, Melkor fled from Valinor to his fortress Angband in the north of Middle-earth. Thereafter he wore the Silmarils in his Iron Crown. Fëanor was furious at Melkor, whom he named Morgoth, \\"Dark Enemy of the World\\", and at the Valar's desire to take the gems for their own purposes. Together with his sons he swore the Oath of Fëanor, which bound them to fight anyone who withheld the Silmarils from them. This terrible oath resulted in much future trouble including mass murder and the war of Elf against Elf. Fëanor led many of the Noldor back to Middle-earth. His flight, which occurred during the First Age of Middle-earth, led to no end of grief for the Elves and eventually for the Men of Middle-earth. Five major battles were fought in Beleriand, but ultimately the Noldor and all the people who took the oath failed in their attempt to regain the Silmarils from Morgoth. One of the Silmarils was recovered by Beren and Lúthien through great peril and loss, when Lúthien sent Morgoth to sleep with her singing and Beren cut it from his crown. The werewolf Carcharoth attacked them as they left Angband and swallowed Beren's hand containing the Silmaril, and this drove Carcharoth mad. He was later killed by Huan the Hound, who died from his wounds, and Mablung cut the Silmaril out. It was later taken to the Valar in the West by Eärendil, son of Tuor and Idril and husband of Elwing: heir of Beren and Lúthien, as a token of repentance. The Valar then set this Silmaril as a star in the sky. The other two gems remained in Morgoth's hands, and were taken from him by a servant of Manwë at the end of the War of Wrath. However, soon afterwards, they were stolen by Fëanor's two remaining sons, Maedhros and Maglor, as they tried to fulfil the oath they had sworn so many years before. But the jewels burned their hands, in denial of their rights of possession, as they had burned Morgoth's hands before. In agony, Maedhros threw himself and his Silmaril into a fiery pit, and Maglor threw his Silmaril into the sea.Maglor Casts a Silmaril into the Sea as illustrated by Ted Nasmith Thus the Silmarils remain in the ocean, the earth, and the sky—their light present but inaccessible to those in Middle-earth. According to a prophecy of Mandos, following Melkor's final return and defeat in the Dagor Dagorath (Battle of Battles), the world will be changed and the Silmarils will be recovered by the Valar. Then Fëanor will be released from the Halls of Mandos and give Yavanna the Silmarils and she will break them and with their light she will revive the Two Trees, the Pelóri Mountains will be flattened and the light of the Two Trees will fill the world in eternal bliss. This concept appears in Tolkien's manuscripts that were published by his son Christopher in The Shaping of Middle-earth but was not implemented in the published Silmarillion. Origins Sigelwara etymologies, leading to \\"Silmaril\\" and other Middle-earth concepts. The idea of the Silmaril is connected to Tolkien's exploration of the Old English word Sigelwara, which was used in the Old English Codex Junius to mean \\"Aethiopian\\". Tolkien wondered why the Anglo-Saxons should have had a word with this meaning, and conjectured that it had once meant something else, which he explored in his essay \\"Sigelwara Land\\".J. R. R. Tolkien, \\"Sigelwara Land\\" Medium Aevum Vol. 1, No. 3. December 1932 and Medium Aevum Vol. 3, No. 2. June 1934. He stated that Sigel meant \\"both sun and jewel\\", the former as it was the name of the Sun rune *sowilō (ᛋ), the latter ... from Latin sigillum, a seal. He decided that Hearwa was related to Old English heorð, \\"hearth\\", and ultimately to Latin carbo, \\"soot\\". He suggested this implied a class of demons \\"with red-hot eyes that emitted sparks and faces black as soot\\". The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey states that this contributed to the sun-jewel Silmarils, \\"helped to naturalise the Balrog\\" (a demon of fire), while the Aethiopians suggested to Tolkien the Haradrim, a dark southern race of men. Reception Shippey comments that the Silmarils relate to the book's theme in a particular way: the sin of the elves is not human pride, as in the Biblical fall, but their \\"desire to make things which will forever reflect or incarnate their own personality\\". This elvish form of pride leads Fëanor to forge the Silmarils, and, Shippey suggests, led Tolkien to write his fictions: \\"Tolkien could not help seeing a part of himself in Fëanor and Saruman, sharing their perhaps licit, perhaps illicit desire to 'sub-create'.\\" The critic Jane Chance Nitzsche views the Silmarils as \\"created things misused by their creators\\", like indeed the One Ring in The Lord of the Rings; and like it, they give their name to their book and help \\"to unify the entire mythology\\". She sees the theme as straightforwardly Biblical, the Silmarils symbolising \\"the same desire for knowledge of good and evil witnessed in the Garden of Eden.\\" See also * Rings of Power Notes References Sources Category:Middle-earth rings and jewels Category:Fictional gemstones and jewelry de:Gegenstände in Tolkiens Welt#Die Silmaril ","title":"Silmarils"},{"id":"23141613","title":"Rufus Norris"},{"id":"23141623","text":"Noor ul Mashaikh Sayyid Ahamed Muhyuddeen Noori Shah Jeelani Arabic: (حضرة سيد أحمد محي الدين نوري شاه الجيلاني) was a renowned 20th century, Muslim Sufi, Wali, Mystic, Orator, Faqeeh, Theologian, Mujaddid and highly acclaimed Islamic scholar of the Qadri, Chisti order from the Indian sub continent.

The Sejm cross hangs above the door on the left-hand side of the rostrum in the Sejm Plenary Hall. It was hung there by a Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS) MP Tomasz Wójcik and his colleague in the night between October 19 and 20 1997, shortly after the AWS and the Freedom Union signed a coalition agreement. The cross was a gift from the mother of Fr. Jerzy Popieluszko, priest and martyr murdered by the Służba Bezpieczeństwa (communist political police) in 1984. The spokesman of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) protested against the presence of the cross in the Sejm, saying that it was hung there in order to provoke a brawl. Other opponents called it a violation of the Constitution (which came into effect two days before the act) which states that the Republic of Poland is neutral in religious matters. Nobody disputed the fact that the hanging of the cross was illegal - Wójcik got into the Sejm chamber without any approval and other MPs had never discussed about that topic before. Nonetheless the cross has been hanging in the chamber ever since - even when the Democratic Left Alliance won the elections in 2001.

History The Tyne was crossed by two ferries called the east (at the location of the present bridge) and the west boats (Warden Bridge). As a result of persistent agitation a bridge was started in 1767 and completed in 1770. A map of 1769 by W. Armstrong shows the bridge to the west of Hexham close by the present Old Bridge End farm. It was built by a Mr. Gait and consisted of seven arches. Less than a year later it was swept away in the great Tyne flood of 1771. In that flood eight bridges shared the fate of Hexham. In 1774 a new attempt was made fifty yards to the west by Mr. Wooler, an engineer who had been working on the new Newcastle bridge. Piles were sunk to carry the piers but work was abandoned on discovering that the \\"soil beneath the gravel was a quicksand with no more resistance than chaff\\".

Plot When Trace Jordan's brother is murdered and several of their horses stolen, Trace sees by the tracks that three men are involved. One man wears Mexican spurs, one walks with a limp, and one smokes cheroots. Upon arriving in the town of Esperanza, Trace sees a destroyed sheriff's office and discovers the only law in Esperanza is Joe Sutton. He also discovers that the stolen horses have been rebranded with the Sutton brand, and their riders who match the description of their tracks work for Sutton. Trace enters Joe Sutton's (Ray Teal) ranch and wounds him in a shooting. The enraged Sutton sends his son Jack (Skip Homeier), his foreman Ben (Claude Akins) and ten ranch hands to track down Trace before he goes to an Army fort to bring law to Esperanza. Wounded in his escape, Trace is helped by courageous half Mexican woman named Maria Colton (Natalie Wood). Unable to locate the hidden Trace, Joe Sutton enlists a half Indian tracker Jacob Lantz (Eduard Franz). Production Louis L'Amour said he wrote the novel for Gary Cooper and Katy Jurado. Jurado tried to buy film rights to the novel. L'Amour's novel Hondo had been successfully filmed with John Wayne in 1953 and there was interest in The Burning Hills.

History  Plug’n’ Play band was formed in Novi Sad, in November, 2002. Initial band members were guitarist/vocalist Goran Beg, bassist Zoran Mandić and drummer Predrag Novković (ex Porshe Lynn). Two months after the band had been formed, Vasil Tomov-Flipp was recruited as the band’s leading vocalist and Goran, while retaining the responsibility of the guitarist, accepted the new role of the supporting vocalist. As the band members were becoming more acquainted with each other, they also became more musically attuned by playing mainly interpretations of popular rock songs. Plug’n’ Play had its debut in front of a live audience in Novi Sad Night Club Enter, in April 2003. The live performance, included interpretations of the bands such as Pearl Jam, The Cult, Neurotic Outsiders, Let 3 and Supergrass. This live performance marked the end of the first phase of the band’s development. Consequently, the band decided to create its own music, which in essence was inextricably influenced by the worldly renowned aforementioned bands, including also Rage Against The Machine, Audioslave, Tool, Faith No More and many others. In autumn 2003, due to differences in musical preconceptions between the band’s leading vocalist and the rest of the band members, Flipp decided to leave, which in turn slightly delayed musical productivity of the band. Nonetheless, the band continued working without a leading vocalist until February 2004, when Srdjan Slankamenac-Slani (ex-Post Scriptum) joined the band as a new leading vocalist. After a period of rehearsals with the new vocalist, Plug’n’Play commenced with its live performances mostly in Novi Sad Night Clubs. The band with its new vocalist Slani, had its first concert as a part of manifestation named \\"Saberimo se Novosadjani\\", in NS Time club, on 3 October 2004, after which the band had a series of live performances in all prominent nightclubs of Novi Sad.  2005-2006  In February 2005, Plug’n’Play recorded their first demo cd – ‘Plug-ins’ with three songs: ‘Plug’n’Play’, ‘Friend’ and ‘Angel’ (Massive Attack cover). The demo songs were recorded at ‘Zid’ studio in S. Kamenica and at ‘Digital tone works’ studio in Rumenka by the producer Dragan Alimpijevic – Pik. In September 2005, the bend recorded a music video for the song Plug ’n’ Play. During late 2005 and early in 2006, this music clip was played on numerous local and national TV stations, as well as on the MTV Adria. In the meantime, Plug’n’Play band appeared several times as the special guest in the concerts of popular rock bends. Some of these concerts include Del Arno Band in Trema Club, dedicated to disadvantaged children (Decije selo, Sremska Kamenica), on 22 November 2005. Also, Plug’n’Play performed live as the special guest of Block Out bend, in Gradiliste Club on 1 April 2006. Further, Plug ’n’ Play participated at the reinstated musical festival \\"String\\" in Subotica, on 18 August 2006. At the end of September 2006, Plug’n’Play played on a tour named \\"Days of Vojvidina in Istra\\" in Pula, Pazin and Buzet (Croatia), along with bands such as Zbogom Brus Lee and UMT.  Raise your voice 2007-2009  Plug’n’Play recorded its first album in 2007. The album is titled \\"Raise your voice\\" and it consists of 12 songs. The producer is yet again Dragan Alampijevic-Pik. Album release was followed by a promotion in Trema club in Novi Sad on 2 November 2007. The band recorded a video for the song \\"Was it better when it was worse\\" and got back to live performances. In 2008. Plug'n'Play started working on the material for the new album and recorded the first 5 demo tracks.  2009-present  In the early 2009. Predrag Novković left the band, and the remaining band members continued to work on a new album. In November 2009. Miloš Sremački steps in as a drummer. Two months after that the band records a new single 'The One', but shortly after that Sremački diverged. Nevertheless, the band continued working on the new album, and in June 2010 Robert Moldvaji (Grate) comes in as a permanent drummer.

Conainne was a female missionary who evangalised in the Soghain area of County Galway. She founded a church at Cell Conainne ('the church of Conainne'), modern-day Kilconnell, it appears that the name of the more widely known St Connell was by error substituted for Connainne/Dachonna after the 16th century. She may be responsible for the foundation of Tigh Dachoinne (\\"the church of Dachonna\\"), now the townland of Tiaquin, Athenry. It is thought that a children's burial ground may mark the site of the church. Furthermore, the burial ground itself is called Leacht an Óra (\\"the stone monument of adoration\\") The Martyrology of Oengus says she was of the Uí Maine, and lists her under the date 8 March, stating: This would make her a stepsister of Saint Senan. The Life of Saint Attracta states that Attracta approached her brother Bishop Conal of Drumconnell and sought permission to erect a nunnery close to his own foundation. He prevailed upon St. Conainne to request Attracta not to build in the area. St Attracta complied with her brother's wishes but was very displeased and is said to have denounced his church. The Irish terms of endearment, mo and do, were regularly added to the names of Irish saints and secular people, hence the origin of her diminutive pseudonym, Dachonna.

He won the Chilean National Prize for Literature in 1949. Biography He was the son of Absalón Prado Marín and Laura Calvo and was born October 8, 1886. His mom died when he was two years old, and his dad passed in 1905. In 1895, he was admitted to the Instituto Nacional General José Miguel Carrera where he studied the humanities until 1903. He also took elective courses in German, accounting, painting, and music. He finished the last two years of his college education at the University of Chile, in the School of Engineering. He then studied at the School of Architecture at the University of Chile for three years without earning a degree. He began exploring his interest in painting at that time, receiving lessons from Pedro Lira, a prominent Chilean artist during the 19th century. It was around this time that he traveled to northern Chile, then southern Argentina, where he married Adriana Jaramillo Bruce on January 1, 1910. That year he was elected President of the Federation of Students in Chile (FECH) and attended The Congress of Students in Buenos Aires as a delegate. He helped found the Chilean literary group Los Diez in 1914 during one of the most important Chilean intellectual movements of the twentieth century. In 1949 he was awarded the National Prize for Literature. The Writer He began writing poetry with “Flores de cardo”, a book published in 1908, which broke the mold of metric rhyme and marked the introduction of free verse in his country. In 1912, “La casa abandonada” introduced prose poetry, breaking the tradition of versified poetry and founding poetic prose. In 1913, he published “El llamado del mundo”, which was followed in 1915 by the prose poem “Los diez, el claustro, la barca”. That same year, “Los Pájaros Errantes” emerged, which is reputedly his most accomplished lyrical work, utilizing Parnassianism and symbolism. His poetic creations continued with Las Copas in 1921, Karez y Roshan in 1921, and the dramatic poem Androvar in 1925. He was a deeply philosophical novelist and his work infused creative and poetic imagery with the features of the novels popular within the region at the time. In this genre, he debuted in 1914 with “La reina de Rapa Nui”, an exotic novel where, in the guise of a simple love story, elements of Easter Island folklore are presented. In 1920, he produced his most important and well-known work: “Alsino”, a story with a mythical and philosophically relevant plot, written in prose and full of poetic and symbolic language. It tells the story of a small peasant boy who dreams of emulating Icarus; he leapt from a tree, and as a result of the rough landing, he grew a hump on his back from which wings extended, allowing him to fly just as he desired. The author called it a “romantic poem”. In 1924, he published “Un juez rural”, a realistic-folkloric novel that was, to some extent, autobiographical. It reflected the authors beliefs as to the meaning of justice, the dilemmas of those who manage it, and the extent of its consequences. As an essay writer in 1916, he wrote “Ensayo Sobre Arquitectura y Poesía”, a book in which he elaborates his architectural thought. Later, his relationship with architecture is described in “A los Estudiantes de Arquitectura,” published in 1919 in “Juventud Nº 3” magazine, as well as “Del Sacrificio y la Salvación de la Belleza,” published in the 16th edition of the same magazine, and “El arte obrero, la tradición y el porvenir, published in “Diario La Nación” on July 2, 1922. In 1924, after being asked by Arturo Alessandri, he wrote the essay “Bases para un nuevo Gobierno y un Nuevo Parlamento,” without any previous political experience. The military then wanted to declare themselves as co-authors, but was denied by Prado. In 1934, his book of sonnets was published, a genre some say he mastered. In 1935, he received the “Premio Academia de Roma,” granted by the Italian embassy. That year, he also received the Premio Municipal de Santiago. In 1949, he was given the Premio Nacional de Literatura. He was a member of the Academia Chilena de la Lengua in 1950, replacing Arturo Alessandri. However, he was not able to be inaugurated, since he died on January 31, 1952, due to a cerebral hemorrhage in his summer home in Vina del Mar. Well-Rounded Intellectual As a painter, having taken lessons with Pedro Lira, Prado devoted himself to the painting of Chilean landscapes and illustrated various publications of the time, including some of his own. In 1917 he received the Third Place Medal in Painting award at the Annual Exhibition of Fine Arts in Santiago. In 1918 he became a founding member of the National Society of Fine Arts created by Juan Francisco González. He held a showing at the Official Exhibition of Santiago in 1921, and that same year was named director of the Chilean National Museum of Fine Arts, a position which he held until 1923. In 1922 he held a showing at the Winter Exposition of the Artists’ Society of Chile in Santiago. As an architect he stressed his concern for the urban landscape, becoming a staunch critic of the planning of Santiago. While serving as director of the National Museum of Fine Arts, he directed repairs to the building and criticized the precarious conditions of its construction, which left it unfinished and with evident structural flaws only a decade after its opening. Within the museum, the Palacio Bruna stands out, an embassy and consulate of the United States. Prado represented Chile as a diplomat two times, first in 1925 for the celebration of the centennial of the Bolivian Declaration of Independence, and again in 1927 when he was appointed the Plenipotentiary Minister of Chile by Emiliano Figueroa in Colombia. He held this position until December 1928, and was awarded by Colombia with the Order of Boyaca, commander’s grade.

He scored 200 goals from 562 league appearances. Club career Phillips was born in Edmonton, London. He began his football career as an apprentice with Birmingham City, turning professional in August 1971. His first-team debut, as a substitute in the 3–2 defeat of Carlisle United in the Football League Second Division, came the same month, at the age of 17 years 17 days, which made him at the time the club's second-youngest debutant.Matthews, p. 207. He played six more games in the starting eleven before losing his place; the arrival of Bob Hatton in October meant he failed to regain it. Birmingham's promotion to the First Division, and the establishment of Hatton, Bob Latchford and Trevor Francis as the forward line of choice, gave Phillips few opportunities in the first team, though he did score his first goal, in a 4–2 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in February 1974.Matthews, pp. 208–09. After a spell on loan at Torquay United, Phillips joined Fourth Division club Northampton Town in October 1975 for a fee of £5,000. Phillips scored nine goals from his 51 league appearances for Northampton before moving on to Brentford in February 1977. In his first full season at Brentford, Phillips finished as the Football League's leading scorer with 32 goals and his partnership with Andrew McCulloch made a major contribution to the club's promotion to the Third Division. Phillips scored 69 goals from 167 appearances for Brentford and was inducted into the club's Hall of Fame in 2019. He was sold back to former club Northampton Town in August 1980 for a fee of £40,000. He scored 29 goals from 75 league games in this spell at the club, form which led to his inclusion in the PFA Fourth Division Team of the Year for the 1980–81 season. After 18 months he moved on again, this time to Southend United in March 1982, a move which meant he played 48 league games in a 46-game season: having already played 30 league games for Northampton by the time the transfer went through, he added a further 18 for Southend.Miles & Goody, p. 62. Phillips was Southend's leading scorer in each of his first three full seasons, an achievement to which was added the club's Player of the Season award in 1984–85., and He finished his Southend career with 72 goals from 182 games in all competitions, 66 from 158 in the league. He rejoined Torquay United in January 1986, and went on to play for Peterborough United and for Exeter City and Chesterfield on loan. International career When England youth team manager Tony Waiters selected Phillips for the 1973 UEFA Youth (under-18) Tournament to be staged in Italy, the Football Association asked him to reconsider, on the grounds of the player's potential for disruptive behaviour; Waiters insisted on Phillips remaining in the squad. The player showed his unhappiness at not being in the starting eleven, to the extent that Waiters threatened to send him home, but when England reached the final against their East German counterparts, Phillips came off the substitutes' bench to score the winning goal. After football In 1999, he opened a bar in Benalmádena, Spain. He later returned to England where he ran pubs. Steve is now sponsorship manager at Wellingborough Town F.C.

In 1903 his family moved to Talagante, also a small town in the area. When González Vera was 11, he travelled to Santiago to attend Liceo Valentín Letelier (Valentin Letelier High School). After one year, he could not pass his classes and quit school. At the age of 13, he starts to work: he was a painter apprentice, tailor shop assistant, bargain sale's assistant, smelting worker, hairdresser, shoeshine boy, secretary in a butcher's society, commission agent, cashier and trolley's money collector in Valparaiso. Those experiences led him to become an anarchist: \\"I was a young man when I had to work in different things to survive. This is how I met different workers who wanted to establish an igualitarian and free society, the way anarchist thinks it should be. Soon after that, I started to dream about it too, because nothing helps you the most to make up your mind about those things than youth\\" González Vera became interested in literature when he was 20. He read the work of Maxim Gorki and Peter Kropotkin, one of the most important theorist of anarchism. Right after that, he started writing to expand the ideology of \\"giving a righter order to society\\". José Santos was the founder member and the writer of La Pluma (The Feather), along with Manuel Rojas; and Numen. He collaborated with Claridad (Clarity), a journal of the Student Federation of the Universidad de Chile. He also wrote for the journal Atenea, in the city of Concepcion.

The wizards in J. R. R. Tolkien's fiction were powerful angelic beings, Maiar, who took the form of Men to intervene in the affairs of Middle-earth in the Third Age, after catastrophically violent direct interventions by the Valar, and indeed by the one god Eru Iluvatar, in the earlier ages. Two wizards, Gandalf the Grey and Saruman the White, largely represent the order, though a third wizard, Radagast, appears briefly. Saruman sets out as the head of the White Council, but falls to the temptation of power. He imitates and is to an extent the double of the Dark Lord Sauron, only to become his unwitting servant. Gandalf ceaselessly assists the Company of the Ring in their quest to destroy the Ring and defeat Sauron. He forms the double of Saruman, as Saruman falls and is destroyed, while Gandalf rises and takes Saruman's place as the White wizard. Gandalf resembles the Norse god Odin in his guise as Wanderer. He has been described as an angelic being, and as a figure of Christ. All three named wizards appear in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit film trilogies. Commentators have stated that they operate more physically and less spiritually than the wizards in Tolkien's novels, but that this is mostly successful in furthering the drama. Maiar The wizards of Middle-earth are Maiar: spirits similar to the godlike Valar, but lesser in power. Outwardly resembling Men but possessing much greater physical and mental power, they are called Istari (Quenya for \\"Wise Ones\\") by the Elves. They were sent by the Valar to assist the free peoples of Middle-earth in the Third Age to counter the Dark Lord Sauron, a fallen Maia of great power.Unfinished Tales, \\"The Istari\\" =Names= The first three of these five wizards were named in The Lord of the Rings as Saruman \\"man of skill\\" (Rohirric), Gandalf \\"elf of the staff\\" (northern Men), and Radagast \\"tender of beasts\\" (possibly Westron). Tolkien never provided non-Elvish names for the other two; their names in Valinor are stated as Alatar and Pallando, and in Middle-earth as Morinehtar and Rómestámo.The Peoples of Middle-earth, pp. 384–385 Each wizard in the series had robes of a characteristic colour: white for Saruman (the chief and the most powerful of the five), grey for Gandalf, brown for Radagast,His name is taken from the Slavic god Radegast. and sea-blue for Alatar and Pallando. Gandalf and Saruman play important roles in The Lord of the Rings, while Radagast appears only briefly, more or less as a single plot device. He innocently helps Saruman to deceive Gandalf, who believes Radagast since he is honest, but fortuitously alerts the eagle Gwaihir to rescue Gandalf. Alatar and Pallando do not feature in the story; they are said to have journeyed far into the east after their arrival in Middle-earth. =Servants of the Valar= As the Istari were Maiar, each one served a Vala in some way. Saruman was the servant and helper of Aulë, and so learned much in the art of craftsmanship, mechanics, and metal-working, as was seen in the later Third Age. Gandalf was the servant of Manwë or Varda, but was a lover of the Gardens of Lórien, and so knew much of the hopes and dreams of Men and Elves. Radagast, servant of Yavanna, loved the things of nature, both animals and plants. As each of these Istari learned from their Vala, so they acted in Middle-earth. =Gandalf= Gandalf the Grey is a protagonist in The Hobbit, where he assists Bilbo Baggins on his quest, and The Lord of the Rings, where he is the leader of the Company of the Ring. Tolkien took the name \\"Gandalf\\" from the Old Norse \\"Catalogue of Dwarves\\" (Dvergatal) in the Völuspá; its meaning in that language is \\"staff-elf\\". As a wizard and the bearer of a Ring of Power, Gandalf has great power, but works mostly by encouraging and persuading. He sets out as Gandalf the Grey, possessing great knowledge, and travelling continually, always focused on his mission to counter Sauron. He is associated with fire, his ring being Narya, the Ring of Fire, and he both delights in fireworks to entertain the hobbits of the Shire, and in great need uses fire as a weapon. As one of the Maiar he is an immortal spirit, but being in a physical body on Middle-earth, he can be killed in battle, as he is by the Balrog from Moria. He is sent back to Middle-earth to complete his mission, now as Gandalf the White and leader of the Istari. Tolkien once described Gandalf as an angel incarnate; later, both he and other scholars likened Gandalf to the Norse god Odin in his \\"Wanderer\\" guise.Letters, #107 to Sir Stanley Unwin, 7 December 1946 Others have described Gandalf as a guide-figure who assists the protagonist, comparable to the Cumaean Sibyl who assisted Aeneas in Virgil's The Aeneid, or to Virgil himself in Dante's Inferno; and as a Christ-figure, a prophet. =Saruman= Saruman the White is leader of the Istari and of the White Council, in The Hobbit and at the outset in The Lord of the Rings. However, he desires Sauron's power for himself and plots to take over Middle-earth by force, remodelling Isengard along the lines of Sauron's Dark Tower, Barad-Dur. Saruman's character illustrates the corruption of power; his desire for knowledge and order leads to his fall, and he rejects the chance of redemption when it is offered. The name Saruman means \\"man of skill or cunning\\" in the Mercian dialect of Anglo-Saxon; he serves as an example of technology and modernity being overthrown by forces more in tune with nature. =Radagast= Radagast the Brown appears briefly in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. His role is so slight that it has been described as a plot device. He played a more significant part in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit film series. Some aspects of his characterisation were invented for the films, but the core elements of his character, namely communing with animals, skill with herbs, and shamanistic ability to change his shape and colours, are as described by Tolkien. Unusually among Middle-earth names, Radagast is Slavic, the name of a god. Significance Tolkien stated that the main temptation facing the wizards, and the one that brought down Saruman, was impatience. It led to a desire to force others to do good, and from there to a simple desire for power.Letters #181 to Michael Straight, January or February 1956 The Tolkien scholar Marjorie Burns writes that while Saruman is an \\"imitative and lesser\\" double of Sauron, reinforcing the Dark Lord's character type, he is also a contrasting double of Gandalf, who becomes Saruman as he \\"should have been\\", after Saruman fails in his original purpose. Charles Nelson writes that although evil is personified in Sauron and his creatures such as Balrogs, along with Shelob and other \\"nameless things\\" deep below the mountains, evil threatens the characters from within, and the moral failures of those such as Saruman, Boromir, and Denethor endanger the world. Nelson notes that in a letter, Tolkien stated that \\"Myth and fairy-story must, as all art, reflect and contain in solution elements of moral and religious truth (or error), but not explicit, not in the known form of the primary 'real' world.\\"Letters #131 to Milton Waldman, late 1951 Each race exemplified one of the Seven Deadly Sins, for instance Dwarves embody greed, Men pride, Elves envy. In this scheme, the Wizards represent the angels sent by god, or as Tolkien wrote \\"Emissaries (in the terms of this tale from the Far West beyond the Sea)\\".Letters #1144 to Naomi Mitchison, 25 April 1954 Pride is the greatest of the Sins, and affects the wizards who take the shape of Men. Saruman, like Lucifer, is overwhelmed by pride and vainglory, just as Denethor is. Nelson states that Saruman's argument for the need for power \\"definitely echoes\\" Hitler's rationalisations for the Second World War, despite Tolkien's claims to the contrary.The Fellowship of the Ring, Foreword to the Second Edition The critic Patrick Curry rebuts the \\"common criticism\\" of Tolkien, levelled by literary critics such as the scholars of English literature Catherine Stimpson, that his characters are naively either good or evil. Curry writes that far from being \\"seemingly incorruptible\\" as Stimpson alleges, evil emerges among the wizards. William Senior contrasts Tolkien's wizards as angelic emissaries with those in Stephen R. Donaldson's The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant (published 1977–2013), who are simply human. In Senior's view, where Tolkien used myth and a medieval hierarchy of orders of being, with wizards higher than Elves who are higher than Men, Donalson's Lords are \\"wholly human\\" and \\"function democratically\\". Adaptations Christopher Lee played Saruman in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit as \\"a powerfully haunted and vindictive figure\\". Three wizards appear in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit film trilogies: Saruman, portrayed by Christopher Lee; Gandalf, portrayed by Ian McKellen; and Radagast, portrayed by Sylvester McCoy. The critic Brian D. Walter writes that the films seek to make Gandalf a powerful character without having him take over the Fellowship's strategy and action. As in the novels, Gandalf is \\"an oddly ambivalent presence, extraordinarily powerful and authoritative ..., but also a stranger, the only one of the Istari who never settles down\\". On screen, Gandalf is necessarily \\"less remote, less liminal, more bodily present\\", less like an angelic spirit than in Tolkien, but in Walter's view this benefits the films' dramatic tension and helps to bring out many other characters. Still, he appears more as a magical than a heroic figure, for example when the Fellowship is attacked by wargs in Hollin, where he uses words and a firebrand rather than drawing his sword Glamdring. Brian Rosebury calls the film Saruman \\"incipiently Shakespearean ... [with] the potential to rise to a kind of tragic dignity\\"; he considers that Christopher Lee attains a suitable presence as \\"a powerfully haunted and vindictive figure, if less self-deluding than Tolkien's\\", even if the film version of the verbal confrontation with Gandalf fails to rise to the same level. Kristin Thompson notes that the wizards' staffs are more elaborate in the films; their tips are \\"more convoluted\\" and can hold a crystal, which can be used to produce light. Rosebury considers the staff-battle between Gandalf and Saruman in Orthanc \\"absurd\\", breaking the spell of the film in The Fellowship of the Ring, and coming \\"uncomfortably close\\" to the light-sabre fights in Star Wars.
