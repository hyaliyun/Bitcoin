The road is particularly notable for the \\"imposing mansions\\" that existed in the Germantown neighborhood in Philadelphia. The road was left in ruins after the British destroyed it in the Revolutionary War during the 1777 Battle of Germantown, and was not rebuilt until 1809. Portions of Germantown Pike were signed as U.S. Route 422 (US 422) before the latter was rerouted along a freeway alignment to King of Prussia. Route description =Montgomery County= Germantown Pike westbound in Plymouth Meeting Germantown Pike begins at an intersection with Ridge Pike in Lower Providence Township, Montgomery County a short distance east of the Perkiomen Bridge that carries Ridge Pike over the Perkiomen Creek into the borough of Collegeville.

History Battle marker at the Lutheran Seminary on Germantown Avenue What is now Germantown Pike was originally a cart road dating back to 1687 that ran from Philadelphia northwest to Germantown and Plymouth Meeting. The Germantown Pike was built as a turnpike by the Germantown and Perkiomen Turnpike Company, with construction on the road beginning in 1801. The turnpike began at 3rd and Vine streets in Philadelphia and continued northwest to the east end of the Perkiomen Bridge in Collegeville, with milestones making the distance from Philadelphia along the road. The Germantown and Perkiomen Turnpike Company completed construction of the road in 1804. In 1870, the Germantown and Perkiomen Turnpike Company was taken over by the city of Philadelphia and the tolls were removed. When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, the portion of Germantown Pike between Sandy Hill Road in Plymouth Meeting and Philadelphia was designated as Legislative Route 145. The portion of Germantown Pike from Sandy Hill Road to Philadelphia was designated as US 120 when the U.S. Highway System was created in 1926; US 120 was designated concurrent with PA 13. In 1927, US 422 replaced the US 120/PA 13 designation along this stretch of Germantown Pike. In the 1930s, Germantown Pike and Germantown Avenue between Church Road in Barren Hill and Chew Street in Philadelphia was signed as part of US 422 Byp. while US 309 was cosigned with US 422 Byp. along Germantown Avenue in Philadelphia between Bethlehem Pike and Allens Lane. Germantown Pike was widened to a multilane road between Barren Hill and Philadelphia during the 1940s. In the 1940s, US 422 replaced the US 422 Byp. designation along the road while US 309 Truck was designated onto Germantown Avenue in Philadelphia between US 309 (Allens Lane) and US 1 Byp./US 13 Byp. (Hunting Park Avenue). In the 1950s, US 309 was realigned off Germantown Avenue, the US 309 Truck designation was removed, and US 422 switched alignments with US 422 Alt. east of Barren Hill; this resulted in US 422 Alt. being designated along Germantown Pike and Germantown Avenue between Church Road in Barren Hill and Washington Lane in Philadelphia. In the 1960s, US 422 was realigned to follow Germantown Pike and Germantown Avenue between Ridge Pike near Collegeville and Washington Lane in Philadelphia. The route was realigned off its former alignment through Norristown along Ridge Pike, Airy Street, and Sandy Hill Road and was realigned off Ridge Pike and Ridge Avenue into Philadelphia, replacing the US 422 Alt. designation. On May 23, 1984, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved realigning US 422 to a freeway alignment between west of Pottstown and US 202 in King of Prussia, removing the US 422 designation from Germantown Pike and Germantown Avenue.

The film was screened primarily at LGBTQ film festivals in 2003 and 2004. Using archival performance footage, still photographs, and interviews with many women involved in the early years and heyday of women's music, Radical Harmonies presents a history of the genre that one scholar has described as \\"the soundtrack for the cultural arm of radical feminism\\". The film depicts \\"women's music as both a cultural network comprising visual arts, dance, theater, and music, and as a utopian vision of women's community\\". The interviewees include not only women's music pioneers such as Cris Williamson, Holly Near, Linda Tillery, Mary Watkins, Ferron, Alix Dobkin and Bernice Johnson Reagon but also festival producers, concert promoters, sound engineers, sign language interpreters, dancers, comedians, choral conductors, photographers, journalists, record distributors, and record label executives who were part of the cultural movement that was essentially unknown to mainstream audiences. Younger musicians and bands such as Toshi Reagon, Ubaka Hill, Bitch and Animal, and Tribe 8 are also featured, as well as interviews with mainstream artists Amy Ray and Ani DiFranco who \\"insist on the importance of the women's music movement to their own careers\\". The documentary is a Woman Vision film. Director Mosbacher, a lesbian feminist activist filmmaker and psychiatrist, established Woman Vision as a nonprofit organization \\"to promote equal treatment of all people through the production and use of educational media\\". Musicians involved in the film's production include June Millington as associate director, Margie Adam as associate producer, and Judith Casselberry as production consultant. Synopsis Radical Harmonies opens with some of the film's participants answering the question \\"What is women's music?\\" and makes the point that there is not a single definition of the genre. The film next puts the women's music movement into historical context by linking it to second-wave feminism as well as the civil rights, peace, and labor movements of the 1960s and 1970s in the United States. It discusses the sexism that pervaded the male-dominated music industry in the 1970s, and the struggle of the women's music movement with homophobia within both the larger society as well as the feminist movement. Interviews are conducted with some of the women involved with the sound, lighting, recording, production and record distribution industries, as well as the founding of Olivia and Redwood Records. The origins and scope of women's music festivals is documented, and they are described in the film's narration as \\"the heart and soul of the movement\\". The film discusses contributions in the area of accessibility from women's music events to the larger society, recognizing that \\"sliding scale ticket prices, sign-language interpreters, and wheelchair access … were first instituted in the women's music movement\\". The broadening of the focus of women's music from \\"white girls with guitars\\" to include more women of color and to incorporate other musical genres such as \\"classical, choral, jazz and improvisation, rhythm and blues, indigenous, non-Western, punk, rock, and nonvocal genres\\" as well as performance genres such as comedy, dance, and theater is detailed. The film discusses separatism and women-only spaces at some music festivals, and tells the \\"terrifying and inspirational tale\\" of two women's \\"efforts to launch Camp Sister Spirit and the Gulf Coast Women's Festival in Ovett, Mississippi\\". The women's music response to homophobia in general and specifically the anti-gay rights crusades of Anita Bryant in the mid-1970s is covered. The film ends with interviews and performance segments from a younger, more radical generation of women's music performers, and a \\"cross-generational conversation among the musicians themselves\\". =Interviewees= The following musicians or others involved in the women's music cultural network are named and seen onscreen in an interview setting, usually for small amounts of screen time. *Amy Ray *Alix Dobkin *Amy Horowitz *Ani DiFranco *Barbara Price *Bernice Johnson Reagon *Bitch and Animal *Boden Sandstrom *Bonnie J.

As of December 2018, there are no reviews or scores collected on Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic. Scholarly books and journals in general praise the film for its \\"archival function\\" and \\"impassioned testimony\\" in documenting an important aspect of American lesbian culture from the early 1970s to the late 1990s. The film was described by some critics as \\"long-awaited\\" and \\"celebratory\\", containing \\"dazzling concert footage\\", and as \\"an impressively comprehensive look at a unique and influential musical subculture\\". In her book Songs in Black and Lavender, musicologist Eileen Hayes states that \\"in part because of its medium, celebratory tone, and rockist frame, Sandstrom and Mosbacher's film will dictate the way women's music is perceived for decades to come\\". But scholars also criticize the filmmakers for shying away from a \\"deeper analysis\\" of the \\"persistent conflicts around racism and separatism\\" within the culture of women's music. Multiple scholarly critics noted the complete absence within the film of any mention of the \\"women-born-women-only policy\\" or \\"anti-trans policy\\" at the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, despite that controversy generating annual protests outside of the festival site beginning in 1991. Reviews in the mainstream, alternative, and gay press are also mixed, with male reviewers somewhat less enthusiastic about the film than female reviewers. Dennis Harvey wrote in Variety that the film is a \\"whirlwind tour through three decades of mostly lesbian-targeted, folk rocking 'women's music' \\" and \\"is entertaining on its own terms, but offers little for those not already well-acquainted with this musical scene\\". In the Chicago Reader, reviewer Patrick McGavin wrote \\"Although visually and formally plain, the work is enlivened by expressive performances from Holly Near, Ronnie Gilbert, and Sweet Honey in the Rock that showcase the liberating power of the music\\". The Washington, D.C. gay newspaper Metro Weekly review gave the film five out of five stars, with reviewer Nancy Legato writing \\"In the sheer volume of footage and inclusion of voices, Mosbacher … has managed a huge accomplishment\\". In two different newspapers in Miami, a male reviewer deemed the film \\"mildly compelling\\", while a female reviewer described it as \\"lively\\", \\"bursting with terrific live clips\\" and featuring \\"insightful interviews\\". A review in Library Journal, which helps librarians with purchasing decisions, concluded with \\"strongly recommended for all women's studies and music collections\\". As of December 2018, the film is held in 227 libraries worldwide. Screenings The film was shown primarily at LGBTQ film festivals in the United States between 2003 and 2004. It has also been shown at benefits for women's organizations or other non-profit organizations, as well as at some colleges and universities, usually as part of classes or workshops on feminism, gender equality, or gay studies. *San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival (Frameline) (World premiere: June 28, 2002) *Benefit for Astraea's Lynn Campbell Memorial Fund (New York City premiere, October 21, 2002) *Screening sponsored by the Women's Studies Department, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (November 23, 2002) *London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival (April 3, 2003) *Miami Gay and Lesbian Film Festival (April 27, 2003) *Boston Gay and Lesbian Film Festival (May 2, 2003) *Connecticut Gay & Lesbian Film Festival (June 6, 2003) *Seattle International Film Festival (June 7, 2003) *Fundraising benefit for ImageOut: The Rochester Lesbian and Gay Film & Video Festival (June 19, 2003) *Outfest Los Angeles (July 2003) *Nashville Gay and Lesbian Film Festival (September 2003) *Milwaukee LGBT Film & Video Festival (October 11, 2003) *Pittsburgh International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival (October 24, 2003) *Paris Cineffable International Lesbian and Feminist Film Festival (November 8 and 9, 2003) *St. Louis International Film Festival (November 15, 2003) *Minneapolis/St. Paul LGBT Film Festival (November 17, 2003) *Reeling 2003: The Chicago Lesbian and Gay International Film Festival (November 2003) *Benefit for the Institute for the Musical Arts (IMA)'s Rock 'n' Roll Camp for Teen Girls Scholarship Fund (February 15, 2004) *Southern Arizona Wingspan LGBT Film Festival (March 7, 2004) *Kingston ReelOut Queer Film and Video Festival (March 10, 2004) *Reykjavik Gay and Lesbian Film Festival (March 13, 2004) *Women in the Director's Chair International Film & Video Festival (March 20, 2004) *Boston Gay and Lesbian Film Festival (May 8, 2004) *Knoxville Heritage Night (May 26, 2004) *Kalamazoo YWCA (June 13, 2006) *Kalamazoo Public Library (March 29, 2007) *Kunst Kultur Frauenfeste Clubnächte, Vienna Austria (April 16, 2009) *Benefit for the Women's Museum of California at Art Rocks Film, San Diego (August 16, 2015) Awards *2002: Won Best Documentary (audience award) at the 26th San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival *2003: Won the audience award for Outstanding Soundtrack at Outfest, the Los Angeles LGBT film festival References External links  Category:2002 films Category:2002 documentary films Category:2002 independent films Category:2002 LGBT-related films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American documentary films Category:American independent films Category:American LGBT- related films Category:Documentary films about lesbians Category:Documentary films about music and musicians Category:Documentary films about the music industry Category:Women's music ","title":"Radical Harmonies"},{"id":"59644882","text":"Children of Eve is a 1915 silent film directed by John H.

An article in the Transactions of the Thoroton Society referred to John Otter organising ‘mass missionary meetings’ in Stokeham every June.Transactions of the Thoroton Society, Nottingham, 1972, p.102 Otter was a common family name in the area with Otters also in Rampton and Laneham – where John seems to have been born in about 1813 according to the 1851 Census. Missionary meetings were held in Stokeham every June, having started after the visit of a Dr John Hannah, a celebrated Lincoln Methodist, in 1824.Otter, John, Poetical Musings, Whiteside Retford, 1857, p.59 Otter was also a poet and in 1857 published a book of his poems called ‘Poetical Musings’. This contains Otter’s reflections on all sorts of missionary activity across the world, and especially on missionaries’ deaths. One of the poems is a reflection on the death in Fiji of Nottinghamshire missionary John Hunt – the gravestones of his wife and daughter are at Newton on Trent.Otter, John, Poetical Musings, Whiteside Retford, 1857 An eyewitness account of one of the Stokeham meetings is provided in the ‘Wesleyan Missionary Notices’ of 1872Wesleyan Missionary Notices, volume IV, London, 1872, p.94 ‘…in 1851, I was at a village called Stokeham, where good old John Otter lived. I remember going to the Anniversary at that hamlet which contained, I think, five houses and a church, and what did we see? From end to end, directly we got near the place, there were – not cabs, nothing half so grand – but carts, gigs, phaetons, waggons and all sorts of things except wheelbarrows upon which people could be brought. Then when you got to Mr Otter’s place you found him beaming, all in his element. There was a large tent erected, and there I had the honour of shaking hands with the widow, just returned, of the late Rev John Hunt. There was tea in the tent, and a capital meeting in a great barn, and they made such a fuss and disturbance that they got people to come from…twenty miles around.’ The Wesleyan Missionary Notices recorded that the 1851 meeting raised £70 for foreign missionary work, about £9,500 today.

Butler Pike continues northeast along the boundary between Plymouth Township to the northwest and Whitemarsh Township to the southeast as a two-lane undivided road, passing industrial parks and heading under Norfolk Southern's Morrisville Line (formerly the Pennsylvania Railroad's Trenton Cutoff). The road passes near residential development and intersects Plymouth Road/Flourtown Road in the community of Cold Point. From here, Butler Pike passes more homes and curves northwest to fully enter Plymouth Township as it bypasses Cold Point Hill, while Cold Point Hill Road continues northeast along the township line. Butler Pike makes a sharp turn to the east before curving back to the northeast, recovering its path along the township line and passing under the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 276). The road continues through wooded areas of homes and commercial development, at the Township Line Road intersection becoming the boundary between Whitpain Township to the northwest and Whitemarsh Township to the southeast. The road runs through wooded residential areas before it comes to an intersection with PA 73 in an area of businesses in the community of Broad Axe. Following this intersection, Butler Pike continues northeast through a mix of fields, woods, and homes. The road curves east- northeast to fully enter Whitemarsh Township before it heads northeast into Upper Dublin Township and crosses Morris Road as it heads into forested areas. The road crosses the Wissahickon Creek and enters the borough of Ambler, where the name changes to West Butler Avenue. The roadway heads east-northeast through commercial areas before it crosses SEPTA's Lansdale/Doylestown Line at-grade north of Ambler station. At this point, West Butler Avenue heads into the commercial downtown of Ambler. At the Main Street intersection, the road becomes East Butler Avenue and runs through more of the downtown area. The road heads northeast past more businesses before it runs through residential areas. On the eastern border of Ambler, the road comes to an intersection with Bethlehem Pike. Upon crossing Bethlehem Pike, Butler Pike leaves Ambler for Upper Dublin Township and passes through residential areas, coming to an intersection with Susquehanna Road in the community of Rose Valley. Butler Pike reaches a partial interchange with the PA 309 freeway, with access to northbound PA 309 and access from southbound PA 309; the missing movements are provided via an interchange with Susquehanna Road. Past the PA 309 interchange, the road continues northeast through wooded residential areas and comes to a junction with Norristown Road in the community of Three Tuns. From here, Butler Pike passes more residential neighborhoods as it heads into Maple Glen, where it intersects PA 63 and crosses into Horsham Township. Butler Pike runs through wooded areas of homes and comes to its terminus at an intersection with PA 152. History Offset intersection of Butler Pike (foreground) and Germantown Pike in Plymouth Meeting The route was laid out in 1712 by Simon Butler (1684–1764), a Bucks County miller and justice of the peace, for whom the road was later named. It provided access to the Schuylkill River at Matson's Ford (Conshohocken), and facilitated communication among the Quaker meeting houses in Plymouth Meeting, Upper Dublin, Horsham, and central Bucks County. In the early 19th century, Butler Pike became part of a route used in the Underground Railroad. For more than 20 years, George and Martha Maulsby Corson sheltered fugitive slaves in their house at the corner of Germantown and Butler pikes. The Underground Railroad stops were located apart, and under cover of darkness a conductor would escort the enslaved to the next stop. Two sections of Butler Pike were converted into turnpikes in the mid-19th century—the Whitemarsh and Plymouth Turnpike, which improved the road between Germantown Pike and Conshohocken, and operated from 1849 to 1896; and the Upper Dublin and Plymouth Turnpike, which improved the road between Germantown Pike and Limekiln Pike, and operated from 1855 to 1896.

The IAM was founded on 5 July 2016 and has its headquarters in Munich, Germany. The organization was originally founded by a subset of memory competitors and organizers who had previously been involved in competitions run by the World Memory Sports Council (WMSC), the memory sport organizing body which hosted the first World Memory Championships in 1991. 45 competitors and arbiters signed their names to the initial announcement letter. The IAM carried over event structure, rankings, and titles from prior WMSC competitions. Following its inception, the IAM has maintained its own ranking system distinct from that of the WMSC. The organization describes itself as a \\"worldwide federation with the overarching vision of bringing memory sports to everybody and providing a free and democratic environment for the memory community.\\" In December 2018, the IAM elected its first board, which consists of 10 members, two from each of the five participating continents.  Competitions  The first IAM competition took place in San Diego, California in 2016, in partnership with Memory League. Its first World Memory Championship took place in Jakarta, Indonesia, in December 2017. The IAM hosted its second annual World Memory Championship in Vienna, Austria, in December 2018.\\"Top Nass official wins global memory contest\\", in GDNonline.com, December 2018. Traditional IAM events are largely identical to the events originally created by the WMSC. The World Memory Championship, for example, is a three-day competition consisting of the following 10 events: 15-minute Names & Faces, 30-minute Binary, 1-hour Numbers, 5-minute Images, 5-minute Numbers, 5-minute Dates, 1-hour Cards, 15-minute Words, Spoken Numbers, and Speed Cards. In 2017, the IAM replaced the 15-minute abstract images event used by the WMSC with a 5-minute concrete images event. The IAM has hosted championships in the US,Gary Pettus, \\"UMMC med student's memory again holds all the cards\\", in The Clarion-Ledger, January 2018.

A full listing of competitions, results, rankings, and national and world records can be found on the IAM's statistics website. Building on the WMSC model, the IAM instituted a new world ranking system, which incorporates competitors' three most recent competitions rather than only using their highest-scoring competition. The organization has also imposed a \\"levels\\" system and adjusted their metrics for the Grand Master of Memory title.  Partnerships  In addition to their traditional, 10-discipline memory championships, the IAM partners with Memory League to offer competitions which are entirely digital, have head-to-head matches, and are composed of shorter disciplines. The five Memory League disciplines are one-minute memorization of names, words, images, numbers, and cards.Joao Medeiros, \\"The science behind the best memorisers in the world\\", in Wired UK, August 2015.

He is the author of four books: Hunt Gather Cook, Duck Duck Goose, Buck Buck Moose and Pheasant Quail Cottontail, all wild game cookbooks.  Early years  Shaw was born in Westfield, New Jersey, the youngest of four children. He graduated from Stony Brook University on Long Island in 1992, then earned a master's in history from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. After an initial few years working as a line cook and sous chef in restaurants in Madison, Wisconsin, Shaw became a newspaper reporter, first for the Madison Times weekly newspaper, then to a series of weeklies on Long Island, including the Islip Bulletin and the Suffolk County News. Shaw later worked at the Potomac News in Woodbridge, Virginia, then the Fredericksburg Free Lance-Star before moving to Minnesota in 2002 to work at the St. Paul Pioneer Press. His final newspaper stint was at the Stockton Record in California, where he worked until 2008 as the paper's Sacramento Bureau Chief.  Media career  = Website = Hunter Angler Gardener Cook, Shaw's wild foods website, began in 2007 and has become one of the largest sources of wild food recipes on the internet. It has won numerous awards, including the James Beard Award, and is home to more than 1100 recipes. = Television = Shaw has appeared on numerous television shows, including Andrew Zimmern’s Bizarre Foods.., Mike Rowe’s Somebody’s Gotta Do It, Steven Rinella’s Meateater, and Randy Newberg’s Fresh Tracks = Books = * Hunt, Gather, Cook: Finding the Forgotten Feast Shaw’s first book was released in 2011 by Rodale Books. It is a primer on the wild world and covers hunting, fishing and foraging. The New York Times praised the book: “In Hunt, Gather, Cook, [Shaw] makes a powerful argument for joining him in a few of those pursuits, if only to become aware of the great bounty that surrounds us in the natural world, even when we live in urban environments—and perhaps particularly then.” * Duck, Duck, Goose: Recipes and Techniques for Ducks and Geese, both Wild and Domesticated Shaw's second book was released by Ten Speed Press in October 2013. It covers all things waterfowl and was named as one of the Cookbooks of the Year in 2013 by Amazon.com. * Buck, Buck, Moose: Recipes and Techniques for Cooking Deer, Elk, Moose, Antelope and Other Antlered Things Published in September 2016, this is a comprehensive cookbook covering all forms of venison, and is the first book Shaw released via his publishing company, H&H; Books. * Pheasant, Quail, Cottontail: Upland Birds and Small Game from Field to Feast Released in March 2018, this is the latest book published by Shaw's company. It covers all the upland birds, doves, pigeons and all the small mammals commonly hunted in North America.  Awards and nominations  Shaw won numerous journalism awards in his early career, and was first nominated for a James Beard Award for Hunter Angler Gardener Cook in 2009. He was nominated again in 2010, and won the award in 2013 Shaw also won Best Blog from the International Association of Culinary Professionals in 2010 and 2011 His work was featured in the anthology Best Food Writing in 2012 and 2013.

It was started in 1983 and ceased publication in 1995. In total 27 issues were published. Contents Adventurers Club originally featured supplementary material for Champions and Espionage, as well as news from Hero Games and a letter column purportedly edited by the fictional villain Foxbat. History In 1983, Hero Games kicked off its house magazine: Adventurers Club. However, by 1986, the company was having problems with cash flow and manpower, and as a result Adventurers Club #7 (Summer 1986), which had been prepared in March 1985, was delayed for over a year while money was diverted toward other projects. As the result of a merger in 1988 between Hero Games and Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE), five issues of the magazine (#8 to #12) featured articles about both Hero and ICE games. In the 2014 book Designers & Dragons, game historian Shannon Appelcline wrote, \\"Unfortunately, fans hated the split magazine. In their final dual-branded issue, editor Aaron Allston acknowledged that half of the readers had been asking that the ICE articles be removed and the other half had been asking that only ICE articles be covered.\\" In response, Adventurers Club was once again dedicated solely to Hero games, while ICE published a tabloid magazine, Iron Crown Quarterly, which focussed only on ICE games such as Rolemaster, Spacemaster, and Middle-earth Role Playing; ICE produced seven issues of Iron Crown Quartertly from 1988–1990. Reception Allen Varney reviewed the magazine twice in the pages of Dragon: * In the October 1990 edition (Issue 162), Varney derided Adventurers Clubs claim of being a quarterly publication, pointing out that it had \\"appeared more or less annually for years.\\" Varney commented that although it \\"deserves attention for its scenarios, NPCs, gadgets and campaigning tips\\", it was \\"thin and badly printed. At $3 an issue, it's still in a wait-and-see stage.\\" * In the September 1993 edition (Issue 197), Varney again noted that the magazine had rarely appeared on time in its first decade of publication. Varney thought that even in the latest issues, \\"Style and grammar still fall short of professional standards, and four bucks an issue seems a steep price on that count, if nothing else.\\" He also noted that each individual issue might have little material for a gamemaster because \\"its coverage of all the different Hero System game genres means that any one issue may offer little for your own campaign.\\" In the Nov-Dec 1983 edition of Space Gamer (Issue No. 66), Russell Grant Collins thought that the magazine featured material essential for players of Champions, saying, \\"If you GM a Champions campaign, I really recommend this magazine. If you GM Espionage!, then it still might appeal to you. It is a worthy addition to the Hero line.\\" References Category:Defunct magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines established in 1983 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1995 Category:Quarterly magazines published in the United States Category:Role-playing game magazines ","title":"Adventurers Club (magazine)"},{"id":"59645341","text":"The World Is Not Enough (WINE) is a US project developing a refuelable steam engine system for spacecraft propulsion. WINE developed a method of extracting volatiles from ice, ice-rich regolith, and hydrated soils and uses it as steam propulsion which allows the spacecraft to refuel multiple times and have an extraordinary long service lifetime. This would allow a single spacecraft to visit multiple asteroids, comets or several landing locations at an icy world such as the Moon, Mars, Pluto, Enceladus, Ganymede, Europa, etc. The harvesting and propulsion systems were successfully tested in December 2018 on a small spacecraft prototype under simulated asteroid conditions.

The system employs a drill to mine and extract water ice from the surface soil (regolith), purify the water, and heat it to be used as compressed steam for propulsion. Refueling can be repeated indefinitely at different icy bodies within the Solar System or at multiple landing sites at icy worlds with low gravity such as Pluto, Enceladus, Europa, and the Moon. As of January 2019, development and testing are funded by NASA's Small Business Innovation Research program (SIBIR).

Vol. 359, Issue 6372, pp. 199–201. There are two versions of water harvesters being developed by Honeybee Robotics: the 'Spider System' is for landers meant to \\"walk\\" or takeoff again using steam power, and PVEx for large rovers meant to harvest and transport the water for other purposes. The water extracted is stored in a tank, and it can be used for steam propulsion or can be transported elsewhere for other uses. The Spider Water Extraction System features multiple systems integrated into spacecraft lander legs to provide higher processing volume and system redundancy. It can drill into cemented icy and mineral composites that can be as hard as concrete. The architecture enables each drill to also act as an anchoring force as they sample for water-rich material. Spider Water Extraction System. Honeybee Robotics. 2018. The stored water can be heated into steam and used to move the lander's legs as a spider does for walking, or use it as a jet thrust to fly to different landing sites or to travel to multiple icy bodies. The Planetary Volatiles Extractor (PVEx) is a variant best mounted on a large rover equipped with radioisotope thermoelectric generators. It features a double-walled coring auger with a heated inner wall to extract volatiles from ice, ice-rich regolith, and hydrated soils from icy bodies. The double-wall coring drill penetrates icy material and heats the volatile-rich core, causing water and other volatiles to turn into a gas. This gas is contained in the system and flows into a cold trap, where it condenses into a solid and can be transferred to a storage tank on another vehicle or depot. The system combines mining and extraction into one step.Planetary Volatiles Extractor. Honeybee Robotics. Accessed on 12 January 2019. It drills to a target depth, obtains a core sample, heats it up, and captures volatiles in a condenser above the surface. Once extraction is complete, the corer is retracted and the dry regolith core is left behind. Testing Initial tests in 2016 were performed in limestone and blocks of ice to evaluate mechanical aspects of the system. The PVEx variant targeted a depth of in limestone in 10 minutes and a similar depth in ice blocks in 7 minutes. Early performance tests under space analog conditions measured a water extraction efficiency of 87% while requiring extraction energy of 1.7 Whr/g; the needed power is 60 watts for 40 minutes.

Luczek, A. Paz. Honeybee Robotics. Annual Meeting of the Lunar Exploration Analysis Group (2016) To harvest 30 kg of water per day, the PVEx corer would need two MMRTG generators. For lower demands, it can use solar panels. Later in 2016, the team experimented with several mining mechanisms that were adapted to the smaller size of a WINE spacecraft. The mining tests extracted water from lunar regolith simulant that contained ice. The tests also extracted water from asteroid regolith simulant that was physically dry (containing no water or ice), because it released the water that had been locked inside the crystalline structure of its phyllosilicate minerals. Phyllosilicates are abundant in carbonaceous asteroids. This extracted asteroidal water was found to contain large amounts of dissolved carbon dioxide, metals, and organic matter due to the bulk composition of the simulated asteroid, but the team did not consider this a hindrance to steam propulsion. Based on the results, they selected the PVEX corer for additional development in an integrated WINE prototype. The team successfully tested the integrated prototype on 31 December 2018 under simulated outer space conditions of vacuum and low temperature while harvesting frozen water from simulated asteroid regolith. Steam-powered spacecraft backed by NASA could explore asteroids. Amanda Kooser, CNET. 10 January 2019. Within minutes, the microwave-sized spacecraft extracted the water from hydrated artificial regolith and took off within the vacuum chamber using steam thrusters. See the Steam-Powered Probe That Could Explore Space Forever. Techodom. 11 January 2019. The system components are expected to reach technology readiness level 5 (TRL 5) in 2019. Although the research is funded by NASA, this water- harvesting system is available to private companies to use it on asteroids, comets, the Moon, Ceres, Europa, Titan, Pluto, the poles of Mercury, or anywhere there is water and sufficiently low gravity. Power The spacecraft uses deployable solar panels to generate electrical energy for mining and making steam, or it could use radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG) to extend the potential reach of these planetary hoppers to Pluto and other locations far from the Sun.

The water is heated and allowed to escape as pressurized steam through a propelling nozzle to produce thrust. Alternatively, the steam is used to initiate mechanical movement as a steam engine.

The techno club belonged, besides the Tresor and E-Werk in Berlin, the Dorian Gray and Omen in Frankfurt, and the Munich-based clubs ', Natraj Temple and Millennium, to the most renowned clubs of Germany's 1990s techno culture. According to FazeMag, Ultraschall was \\"for many techno fans the most authentic techno club alongside the Tresor\\".  History and Description  = Origins = The origins of the club lie in the monthly Ultraworld parties on the grounds of an alternative cultural center in Munich's Oberföhring borough, which was called Kulturstation and often also hosted punk concerts. The techno club nights were inspired by the nascent techno scene in Berlin and especially the clubs Tresor and Planet at that time. Because of the popularity of the parties and the lack of ventilation, the music had to be interrupted every two hours and to open the windows in order to supply sufficient oxygen. = Ultraschall I = On 17 June 1994 the first Ultraschall club was opened by Peter Wacha, David Süss and Dorothea Zenker in the former canteen kitchen of the recently decommissioned Munich-Riem Airport. The club is regarded as the first pure techno club in Munich. Before, only infrequent raves and techno club nights had taken place at venues such as Parkcafé, Tanzlokal Größenwahn, Babalu Club, Pulverturm or Nachtwerk. At the opening gig, Jeff Mills still played in front of only 120 paying guests and decided not to charge anything, but a few months later the club took off and became a grand success. A special feature of the club was that it was completely coated with white ceramic tiles. Moreover, large parts of the club were fitted out with spaceship decorations taken from the science fiction movie The High Crusade. With such avant-garde decorations, and the overall concept of an \\"world of experience\\", where beyond the music also light installations and video art played an important role, Ultraschall achieved international fame. The crew members and resident DJs of the club included DJ Hell, Monika Kruse, Richard Bartz and Acid Maria. The parties at Ultraschall were notorious for being experimental and wild. According to Monika Kruse \\"one day the whole dancefloor was arranged as a giant bed. People came around to consume mushrooms, or just brought along their bongs with them. They all lied on the floor and chatted\\". As the area of the former Munich Airport was needed for the planned new borough Messestadt Riem, the Ultraschall I and all other clubs and halls on the compound had to close in summer 1996. = Ultraschall II = The complete party area of the Riem airport now moved to the Kunstpark Ost, a former factory site of 90.000 m² close to the Ostbahnhof train station in Munich's Berg am Laim district. Ultraschall was re-opened there by Michi Kern and colleagues in the former potato drying facility of the Pfanni factory on 13 September 1996. The new premises were much larger than the first Ultraschall and allowed to establish two dance floors. The main floor was white tiled on all four sides, subdivided by several columns and self- contained. The space, characterized by simple geometric shapes, had the ambience of an industrial production site, but due to its strong angularity it did not have the atmosphere of a warehouse club. The main floor was known for the cold clanking sound, as well as for the wooden floor which was vibrating strongly due to the basses. Due to its decoration with green flokati, the second floor became known as the Green Room. Since 1998 this room served as a home base for the popular Flokati House Club, which was initiated by Tobi Neumann and in the 2000s moved on to the Harry Klein Club when Ultraschall closed. On Saturdays, the green room served as the chill out for the Main Floor, which provided space for 1,500 people and where international acts such as Jeff Mills, Carl Craig, Jay Denham or Green Velvet played. Just as the Ultraschall I, its successor put a lot emphasis on decoration, light installations and video art by the Highflyer crew, and both incarnations of the club are considered as being some of the best decorated venues of all time. When the Kunstpark Ost party areal had to close on 31 January 2003, Ultraschall had to close as well. = DJs and Legacy = DJs and live acts who played at Ultraschall include international acts such Jeff Mills, Underground Resistance, Carl Craig, Miss Kittin, The Hacker, Blake Baxter, Robert Hood, Anthony Rother, Joey Beltram, Umek, Chris Korda, Chicks on Speed, I-F, Adam Beyer, Cari Lekebusch, Marco Carola, Ian Pooley, Cristian Vogel, John Tejada, The Advent, Jay Denham, Green Velvet, Anthony Shakir, DJ Tanith, Robert Görl, Johannes Heil, Electric Indigo, among many others. The club also launched the careers of many of its residents, some of which became important representatives of the German techno scene themselves. Famous resident DJs of Ultraschall include DJ Hell, Monika Kruse, Richard Bartz, Acid Maria and Tobi Neumann. Ultraschall and Munich-based techno labels such as International DeeJay Gigolo Records, Disko B and Kurbel Records formed a close network, and the club was used as a test platform for all new records of these labels. Further the club was used by the labels to get to know and enlist guest DJs, such as for example Blake Baxter, I-F or Abe Duque. = Successors = In the converted halls of the Ultraschall II main floor, on 12 March 2005 the Octagon club opened, after a club called Phosphor had tried a fresh start there in 2004. One part of the Ultraschall crew opened the much smaller Harry Klein Club, which can be seen as a successor of the Green Room, and became one of the world's most popular clubs as well. The other part of the Ultraschall crew opened the club Rote Sonne, which reminds of the Ultraworld and also became one of Europe's most popular techno clubs. In the 2010s, the Nox Club was the last venue that resided in the former bar area of the Ultraschall, before the factory building was demolished in January 2016, in order to create space for the planned Werksviertel working and residential district.

Pòtí: When the people below are rich, the ruler at the top will naturally be rich. 2\\\\. Chéngtí: This is so because the wealth of the ruler is something kept by the people. If the people are already rich, how can it stand to reason that the ruler alone is poor? 3\\\\. Qǐjiǎng: You Ruo spoke from profundity the idea of the oneness of the ruler and the people in his advice to Duke Ai. The implication was that the Duke's proposal to increase the taxation was due to the insufficiency of his revenues for state expenditure; to insure the sufficiency of state expenditure, then, what could take precedence over measures to insure sufficiency for his people? 4\\\\. Qǐgǔ: If, indeed, : the farming lands were tithed with a sincere wish to be thrifty in expenditure and to be considerate in showing love to the people, : the one-tenth tax on the agricultural produce were levied with no scheme to exploit the people and to seek extravagance for the person of the ruler himself; Then, : the exertions of the people would not be burdened with excessive taxations, the accumulation of the people's property would not be exhausted by undue demands; : within common households there would be enough savings and accumulation, leaving little worry over caring for parents and raising the young, : in the ordinary farms there would be abundant grains and millets, warding off the anxieties of nurturing the living and of honoring the dead. 5\\\\. Xùgû: If the people are enjoying sufficiency, for what conceivable reason should the ruler be left alone in poverty? 6\\\\. Zhōnggǔ: I know that : what was kept in the common households would all be available to the ruler, without its being hoarded in the treasury to enable the ruler to claim, \\"This is my wealth\\"; : what is stored in the farm and fields would all be accessible to the ruler, without its being accumulated in the vaults to enable the ruler to claim, \\"These are my possessions.\\" With inexhaustible availability, what worry is there for failure to respond to demand? With inexhaustible supplies, what anxiety is there for lack of preparedness in emergency? 7\\\\. Hòugǔ: The sacrificial animals and ritual cereals are plentiful to be used in religious offerings; and the jades and silks are abundant to be used as tributes and diplomatic gifts. Even if these were insufficient, the people will naturally supply them in full. Wherein will there be a shortage? Food and delicacies, beefs and drinks are abundant for entertainment of state guests; carriages and horses, arms and equipment are enough for the preparation of wars and defense. Even if these were insufficient, the people will take care of the needs. Wherein again will there be insufficiency? 8\\\\. Dàjié: Oh! The establishment of the tithe was originally for the good of the people, but in this very usage lies the sufficiency of national expenditure. Where then is there any need to increase taxation to attain national wealth?

Life Francesco Ravizza was born to a humble family in Orvieto in 1616. In that town he worked in the sewing shops of his parents, but soon he moved to Rome seeking his fortune. In Rome he succeeded to enter in the service of Olimpia Maidalchini, the powerful sister-in-law of reigning Pope Innocent X. At the death of Innocent X, Ravizza participated to the 1655 papal conclave as secretary of Cardinal Carlo Gualterio; in that conclave Ravizza used in secret to send notes out of the conclave to Olimpia Maidalchini: for this reason he was arrested and passed some time in prison till he was forgiven by the new Pope Alexander VII. Under the new Pope, Ravizza became personal secretary of the cardinal nephew Flavio Chigi. On 28 November 1661 he was appointed as referendary of the Tribunals of the Apostolic Signature of Justice and of Grace (which made him a prelate). On 31 December 1662 he entered in Chapter of St. Peter's Basilica. In 1664 Ravizza went with cardinal Flavio Chigi in his extraordinary legation in France. On July 14, 1665 he was appointed, succeeding Domenico Salvetti, prefect of the Vatican Secret Archives, an office that he never actually practiced. On February 17, 1666 he became secretary of the powerful Sacra Consulta, the most important administrative tribunal of the Papal States, a post that he held until February 22, 1668. On 19 March 1667, shortly before the death of the Pope, he was appointed titular Bishop of Sidon. The episcopal consecration followed on 20 March in St. Peter's Basilica by the hands of Cardinal Neri Corsini. During the 1667 papal conclave Ravizza schemed in favour of cardinal Angelo Celsi and during the 1669-70 papal conclave he played a hidden, but key role in supporting the Spanish faction, being however stopped by cardinal Jean François Paul de Gondi. The Treaty of Lisbon (1668) allowed the Pope to restore the ecclesiastic jurisdiction in Portugal, previously placed in hold due to the conflict between the House of Braganza and the House of Habsburg: in 1659 had died the last bishop in Portugal. On 12 August 1670 Francesco Ravizza was nominated Apostolic Nuncio to Portugal. He reached Lisboa on 4 May 1671 after had passed in Paris to obtain the support of France in negotiating with the prince-regent Peter II of Portugal. In Lisboa Ravizza performed many episcopal consecrations in order to re-establish a hierarchy there, but he found difficulties to re-establish also the ecclesiastic tribunals. He finished this diplomatic assignment on April 12, 1673, when he was replaced by the future Cardinal Marcello Durazzo. Back in Rome Ravizza was appointed secretary of Propaganda Fide. He died in Rome on 22 May 1675 and was buried in the Sacristy of St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican. A short book ascribed to the anti-Catholic Gregorio Leti describes Ravizza as a man full of plots and tricks.

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a “Mountain Treasure”.Virginia's Mountain Treasures, report issued by The Wilderness Society, May, 1999 The highlight of the area is Devils Bathtub, a pool carved into rock, in a largely remote area. There are also scenic trails and a 20-foot waterfall. This wildland is part of the Clinch Ranger District Cluster. Location and access The area is located in the Cumberland Mountains of Southwestern Virginia, about 6 miles southeast of Big Stone Gap, Virginia and 20 miles north of Kingsport, Tennessee. It is between VA722 and VA 619. Trails include: *Devils Fork Loop Trail. Forest Service Trail 210, 6.92 miles *Straight Fork Ridge Trail, Forest Service Trail 204, 1.83 miles Straight Fork Road, about two miles long, provides access into the area. Boundary of the Devils Fork wildarea as identified by the Wilderness Society.The boundary of the wildland as determined by the Wilderness Society is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Maps 789 (Clinch Ranger District). A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wildland's gps coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Cumberland Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Devil’s Fork wildarea is covered by USGS topographic map East Stone Gap. Natural history The area contains 628 acres of old growth forest, mostly white oak/red oak/hickory forest. It includes habitat for the rare magnolia warbler, as well as other neotropical migrants. Game species include black bear, which has been reintroduced into the area, deer, and turkey. Vegetation includes mixed hardwoods in higher elevations and conifers as well as rhododendron, and laurel in moist areas such as coves along river drainages. Two special biological areas are found here: the Straight Fork area on the northeastern corner, and the Good Spur Ridge area, with 200 year-old trees, on the west. Topography The area is part of the Pine and Cumberland Mountains Subsection of the Southern Cumberland Mountain Section of the Central Appalachian Broadleaf Coniferous Forest-Meadow Province. The low elevation of 1550 feet is found at the lower Straight Fork, and the height of about 3490 feet at Cox Place on Little Mountain. While Devil Fork is the main drainage, Clinch Rock Branch of Straight Creek, Roddy Branch of Valley Creek, and Stinking Creek also drain the area and are also tributaries to the Clinch River. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Devils Fork was inventoried as part of RARE II, an inventory conducted in the late 1970s. However, the Forest Service stripped the area of this designation in the 2004 Forest Plan removing protection from possible road construction and timber sales. A permit to conduct coal exploration, near the western boundary along Stinking Creek, was granted to the Sinking Creek Coal Company in 1994. While surface rights for about 80 percent of the area are in federal ownership, all of the mineral rights in the area are in private ownership. Most of the mining and prospecting in the vicinity has been primarily for coal, but iron, limestone and sandstone have been produced in nearby areas. The forest service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. The area includes land designated as “Back Country—non-motorized” for most of the area, ”Scenic Corridor” on the south, “botanical and zoological area”, “semi-primitive, non-motorized” and “Mix of Successional Habitats” on the northeast. A prescribed burn was conducted on the northeastern corner of the area around 2008.

The fourteen defendants were acquitted by an all-white jury after a two month trial.  Background  In 1983, Robert Jay Mathews founded a revolutionary white supremacist terrorist group called The Order (or The Silent Brotherhood) on his farm in Metaline, Washington. The group was formed with the goal of overthrowing the United States Federal Government, which they called \\"Zionist Occupation Government\\" (ZOG), and to establish an all-white nation in the Pacific Northwest. Mathews recruited several men from the Aryan Nations to join the group. The Order began robbing banks and armored cars in order to finance their planned revolution. Members of the group assassinated Jewish radio talk show host Alan Berg outside his Denver home on June 18, 1984. Mathews was killed in a shootout with FBI agents on Whidbey Island on December 8, 1984 and most other members of The Order were arrested thereafter. Two Order members, David Lane and Bruce Pierce, were convicted of involvement in Berg's death and several other members, including Richard Scutari and Andrew Barnhill, were given lengthy sentences for racketeering. Around the same time as The Order was active, another white supremacist group called The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord (CSA) was also plotting to overthrow the US government. The group was headquartered on a heavily armed and fortified compound in Arkansas and group established ties with other white supremacists, such as Aryan Nations leader Richard G. Butler and Christian Identity and Ku Klux Klan leader Robert E. Miles. CSA members allegedly plotted to poison the water supplies of New York City and Washington D.C. with sodium cyanide. One CSA member named Richard Wayne Snell assassinated a black Arkansas State Trooper and a white pawnshop owner he mistakenly thought was Jewish. Snell was ultimately convicted, sentenced to death and executed for these crimes on April 19, 1995. After Snell's arrest, the FBI and ATF plotted a siege of the CSA compound on weapons violations which began on April 19, 1985 and ended peacefully three days later with the arrest of CSA leader Jim Ellison. Ellison was later sentenced to 20 years in federal prison on racketeering charges. As the FBI investigated The Order's crimes, informants began providing them with information allegedly outlining The Order's ties to several prominent white supremacists, such as Butler, Miles, Texas KKK leader Louis Beam, Tom Metzger of White Aryan Resistance, William L. Pierce (no relation to Bruce Pierce) of the National Alliance and Glenn Miller of the White Patriot Party. The FBI alleged that The Order's crimes, as well as other crimes committed by other white supremacists, were coordinated by prominent leaders of the white supremacist movement and that some of the leaders were continuing to plot more crimes including the bombings of several federal courthouses.  The trial  In April 1987, fourteen white supremacists were formally indicted in Fort Smith, Arkansas. on charges of seditious conspiracy, transporting stolen money and conspiring to commit murder. Barnhill, Beam, Butler, Lane, Miles, Bruce Pierce, Scutari, Snell, Robert Neil Smalley and Ardie McBrearty were charged with seditious conspiracy while Snell, David Michael McGuire, William and Ivan Wade and Lambert Miller (no relation to Glenn Miller) were charged with conspiracy to commit murder. Barnhill and Scutari also faced charges of transporting stolen money. The trial began on February 16, 1988. The prosecution's case relied heavily on the testimonies of Ellison and Glenn Miller. The defense contended that Ellison and Miller had motive to lie about the alleged conspiracy in order to receive reduced prison sentences on other charges. The defense also attacked Ellison's character by revealing his delusions of grandeur and that he was a polygamist. The charges against Smalley were dismissed due to lack of evidence in March 1988, and the remaining thirteen defendants were acquitted of all charges on April 7. = The defendants = *Louis Ray Beam, of Houston, Texas *Robert E. Miles, of Cohoctah, Michigan *Richard G. Butler, of Hayden Lake, Idaho *Richard Joseph Scutari, of New York *Andrew Virgil Barnhill, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida *Bruce Carroll Pierce, of Metaline Falls, Washington *Ardie McBrearty, of Gentry, Arkansas *David Eden Lane, of Denver, Colorado *Richard Wayne Snell, of Muse, Oklahoma *Lambert Miller, of Springfield, Missouri *David Michael McGuire, of Greenville, Illinois *Ivan Ray Wade, of Smithville, Arkansas *William Wade (father of Ivan Wade), also of Smithville *Robert Neil Smalley, of Fort Smith  Aftermath  Many white supremacists celebrated the verdict with Beam stating \\"ZOG has suffered a terrible defeat here today\\". Several of the defendants, including Barnhill, Lane, McBrearty, Pierce and Scutari still had to serve lengthy prison sentences on other charges. Lane and Pierce died serving their sentences in 2007 and 2010 respectively while Scutari remains incarcerated. Glenn Miller would later kill three people in two shootings at Jewish community centers in Overland Park, Kansas on April 13, 2014. Miller was sentenced to death in 2015 for the murders. Snell was executed by lethal injection on April 19, 1995 in Arkansas. Snell was executed on the same day the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was bombed in Oklahoma City. Snell, Ellison and another CSA had previously plotted to bomb the Murrah building in 1983. Some conspiracy theorists and former members of the CSA, including Ellison's second-in-command Kerry Noble, alleged that the Oklahoma City Bombing was meant to coincide with Snell's execution. An Arkansas prison official reported that Snell laughed while watching news of the bombing in the hours prior to his execution. Noble also alleged that the bombing was a continuation of The Order's war.

Bárcenas B-01 at Culiacán International Airport. The Bárcenas B-01 is a low-wing monoplane agricultural aircraft built by Aeroservicio Bárcenas S.A.  Development  Aeroservicio Bárcenas began operating as repair and maintenance workshops for aircraft at Uruapan Airport in the early 60's, then, in the early 70's began designing and developing an agricultural aircraft whose first flight was made on June 8, 1973 and was certified by the DGAC on November 30 of the same year. The aircraft had an alar profile called \\"Bárcenas airfoil\\", which allowed it better support and control than its competitors at that time, the design of that wing profile was later used by the National Polytechnic Institute and the Navy of Mexico in the design and assembly of the Tonatiuh MX-1 aircraft, which was used by Mexican Naval Aviation as an observation and reconnaissance aircraft. In December 1978, the General Directorate of Civil Aeronautics published the results of a study titled Agricultural Aircraft and its Construction, in which the College of Mexican Engineers in Aeronautics, the Federation of Pilots and Owners of Agricultural Aircraft of the Mexican Republic intervened. , Nacional Financiera SA, the General Directorate of Parastatal Basic Industries of the Ministry of Heritage and Industrial Development and the DGAC. In this work were analyzed and compared the characteristics of the following aircraft, then commercially available for agricultural use: Anahuac Tauro 300, AAMSA Quail A-9-B, Bárcenas B-01, Piper Pawnee 235 D, Piper Pawnee 260D, Piper PA-36 Pawnee Brave, Cessna Agwagon, Cessna AGtruck, Weatherly 201C, Grumman Agcat 164B, Grumman Agcat 164C, Embraer Ipanema 201B, Trush Commander 600 and Trush Commander 800. The acquisition costs, operating costs, useful life, maintenance facilities, performance, versatility and maneuverability were taken into account. The verdict was as follows: it was feasible to manufacture this type of aircraft in Mexico, there was sufficient demand, its financing was possible, there was infrastructure for the installation of the company and the \\"ideal plane\\" was between the Bárcenas B-01 and the Piper Pawnee 260. Sixteen aircraft were built between 1973 and 1982, costing in the last year $ 52,000 USD (about 130,000 current dollars).  End of production  In the 70's there were 3 aircraft factories in Mexico, however, SAGARPA authorized the importation of 130 agricultural aircraft, leaving Mexican companies out of competition, as well as the National Rural Credit Bank, which ordered the manufacture of 11 aircraft to Anahuac and Bárcenas. for the Tehuantepec region and finally it did not finance the manufacture of the same, among those aircraft, Embraer EMB 201B of Brazilian manufacture was imported at a lower price than Bárcenas B-01.  ASA Chac  It was an agricultural aircraft developed by the National Polytechnic Institute and Airports and Auxiliary Services and produced by the Airport and Auxiliary Services Workshops at the Mexico City Airport in the early 80's. In 1981, ASA acquired the Bárcenas B-01 manufacturing license whose design was only altered in terms of the wing profile, because instead of using the Bárcenas Profile, a NACA 23012 profile was used. Three prototypes of this aircraft were constructed, The third prototype was donated to the IPN by ASA on February 27, 1989, on the condition that it would not be commercialized.

She was born in 1973, during the Guatemalan Civil War. She mentions that, as a Guatemalan citizen, she feels that political issues are a part of her identity and that a lot of her and her family's experiences are reflected through her artwork. Diaz is a self taught artist as well as a graphic designer, and has worked in the press, publicity, and media. While she does not consider herself a feminist, many of her works have been displayed in feminist exhibitions; she considers her work feminine because it is work done by a woman. Style Diaz has stated that she creates art to express her objections against “patriarchal values, political deception, and political ideology”. She has also commented that one of the main purposes of her artwork is to explore the sublimity of women. She uses various forms of medium to convey her messages, including video and installations; her preferred medium is her own body. She states that “[her] body is the vehicle to transport a big load of [her] own life experience; touching the limits is the way [she gets] intimate with [her] own body and the work”. Furthermore, she states that \\"by using [her] body like a medium, [she] conveys [her] objections with political disappointments, the patriarchal companies, and discriminating philosophies.\\" Her work is meant to express the different \\"facets of being a woman, a mother, a victim, and an artist, and so forth.\\" \\"Borderline\\" One of her most prominent works is “Borderline,” which is a video performance created in 2005 that is featured in the E Pluribus Unum: Out of Many, One exhibition at Studios at the Park in Paso Robles, California. “Borderline” was set in the ocean, where Diaz actually sat herself in an enclosed wooden box and was launched into the ocean for 45 minutes without any means of protection. Adela explains that the purpose behind this video performance is to enhance the discussion on the injustices that exist in the United States toward immigrants. It demonstrate the instability that exists in the lives of migrants who reside in the U.S., through their marginalization and the discrimination that they are forced to endure. Diaz mentions that her personal experience as an immigrant in the United States is reflected in this video performance. 2005, aside from being the year that she created this art piece, was also a detrimental year for her legal status. She states that through the making of this piece, she risked her own life not only in terms of dying but also of getting caught by the police who could potentially deport her back to Guatemala. She mentions that a part of her desired for this to occur. This artwork was meant to provide a voice for the millions of men and women who are trapped in similar situations. Select artwork * Detachment, 2007, Video Performance''' **This piece shows two women, mother and daughter, in red dresses who are stitched together, and as they begin to move in opposite ways, the stitching is destroyed. In the description of the video performance, Maria Adela Diaz discusses the detachment that occurs between a mother and her daughter: “The bond between a mother and daughter wavers throughout its evolution. The most prevalent, and possibly most taboo, is the separation of ideologies and disruption of communication. Daily life turns into steps in opposite directions. In this video, I demonstrate the detachment between a mother and daughter while maintaining an invisible umbilical cord that once linked us together but only remains metaphorically. Once detached, the only thing that remains and links the two is blood” *Blossom, 2008, Video Performance **This piece depicts a young woman running and jumping in what seems to be a field of flowers. According to Diaz, it is representative of the growth and maturity human beings experience as time passes. *CAUTION, 2008, Video Art **This video portrays what seems to be a father, mother, and their daughter running while the sun is going down. It reminds viewers of the immigration signs placed at the borders as warning signs. Diaz states that she recreated the sign into video art in order to send the message that the crossing of borders should be a legal action. The continuous looping of the video empowers her idea because it helps to demonstrate that crossing borders is uncontrollable, either by laws or through other forms of higher powers. *Status Quo, 2017, Performance **This performance piece displays a woman trapped in her personal space, and then a group of men begin to weld pieces of metal to create a structure that entraps the woman and does not allow her to escape. The woman then begins to fight for her way out by breaking the structure. Diaz provides commentary on her work: \\"[it] denounces the inert behavior of Latin American societies when it comes to [denouncing] violent and abusive events that occur near them [or] even in their own personal intimate space. Her body trapped and invaded are analogies to the Latin American cultures that oppresses and violates the women body\\". *Antipodes, Installation/ Video Performance **This performance piece of 100 shoes that were connected by the same sole is—based on Diaz's commentary— representative of how unity between humanity will help towards achieving and creating a better world. * Resistance, Performance, Action ** Resistance is similar to Detachment in that it shows three women, who are stitched together through pink shirts, attempting to move away from one another until the stitching is destroyed. Diaz mentions that her piece is meant to explore the pain that is created through detachment, as was commonly experienced during the military regimes that were in power in Guatemala and other Latin American countries. Millions of people were separated from their families and friends; it was common for people to be tortured, kidnapped, or killed. *Rastros, 2018, Video Performance **In 2017, about 412 deaths were recorded of migrants who died while crossing the U.S.-Mexican border. Diaz states that the pieces symbolize the immigration laws that are passed in the U.S. in order to dehumanize migrants. The border represents a piece of territory where body parts are found, often unable to be identified. Exhibitions Maria Adela Diaz has been featured in exhibitions all over the world, including \\"the Centre Pompidou in Paris, Exteresa Arte Actual in Mexico City, and Museo de Arte Contemporáneo in San Jose, Costa Rica.\\" She has exhibited alongside other artists, including: Isabel Barbuzza, Ana de Obregoso, Kate Leffer, Linda Vallejo, Bianca Ana Chavez, and Anais Yu Ye. *Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960–1985 **Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960–1985 displays the work of Latina and Chicana women artists created during a period of Latin American history representative of both repressive times as well as liberal ones. During the times these artists created their artworks, many of their respective countries were experiencing social and political upheaval, including dictatorships and civil wars. Many of the art presented in this exhibition is centered around the rejection of repressive regimes as well as patriarchal culture. * E Pluribus Unum: From Many, One ** This exhibition, executed by Studios on the Park during June 2017, encouraged guests to participate in examining how immigration has impacted their daily lives as well as the national culture. It encouraged guests to evaluate their own perceptions on such a controversial issue, despite the fact that America \\"is and always has been a nation of immigrants.\\" *Other exhibitions include: ** Group and solo exhibitions 2018 *\\"Encuentros\\" International video Art Exhibition, Museo y Centro de Estudios Humanísticos de la Universidad de Turabo, Puerto Rico.

The film is about a group of scammers who embark in a cruise ship in order to defraud and steal the money of an old baker who recently won millions of euros in the lottery and is travelling on the ship with his family. Yucatán was mostly filmed onboard Pullmantur Cruises's MS Sovereign and on location in the ports where the ship docked during its route. Plot Clayderman (Rodrigo de la Serna) is a con man who, together with his wife Verónica (Stephanie Cayo), works on board the MS Sovereign as a pianist. He uses his position as a crew member to commit petty crimes against the passengers. In Barcelona, Lucas (another scammer) discreetly enters the ship disguised as a crew member. Almost at the same time, Antonio and his family come on board as regular passengers. Clayderman, Lucas, and Verónica have a past together when they used to \\"work\\" as a group, but they split up when both Clayderman and Lucas fell in love with Verónica. As soon as Clayderman finds out that Lucas is on board, he is sure that his old friend is planning a new scam. He starts to investigate and finds that Antonio, an old baker who recently won 161 million euros in the lottery, is on board with his family. From this moment on, Clayderman, Lucas, and Verónica (assisted by their allies) start a competition to see who can defraud and steal the old man's money first. Cast * Luis Tosar as Lucas * Rodrigo de la Serna as Clayderman * Joan Pera as Antonio * Stephanie Cayo as Verónica * Gloria Muñoz as Carmen * Alicia Fernández as Leticia * Adrián Núñez as Brendon * Txell Aixendri as Alicia Production Most of Yucatán scenes are set onboard Pullmantur Cruises's MS Sovereign cruise ship. The film was shot on board the ship during a transatlantic crossing from Brazil to Spain. The actors and the crew embarked on April 10, 2016, in Recife and spent 22 days shooting the film, disembarking in Barcelona. The team was composed of about 100 people who lived aboard the ship during this time. While filming was taking place the ship was performing its regular route with passengers; the crew and passengers became part of the film and even acted as extras in some scenes. Release =Box office= Yucatán was released in Spain on August 31, 2018. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $1,240,253, finishing number one in the Spanish box office. In its second weekend, the film grossed $1,071,148 and dropped to the second position in the box office. After seven weeks, Yucatán grossed more than $5.8 million only in the Spanish territory, becoming the seventh-highest-grossing film in Spain in 2018. =Reception= Carlos Boyero of El País wrote: \\"I think I understand what Daniel Monzón has proposed, but the result seems devastating. Nothing works in this weary plot, null of grace, with interpretations that move between the inane and the grotesque\\". Xavi Sánchez Pons from the website \\"Sensacine\\" did not like the film either, giving it two out of five stars with the explanation: \\"In Yucatan, all of the comedic gags are forced and lack any kind of surprise effect\\". Sergio F. Pinilla of Cinemanía liked the film, giving it four out of five stars and commenting: \\"With non-stop fun, there's the glamour of the musical, the absurdity of romantic comedies, [intrigue] and even animated cartoon slapstick in Yucatán\\". Noel Murray of Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"From the exotic ports of call to the occasional musical numbers, “Yucatán” is a mostly enjoyable ride. It's meant to be a throwback to glamorous old Hollywood movies.\\". Jordan Hoffman of TV Guide wrote: \\"It's virtually impossible not to be amused by this picture. Like the limitless buffet and late show with dancing girls, it's a simple pleasure, but one with guaranteed success.\\" Sergi Sánchez of Fotogramas gives the film four out of five stars and comments: \\"[Daniel Monzón] has an infinite affection, not condescension, for his characters and a remarkable empathy for the lights and shadows of the human condition\\". Yucatán was nominated for one Gaudí Award in the category of \\"Best Production Manager (Millor Direcció de Producció)\\".

Intuitively, it provides a method for solving one problem efficiently by using the solution to the other problem as a subroutine. If problem A can be solved in time a(n) and problem B can be solved in time b(n), then the existence of an (a,b)-reduction from problem A to problem B implies that any significant speedup for problem B would also lead to a speedup for problem A. Definition Let A and B be computational problems, specified as the desired output for each possible input. Let a and b both be time-constructible functions that take an integer argument n and produce an integer result. Usually, a and b are the time bounds for known or naive algorithms for the two problems, and often they are monomials such as n^2. Then A is said to be (a,b)-reducible to B if, for every real number \\\\epsilon>0, there exists a real number \\\\delta>0 and an algorithm that solves instances of problem A by transforming it into a sequence of instances of problem B, taking time O\\\\bigl(a(n)^{1-\\\\delta}\\\\bigr) for the transformation on instances of size n, and producing a sequence of instances whose sizes n_i are bounded by \\\\sum_i b(n_i)^{1-\\\\epsilon}. An (a,b)-reduction is given by the mapping from \\\\epsilon to the pair of an algorithm and \\\\delta. Speedup implication Suppose A is (a,b)-reducible to B, and there exists \\\\epsilon>0 such that B can be solved in time O\\\\bigl(b(n)^{1-\\\\epsilon}\\\\bigr). Then, with these assumptions, there also exists \\\\delta>0 such that A can be solved in time O\\\\bigl(a(n)^{1-\\\\delta}\\\\bigr). Namely, let \\\\delta be the value given by the (a,b)-reduction, and solve A by applying the transformation of the reduction and using the fast algorithm for B for each resulting subproblem. Equivalently, if A cannot be solved in time significantly faster than a(n), then B cannot be solved in time significantly faster than b(n). History Fine-grained reductions were defined, in the special case that a and b are equal monomials, by Virginia Vassilevska Williams and Ryan Williams in 2010. They also showed the existence of (n^3,n^3)-reductions between several problems including all-pairs shortest paths, finding the second- shortest path between two given vertices in a weighted graph, finding negative-weight triangles in weighted graphs, and testing whether a given distance matrix describes a metric space. According to their results, either all of these problems have time bounds with exponents less than three, or none of them do. The term \\"fine-grained reduction\\" comes from later work by Virginia Vassilevska Williams in an invited presentation at the 10th International Symposium on Parameterized and Exact Computation. Although the original definition of fine-grained reductions involved deterministic algorithms, the corresponding concepts for randomized algorithms and nondeterministic algorithms have also been considered.

He was the eldest son of Count Guy and Petronilla (Elizabeth) of Chacenay. In 1147, Milo joined the Second Crusade, travelling with the army of Henry the Liberal, the heir to the County of Champagne. Little is known of his actions during the crusade. His father, whose death is unrecorded, may have been a victim of the crusade, although he is not recorded as having accompanied Milo. Milo was back in France by the end of 1149. Milo married Agnes, heiress of Braine and the castle of Baudement. The couple had one daughter, Petronilla, born about 1150. A year later Milo fell ill while visiting Count Theobald II of Champagne and died in Troyes. The date of his death is sometimes given as 1 October 1151. On his deathbed he gave to the Abbey of Larivour the right to receive annually two sextarii of wheat and another two of messail (a mixture of wheat and rye) from the banal mills of Bar-sur-Seine. This gift was witnessed and confirmed by his mother, wife and daughter. Petronilla inherited the county while still an infant and was placed under the regency of Milo's brother, Manasses, until Petronilla came of age. In 1168 she took over the county and married Hugh IV of Le Puiset. Agnes re- married to the widower Count Robert I of Dreux. She was still living in 1217.

The Wädenswil–Einsiedeln-Bahn merged with the Zürichsee–Gotthardbahn (Lake Zürich-Gotthard Railway) in 1890, in order to promote the construction of a railway from to , where it would connect with the Gotthard Railway. Only the Pfäffikon– and the –Arth-Goldau sections had to be built. The line over the Seedamm had already been completed and the Pfäffikon–Arth-Goldau railway would use the existing line between Samstagern and Biberbrugg. The Pfäffikon–Arth-Goldau railway was opened on 8 August 1891. Finance for electrification was not secured for a long time, but it was eventually approved at the General Meeting on 6 July 1938. Work began immediately on building the overhead line and the transmission lines. It was scheduled to be completed before the Swiss National Exhibition of 1939 in Zürich (Landi 39). The electricity would be supplied at cost price from the Etzel works of the SBB. The electrification succeeded and the lines were electrified within 10 months. A small celebration took place on 13 May. Electrical operations should have been started on the entire network of the Südostbahn at the timetable change on 15 May 1939. However, the railway did not have its own electric rolling stock at this time. The eight railcars (CFZe 4/4 and BCFZe 4/4) ordered in 1938 had not yet been delivered. The halt of Grüenfeld was opened in 1979. The Neuberg crossing loop was built between February and May 1981 for the visit of the Pope. It allows two trains to cross between Biberbrugg and Einsiedeln. The line between Samstagern and Schindellegi-Feusisberg was duplicated in 1992 to handle the increase in traffic. Since 10 June 1979, the Wädenswil–Einsiedeln line has been equipped at least to the former SBB profile I, that is a rail weight of . The restrictions on axle load and linear load on bridges could then be lifted. Since 2018, all rolling stock up to and including class D4 ( axle load, linear load) has been allowed on the line.According to the map of FDV AB, section 5.1 chapter 4.2.4, as of 1 July 2017 ()  Route After leaving Wädenswil station, the line crosses the main street at a level crossing. Immediately afterwards, the 5.0% grade begins and the line runs along the slope in a south-easterly direction around the hill on which the ruins of Alt Wädenswil Castle stand. After the bend around the hill, the line reaches the southwest-facing station of Burghalden and is level through the station, but immediately returns to the 5.0% grade. After a left- hand bend crossing a bridge towards the south-east, followed by a right-hand bend, the line reaches the halt of Grüenfeld running to the southwest. Part of the station lies on a grade of 3.0%, but within the platform area the line returns to a 5.0% grade. The line takes a slight left turn that tightens and turns another 80 degrees to run parallel with the line from Pfäffikon, which makes a 180-degree turn here. The line crosses a level crossing where it straightens on the approach to Samstagern station, which is orientated to the south-southwest. Next to the line on the right is the Samstagern workshop and the station building with a goods shed and a loading ramp is to the left. The 5.0% grade begins again before then end of the platform and immediately goes into a 90-degree right turn and then into another 90 left turn. The line then runs along the main road along the slope through the locality of Itlimoosweiher. The road crosses the railway line on a bridge in Asch, where, the line makes a slight bend to the right to reach Schindellegi-Feusisberg station, which also has a station straight. The station is on a slight right- hand turn towards the southwest. After the station there is a short 4.5% grade and the line crosses the Sihl on a bridge. There is a siding in Chaltenboden. The line now turns south into the Alp gorge and is noticeably flatter. Shortly later the line curves into Biberbrugg station. The junction station has a section of straight track, but is mostly located on a curve. The tracks are orientated north-south in front of the station building, which is located east of the tracks. The road to Sattel crosses the station on a bridge. After this bridge, the line to Einsiedeln crosses the Biber on a left turn, while the line to Arth-Goldau remains on the other side of the river for a short distance. The line to Einsiedeln runs along the winding Alp, but only on the left bank. After a good two kilometres, the line reaches the Neuberg crossing loop, which lies to the east-northeast. The line turns in Nübergsübergang through several curves back to the south. Until 1936, the Rabennest tunnel was located at the last turn before the line runs continuously to the south. The line crosses the Alp at Holzrütisäge, where the Alp valley widens. Shortly afterwards, the line reaches the storage sidings and Einsiedeln station a kilometre later.  Structures  The only tunnel of the line, the 54 metre- long Rabennest tunnel between Biberbrugg and Einsiedeln, had to be removed in 1936 due to strong earth forces. It was opened out and replaced by a retaining wall.  Accidents = 30 November 1876 (Wädenswil): out of control test train = Newspaper photo of the accident on 30 November 1876 in Wädenswil The trial of the Wetli system was held on 30 November 1876. The ascent with locomotive 253 was promising. After the train arrived in Schindellegi, the helical wheel which engaged on the track sections disengaged due to irregularities. The brakes failed during the descent to Wädenswil without intervention by the rollers. It is believed that oil leaked and fell the on the rails and the wheels, rendering the brakes ineffective. (This theory is set out by Alfred Moser, in his book among others). The disaster was foreseeable, so that some of the people on board tried to escape by jumping off. All persons were injured, one member of the company's board was thrown out and killed. At the entrance to Wädenswil station, the train had a speed of an estimated 120 kilometers per hour. This caused the locomotive to overturn in the station and another person was killed. The casualties are not completely proven. Depending on the source, one dead and five injured or two dead and several injured are given. This could indicate that an injured person died later and thus was not counted as killed in the newspaper reports. After this incident, no one was willing to test the Wetli system any further, so that there was no chance to restore it to operation. The Swiss Northeastern Railway (Nordostbahn) withdrew from its construction obligations as a result of the accident, as it seriously doubted the appropriateness of the Wetli system and, as a consequence, did not want to carry out any further tests. = 26 July 1947 at the Bennau footbridge: head-on collision = On 26 July 1947, there was a head-on collision of two trains at the Bennau footbridge between Biberbrugg and Einsiedeln. Train 183 had been sent by the station master down the line two minutes early, although it was still occupied by train 84\\\\. 10 people died and at least 63 others were injured. = 22 February 1948 (Wädenswil): out of control sports special train= On 22 February 1948, a sports special train from Sattel to Zurich overran a buffer stop in Wädenswil station at 60 km/h after an error by the locomotive driver and ran into the operating and administrative building of a fruit and wine cooperative. This killed 22 people. = 2 September 1952 between Samstagern and Schindellegi: head-on collision = On 2 September 1952, two passenger trains collided on the open track between Samstagern and Schindellegi because the delayed train 34 did not wait for a delayed crossing in Schindellegi. This time there were no dead, but only six injured—five passengers and the train and post office attendant—to complain.

S. scuireus formerly applied to Humboldt's squirrel monkey and Collins' squirrel monkey, but genetic research in 2009 and 2015 revealed that these are distinct species. Taxonomy Several now- separate squirrel monkey species were formerly considered a single species, Saimiri scuireus, generally known as the common squirrel monkey, with a wide range in the northern half of South America. A 2009 genetic study by Carretero-Pinzón, et al indicated Humboldt's squirrel monkey, S. cassiquiarensis, from Colombia, Peru and Ecuador, which had been considered a subspecies of S. scuireus, was actually more closely related to other squirrel monkey species. A 2015 genetic study by Lynch Alfaro, et al revealed that Collins' squirrel monkey, S. collinsi, from northeastern Brazil, which had also been considered a subspecies of S. scuireus, should also be treated as a separate species. This left S. scuireus to apply to the squirrel monkeys in northern Brazil and the Guianas. Lynch Alfaro's study also revealed that despite the gap in their ranges, the squirrel monkey species most closely related to the Guianan squirrel monkey is the Central American squirrel monkey of Costa Rica and Panama. Description Guianan squirrel monkey males have a body between long with a tail between long. Females have a body between long with a tail between long. Males weigh between and females weigh between . The Guianan squirrel monkey has a pink face, black muzzle and white arches over the eyes. The crown of its head is olive or olive gray. The fur on its back can vary in color among gray, olive or orange, but the belly is white and the arms are yellow-orange. Behavior The Guianan squirrel monkey often feeds and moves in mixed species groups with capuchin monkeys. It also associates with the red-backed bearded saki. Hybrids with the bare-eared squirrel monkey are known to occur along the boundaries of their ranges. The Guianan squirrel monkey's diet includes insects, seeds, fruit, young leaves, flowers, gum, shoots, nectar, spiders, lizards and bird eggs. On at least one occasion one was seen eating a bat, although it does not appear to hunt bats as often as the related Central American squirrel monkey. Breeding is typically synchronized within each group. Males gain weight in the upper portion of their bodies and become more aggressive prior to mating season. Females do not appear to initiate mating. Gestation period is about 5 months, and all infants within a group are typically born within one week of each other during January or February. Males provide no parental care, but non-maternal females provide some alloparental care. Infants have slightly prehensile tails and are weaned at about 6 months. Females are sexually mature at about 2 1/2 years, and males are fully mature at 4 or 5 years. Guianan squirrel monkeys can live more than 20 years.

The original totem pole was carved in 1790 and raised in the Tlingit village on Tongass Island, Alaska to honor the Tlingit woman Chief-of-All-Women. The totem pole was later stolen by Seattle businessmen on an expedition to Alaska and subsequently gifted to the City of Seattle in 1899, where it was raised in Pioneer Square and became a source of civic pride. The totem pole was later damaged by arson and a replica was commissioned and installed in its place in 1940, which is now designated a National Historic Landmark.  History  = Tlingit origin = The totem pole was initially carved around the year 1790 and belonged to the Kinninook family, a Tlingit clan of the Raven moiety. It was carved to honor Chief-of- All-Women, a Tlingit woman who drowned in the Nass River while traveling to visit an ill sister. Her family hired a carver and gathered to tell him stories they wanted represented on her totem pole. When the totem pole was complete, they organized a potlatch and raised the totem pole in her honor in the Tlingit village on Tongass Island. It was one of the few totem poles dedicated to a woman. = Seattle Post-Intelligencer expedition = City of Seattle In 1899, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer sponsored an expedition of \\"leading Seattle citizens\\" to the District of Alaska. The expedition was meant to be a \\"goodwill tour,\\" with a mixture of business and pleasure, and the goal of investigating increased trade and investment in Alaska. However, even as the Klondike Gold Rush came to an end, civic leaders also wanted to solidify Seattle as the \\"Gateway to Alaska\\" and the Seattle Chamber of Commerce included a committee of prominent businessmen on the expedition. On August 17, 1899, the expedition set sail on the steamship City of Seattle with a total of 165 men and women. The expedition included stops at Vancouver, Mary Island, New Metlakahtla, Ketckikan, Wrangel, Juneau, the Treadwell Mines, Skagway, Lake Bennett, Dyea, Pyramid Harbor, Glacier Bay, Muir Glacier, Killisnoo, Sitka and Victoria. On the morning of August 28, 1899, the City of Seattle stopped at the Tlingit village at Fort Tongass when members of the Chamber of Commerce committee spotted multiple totem poles. The village appeared to be deserted and they decided to take a totem pole as a souvenir. Third mate R. D. McGillvery and other members of the expedition went ashore and McGillvery later described the events as: > The Indians were all away fishing, except for one who stayed in his house > and looked scared to death. We picked out the best looking totem pole... I > took a couple of sailors ashore and we chopped it down—just like you'd chop > down a tree. It was too big to roll down the beach, so we sawed it in two. During the process, McGillvery and the other sailors broke the beak on the bottom figure which was later incorrectly reconstructed. A carving of a seal, about in length, was also taken from the Tlingit village. After the totem pole was floated back to the ship, the Chamber of Commerce committee collectively paid McGillvery $2.50 for his labor. The expedition returned to Seattle on August 30, 1899, and the Chamber of Commerce committee subsequently presented the totem pole to the Seattle City Council as a gift to the city. = Installation in Pioneer Square = The original pole, c. 1924 The totem pole was repaired, repainted, and stored at the Denny Hotel in Denny Hill under watch of three members of the Chamber of Commerce committee. On October 18, 1899, the totem pole was raised in Pioneer Square in downtown Seattle and was \\"greeted by cheers of a multitude of people.\\" At the ceremony, city officials praised the Chamber of Commerce committee for their gift and assured the gathered crowd that no one had owned the totem pole and that the expedition saved it from its certain destruction. The Tlingit however, with the exception of the elderly and small children, had simply been away for the fishing and cannery season when the City of Seattle arrived at Fort Tongass and they were shocked to discover the totem pole gone when they returned. David E. Kinninook, who was a descendant of Chief-of-All-Women, and Tlingit witnesses of the theft contacted the governor of the District of Alaska John Green Brady and demanded legal action and $20,000 for the totem pole. The Kinninook family also sent a delegation to Seattle in an unsuccessful attempt to retrieve the totem pole. The demand for legal action led to a federal grand jury in Alaska indicting eight men on the Chamber of Commerce committee for theft of government property. Attorney William H. Thompson, who was also on the expedition, defended the indicted men and said: > The village has long since been deserted ... Here the totem will voice the > natives' deeds with surer speech than if lying prone on moss and fern on the > shore of Tongass Island. The suit was dismissed after a U.S. District Court Judge stopped in Seattle on the way to his new Alaska posting and was entertained at the private Rainier Club. The City of Seattle was allowed to keep the totem pole and the Chamber of Commerce committee was charged a nominal fine of $500, which the Seattle Post-Intelligencer paid on their behalf. In the interim, the totem pole had become a source of civic pride for Seattle and was featured on post cards and brochures. In 1909, Seattle hosted the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition, which in part celebrated the transformation of Seattle from a small town to a booming city, and the totem pole was featured on the official brochure. The totem pole had lost all association with the Tlingit owners and a 1910 article described it as the \\"totem pole that made Seattle famous.\\" = Destruction and commission of replica = Raising the replica in Pioneer Square, 1940 In October 1938, the totem pole was damaged by an arsonist and was found to be too damaged by dry rot for repair; the Seattle City Council and Park Board sought to have a replica commissioned. The United States Forest Service was directing a totem pole restoration project in southeastern Alaska and offered to employ Civilian Conservation Corps Tlingit carvers to craft a replica. The damaged totem pole was shipped to Saxman, Alaska, where Tlingit carver Charles Brown directed a team of carvers which included members of the Kinninook family. The replica was completed after three months of work, and because the red cedar used to carve the totem pole had come from Forest Service land and the carvers were paid by the government, a special act of Congress was passed to allow transfer of ownership of the totem pole from the Forest Service to the City of Seattle. The completed replica was dedicated with tribal blessings and shipped to Seattle in April 1940 and then raised in Pioneer Square in a ceremony on July 24, 1940. In 1972, Tsimshian carver John C. Hudson, Jr. restored and repainted the totem pole. In 1977, the totem pole—along with the Pioneer Building and pergola in Pioneer Square—was designated a National Historic Landmark. = Modern-day controversy = The Coast Salish, who are native to Seattle and the Pacific Northwest Coast, did not traditionally carve totem poles and the Pioneer Square totem pole was the first totem pole in Seattle. Totem poles have since become a symbol of Seattle and are used in tourism campaigns, while native Salish art has not been featured as prominently. Seattle City Councilmember Debora Juarez, a member of the Blackfeet Nation, called for a review of all the totem poles in the city for cultural sensitivity, which was granted by the city council in November 2018.  Appearance and meaning  The replica's base, 2007 The original Chief-of- All-Women pole was tall and was carved from hemlock, while the replica stands tall and was carved from a red cedar from Kina Cove near Kasaan, Alaska. The original totem pole had been repainted with successive coats of non-Tlingit colors in an attempt to preserve the pole. The replica, however, used the native Tlingit colors of black, red and blue-green. Totem poles are read from top to bottom, with the topmost figure identifying the owner. On the Pioneer Square totem pole that is Raven, which in Tlingit mythology \\"did everything, knew everything, and seemed to be everywhere at once.\\" The other figures, in descending order on the totem pole, are: a woman holding her frog child, the woman's frog husband, Mink, Raven and Whale with a seal in his mouth. At the bottom of the totem pole is Raven-at-the-Head-of-Nass, who is also called Grandfather of Raven. Three legends told by Chief-of-All-Women's lineage are represented on the totem pole. The first legend is Raven Steals the Sun, Stars and Moon, which involves Raven, who holds the crescent moon in his beak, and Grandfather of Raven. In this legend, Raven, who had made all living creatures, lived in darkness because he had not yet made the sun. One day, he learned that there was a chief who possessed the sun, the moon, and the stars in a box. Raven turned himself into a needle and fell into the chief's daughter's drinking cup, who drank the needle and gave birth to a son, who was Raven. The chief (Grandfather of Raven) loved his grandson (Raven) and gave him whatever he asked for, including the moon and stars, which Raven scattered across the sky. Grandfather of Raven then gave Raven the box containing the sun, which Raven took and flew up through the smoke hole with. He then opened the box and let sunlight into the world, which frightened and subsequently spread his people to every corner of the world. The second legend concerns the woman holding her frog child and the woman's frog husband. In it, a young woman makes a derogatory remark about frogs which a frog hears before turning himself into a man. The woman then married him and was happy until she learned that they lived under a lake and her husband and his relatives and her own children were all frogs. She sent her children to her father's home, who sent the frogs away, but he eventually became suspicious and discovered his daughter living in the lake with the frogs. He drained the lake, killing his daughter's frog husband, but rescuing his daughter and grandchildren. She did not live long afterwards though and her frog children eventually turned into humans and never returned to the lake. The final legend involves Raven and Mink, who are swallowed by a whale along with firewood and stones they bring to build a fire in his stomach. When the whale swallows fish, Raven and Mink cook them over the fire. However, the whale does not swallow enough fish and they begin to cut slices of fat from the whale's stomach. Eventually, they grow tired of their journey and cut out the whale's heart and kill him. The whale washes ashore and Raven sings until people come and cut open the whale to free Raven and Mink. Raven emerges sleek and glossy, while Mink emerges a dirty brown color from drying himself in rotten wood. Raven consumes all the meat and oil of the whale himself before setting off on further adventures.

A notable variant of lumpiang gulay is lumpiang togue, which is made mostly with togue (mung bean sprouts). Despite the name, lumpiang gulay is not a vegetarian dish by default, though vegetarian lumpia, a vegetarian variant, can be created from the basic recipe. Description Typical ingredients in lumpiang gulay include carrots, kamote (sweet potato), onions, garlic, shallots, cabbage or lettuce, potatoes, singkamas (jicama), sitaw (green beans), sayote (chayote), and togue (mung bean sprouts). It is mixed with a small amount of ground meat, meat strips, and/or shrimp. Fish flakes can also be used. The meat is simmered for a few minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients. They are then wrapped in lumpia wrapper and deep-fried. The vegetables can alternatively be stir-fried. The ingredients of lumpiang gulay are roughly the same as the ingredients of lumpiang sariwa variants, except that lumpiang gulay is fried. It is traditionally eaten dipped in vinegar or agre dulce, but other types of dipping sauces can also be used. It is sometimes also known as lumpiang prito, a generic name for any fried lumpia versions. Lumpiang gulay is distinguished from other types of lumpia (especially lumpiang Shanghai) in that it has a greater ratio of vegetables to meat. It is also typically thicker in diameter than lumpiang Shanghai because it has more fillings. Other types of lumpia like lumpiang ubod, lumpiang labong, and lumpiang singkamas are generally regarded as different dishes, as they can be served fresh or fried, unlike lumpiang gulay which is always served as lumpiang prito (deep-fried). Variants =Lumpiang togue= A popular variant of lumpiang gulay is lumpiang togue, also known as \\"bean sprouts lumpia\\" or \\"bean sprouts egg roll\\". It is prepared roughly the same as lumpiang gulay with mostly the same ingredients. The main difference is that lumpiang togue uses more togue (mung bean sprouts) as the main ingredients, replacing the main filler of lumpiang gulay (usually cabbage). =Vegetarian lumpia= Despite the name, lumpiang gulay is typically not vegetarian. However, vegetarian versions can be made from both lumpiang gulay and lumpiang togue which do not use meat at all. They typically also include mushrooms or tokwa (tofu). These are differentiated as \\"vegetarian lumpia\\", which can be served fresh or fried. A pescetarian version can also be made with just chopped shrimp or fish flakes. Unlike lumpiang gulay and lumpiang togue, vegetarian lumpia can be served either as lumpiang prito (fried) or lumpiang sariwa (fresh). Vegan versions of lumpiang gulay can also be created. Though the lumpia wrappers used will need to be the vegan versions (without eggs).

The farm includes a large, irregularly- arranged main house, a Pennsylvania-style bank barn, a tenant house, and outbuildings including a spring house, smoke house, ice house, corn crib, water tower and a decorative pavilion. Description The complex is approached through metal gates along a tree-lined lane bordered by a stone wall. The main house has an unbalanced composition, unusual for its time, that anticipates late-19th century compositions. The wood-framed house has a two- story square-columned portico on the east elevation, with a Chippendale-styled balustrade on the second level spanning three of five bays. There are six columns and five dormers, on an ashlar-cut stone base. Three large brick chimneys project from the long roof ridge through the metal roofing material. This elevation is not the main entrance of the house, which is on the south side. A cantilevered oriel bay projects on the first level of the north side next to the east portico. The overall composition of the house is reminiscent of architecture in New Orleans, where Rezin Shepherd had lived. The other sides of the house have complex elevations reflecting the house's history of additions and alterations into the 20th century, all on rubble stone foundations. The lower side of the springhouse in 2010 The main entrance is at the east end of the south elevation, with a Greek Revival treatment opening into a reception and stair hall along the east wing, with an opening on the east side into the east wing ballroom or parlor. A dining room is on the west side of the hall, followed by a billiard room and a series of kitchen spaces. The kitchen area appears to be the oldest section of the house. The upstairs are divided into bedrooms that largely reflect the original layout of the house. The third floor was finished in the early 20th century, when the dormers were added. The complex includes several notable outbuildings, including a springhouse in the rough form of a Greek temple. Built about 1845, the building is set into the ground, surrounded by stone retaining walls. The springhouse itself is constructed of ashlar stone masonry, with a projecting portico supported by square columns. The interior is divided into three spaces, with a channel running through for the spring water. Other contributing buildings include a stone building (c. 1845) believed to be an office, an octagonal pagoda-like frame \\"sentry station\\" (c. 1880), believed to be a place for a timekeeper, a brick ice house (c. 1911), a stone pump house (c. 1911), a stone smokehouse (c. 1845), a six-bay carriage shed (c. 1845), and a tenant house (c. 1880). The complex includes several agricultural buildings, including a large Pennsylvania bank barn, built between 1842 and 1845. The lowest level of the barn features unusually fine stone masonry, with a stone-arched opening leading out of the stone-walled barnyard. Other buildings include a wood-frame poultry house (c. 1880), and a frame corn crib (c. 1880). The property includes an unusual number of fitted and finished stone walls. History The Wild Goose property was subdivided from a larger tract in the early 19th century, when John Stipp sold to his son George. Passing through two more owners, the property was purchased by Van Swearingen, owner of the adjoining River View farm, in 1829. In 1838 Swearingen's heirs sold much of the land to Charles M. Shepherd. The Shepherd family, descended from Abraham Shepherd, founder of Shepherdstown, owned much of the land in the area. Rezin Davis Shepherd was the eldest son of Abraham, who had spent much of his life as a merchant in New Orleans. Henry Shepherd, the next son, operated a livestock breeding operation at Springwood near Shepherdstown, in partnership with Rezin. Youngest son Charles managed the Shepherd properties in Virginia. Rezin moved back to West Virginia in the early 1840s, having bought Charles's assets, including land, livestock and slaves. By 1846, Rezin had built a new house on the Wild Goose tract, presumed to be the present manor house. The estate reached about in size by the time Rezin Shepherd entered retirement at Wild Goose, around 1850. Rezin died in 1865 at 80. Rezin's daughter Ellen (Brooks) and her two sons Peter Brooks and Shepherd Brooks inherited the property. In 1866 Shepherd bought the entire property and established it as Wild Goose Farm. In 1871 Shepherd Brooks sold the farm to Henry Shepherd, Jr. for $30,000. Henry Jr. moved to the farm in 1872. Henry Shepherd died in 1891, deeding the farm to four sons. The three younger sons sold their shares to eldest son Rezin Davis Shepherd for $24,531, for a total property value of $38,000. The second Rezin D. Shepherd was a stage actor, using the stage name of R.D. McLean. When McLean became involved in movies in the 20th century, he sold the core of Wild Goose to Edwin S. Jarrett for $36,000 in 1911. Jarrett used the property primarily as a retreat, with a tenant farmer. During Jarrett's ownership, he added Colonial Revival features to the house and raised the roof of the east wing to furnish a third floor, adding the colonnaded porch and opening the lower level of the east wing into a single ballroom. Jarrett died in 1940, after which the property changed hands several times. It was consistently used as a country retreat by successive owners, including NASA engineer Robert Moss during the 1960s, and by West Virginia governor Gaston Caperton from 1998. Wild Goose Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 20, 2018.

His studio was called Pugh's Photograph and Fine Art Gallery and printed ambrotype, tintype and daguerreotype photographs. Pugh sailed to Europe in 1867 in order to attend the International Exposition and wrote a book about his European travels. In it he spoke of how he \\"[held] it to be a duty every man owes to his family, to have both his and their likenesses taken at least once a year.\\" His studio featured sinks with running water to make sure his prints had as much of the salts washed off of them as possible. In addition, he featured scenery backdrops painted by artists in New York City and an art gallery of photographs and paintings in his studio. Later in his career Pugh took up painting himself, creating life sized portraits of people from ambrotypes he'd taken of them. In 1873 he won Best Photograph, Best Photograph in Oil, Best Photograph in Pastel, and Best Collection of Photographs at the Georgia State Fair.

The entirety of the album's lyrics are adapted from Jean Feraca's Crossing the Great Divide (1992), with the album being bookended by different readings of the same poem on the opening track, \\"Bolt\\" and the closing track, \\"Tarantella\\". The album also makes use of samples of the 'Silentium' movement from Arvo Pärt's Tabula Rasa, albeit mixed to be faintly audible under the album's overall use of severely clipped high and low frequencies. The album's mastering, a trademark of Fernow's production style and overall noise ethic, is noticeably extremely clipped, and its DC offset is at times in the album intentionally brickwalled. Due to this, in an anomalous case of Prurient's albums being digitally distributed, the album is nearly incapable of being properly listened to on Spotify, as it amounts to faint white noise.

The Prince's Band of Carabiniers () is a part-time military band assigned to provide musical support to the Prince Albert II of Monaco, who is the head of state and the ceremonial head of the Force Publique. Its home unit is the Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince, which is responsible for the country's defence. All members of the band are trained dually music and in the trades of non-band members. The 26-members of the band are referred to as \\"rifle-musicians\\" while the band director is titled a Maréchal des Logis Chef. In 1978, the title of \\"Fanfare de la Companies des Carabiniers\\" was adopted. History In previous centuries, the Prince’s guardsmen included signalers and military drummers who set the marching pace and/or delivered orders to the Prince’s Palace. These ensembles evolved over time, with their duties becoming more ceremonial. In 1966, during the reign of Rainier III, they were combined into a platoon, which in 1978 eventually became a wind band. On 1 January 2014, the platoons were merged into a single company, named the Prince’s Band of Carabiniers. On 20 January 2016, the band was given the Order of Grimaldi by the Sovereign, in honour of its golden jubilee. On this anniversary, it also performed at a gala concert in the presence of the Sovereign and his sister, with proceeds going to the Adrien Foundation and the Baby et Népal Association. Public events The band has the following ad hoc ensembles at its disposal during public events: *Marching Band *Concert Band *Jazz Band *Wind Quintet *Brass Quintet *Fanfare Team The diversity of the repertoire of the band allows it to perform at official ceremonies, sporting events, and public concerts. =Protocol= The band often performs its signature march, La Marche de la Fanfare des Carabiniers, at its public relations events. It performs during the daily Changing the Guard at the Prince's Palace at 11:55. It also performs during state visits to Monaco, performing the national anthem of a foreign country while also performing the Hymne Monégasque. Another occasion of importance includes the National Day celebrations in November. It commonly performs at civic engagements and music festivals. In its participation in the latter, the band has, since 1989, performed outside of Monaco, in various cities that include, such as: Saumur, Nîmes, Albertville, Lugano, Düsseldorf, Turin, Lisbon, Seville, Geneva, and Hanover. =Visit to Scotland= On 4 August 2017, the band accompanied Prince Albert II in his attendance at the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo. The tattoo was the 68th edition to have been held. =Visit to Russia= In August 2018, the band, under the direction of Senior Warrant Officer Olivier Drean, visited Russia to take part in the Spasskaya Tower Military Music Festival and Tattoo on Moscow's Red Square. One of the band members dressed up as a monk resembling those worn during the war of François Grimaldi. The band was noted for using unconventional instruments during its performance, including a bass guitar and an IPad. Among the guests the who were in the presence of the band included Princess Stéphanie and Ambassador Mireille Pettiti. The band also paraded with other bands such as the Central Navy Band of Russia and the Sri Lankan Military Band at the Exhibition of Achievements of National Economy.

The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. With History Irrigation districts in Idaho began forming toward the end of the 19th century, and by 1903 Idaho counted four irrigation districts: Weiser in Washington County, Pioneer in Canyon County, New Sweden in Bingham County, and Oneida in Oneida County. Montpelier Irrigation District was formed in Bear Lake County later in 1903, and farmers in Meridian held meetings to establish their own irrigation district. In 1904 the Nampa and Meridian Irrigation District was formed in Meridian by farmers in Canyon and Ada Counties, and one of the organization's first actions was to purchase and expand the Ridenbaugh Canal, begun in 1878 by William T. Ridenbaugh to irrigate a large ranch owned by his uncle, William B. Morris. By 1913 the Ridenbaugh Canal had been expanded from an original length of six miles to nearly 40 miles, and it carried water to more than 1000 customers, including over 600 farms. Early in 1919 the district moved its headquarters from Meridian to Nampa, and offices were opened on the second floor of Nampa City Hall. (Although listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the 1910 City Hall was demolished in 1991.) After two months at City Hall, the district announced plans to build its own office in Nampa.

Robin Holmes was born in Virginia in 1810. He stated that he and his wife, Polly, had been owned by a US Army Major in Missouri for twelve years before they were seized to pay the major's debts. Politician and landowner Nathaniel Ford claimed them as his own slaves, though Holmes would later dispute the legality of the sale. In 1843, Ford, who was 2400 dollars in debt, mortgaged Robin and Polly Holmes and five of their six children. He regained ownership of Robin Holmes, Polly Holmes, and two of their children. The others- William, Eliza, and Clarisa- he either lost permanently or sold. Based on dates recorded by the Fords, Eliza, the oldest of the three, would have been twelve years old. On May 14, 1844, the Ford and Holmes families set out for the Oregon Territory. Ford's descendants claimed that Ford was reluctant to bring Robin Holmes along, but was swayed by Holmes's pleas to stay with the Fords. Robin Holmes himself testified that he had been offered freedom in exchange for helping Ford settle in Oregon, an account that Ford did not dispute in his own testimony. Mary Jane, Harriet, and Celi Ann, Holmes's three remaining daughters, were also brought along. In 1850, Mr. Ford granted freedom to only Robin, Polly, and one of the children, leaving four children enslaved (two children had been born to the couple between 1844 and 1850). One of the children, Harriet, died in 1851. Robin Holmes then sued Nathaniel Ford for his children's freedom in 1852. The case, Holmes v. Ford, was brought before the Oregon Territorial Supreme Court on July 13, 1853, and the children were awarded to their parents after a fourteen month trial.

It is one of the most prominent Hindu temples in Kasargod district which dates back as old as 500 years, dedicated to the main deity 'Kshetrapalakan' Eswaran and mother Goddess known as Kalarathri Amma (Bhadrakali). One of the oldest temples in North Kerala, Shri Madiyan Kulam is an ancient shrine. Sri Madiyan Kulam is the headquarters of the 'Allada Swaroopam Mookatham Nadu'. The temple famous for its centuries old wooden carvings is also known for its epic poems which portrays unity of different religions and castes.  Location  Sri Madiyan Koolom Temple is located at latitude 12 ° 21′0 and longitude 12 ° 21′0, 5 kilometers from Kanhangad and 69 km from Kannur. Madiyan Koolom  Legend and Etymology  Kshethrapalakan Eeshwaran who is the main deity of Madiyan Kovilakam and Udinur Kovilakam is the head of Alladadesham which stretches from Chittari to Olavara. Legend has it that he decides to 'sit' when he found his niche once he reached Madiyan on the midway of his journey from Udinur along with Vairajathan; after he was attracted by the smell of the Appam (which is still an offering in the temple renowned as 'Kooloth Appam') that was being prepared for Nadayil Bhagavathi who was the main deity of Koolom at the time. Seeing this \\"Sastha\\" and other disciples who were accompanying him called Thampuran as \\"Madiya\\" which means lazy in Malayalam which later came to be known as \\"Madiyan\\" Kshethra palakan. Vairajathan Theyyam Thampuran or Kshethrapalakan later sat on the lap of Kaalarathriamma, a goddess who was in her 'furious form' and enjoyed a Mother's love and affection eventually positioning himself facing towards the west of the temple. There is another popular belief that the word \\"Madiyan\\" was originated since he sat on the lap (Madi in Malayalam) of Kalarathriyamma. It was also an end to the \\"Shaktheya puja\\" which was performed there before. In the memory of Shakteya pooja, kallu (palm toddy) and fish are still brought inside the temple on the day of Kalasham.  History  The origins of the Sri Madiyan Kovilakam has very devotional stories. It's also famous in a way as a temple which also had entry for lower castes people even before the Temple Entry Proclamation in Kerala. Eshwaran is the main deity of the Madiyan Kovilakam who is a symbol of religious unity. The Paattu festival in the month of Dhanu and Kalasham festival in the month of Edavam are held together with unity and harmony irrespective of castes. The temple exists as a link for the Hindu-Muslim unity in the region. The devotion of the Muslims in this area and their respect of other religions was the reason why the site where an Athiyal temple was located was granted to build the first mosque. The friendship between Muslims and Hindus is inevitable for the rituals. The Kshethrapalakan came to the earth under the command of Mahadeva to conquer that \\"Allada swaroopam\\". Alladaswarupam was a town stretching from Chittari river in the north to the \\"Olavara\\" River in the south. It was a customary for the kings to name their country as \\"Swaroopam\\" in the olden times. The region was ruled by a bad and ruthless lord known as Allohalan. At this time Kerala Varma, son of Kolathiri falls in love with \\"Pankipillayathiri Thamburatti\\" of Nediyirippu Swaroopam. In the aftermath protests, they both married. They had a desire to have their own country for their children. So they decided to conquer the kingdom of Allohalan. The guards kill him when he came to wash on the northern pond of the temple. Kerala Verma opened the fortress and owned it. The Kerala Varma later worshiped Kshethrapalakan and Kalarathri who helped him in his conquest. But most of the people around him were the people of Allohalan. For this reason, \\"Moolchary Nairachan\\" was appointed in the temple and he builds a palace in Nileshwaram and continued ruling from there along with the queen. Earlier outer Kalasham was held during the 2nd of Edavam to worship Nadayil Bagavathi by performing Theyyam, apart from Kshethrapalakan and Kaalarathriamma. It's believed to be complete only if all the inhabitants of the country will join it; which continues to this day. Madiyan Koolom still proudly exists as the headquarters of the Alladanadu or the town famed as the shrine of Lord Kshethrapalakan, son of Kaalarathriamma.  Order of Darshan  The temple follows a particular order to offer prayers or having darshan. 1\\\\. Naagam 2\\\\. Perattur Baghavathi 3\\\\. Maanjali Amma 4\\\\. Kshethrapalakan Eeshwaran 5\\\\. Kaalarathriamma  Architecture  The temple sprawls in a 6 acres of land out of which 3 acres consists of monuments built in traditional Kerala style architecture and is also famous for its sculptures and astonishing wooden carvings which depicts the ancient stories from Ramayana and other epics. Most of the carvings are found in Thekkini, western Gopuram and the Mandapa near the pond. The 'Thekkini Mandapam' near the temple kitchen has the etchings of Dakshayagam, Seethaswayamvaram and the Vanayathra of Rama and Lakshmana. All the wooden etchings in this portion of temple is partially or mostly destroyed as it's turned black due to the continuous exposure of smoke from the kitchen. This was reported even in the medias and there wasn't any response or action by the concerned authorities. Similarly the wooden carvings of 12 Raashis and Navagraha devatas in the pond Gopuram is completely destroyed by painting it with silver colour. Daru sculpture at Madiyan Koolom Temple, Kasargode, Kerala, India Daru sculpture at Madiyan Koolom Temple, Kasargode, Kerala, India The western gopuram shows instances of Amruthamadhanam, Kaliyamardhanam and Ananthashayanam. The etchings showing the premier of churning ocean of \\"Palazhi\\" using Vasuki to make Amrut (Kshir Sagar) looks extraordinarily beautiful. The carvings also includes erotic wooden etchings similar to those of the world-famous Khajuraho temple in Madhya Pradesh. A number of tourists visit here to see the marvel etchings and wooden carvings. It also has depiction of many mythical characters like those of the 'elephants with feathers'. The use and combination of natural colours obtained from unique plants and trees enhances the aesthetics of the carvings. A mural painting of the Narasimha avatar of Lord Vishnu is another attraction. The temple houses two ponds. There is a small sculpture of a 'bowing' elephant near the entrance which is believed to be a curse to an elephant who was about to enter the temple as elephants are not permitted inside the temple premises. Similarly there is another sculpture of a snake in one of the ponds which is again believed to be a curse as legend has it that the snake was send to spew venom in the pond. Now the temple paintings and carvings are in the stage of complete deterioration due to recklessness and negligence of the Malabar Devaswom board. The question of existence of marvellous works of this ancient temple is what remains at the end. = Theyyams = * Kshethrapalakan Eeshwaran * Kalarathri Amma * Nadayil Bhagavathi Theyyam * Manavalan & Manavatty Theyyam * Manjaliamma Theyyam See also *Kanhangad *Nileshwaram *Madhur Temple *Ananthapura Lake Temple *Temples of Kerala References External links *http://travelkannur.com/theyyam-kavu/kasaragod-kanhangad- madiyan-koolom-temple/ *https://www.justkerala.in/tourism/pilgrimage/temples/madiyan-kooloom-temple *http://www.keralaculture.org/kerala-festivals/pattu-utsavam/72/3 Category:Hindu temples in Kasaragod district ","title":"Sree Madiyan Koolom Temple"},{"id":"59652121","text":"The Petite Bosse (French: Little Hump) is a snowy bulge, culminating at 4,547 m, on the border of France and Italy on the so-called normal routes towards the summit of Mont Blanc (the Bosses Ridge), between the Grande Bosse and the rocky protrusion known as the Rocher(s) de la Tournette.

In 1953 he took over the office, which he held until 1984. After the office of Thomaskantor became vacant in 1960 due to Kurt Thomas' departure, he fulfilled it provisionally until Erhard Mauersberger was appointed by the city of Leipzig in 1961. From 1960 Kästner taught organ and harpsichord at the Hochschule für Musik in Leipzig, where he was appointed professor for organ playing in 1984. He held this teaching post until his death. Kästner played the harpsichord in the Leipzig Bach Orchestra.

There are four vertices on the outside face, eight vertices on the second layer (light yellow), and two vertices on the third layer (darker yellow). Because of the symmetries of the graph, no other embedding has fewer layers. In graph theory, a k-outerplanar graph is a planar graph that has a planar embedding in which the vertices belong to at most k concentric layers. The outerplanarity index of a planar graph is the minimum value of k for which it is k-outerplanar. Definition An outerplanar graph (or 1-outerplanar graph) has all of its vertices on the unbounded (outside) face of the graph. A 2-outerplanar graph is a planar graph with the property that, when the vertices on the unbounded face are removed, the remaining vertices all lie on the newly formed unbounded face. And so on. More formally, a graph is k-outerplanar if it has a planar embedding such that, for every vertex, there is an alternating sequence of at most k faces and k vertices of the embedding, starting with the unbounded face and ending with the vertex, in which each consecutive face and vertex are incident to each other. Properties and applications The k-outerplanar graphs have treewidth at most 3k-1. However, some bounded-treewidth planar graphs such as the nested triangles graph may be k-outerplanar only for very large k, linear in the number of vertices. Baker's technique covers a planar graph with a constant number of k-outerplanar graphs and uses their low treewidth in order to quickly approximate several hard graph optimization problems.. In connection with the GNRS conjecture on metric embedding of minor-closed graph families, the k-outerplanar graphs are one of the most general classes of graphs for which the conjecture has been proved. A conjectured converse of Courcelle's theorem, according to which every graph property recognizable on graphs of bounded treewidth by finite state tree automata is definable in the monadic second-order logic of graphs, has been proven for the k-outerplanar graphs. Recognition The smallest value of k for which a given graph is k-outerplanar (its outerplanarity index) can be computed in quadratic time. References Category:Planar graphs ","title":"K-outerplanar graph"},{"id":"59652628","text":"In theoretical computer science and metric geometry, the GNRS conjecture connects the theory of graph minors, the stretch factor of embeddings, and the approximation ratio of multi-commodity flow problems. It is named after Anupam Gupta, Ilan Newman, Yuri Rabinovich, and Alistair Sinclair, who formulated it in 2004. Formulation One formulation of the conjecture involves embeddings of the shortest path distances of weighted undirected graphs into \\\\ell_1 spaces, real vector spaces in which the distance between two vectors is the sum of their coordinate differences. If an embedding maps all pairs of vertices with distance d to pairs of vectors with distance in the range [cd,Cd] then its stretch factor or distortion is the ratio C/c; an isometry has stretch factor one, and all other embeddings have greater stretch factor. The graphs that have an embedding with at most a given distortion are closed under graph minor operations, operations that delete vertices or edges from a graph or contract some of its edges. The GNRS conjecture states that, conversely, every nontrivial minor-closed family of graphs can be embedded into an \\\\ell_1 space with bounded distortion. That is, the distortion of graphs in the family is bounded by a constant that depends on the family but not on the individual graphs. For instance, the planar graphs are closed under minors. Therefore, it would follow from the GNRS conjecture that the planar graphs have bounded distortion. An alternative formulation involves analogues of the max-flow min-cut theorem for undirected multi-commodity flow problems. The ratio of the maximum flow to the minimum cut, in such problems, is known as the flow-cut gap. The largest flow-cut gap that a flow problem can have on a given graph equals the distortion of the optimal \\\\ell_1 embedding of the graph. Therefore, the GNRS conjecture can be rephrased as stating that the minor-closed families of graphs have bounded flow-cut gap. Related results Arbitrary n-vertex graphs (indeed, arbitrary n-point metric spaces) have \\\\ell_1 embeddings with distortion O(\\\\log n). Some graphs have logarithmic flow-cut gap, and in particular this is true for a multicommodity flow with every pair of vertices having equal demand on a bounded-degree expander graph. Therefore, this logarithmic bound on the distortion of arbitrary graphs is tight. Planar graphs can be embedded with smaller distortion, O(\\\\sqrt{\\\\log n}). Although the GNRS conjecture remains unsolved, it has been proven for some minor-closed graph families that bounded-distortion embeddings exist. These include the series-parallel graphs and the graphs of bounded circuit rank, the graphs of bounded pathwidth, the 2-clique-sums of graphs of bounded size, and the k-outerplanar graphs. In contrast to the behavior of metric embeddings into \\\\ell_1 spaces, every finite metric space has embeddings into \\\\ell_2 with stretch arbitrarily close to one by the Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma, and into \\\\ell_\\\\infty spaces with stretch exactly one by the tight span construction.

It represents one of Elizabeth Daily's earliest starring roles.  Plot  The film centers around a group of elderly residents of an old San Francisco hotel and are threatened with eviction when a developer wants to demolish the structure. Initially, they feel resigned to their fate, but a young desk clerk (Dailey) gets involved and helps spearhead a resistance.  Cast  * Elizabeth Daily as Sadie * Larry Breeding as Eddie * Ned Glass as Sam * Marjorie Eaton as Mildred  Production  Bowen, who was 37 at the time she filmed Street Music, conceived the idea during a lull on the production of Apocalypse Now, where she was working as a recording engineer. She was walking from Francis Ford Coppola's offices and stumbled upon a group of elderly people who were being evicted from their longtime home. Bowen also recounted working as a bookkeeper at a run-down San Francisco hotel while beginning her acting career and seeing people being evicted. She based the film's central character on a roommate she had who was a street singer and a dancer. Neither she nor her husband—cinematographer Richard Bowen—had any experience writing or directing at the time. The pair raised an initial $450,000 and later realized they'd need another $150,000, which brought the total to $600,000. The money came in chunks, as some of the bigger names had suggested things like turning the script into an \\"old peoples' 'Animal House.'\\" The film was shot on location in San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood over the course of 37 days, beginning in October 1980. They shot inside the then-abandoned Hotel Hamlin on Eddy Street that they refurbished, as well as on the surrounding streets. During the duration of the filming, the Bowens had to deal with an actors' strike, ruptured water pipes, a car crash, and an actor having a heart attack. Sadly, co-star Larry Breeding died in a car crash three months before the film's premiere.  Reception  The film played at a number of film festivals, and tied for first place in the independent feature section at the U.S. Film Festival. Reviews were mostly positive; The San Francisco Examiner's Nancy Scott called it \\"an intelligent balance between the bitter and the sweet,\\" and says that it was filmed \\"with a clear, loving and unpretentious eye.\\" Robert Redford liked the film so much he connected the Bowens with funding through the Sundance Institute for their second film.

The theory developed within the context of pre-Nazi scientific racism, placing Turks as one of the \\"Alpine subgroup\\" of the Caucasian race. The intent of the theory was a rejection of Western European assertions that Turks belonged to the \\"yellow or mongol\\" race. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk took a personal interest in the subject after he was shown a French language book that claimed Turks \\"belonged to the yellow race\\" and were a \\"secondaire\\" people. In the aftermath of World War I, Turks strove to prove to Western nations that they were equals and at this time this carried not only historical connotations, but racial ones. The Turkish History Thesis created a third alternative to the existing narratives that Greece and/or Mesopotamia were the \\"cradle\\" of Western civilization, but the thesis itself rested on a spurious intellectual foundation by claiming Hittite ancestry through a convoluted logic that rested on a theory of Central Asian Aryan origin that was being promoted by some European writers of the era. The thesis insisted on a common racial origin for all Turkish people who had created a great civilization in their Central Asian homeland in prehistoric times and have since preserved the same language and racial characteristics. According to the thesis, Turks had originally migrated from Central Asia to China and then India, founding the civilizations of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, continuing to diverse parts of the world. The thesis pushed a view that Turks were racially what was called \\"brachycephalic\\", and thus racially similar to other Central Europeans. The internal contradictions of the Turkish History Thesis became more pronounced in later decades as Colonel Kurtcebe sought to raise modern Turks awareness of their connection to Central Asia and the Mongols. He believed that an emphasis on Western-style historical education had caused Turks to be uninterested in Mongolian history. This produced a confused doctrine where military publications had to maintain the Turkish History Thesis' connection with European races, but at the same time promote an image of a military superior to Western powers with roots in a mythic Central Asian past. The thesis was based on the book Türk Tarihinin Ana Hatları (The Mainlines of Turkish History), published by the Committee for the Study of the Turkish History 1930, becoming a \\"state dogma\\", and later included in school textbooks. The Thesis was made known to the public during the First Turkish Historical Congress between 2 - 11 July 1932. During Atatürk's government, scholars were encouraged that the findings of their studies in history and social sciences be in line with the Turkish Historical Thesis and the Sun Language Theory.

He also painted portraits and drew illustrations. Artistic career Hamilton Hamilton was born in Oxford, England, on 1 April 1847. While young, he was a protégé of John Ruskin. In 1872, he began his mostly self-taught career as a portrait artist in Buffalo, New York. He created 47 landscape paintings during an 1873 expedition to Colorado which were chosen to be part of the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. He spent 1878 and 1879 painting in Pont-Aven, Brittany, alongside Barbizon School painters. He moved to New York City in 1881 and shortly after began to practice genre painting and etching. He became an associate member of the National Academy of Design in 1886 and a National Academician in 1889. Until the end of the century, he and his family resided alternately in upstate New York, Long Island, Colorado, and England. In 1907 and 1908, Hamilton spent two years painting landscapes in Southern California. In 1912 he and his family permanently moved to Norwalk, Connecticut. There he became involved with the Silvermine group of artists led by Solon Borglum. After Borglum's death, he and others founded the Silvermine Guild of Artists. At the time of his death, he was known as the dean of the group. His works are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Phoenix Art Museum, the National Gallery of Art, the Akron Art Museum, and the East Hampton Historical Society. Artistic style Hamilton was known for his landscape paintings of the American West, New York, Connecticut, England, and France. He used multiple layers of colors to execute his landscapes, suggesting the influence of Impressionism. He also did portraiture and illustrations. Personal life Hamilton married Helen McIlhenney (sister of artist Charles Morgan McIlhenney). In 1889, they had twin daughters, Helen and Marguerite, who served as his models. Both daughters grew up to be artists; Helen in particular became a noted Post-Impressionist landscape painter. Hamilton died in Norwalk, Connecticut, on 4 January 1928, aged 80.

A Syracusan army, led by Dionysius I, was defeated by a Carthaginian army, led by Himilco Mago, Mago II's son. The Carthaginians won the day having routed the enemy army. Leptines, Dionysius' brother, was killed during the battle. The location of Cronium is considered to be close to modern Palermo. Background Dionysius, the tyrant of Syracuse, having concluded a peace treaty with the Carthaginians after the Battle of Chrysas, was looking for a reason to renew the war. He found one when the subjugated cities of the Carthaginians started a revolt. Dionysius allied himself with the cities. The Carthaginians sent envoys to Dionysius to ask for the return of their subject cities, but they were ignored, so the war was renewed. The Carthaginians sent an army to Sicily to confront Dionysius. Their army, however, was defeated at Cabala. The Carthaginian King-general, Mago II, died in battle and his son, Himilco Margo, became the new general. The Carthaginians had concluded a truce for a few days, but having expired, the two armies confronted each other again, this time at Cronium. Battle The battle started with a tough fight on one of the Syracusan wings, where Leptines was stationed. Leptines was said to have died a glorious death, having killed many enemies.Diodorus Sicullus, 15.17.1 At his fall the Carthaginians were emboldened; they began pushing and were able to rout their enemies. Dionysius, whose troops were a select band,Diodorus Sicullus, 15.17.2 were winning the fight, but after having received the news of the fall of Leptines and the defeat of the other wing, they were dismayed and took flight. When the rout became general, the Carthaginians pursued the more eagerly and called out to one another to take no captives; and so all those who were caught were put to death. The Syracusan casualties were found to number more than fourteen thousand. Aftermath After this great victory, the Carthaginians returned to Panormus. They sent envoys to Dionysius and gave him the chance to end the war. The tyrant accepted the envoys' offer, and a truce was concluded. This included that both sides kept their territory, but with only one exception, the Carthaginians receiving Selinous and Acragas. Dionysius had to pay the Carthaginians 1,000 talents.

It is located at a distance of circa 60 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 1381 is about 55,000 light years across. It is a member of the Fornax Cluster. NGC 1381 appears edge-on and features a thin disk with high surface brightness and a boxy bulge.Sandage, A., Bedke, J. (1994), The Carnegie Atlas of Galaxies. Volume I, Carnegie Institution of Washington Both the box-shaped bulge and the kinematics of the central area of the galaxy suggest that NGC 1381 has a bar. NGC 1381 was discovered by Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt on January 19, 1865. Julius Schmidt was then director of the National Observatory of Athens and he was inspecting the Cape catalogue nebulae with a 6 ft refractor. Along with NGC 1381, he also discovered the nearby galaxies NGC 1382, NGC 1386, NGC 1389, and NGC 1428. The publication of their discovery was delayed by 10 years and was published in 1876 with the work Über einige im Cape-Catalog fehlende Nebel. NGC 1381 lies at the core of the Fornax Cluster. It lies within a region with increased density of candidate globular clusters nearly half a degree across that connects the elliptical galaxy NGC 1399 with its surrounding galaxies like NGC 1404, NGC 1387, and NGC 1380B. This structure is considered to be the result of the interactions between the cluster galaxies. A region with intracluster light has also being discovered between NGC 1381, NGC 1387, and NGC 1379. It is suggested that it was created by the tidal stripping of stars and globular clusters from the galaxies.

Up until now this name is still used as an informal name for the temple. In 1767, King Taksin incorporated the temple as part of his Thonburi Palace. Later, in Rattanakosin period, King Phutthaloetla Naphalai (Rama ll) renovated the ordination hall and renamed \\"Wat Phutthaisawan\\" (วัดพุทไธสวรรค์). When King Nangklao (Rama lll) restored all the temple and rename to \\"Wat Molilokyasutharam\\" (วัดโมลีโลกยสุธาราม) and changed to Wat Molilokkayaram in the present. In addition, this temple is also a place of study for the son of King Phutthaloetla Naphalai in childhood. In 1997, the abbot of the temple further developed and upgrading to Pali school for novice and monk. At present, it is the school that has the most Pali-winning students in Thailand.

Kenya Erskine was invited to Kenya by a businessman with connections to Lord Delamere, and he soon set up a successful grocer business. In 1951, together with Archie Evans, he co-founded the Kenya Amateur Athletics Association (KAAA), which would later become Athletics Kenya.

The first part of the Ferrocarril Central Andino that was built in Peru was the railway between Callao and Lima. To build this railway Westhoff was sent to purchase railway sleepers. Westhoff arrived this way to Ancud from where he administered a Pilgerodendron uviferum () logging industry in Guaitecas Archipelago in Patagonia. For the purpose of overseeing the business he founded the settlement of Melinka in 1860, the first permanent settlement in Guaitecas Archipelago. Westhoff had exclusive logging rights in Guaitecas and was granted the position of subdelegado marítimo by Chilean authorities. While he held this position of authority until the early 1870s, in reality it implied few benefits. While not longer an agent of Ferrocarril Central Andino he continued to export sleepers to Peru. Westhoff was active in the logging industry in the 1860s and early 1870s becoming a wealthy man. When retiring from the wood industry he settled in Valdivia working as a teacher. After the retirement of Westhoff, Ciriaco Álvarez, a native from Chonchi, rose as the most prominent Pilgerodendron uviferum businessman in the area. Citing alleged analogies with the Urals, New Zealand and Colombia Westhoff believed the Chonos-Guaitecas archipelago to have great mineral wealth to be discovered. Westhoff was critical of the intentional forest fires and allegedly ineffective sea lion hunting techniques used by Chilotes travelling south to the archipelagoes of Guaitecas and Chonos.

In the 16th century, the Montmorencys added a brick top floor, used as a dovecote, to the gatehouse. In 1570, the castle was confiscated by Philip II of Spain from Floris de Montmorency.

Bullesi lived as a refugee during World War I after his hometown was declared a war zone; he did his education in the cities he was forced to relocate to before being able to move back to his hometown following the end of the war. He became a naval officer after being drafted and following that became a draftsman in Pula. He was noted among his colleagues for his enthusiasm in addition to his pious nature. He entered Catholic Action and the Secular Franciscans in 1920 while also working for the Vincentian communities in his region. The beatification process for Bullesi launched in the 1970s in Trieste and he became titled as a Servant of God. The confirmation of his life of heroic virtue in 1997 allowed for Pope John Paul II to name him as Venerable. Life Egidio Bullesi was born in Pula on 24 August 1905 as the third of nine children to the poor Francesco Bullesi and Maria Diritti; he was baptized in the Pula Cathedral. His father worked in Pula as a naval technical designer. Two of his siblings were Maria and Giovanni. The outbreak of World War I in 1914 caused his hometown to be declared a war zone thus resulting in most of the population in the area being deemed refugees due to their internment in Rovinj and then in Graz in 1915. The Bullesi's also moved to Szeghedin and Wagna during this period. He was forced to remain with his mother and siblings in relative quiet during this dangerous period while his father was separated from them continuing his work in Pula. He did his schooling from place to place during this period but made the effort to attend evening classes for further education due to disruptions in his studies. He managed to settle in Rovigo for some time. Bullesi became an apprentice at the docks after he turned thirteen in Pula at the war's end in 1919 after the Bullesi's were able to return to Pula. He later joined Catholic Action (after his sister Maria joined) on 2 July 1920 in addition to joining the Secular Franciscan Order that 4 October - the feast of Saint Francis of Assisi. Upon entering the order he took the religious name Ludovico. The preaching of the Franciscan priest Tito Castagna inspired him so much so that he entered the order soon after. In 1921 he attended the National Congress in Rome for the fiftieth commemoration of the Catholic Youth. Bullesi served in the Italian naval forces after he was drafted into it in February 1925 (serving on the battleship Dante Alighieri) and after he was discharged on 15 March 1927 became a draftsman in the docks at Monfalcone. During his conscription he worked alongside Guido Foghin who was indifferent to faith and was no longer practicing his faith. But his time with Bullesi changed his views on faith so much so that he became a Franciscan priest upon Bullesi's death and served in the Chinese and Guatemalan mission as Father Egidio-Maria. He taught catechism at his local parish and also was known to collaborate from time to time with the Vincentian communities in the area. He suffered from bronchitis that evolved into tuberculosis prompting him to be admitted into hospital in Pula on 29 August 1928. In hospital he ministered to those in need despite his condition weakening over time. He died from tuberculosis in the morning on 25 April 1929; he was buried in the Franciscan habit in Pula. His remains were later relocated in 1974 to the island of Barbana near Grado. Beatification process The beatification process opened on 23 August 1973 - he became titled as a Servant of God - once the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the \\"nihil obstat\\" decree therefore enabling for the cause to open in the Trieste diocese. The cognitional process for the investigation opened in Trieste on 6 May 1974 and later concluded on 6 December 1977 at which stage the evidence collected was sent to the C.C.S. in Rome who later validated the process on 10 October 1990 as having adhered to their rules for conducting sainthood causes. The postulation later compiled and sent the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. in Rome for further investigation at which point theologians assented to the cause on 12 November 1996 as did the C.C.S. on 6 May 1997. Pope John Paul II named Bullesi as Venerable on 7 July 1997 after confirming that he had practiced heroic virtue during his life. The current postulator for this is the Franciscan priest Giovangiuseppe Califano.

Fiestas patronales (patron saint festivals) are held in the central plaza every year. The central plaza history The central plaza, or square, is a place for official and unofficial recreational events and a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies, Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza's purpose was for \\"the parties\\" (celebrations, festivities) (), and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors (). These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain.

The force is said to have consisted of 300 armed Scythians (a nomadic people living in the Eurasian Steppe) who were public slaves in Athens. They acted for a group of eleven elected Athenian magistrates \\"who were responsible for arrests and executions and for some aspects of public order\\" in the city. One of Aristophanes's comedies has a Scythian archer as a character, and he speaks broken Greek with an accent. Name The Scythian archers were called toxotai (, literally \\"[the] archers\\"), Skythai (, literally \\"[the] Scythians\\"), and Speusinioi (), which was named after a certain Speusinos, the alleged founder of the force.Rhodes, Peter J. (Durham), “Scythians”, in: Brill's New Pauly, Antiquity volumes edited by: Hubert Cancik and , Helmuth Schneider, English Edition by: Christine F. Salazar, Classical Tradition volumes edited by: Manfred Landfester, English Edition by: Francis G. Gentry. Consulted online on 13 January 2019 Theory The theory regarding the \\"police force\\" role of the Scythian archers in 5th- and early 4th-century BC Athens is mainly based on some possible evidence from Attic vase paintings and the works of the ancient Athenian playwright Aristophanes. The force is said to have consisted of 300 public slaves (demosioi) who wore Scythian dress and were equipped with bows and arrows in gorytos (the Scythian people were skilled archers). As portrayed on Attic vase paintings, the Scythian archers were distinguished by high pointed headdresses and wide trousers. They were said to have been used to maintain order in the Assembly and the Council, though they had little authority themselves. They acted for The Eleven, a group of eleven elected magistrates in Athens, \\"who were responsible for arrests and executions and for some aspects of public order\\". Analysis Many aspects of the theory are still open for discussion, such as whether they were actually Scythian, and if so why Greeks were not used, and why a police force active in urban Athens should consist of archers. Balbina Bäbler has discussed some overlooked archaeological evidence and its possible link to the Scythian police force, including the stele of Getes, buried Scythian arrowheads, and other Greek- style grave stelae of the 4th century BC in Athens dedicated to unknown Scythians. The Scythian archers that appear to be attending to the hoplites on the Attic vase paintings of the 6th century BC are not necessarily related to the Scythian \\"police force\\" of the 5th century BC. The police force, the number of which is said to have swelled to 1,200 at some point, may have been involved in wartime conflicts as well. In the comedy works of Aristophanes, the dialects of various Greek people are imitated. In his Thesmophoriazusae, the Scythian archer speaks broken Greek, consistently omitting the final -s (-ς) and -n (ν), using the lenis in place of the aspirate, and once using x (ξ) in place of s (σ). These have been noted by John William Donaldson to discuss the largely unknown Scythian languages.

He was born in Brooklyn, New York on November 7, 1925, to Benjamin Szabo of Felso Viso, Hungary (1885-1964) and Jeanette Szabo (née Margolies) of New York, New York (1895-1980). Szabo was a tenured professor of architecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design (GSD) and at the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies (VES), Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts. He co- founded the latter, together with Eduard Sekler in 1968. He was author, with his wife, architect Brenda Dyer Szabo (1926-2017), of “Preliminary Notes on the Indigenous Architecture of Afghanistan” (Harvard Graduate School of Design, 1978) and, with anthropologist, Thomas Barfield, of, “Afghanistan: An Atlas of Indigenous Domestic Architecture” (University of Texas Press, 1991). He died in Cambridge, MA on December 17, 2003. Biography Albert Szabo was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1925. He studied Science and Fine Arts at Brooklyn College from 1942 to 1947 under the guidance of architect, Serge Chermayeff. There was a break in his education during World War II when he enlisted to join the war effort in 1941 and was called to service (air force) in 1943. He received an honorable discharge as an Aviation Cadet when the war ended in 1945. During his time at Brooklyn College he spent summers as apprentice to Bauhaus architect, Marcel Breuer. He was graduated from Brooklyn College in 1947. Following the advice of Chermayeff, he then moved to Chicago, where he studied at the Chicago Institute of Design (formerly The New Bauhaus)(1947-1948). His involvement at the Chicago Institute of Design led to his first teaching appointment which was also at the Institute of Design. In 1948 he returned to Harvard to earn his degree in Architecture (1952) at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, then chaired by Walter Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus in Germany. In 1954 he was invited to join the faculty at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where he taught for 42 years. From 1974 to 1976 he was a lecturer for the Fulbright Program in Architecture at Kabul University, Afghanistan. While there, he studied the country's indigenous architecture, which led to the publication in 1991 of the book, “Afghanistan: An Atlas of Indigenous Domestic Architecture”, named an outstanding academic book by the American Library Association. His experiences in the Middle East also led him in 1979 to create a seminar on indigenous architecture, the first of its kind at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. Teaching the class helped him to further develop his theories regarding the relationship between culture, climate, and context as basic to the evolution of form and purpose in indigenous and contemporary architecture. In addition to teaching, Szabo maintained an architectural practice with his wife, Brenda Dyer Szabo, also a graduate of the Harvard Graduate School of Design (Szabo Associates). Szabo also had an architectural practice with architect Jerzy Soltan, the Nelson Robinson Jr. Professor of Architecture and Urban Design Emeritus at the Harvard Graduate School of Design (Soltan/Szabo Associates.) Szabo retired in 1996. His post-retirement years were chiefly occupied with the making of art, particularly the creation of sculpture from found objects such as typewriters, tool handles, barrel staves, and shoe forms. In summer 2001 the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, Harvard University held an exhibition of his work, titled “Inventions + Interventions.” An exhibition catalogue was issued by the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts. Between 2012 and 2014 a collection was donated to Harvard University (the Frances Loeb Library Special Collections Rare), as well as to the Bauhaus-Archiv museum für gestaltung Education Albert Szabo was enrolled in Science Studies at Brooklyn College, Brooklyn, NY from 1942 to 1944. From 1946 to 1947 he concentrated in Fine Arts Studies, at the same college. From 1947 to 1948 he studied at the Chicago Institute of Design (formerly New Bauhaus, IIT Institute of Design), in Chicago, IL. He received his Master of Architecture degree from the Harvard Graduate School of Design, in 1952. Academic experience Szabo's first teaching appointment was as instructor (1951-1954) at the Chicago Institute of Design (formerly New Bauhaus) in Chicago, IL. In 1954 he was invited to join the Faculty at the Harvard Graduate School of Design in Cambridge, MA. His next appointment (1964-1968) was as Chairman of the Department of Architectural Sciences, Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University. From 1967–1968, in addition to his appointments at Harvard, he was Visiting Professor of Architecture at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. From 1970 to 1972 he held the position of chairman of the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University. In 1974 he was Acting Curator for the Loeb Fellowship in Advanced Environmental Studies, Harvard Graduate School of Design. Szabo was Fulbright Lecturer in Architecture from 1974 to 1976 at Kabul University, Kabul, Afghanistan and in 1983, acted as Visiting Professor and Consultant on Curriculum at King Faisal University, Al-Hofuf, Saudi Arabia. From 1970-1991 he held the position of Professor of Visual and Environmental Studies, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University and, from 1990 to 1992, the position of Acting Director at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University.

It was intended to serve the anglers on the River Dee, tourists, the 1874 Cambus O'May House hunting lodge and the local population of this rural district and stood 39 3⁄8 miles (63.4 km) from the Aberdeen (Joint) station. It was the last stop before Ballater.  History  Loading dock to the east of the station site. The station was opened as a basic halt in 1876 on the Deeside Railway by the Aboyne and Braemar Railway, the station building with its waiting room and ticket office was added at a later date. Closure to passengers took place on 28 February 1966 at which time the station was once again designated a halt.Canmore - Cambus O'May Halt Gunpowder was delivered by train for use at the nearby quarry at Tomnakiesk where pink granite was worked and used as ballast, reached by a siding to the east of the station. The Great North of Scotland Railway directors held their weekend board meetings in the company directors saloon that was shunted into a siding for that purpose. In 1923 the line became part of the London and North Eastern Railway and in 1948 part of British Railways. Passenger services were withdrawn on 28 February 1966 and the line was closed completely to Ballater on 18 July 1966. The body of a GNoSR carriage stood close to the station for many years. The siding at the old loading dock was the site of a LNER camping coach from 1935 to 1939 and possibly one for some of 1934 until it was moved to Aboyne after 1948. This loading dock had been opened by the Aboyne and Braemar Railway prior to the station in conjunction with the ballast quarry but was also used to handle cattle and timber traffic.RailScot - Cambus O'May In 1928 the stationmaster was Alexander Roy, followed by his wife Maggie Roy who remained in charge until the station became unstaffed in 1956, sometime after which it became a request stop and some trains did not call at all.

Cheah opened this location after he \\"saw opportunity in Boston's Chinatown\\". By 1998, two more locations were scheduled to be opened. The restaurant had a menu which contain 150 items. The restaurant also focuses on Indian and Chinese cuisine. In 2001, the chain opened a location in Bethesda, Maryland. The location is owned by family member Kevin Cheah. In 2014, the Bethesda location underwent $60,000 in innovations and was closed for several weeks.

His playing career included spells with Raith Rovers, Livingston, East Fife and Berwick Rangers in Scotland, and Leiftur in Iceland. He has coached in Scotland, New Zealand and in Canada, where he was with Vancouver Whitecaps FC. Early life Gordon Forrest was born in Dunfermline, Fife, on 14 January 1977. He was educated at Woodmill High School in the town and supported local football club Dunfermline Athletic. Playing career Forrest began his senior career with Raith Rovers, joining as a youth from Rosyth Recreation in 1993. He made his Raith debut against Celtic in 1996 and also played in the UEFA Cup. When his former Raith manager Jimmy Nicholl moved to Millwall, Forrest had an extended trial with the English club before joining Livingston in 1997. After two and a half years there, he left in 1999 for a short spell in Iceland with Leiftur, where he again appeared in the UEFA Cup. Returning to Scotland, he joined East Fife in October 1999. He then joined Berwick Rangers in 2000, making over 100 league appearances before leaving in 2005. Forrest ended his playing career with amateur club Burntisland Shipyard. Coaching career Having left senior football whilst still in his twenties, Forrest concentrated on his coaching career, obtaining a UEFA 'A' licence and youth and child coaching licences from the Scottish Football Association (SFA). He went on to work for the SFA as a Youth Development Officer in Edinburgh and Fife. In 2009 he returned to East Fife, working as first team coach under manager Stevie Crawford. In 2011, he emigrated to New Zealand to work as a football development manager for the Northern Football Federation. He was also assistant coach for the New Zealand women's national team at the 2012 Summer Olympics. In October 2012, Forrest joined Canadian-based Major League Soccer (MLS) franchise Vancouver Whitecaps FC as head coach of their under-18 team and manager of coaching development. In January 2014 was promoted to working with the MLS team as an assistant coach to Carl Robinson. Whitecaps released Robinson and his coaching team, including Forrest, in September 2018. Forrest returned to Scotland in January 2019 to take up the position of assistant head coach to Robbie Neilson at Scottish Championship club Dundee United, a role he shared with Lee McCulloch from June 2019 onwards. When Neilson left the club in June 2020 to become manager at Heart of Midlothian, Forrest and McCulloch were initially placed in temporary charge at United before joining Hearts as Neilson's assistants.

Thanks to the max-flow min-cut theorem, determining the minimum cut over a graph representing a flow network is equivalent to computing the maximum flow over the network. Given a pseudo- Boolean function f, if it is possible to construct a flow network with positive weights such that * each cut C of the network can be mapped to an assignment of variables \\\\mathbf{x} to f (and vice versa), and * the cost of C equals f(\\\\mathbf{x}) (up to an additive constant) then it is possible to find the global optimum of f in polynomial time by computing a minimum cut of the graph. The mapping between cuts and variable assignments is done by representing each variable with one node in the graph and, given a cut, each variable will have a value of 0 if the corresponding node belongs to the component connected to the source, or 1 if it belong to the component connected to the sink. Not all pseudo-Boolean functions can be represented by a flow network, and in the general case the global optimization problem is NP- hard. There exist sufficient conditions to characterise families of functions that can be optimised through graph cuts, such as submodular quadratic functions. Graph cut optimization can be extended to functions of discrete variables with a finite number of values, that can be approached with iterative algorithms with strong optimality properties, computing one graph cut at each iteration. Graph cut optimization is an important tool for inference over graphical models such as Markov random fields or conditional random fields, and it has applications in computer vision problems such as image segmentation, denoising, registration and stereo matching..  Representability  A pseudo-Boolean function f: \\\\\\\\{0, 1\\\\\\\\}^n \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} is said to be representable if there exists a graph G = (V, E) with non- negative weights and with source and sink nodes s and t respectively, and there exists a set of nodes V_0 = \\\\\\\\{v_1, \\\\dots, v_n\\\\\\\\} \\\\subset V - \\\\\\\\{s, t\\\\\\\\} such that, for each tuple of values (x_1, \\\\dots, x_n) \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0, 1\\\\\\\\}^n assigned to the variables, f(x_1, \\\\dots, x_n) equals (up to a constant) the value of the flow determined by a minimum cut C = (S, T) of the graph G such that v_i \\\\in S if x_i = 0 and v_i \\\\in T if x_i = 1. It is possible to classify pseudo-Boolean functions according to their order, determined by the maximum number of variables contributing to each single term. All first order functions, where each term depends upon at most one variable, are always representable. Quadratic functions : f(\\\\mathbf{x}) = w_0 + \\\\sum_i w_i(x_i) + \\\\sum_{i < j} w_{ij}(x_i, x_j) . are representable if and only if they are submodular, i.e. for each quadratic term w_{ij} the following condition is satisfied : w_{ij}(0, 0) + w_{ij}(1, 1) \\\\le w_{ij}(0, 1) + w_{ij}(1, 0) . Cubic functions : f(\\\\mathbf{x}) = w_0 + \\\\sum_i w_i(x_i) + \\\\sum_{i < j} w_{ij}(x_i, x_j) + \\\\sum_{i < j < k} w_{ijk}(x_i, x_j, x_k) are representable if and only if they are regular, i.e. all possible binary projections to two variables, obtained by fixing the value of the remaining variable, are submodular. For higher-order functions, regularity is a necessary condition for representability.  Graph construction  Graph construction for a representable function is simplified by the fact that the sum of two representable functions f' and f is representable, and its graph G = (V' \\\\cup V, E' \\\\cup E) is the union of the graphs G' = (V', E') and G = (V, E) representing the two functions. Such theorem allows to build separate graphs representing each term and combine them to obtain a graph representing the entire function. The graph representing a quadratic function of n variables contains n + 2 vertices, two of them representing the source and sink and the others representing the variables. When representing higher-order functions, the graph contains auxiliary nodes that allow to model higher-order interactions. = Unary terms = A unary term w_i depends only on one variable x_i and can be represented by a graph with one non-terminal node v_i and one edge s \\\\rightarrow v_i with weight w_i(1) - w_i(0) if w_i(1) \\\\ge w_i(0), or v_i \\\\rightarrow t with weight w_i(0) - w_i(1) if w_i(1) < w_i(0). = Binary terms = Example of a graph representing a quadratic term w_{ij}(x_i, x_j) in case w_{ij}(1, 0) - w_{ij}(0, 0) > 0 and w_{ij}(1, 1) - w_{ij}(1, 0) < 0. A quadratic (or binary) term w_{ij} can be represented by a graph containing two non-terminal nodes v_i and v_j. The term can be rewritten as :w_{ij}(x_i, x_j) = w_{ij}(0, 0) + k_i x_i + k_j x_j + k_{ij} \\\\left( (1 - x_i) x_j + x_i (1 - x_j) \\\\right) with : \\\\begin{align} k_i &= \\\\frac{1}{2} (w_{ij}(1, 0) - w_{ij}(0, 0)) \\\\\\\\\\\\ k_j &= \\\\frac{1}{2} (w_{ij}(1, 1) - w_{ij}(1, 0)) \\\\\\\\\\\\ k_{ij} &= \\\\frac{1}{2} (w_{ij}(0, 1) + w_{ij}(1, 0) - w_{ij}(0, 0) - w_{ij}(1, 1)) . \\\\end{align} In this expression, the first term is constant and it is not represented by any edge, the two following terms depend on one variable and are represented by one edge, as shown in the previous section for unary terms, while the third term is represented by an edge v_i \\\\rightarrow v_j with weight w_{ij}(0, 1) + w_{ij}(1, 0) - w_{ij}(0, 0) - w_{ij}(1, 1) (submodularity guarantees that the weight is non-negative). = Ternary terms = A cubic (or ternary) term w_{ijk} can be represented by a graph with four non-terminal nodes, three of them (v_i, v_j and v_k) associated to the three variables plus one fourth auxiliary node v_{ijk}. A generic ternary term can be rewritten as the sum of a constant, three unary terms, three binary terms, and a ternary term in simplified form. There may be two different cases, according to the sign of p = w_{ijk}(0, 0, 0) + w_{ijk}(0, 1, 1) + w_{ijk}(1, 0, 1) + w_{ijk}(1, 1, 0). If p > 0 then : w_{ijk}(x_i, x_j, x_k) = w_{ijk}(0, 0, 0) \\\\+ p_1 (x_i - 1) + p_2 (x_j - 1) + p_3 (x_k - 1) \\\\+ p_{23}(x_j - 1) x_k + p_{31} x_i (x_k - 1) + p_{12} (x_i - 1) x_j \\\\- p x_i x_j x_k Example of a graph representing the ternary term p x_i x_j x_k when p > 0 (left) and when p < 0 (right). with : \\\\begin{align} p_1 &= w_{ijk}(1, 0, 1) - w_{ijk}(0, 0, 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\ p_2 &= w_{ijk}(1, 1, 0) - w_{ijk}(1, 0, 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\ p_3 &= w_{ijk}(0, 1, 1) - w_{ijk}(0, 1, 0) \\\\\\\\\\\\ p_{23} &= w_{ijk}(0, 0, 1) + w_{ijk}(0, 1, 0) - w_{ijk}(0, 0, 0) - w_{ijk}(0, 1, 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\ p_{31} &= w_{ijk}(0, 0, 1) + w_{ijk}(1, 0, 0) - w_{ijk}(0, 0, 0) - w_{ijk}(1, 0, 1) \\\\\\\\\\\\ p_{12} &= w_{ijk}(0, 1, 0) + w_{ijk}(1, 0, 0) - w_{ijk}(0, 0, 0) - w_{ijk}(1, 1, 0) . \\\\end{align} If p < 0 the construction is similarly, but the variables will have opposite value. If the function is regular, then all its projections of two variables will be submodular, implying that p_{23}, p_{31} and p_{12} are positive and then all terms in the new representation are submodular. In this decomposition, the constant, unary and binary terms can be represented as shown in the previous sections. If p > 0 the ternary term can be represented with a graph with four edges v_i \\\\rightarrow v_{ijk}, v_j \\\\rightarrow v_{ijk}, v_k \\\\rightarrow v_{ijk}, v_{ijk} \\\\rightarrow t, all with weight p, while if p < 0 the term can be represented by four edges v_{ijk} \\\\rightarrow v_i, v_{ijk} \\\\rightarrow v_j, v_{ijk} \\\\rightarrow v_k, s \\\\rightarrow v_{ijk} with weight -p.  Minimum cut  After building a graph representing a pseudo-Boolean function, it is possible to compute a minimum cut using one among the various algorithms developed for flow networks, such as Ford–Fulkerson, Edmonds–Karp, and Boykov–Kolmogorov algorithm. The result is a partition of the graph in two connected components S and T such that s \\\\in S and t \\\\in T, and the function attains its global minimum when x_i = 0 for each i such that the corresponding node v_i \\\\in S, and x_i = 1 for each i such that the corresponding node v_i \\\\in T. Max-flow algorithms such as Boykov-Kolmogorov's are very efficient in practice for sequential computation, but they are difficult to parallelise, making them not suitable for distributed computing applications and preventing them from exploiting the potential of modern CPUs. Parallel max-flow algorithms were developed, such as push-relabel and jump-flood, that can also take advantage of hardware acceleration in GPGPU implementations.  Functions of discrete variables with more than two values  The previous construction allows global optimization of pseudo-Boolean functions only, but it can be extended to quadratic functions of discrete variables with a finite number of values, in the form :f(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\sum_{i \\\\in V} D(x_i) + \\\\sum_{(i, j) \\\\in E} S(x_i, x_j) where E \\\\subseteq V \\\\times V and x_i \\\\in \\\\Lambda = \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\dots, k\\\\\\\\}. The function D(x_i) represents the unary contribution of each variable (often referred as data term), while the function S(x_i, x_j) represents binary interactions between variables (smoothness term). In the general case, optimization of such functions is a NP-hard problem, and stochastic optimization methods such as simulated annealing are sensitive to local minima and in practice they can generate arbitrarily sub-optimal results. With graph cuts it is possible to construct move-making algorithms that allow to reach in polynomial time a local minima with strong optimality properties for a wide family of quadratic functions of practical interest (when the binary interaction S(x_i, x_j) is a metric or a semimetric), such that the value of the function in the solution lies within a constant and known factor from the global optimum. Given a function f: \\\\Lambda^n \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} with \\\\Lambda = \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\dots, k\\\\\\\\}, and a certain assignment of values \\\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, \\\\dots, x_n) \\\\in \\\\Lambda^n to the variables, it is possible to associate each assignment \\\\mathbf{x} to a partition P = \\\\\\\\{P_l  l \\\\in \\\\Lambda \\\\\\\\} of the set of variables, such that, P_l = \\\\\\\\{ x_i  x_i = l \\\\in \\\\Lambda \\\\\\\\}. Give two distinct assignments P and P' and a value \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\Lambda, a move that transforms P into P' is said to be an \\\\alpha-expansion if P_\\\\alpha \\\\subset P'_\\\\alpha and P'_l \\\\subset P_l \\\\; \\\\forall l \\\\in \\\\Lambda - \\\\\\\\{ \\\\alpha \\\\\\\\}. Given a couple of values \\\\alpha and \\\\beta, a move is said to be an \\\\alpha\\\\beta-swap if P_l = P'_l \\\\; \\\\forall l \\\\in \\\\Lambda - \\\\\\\\{ \\\\alpha, \\\\beta \\\\\\\\}. Intuitively, an \\\\alpha-expansion move from \\\\mathbf{x} assigns the value of \\\\alpha to some variables that have a different value in \\\\mathbf{x}, while an \\\\alpha\\\\beta-swap move assigns \\\\alpha to some variables that have value \\\\beta in \\\\mathbf{x} and vice versa. For each iteration, the \\\\alpha-expansion algorithm computes, for each possible value \\\\alpha, the minimum of the function among all assignments \\\\Alpha(\\\\mathbf{x}) that can be reached with a single \\\\alpha-expansion move from the current temporary solution \\\\mathbf{x}, and takes it as the new temporary solution. \\\\mathbf{x} := \\\\text{arbitrary value in } \\\\Lambda^n \\\\text{exit} := 0 while \\\\text{exit} e 1: \\\\text{exit} = 1 foreach \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\Lambda: \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{x}} := \\\\arg \\\\min_{\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\in \\\\Alpha(\\\\mathbf{x})} f(\\\\mathbf{y}) if f(\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{x}}) < \\\\mathbf{x}: \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{x}} \\\\text{exit} := 0 The \\\\alpha\\\\beta-swap algorithm is similar, but it searches for the minimum among all assignments \\\\Alpha\\\\Beta(\\\\mathbf{x}) reachable with a single \\\\alpha\\\\beta-swap move from \\\\mathbf{x}. \\\\mathbf{x} := \\\\text{arbitrary value in } \\\\Lambda^n \\\\text{exit} := 0 while \\\\text{exit} e 1: \\\\text{exit} = 1 foreach (\\\\alpha, \\\\beta) \\\\in \\\\Lambda^2: \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{x}} := \\\\arg \\\\min_{\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\in \\\\Alpha\\\\Beta(\\\\mathbf{x})} f(\\\\mathbf{y}) if f(\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{x}}) < \\\\mathbf{x}: \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{x}} \\\\text{exit} := 0 In both cases, the optimization problem in the innermost loop can be solved exactly and efficiently with a graph cut. Both algorithms terminate certainly in a finite number of iterations of the outer loop, and in practice such number is small, with most of the improvement happening at the first iteration. The algorithms can generate different solutions depending on the initial guess, but in practice they are robust with respect to initialisation, and starting with a point where all variables are assigned to the same random value is usually sufficient to produce good quality results. The solution generated by such algorithms is not necessarily a global optimum, but it has strong guarantees of optimality. If S(x_i, x_j) is a metric and \\\\mathbf{x} is a solution generated by the \\\\alpha-expansion algorithm, or if S(x_i, x_j) is a semimetric and \\\\mathbf{x} is a solution generated by the \\\\alpha\\\\beta-swap algorithm, then f(\\\\mathbf{x}) lies within a known and constant factor from the global minimum f(\\\\mathbf{x}^*): :f(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\le 2 \\\\frac{ \\\\max_{\\\\alpha e \\\\beta \\\\in \\\\Lambda} S(\\\\alpha, \\\\beta) }{ \\\\min_{\\\\alpha e \\\\beta \\\\in \\\\Lambda} S(\\\\alpha, \\\\beta) } f(\\\\mathbf{x}^*) .  Non-submodular functions  Generally speaking, the problem of optimizing a non-submodular pseudo-Boolean function is NP-hard and cannot be solved in polynomial time with a simple graph cut. The simplest approach is to approximate the function with a similar but submodular one, for instance truncating all non-submodular terms or replacing them with similar submodular expressions. Such approach is generally sub-optimal, and it produces acceptable results only if the number of non-submodular terms is relatively small. In case of quadratic non-submodular functions, it is possible to compute in polynomial time a partial solution using algorithms such as QPBO. Higher-order functions can be reduced in polynomial time to a quadratic form that can be optimised with QPBO.  Higher-order functions  Quadratic functions are extensively studied and were characterised in detail, but more general results were derived also for higher-order functions. While quadratic functions can indeed model many problems of practical interest, they are limited by the fact they can represent only binary interactions between variables. The possibility to capture higher-order interactions allows to better capture the nature of the problem and it can provide higher quality results that could be difficult to achieve with quadratic models. For instance in computer vision applications, where each variable represents a pixel or voxel of the image, higher-order interactions can be used to model texture information, that would be difficult to capture using only quadratic functions. Sufficient conditions analogous to submodularity were developed to characterise higher-order pseudo-Boolean functions that can be optimised in polynomial time, and there exists algorithms analogous to \\\\alpha-expansion and \\\\alpha\\\\beta-swap for some families of higher-order functions. The problem is NP-hard in the general case, and approximate methods were developed for fast optimization of functions that do not satisfy such conditions.  References  Vineet and Narayanan (2008).

If f is submodular then QPBO produces a global optimum equivalently to graph cut optimization, while if f contains non- submodular terms then the algorithm produces a partial solution with specific optimality properties, in both cases in polynomial time. QPBO is a useful tool for inference on Markov random fields and conditional random fields, and has applications in computer vision problems such as image segmentation and stereo matching.  Optimization of non-submodular functions  If the coefficients w_{pq} of the quadratic terms satisfy the submodularity condition : w_{pq}(0, 0) + w_{pq}(1, 1) \\\\le w_{pq}(0, 1) + w_{pq}(1, 0) then the function can be efficiently optimised with graph cut optimization. It is indeed possible to represent it with a non-negative weighted graph, and the global minimum can be found in polynomial time by computing a minimum cut of the graph, which can be computed with algorithms such as Ford–Fulkerson, Edmonds–Karp, and Boykov–Kolmogorov's. If the function is not submodular, then the problem is NP-hard in the general case and it is not always possible to solve it exactly in polynomial time. It is possible to replace the target function with a similar but submodular approximation, e.g. by removing all non-submodular terms or replacing them with submodular approximations, but such approach is generally sub-optimal and it produces satisfying results only if the number of non-submodular terms is relatively small. QPBO builds an extended graph, introducing a set of auxiliary variables ideally equivalent to the negation of the variables in the problem. If the nodes in the graph associated to a variable (representing the variable itself and its negation) are separated by the minimum cut of the graph in two different connected components, then the optimal value for such variable is well defined, otherwise it is not possible to infer it. Such method produces results generally superior to submodular approximations of the target function.  Properties  QPBO produces a solution where each variable assumes one of three possible values: true, false, and undefined, noted in the following as 1, 0, and \\\\emptyset respectively. The solution has the following two properties. * Partial optimality: if f is submodular, then QPBO produces a global minimum exactly, equivalent to graph cut, and all variables have a non-undefined value; if submodularity is not satisfied, the result will be a partial solution \\\\mathbf{x} where a subset \\\\hat{V} \\\\subseteq V of the variables have a non- undefined value. A partial solution is always part of a global solution, i.e. there exists a global minimum point \\\\mathbf{x^*} for f such that x_i = x_i^* for each i \\\\in \\\\hat{V}. * Persistence: given a solution \\\\mathbf{x} generated by QPBO and an arbitrary assignment of values \\\\mathbf{y} to the variables, if a new solution \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{y}} is constructed by replacing y_i with x_i for each i \\\\in \\\\hat{V}, then f(\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{y}}) \\\\le f(\\\\mathbf{y}).  Algorithm  Graph representing a function of two variables x_p and x_q. The algorithm can be divided in three steps: graph construction, max-flow computation, and assignment of values to the variables. When constructing the graph, the set of vertices V contains the source and sink nodes s and t, and a couple of nodes p and p' for each variable. After re-parametrising the function to normal form, a pair of edges is added to the graph for each term w: * for each term w_p(0) the edges p \\\\rightarrow t and s \\\\rightarrow p', with weight \\\\frac{1}{2} w_p(0); * for each term w_p(1) the edges s \\\\rightarrow p and p' \\\\rightarrow t, with weight \\\\frac{1}{2} w_p(1); * for each term w_{pq}(0, 1) the edges p \\\\rightarrow q and q' \\\\rightarrow p', with weight \\\\frac{1}{2} w_{pq}(0, 1); * for each term w_{pq}(1, 0) the edges q \\\\rightarrow p and p' \\\\rightarrow q', with weight \\\\frac{1}{2} w_{pq}(1, 0); * for each term w_{pq}(0, 0) the edges p \\\\rightarrow q' and q \\\\rightarrow p', with weight \\\\frac{1}{2} w_{pq}(0, 0); * for each term w_{pq}(1, 1) the edges q' \\\\rightarrow p and p' \\\\rightarrow q, with weight \\\\frac{1}{2} w_{pq}(1, 1). The minimum cut of the graph can be computed with a max-flow algorithm. In the general case, the minimum cut is not unique, and each minimum cut correspond to a different partial solution, however it is possible to build a minimum cut such that the number of undefined variables is minimal. Once the minimum cut is known, each variable receives a value depending upon the position of its corresponding nodes p and p': if p belongs to the connected component containing the source and p' belongs to the connected component containing the sink then the variable will have value of 0. Vice versa, if p belongs to the connected component containing the sink and p' to the one containing the source, then the variable will have value of 1. If both nodes p and p' belong to the same connected component, then the value of the variable will be undefined. The way undefined variables can be handled is dependent upon the context of the problem. In the general case, given a partition of the graph in two sub-graphs and two solutions, each one optimal for one of the sub-graphs, then it is possible to combine the two solutions into one solution optimal for the whole graph in polynomial time. However, computing an optimal solution for the subset of undefined variables is still a NP-hard problem. In the context of iterative algorithms such as \\\\alpha-expansion, a reasonable approach is to leave the value of undefined variables unchanged, since the persistence property guarantees that the target function will have non-increasing value. Different exact and approximate strategies to minimise the number of undefined variables exist.  Higher order terms  The problem of optimizing higher-order pseudo- boolean functions is generally difficult. The process of reducing a high-order function to a quadratic one is known as \\"quadratization\\". It is always possible to reduce a higher-order function to a quadratic function which is equivalent with respect to the optimisation, problem known as \\"higher-order clique reduction\\" (HOCR), and the result of such reduction can be optimized with QPBO. Generic methods for reduction of arbitrary functions rely on specific substitution rules and in the general case they require the introduction of auxiliary variables. In practice most terms can be reduced without introducing additional variables, resulting in a simpler optimization problem, and the remaining terms can be reduced exactly, with addition of auxiliary variables, or approximately, without addition of any new variable.

References    Notes  The representation of a pseudo-Boolean function with coefficients \\\\mathbf{w} = (w_0, w_1, \\\\dots, w_{nn}) is not unique, and if two coefficient vectors \\\\mathbf{w} and \\\\mathbf{w}' represent the same function then \\\\mathbf{w}' is said to be a reparametrisation of \\\\mathbf{w} and vice versa. In some constructions it is useful to ensure that the function has a specific form, called noraml form, which is always defined for any function, and it is not unique. A function f is in normal form if the two following conditions hold (Kolmogorov and Rother (2007)): # \\\\min \\\\\\\\{ w_p^0, w_p^1 \\\\\\\\} = 0 for each p \\\\in V; # \\\\min \\\\\\\\{ w_{pq}^{0j}, w_{pq}^{1j} \\\\\\\\} = 0 for each (p, q) \\\\in E and for each j \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0, 1\\\\\\\\}. Given an arbitrary function f, it is always possible to find a reparametrisation to normal form with the following algorithm in two steps (Kolmogorov and Rother (2007)): # as long as there exist indices (p, q) \\\\in E and j \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0, 1\\\\\\\\} such that the second condition of normality is not satisfied, substitute: #* w_{pq}^{0j} with w_{pq}^{0j} - a #* w_{pq}^{1j} with w_{pq}^{1j} - a #* w_q^j with w_q^j + a #: where a = \\\\min \\\\\\\\{ w_{pq}^{0j}, w_{pq}^{1j} \\\\\\\\}; # for p = 1, \\\\dots, n, substitute: #* w_0 with w_0 + a #* w_p^0 with w_p^0 - a #* w_p^1 with w_p^1 - a #: where a = \\\\min \\\\\\\\{ w_p^0, w_p^1 \\\\\\\\}.

General Denikin in Odessa, September 1919. The Odessa operation (1919) or the Odessa landing was a successful amphibious military operation by the White Armed Forces of South Russia against the troops of the Red Army and the Odessa garrison on 20–24 August 1919. The success of the operation would have been impossible without a coordinated anti-Bolshevik insurrection in the city itself. The operation was carried out in the development of the \\"Moscow directive\\" of the AFSR (paragraph 6).  Prelude  Between December 1918 and April 1919, French and Greek troops had taken over control of Odessa during the Southern Russia Intervention. On April 7 1919, they evacuated the city when the pro-Bolshevik Army of Ataman Nikifor Grigoriev approached. In May a Red Defence Committee of the Odessa Military District was established under command of Boris Krajewski, Ivan Klimenko and Yan Gamarnik. They had 2 divisions at their disposal, the 45th and 47th, and a garrison of some 5,000 untrained men. The position of Odessa, as the most south-western point of Soviet power, was vulnerable. From the sea it was blocked by the naval forces of the Entente. From land at any time, the Petliurists, Whites or Makhnovists and insurgent peasants of suburban villages could cut it off from the center. Red Odessa of that time, in the words of Comrade Ivan Klimenko, one of the leaders of the Defence Committee of the city, lived all the time in a condition of evacuation. On July 18, the White Army took Nikolaev (now Mykolaiv), what created an immediate threat to Odessa. In late July and early August, typhus and cholera epidemics began to develop in the city, which became extremely acute. By August 10, 1,130 cases of cholera were registered, the death rate among the diseased was 47%. The situation was aggravated by a severe sanitary and hygienic situation by an acute lack of clean water. Furthermore, at the end of July 1919 a powerful peasant uprising flared up in the villages around Odessa, the cause of which was the mobilization into the Red Army of the entire male population between 18 and 45. The leaders of the insurgents contacted the command of the White Volunteer Army (approximately July 30 – August 1), asking for help. Wishing to take advantage of the moment, the command of the AFSR, which had retaken the Crimea (Crimean Socialist Soviet Republic) in June 1919, planned to conduct an amphibious operation from there as soon as possible, hoping to rely on the forces of the insurgents. The fleet of the AFSR was centered around the cruiser Ochakov and commanded by captain 1st rank Pavel Osteletsky. On August 22, at noon, a squadron of the Royal Navy of Great Britain, including light cruiser , joined the AFSR squadron. In the city a White Guard underground organisation had been created under command of A.P. Sablin. It was divided into dozens of units, each of which was assigned to a separate sector of the city. The commander of the Red \\"Black Sea Fleet\\", A. Sheykovsky, also became a supporter of the Volunteers and managed to equip the coastal batteries in the Odessa region with sympathisers. As a result, the batteries later went over to the Whites without firing a single shot. However, the initial plans of the AFSR command – to conduct joint actions with the rebel peasants – did not come true. Having gathered all the forces at its disposal, the “Defence Committee” managed to crush the uprising, “drowning it in blood”. Moreover, the Odessa Checka managed to get on the trail of the White underground organization in the city and on the eve of the landing of troops to arrest their leaders – Colonel Sablin, lieutenants Markov, Chelakaev and Nakashidze. Despite these circumstances, the landing went ahead.  The landing operation and uprising  Early in the morning of August 23, the landing force, under command of Nikolai Shilling, disembarked near Chornomorsk, south of Odessa. The landing went smoothly and was not detected by the Soviet troops. The White landing forces advanced in 6 columns towards the city. The first Red battery it encountered immediately went over to the side of the Whites. After learning about the landing, all the highest Red commanders, Yan Gamarnik, Boris Krajewski and Iona Yakir, fled the city by noon. Due to the flight of the entire command, there was no one left to organise the defence or evacuation of the city, which led to the fact that many Soviet soldiers fell into the hands of the rebels. By 15 o'clock information had been received that Red forces were concentrating in the area of the Artillery school, some 600 men with six howitzers and one armored car. This information was transmitted to the Russian and British squadron. The Russian cruiser Ochakov and HMS Caradoc immediately opened fire and achieved a number of successful hits, which led to panic amongst the Soviet unit, which scattered in all directions. At about 17 o'clock at the intersection of the road from Moldavanka to Arcadia with the tram line, a new concentration of Red forces (415th and 416th regiments) was observed, some 800 men preparing for an attack on the landing party. But soon it was also scattered by accurate artillery fire from the ships. At 17h30, the forward detachment resumed its advance towards Odessa and reached the railway lines that bend around the city and, in view of the coming darkness, stopped for the night. Meanwhile, according to the agreement with the White underground, the heavy battery in Arcadia, which had gone over to the AFSR, fired three shots in the direction of Odessa, which was the signal for the beginning of the uprising. Immediately throughout the city, the rebels seized buildings and freed the 4 imprisoned leaders of the uprising. The rebels chased the Red units from the port area and began to move along the Marazlievskaya and Kanatnaya streets towards the railway station, clearing Red quarter after quarter. There was no particular resistance anywhere. By 2300 hours, the entire eastern part of the city from the seashore to Pushkinska Street (the area where the prosperous classes lived) was under the control of the rebels, who continued to clear the city of the Reds, moving into the working class areas – Moldavanka, Slobodka, Peresyp. By 8 am on August 24, the whole city was under the control of the insurgent White Guards. Colonel Sablin declared himself the \\"Commander of the forces of Odessa.\\"  Aftermath  Having lost Odessa, the Bolsheviks were forced to leave the entire southwest of the Ukrainian SSR. After the occupation of Odessa by the AFSR, it became possible to document the atrocities of the Red terror. A Special Investigation Commission was created to investigate the atrocities of the Bolsheviks, and gathered in Odessa numerous evidences of the crimes of the Bolshevik regime against its own people. Odessa remained under White control until February 8, 1920, when it was retaken by the Red Army in the Odessa operation (1920).

Amanaz drew influences from American and British rock of the late 1960s–early 1970s, especially the music of Jimi Hendrix, and from traditional Zambian music, identifiable in Watson Lungu's drumming and Keith Kabwe's vocals. The band's name is the acronym of \\"Ask Me About Nice Artistes In Zambia\\".  History  In 1973, the band recorded in the Malachite Film Studios of Chingola their sole album named Africa. It was first released as a LP in 1975, and since then re-issued by the German label Shadocks Music in 2008, and by the American label Now-Again Records in 2015. Of the 12 songs of the album, three are performed in the Bemba language and the rest in English. The album continues to be influential as an embodiment of a strain of Zamrock. Pitchfork journalist Nate Patrin described it as \\"both behind and ahead of its era\\" and therefore uniquely \\"out of time\\". Music critic Mark Deming noted that Amanaz's music was based on \\"deep, bluesy grooves with a strong psychedelic undercurrent and thick layers of fuzz guitar\\". Amanaz split up in 1976. Keith Kabwe, the former band leader and main vocalist, then created the short-lived band Drive Unit the same year. By 2014, Keith Kabwe served as a Pentecostal pastor in Mbala and was working on the release of gospel songs.  Discography  * Africa (1975).

The Conservatives suffered badly in this election, and lost 12 of the 14 seats they had won at the previous election. The Green Party held all their four seats, and surpassed the Conservatives in the popular vote. Labour gained two seats, although they failed to gain support in rural areas, where voters favoured the Liberal Democrats. On 14 May, The Liberal Democrats and the Green Party announced that they had agreed to run the council in a new 'progressive partnership' coalition, with Green Party leader Andy D'Agore assuming the role of Deputy Leader of the Council while Liberal Democrat leader Keith Aspden succeeded Ian Gillies as Leader of the Council.

The episode was written by Neil Campbell and directed by Giovani Lampassi. It was the first episode of the series to air on NBC, after the network picked it up when Fox cancelled it in 2018. The show revolves around the fictitious 99th precinct of the New York Police Department in Brooklyn and the officers and detectives that work in the precinct. In the episode, Jake and Amy go on a honeymoon in a Mexican hotel, but meets Holt (Andre Braugher) in the same hotel, who was taking some time off work as he was depressed from losing the Commissioner title to John Kelly. Back at the precinct, Rosa finds a struggling Terry, who is the interim captain, for advice on what to do about a drug case and Charles tries to find out from Gina why their parents are divorcing. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by an estimated 3.54 million household viewers and gained a 1.2/5 ratings share among adults aged 18–49. The episode received positive reviews from critics, who praised the writing, calling the episode a promising inception of the season under a new network. The episode was also the first of the series to feature bleep censors, which was previously prohibited prior to its run on FOX. Plot Jake (Andy Samberg) and Amy (Melissa Fumero) go on their honeymoon at a Mexican beach resort. Coincidentally, they meet a depressed Holt (Andre Braugher), also staying at the same place. Holt decided to take some time off from work to recover from losing the Commissioner title to John Kelly (Phil Reeves), who was trying to push for a \\"vigilant policing\\" initiative. Holt starts to ruin their honeymoon by engaging in depressing monologues and self-wallowing around the newlyweds, such as when the couple is eating dinner, swimming or enjoying a spa session. Amy suggests to invite Holt to join their honeymoon activities to cheer him up. The plan worked, to Jake and Amy's relief, and Holt was starting to feel happier. However, Jake finds out that Holt was planning to quit his job as he was convinced that there was more to life than the NYPD. Consequently, Jake tricks Holt into his and Amy's hotel room to lock him up. Unbeknownst to Amy that Holt was in the room, she comes out dressed up as Holly Gennero from Die Hard as a form of sexual roleplay and is shocked. The two eventually tie Holt up on the bed to prevent him from leaving and try to talk him out of quitting the NYPD. Holt, in a fit of anger and misery, calls Jake selfish, which causes Amy to chide Holt. Holt eventually escapes, apologizes and offers to extend and compensate their honeymoon. Jake and Amy are then seen continuing their sexual roleplay, with Amy as Holly and Jake as Melville Dewey. Back at the precinct, Rosa (Stephanie Beatriz) tries to ask Terry (Terry Crews) for advice on a drug case. However, Terry is distressed over taking over the precinct temporarily as he wanted to be a good leader, just like Holt. He attempts to find Holt's manual in order to be a good leader, but realizes that Holt had actually trusted him in making decisions after reading the manual. He gains confidence and proceeds to tell Rosa how to solve her drug case. Meanwhile, Charles (Joe Lo Truglio) attempts to find out from Gina (Chelsea Peretti) why their parents broke up. He tries to get Gina to investigate it with him, but she refuses to do so. Charles dons a mask with Gina's face on it and tries to unlock Gina's phone to find the truth, and finds out that Gina was the one who coerced her mother in to breaking up with Charles' dad. Gina later reveals it was because her mother was cheating on his father, and the reason she did not want to disclose it initially was because she did not want to hurt his feelings. Jake and Amy come back from their honeymoon to learn that Holt had publicly rebelled against John Kelly's initiative, and as a form of retaliation, John Kelly has moved the entire precinct into the bullpen. Jake and Amy stare in surprise as they watch the overcrowded bullpen going about their business.

The episode was written by Lang Fisher and directed by Cortney Carrillo. In the episode, Jake and Charles investigate a case from Hitchcock and Scully's younger days to determine if the two older detectives are withholding stolen cash. Due to Holt's campaign against John Kelly, the Commissioner closes off the lower level and forces most of the departments to work in a tight space, leading Amy and her officers into conflict with Terry and Rosa. Gina helps Holt prepare for a television interview but ends up taking it herself. Plot The episode starts off with a flashback to 1986 in which a young Scully (Alan Ritchson), and a young Hitchcock (Wyatt Nash) take down mafia boss Gio Costa (Daniel Di Tomasso) with the help of Marissa Costa (Decker Sadowski), Gio's wife. The episode cuts to the present day with Captain Holt (Andre Braugher) calling Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) and Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio) into his office to tell them that Hitchcock (Dirk Blocker) and Scully (Joel McKinnon Miller) were contacted by someone in Internal Affairs who has reopened the case. Holt suspects that Commissioner Kelly (Phil Reeves) is trying to create a scandal and sends Jake and Charles to reevaluate the case. Jake and Charles interrogate Hitchcock and Scully. Hitchcock tells Jake that they took down Gio, then intercepted a ton of coke and three duffel bags full of cash. However, a photo from the night of the bust shows Hitchcock and Scully with four duffel bags. The detectives then defensively suggest they missed the fourth bag. Jake, suspicious of the duo, decides to continue with the investigation. In an attempt to prove their innocence, Hitchcock and Scully both turn over their financial records, revealing that Hitchcock has a monthly parking spot for \\"The Beaver Trap\\", an old sex van that Hitchcock uses as a home between marriages. Jake and Charles go into the van to find the fourth duffel bag empty. Hitchcock and Scully then lock them in the van and escape in Jake’s car. Jake and Charles drive the van to find Hitchcock and Scully at \\"Wing Slutz\\" –a restaurant that they patronize frequently. Jake and Charles confront Hitchcock and Scully but the manager steps in and reveals herself to be Marissa. Hitchcock and Scully tell Jake and Charles that Marissa was their criminal informant in the mafia and that they stole the money for her after their captain refused to place her in witness protection. A call comes from Holt saying that Internal Affairs never reopened the case and it was highly likely that Hitchcock and Scully were called by Gio Costa himself. The mafia then shows up having tracked their location although the squad shows up and subdues Costa. Costa gets hold of a gun and fires shots at Marissa, but Hitchcock and Scully jump in front of her, stopping the bullets with tubs of \\"slut sauce\\" that they had strapped to their bodies in place of bulletproof vests. While investigating Hitchcock and Scully, Charles informs Jake that he’s on the verge of adopting Nikolaj’s half-brother Dragomir. Dragomir claims to be a 15-year-old but Jake finds a photo of him which shows that he is a 42-year-old fur trapper. Charles eventually gets in touch with Nikolaj’s orphanage and confirms the existence of a 34-year-old half-brother, who will be visiting soon. Meanwhile at the precinct, tensions escalate among the \\"upstairs people\\", consisting of Terry (Terry Crews) and the detective squad, and the \\"downstairs people\\", i.e. Amy (Melissa Fumero) and her uniformed officers, and Holt prepares for a television interview where he intends to speak out against Kelly’s new initiatives for the NYPD. Holt misses his interview to help Hitchcock, Scully, Jake, and Charles. Gina (Chelsea Peretti) fills in for him and is proud to break a record for most viewer complaints. Holt apologizes to the squad for his shortsightedness in his pursuit of justice. The final scene is another flashback which reveals that Hitchcock and Scully's physiques as well as attitudes towards work declined after they got hooked on Wing Slutz while checking in on Marissa.

Jake is worried, as his high school reputation was affected after an incident where a forthcoming robbery was cancelled after someone told the principal and everyone assumed it was Jake, earning him the nickname \\"The Tattler\\" and ruining his senior year.

Jake finds out the tattler was actually Gina, as she was the only one with the same clothes. He confronts her, and she reveals that she tattled because Jake could be involved in the robbery and would wind up in jail, effectively ending his dream of being a cop. She also reveals that the leader of the robbery didn't come to the reunion as he's on parole in Delaware.

The district initially operated schools in both Meservey and Thornton. It closed the school in Meservey in 1983. In fall 1988 the district began a whole-grade sharing agreement, in which students from one school district attend another district's schools for certain levels, with the Sheffield–Chapin Community School District. At that point the Sheffield building hosted the senior high school (grades 9–12) while Thornton building housed the middle school (grades 5–8).

Background  Following the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference, the Netherlands recognizes the independence of the Republic of United States of Indonesia (RUSI). The RUSI is a federation whose People’s Representative Council consists of 50 representatives from the Republic of Indonesia and 100 from the various states according to their populations.Republic of United States of Indonesia (RUSI). Distrusting the Javanese and Muslim-dominated Republic of Indonesia, the largely Protestant and pro-Dutch South Moluccans - who have long contributed forces to the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) - declare the independence of the Republic of South Maluku in Ambon and Seram on 25 April 1950. former minister of Eastern-Indonesia declared the independence and former District Deputy-Governor of South Mollucans, mister Manahutu was made President of the new Republic. The independence declaration said the South Moluccas no longer felt secure within State of East Indonesia and were cutting their ties with RUSI. And later, former KNIL soldiers garrisoned at Ambon joined RMS and formed Armed Forces of RMS (APRMS). These are among troops who have been awaiting demobilization or transfer to the TNI. On 17 August 1950, the Indonesian President, Sukarno, proclaimed the restoration of the unitary state of the Republic of Indonesia. This RMS was not acknowledged by Sukarno and on his order Indonesian military invaded the Mollucan island of Buru and a part of the island of Ceram.  Invasion of Ambon  At the time of the RMS proclamation, there were 7,345 former KNIL troops stationed in Ambon, including 2,500 Ambonese. These soldiers became the backbone of APRMS. After a naval blockade by the Indonesian navy, an invasion of Ambon took place on 28 September 1950. The APRMS fled from the town of Ambon before the invading Indonesian troops had taken up positions in old Dutch fortifications in the hills over looking the town. From here they waged guerilla warfare. The TNI occupied the northern half of the island, but had been halted by fierce Ambonese resistance at the one kilometre wide isthmus, which links it with the southern half. On 5 November the city of Ambon came into the hands of the Indonesian army. The RMS government fled to Ceram in December to continue the war in the form of a guerilla warfare. \\"The town of Ambon had been wiped out except for four buildings,\\" an eyewitness told an Australian newspaper. \\"The Indonesians had constantly shelled the town and planes had strafed it, but much of the destruction had been caused by arson.\\" The fighting was ferocious, since TNI's opposition were well-trained former KNIL soldiers including the Green Caps, Indonesian army suffered small losses. Although the RMS Soldier were KNIL member which were well-trained and renowned for their fighting skills, the resistance of the APRMS soldiers was eventually put down in November 1950. Lt. Col.

Video footage showing the official ceremony disbanding the KNIL. and the native soldiers had the choice of either being demobilised or joining the army of the Republic of Indonesia. Due to a deep distrust of the Republican leadership, which was predominantly Javanese Muslim, this was an extremely difficult choice for the Protestant Ambonese, and only a minority chose to serve with the Indonesian Army. Disbanding proved a complicated process and, in 1951, two years after the transfer of sovereignty, not all soldiers had been demobilised. The Dutch were under severe international pressure to disband the colonial army and temporarily made these men part of the regular Dutch army, while trying to demobilise them in Java. Herein lay the source of the discontent among the Moluccan soldiers as, according to the KNIL policy, soldiers had the right to choose the place where they were to be discharged at the end of their contract. The political situation in the new Republic of Indonesia was initially unstable and, in particular, controversy over a federal or centralised form of the state resulted in armed conflicts in which Ambonese ex-KNIL men were involved. In 1951 an independent Republic of the South Moluccas (Indonesian: RMS, Republik Maluku Selatan) was proclaimed at Ambon. The RMS had strong support among the Ambonese KNIL soldiers. As a consequence the Moluccan soldiers located outside the South Moluccas demanded to be discharged at Ambon. But Indonesia refused to let the Dutch transport these soldiers to Ambon as long as the RMS was not repressed, fearing prolonged military struggle. When after heavy fighting the RMS was repressed at Ambon, the soldiers refused to be discharged there. They now demanded to be demobilised at Seram, where pockets of resistance against Indonesia still existed. This was again blocked by Indonesia. The Dutch government finally decided to transport the remaining men and their families to the Netherlands. They were discharged on arrival and 'temporarily' housed in camps until it was possible for them to return to the Moluccan islands.The complicated story of the disbanding of the KNIL is set out briefly here. For a more extended analysis see Manuhutu (1987); Steylen (1996: 33-63); van Amersfoort (1982: 101-8). The psychological impact of the dissolution of the KNIL on the Ambonese servicemen is described in Wittermans (1991). In this way around 12,500 persons were settled in the Netherlands, more or less against their will and certainly also against the original plans of the Dutch government.  Aftermath  After the defeat of the RMS on Ambon by Indonesian forces in November 1950, the self-declared government withdrew to Seram, where an armed struggle continued on until December 1963. The government in exile moved to the Netherlands in 1966, following resistance leader and president Chris Soumokil's capture and execution by Indonesian authorities. The exiled government continues to exist, with John Wattilete as its incumbent president since April 2010.  United Nations  The Proclamation of the RMS has been a subject on the agenda of the United Nations, but was displaced there by the Korea War. On October 1, the RMS government requested intervention from the UN Security Council, Australia and the Netherlands to invade Indonesian troops. The Netherlands indicated that this was a matter for the UN and referred to the RTC transfer. \\"Invasie op Ambon begonnen Indonesische korvetten schieten van de baai uit op de stad Ambon vraagt tussenkomst van de Veiligheidsraad, Nederland en Australië\\". \\"De Gooi- en Eemlander : nieuws- en advertentieblad\\".

It is used in two distinctive contexts, describing structural or functional relations within a particular language. As a structural category, supradialects designate the first level of dialectological subdivision within a language, as for example in the pluricentric Serbo-Croatian language, which is divided into three basic supradialects (Shtokavian, Kajkavian and Chakavian), with each of them being further divided into several dialects. As a functional category, supradialect designates a predominant dialectal form within a particular language, referring to the most commonly used variant of that language, accepted in practice by the majority of its speakers as a basic tool of mutual interaction and communication.

She continued to act as a radical pacifist, strongly opposing re-armament, even after Denmark joined NATO in 1949. Biography Born on 28 May 1878 in Copenhagen, Henriette Dorthea Hansen was the daughter of the tobacco merchant Carl Vilhelm Hansen (1851–1922) and Karen Thorsen (1852–1900). In 1903, she married Thor Beenfeldt (1878–1954), a building inspector. After the First World War had started in 1914, she and her husband became peace activists, joining the peace association Dansk Fredsforening (DF) in 1916. She was also an early member of Danske Kvinders Fredskæde (Danish Women's Peace Chain), the Danish chapter of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom.

Historic England describes Lyde as a tobacco merchant and a director of the Bank of England, but also indicates that the Lyde fortune came from the slave trade. Lyonel and his brother Samuel formed a partnership dealing with the family's business affairs in London. Lyonel was made a director of the Bank of England in the 1760s. The American war of Independence subsequently created difficult conditions for the tobacco trade. Homes Lyonel acquired a country estate at Ayot St Lawrence, which had belonged to his uncle and father-in-law Cornelius Lyde. He built a neo-classical church there, St Lawrence's, with twin mausolea for himself and his wife Rachel. Lyde and his brother also leased houses in Bedford Square, a fashionable new development in London. Baronetcy and legacy A baronetcy was created for him in 1772. The baronetcy became extinct upon his death in 1791. The Ayot House estate passed to relatives, some of whom changed their name to Lyde. For example, Lionel Ames, who inherited the estate in 1806, assumed the surname and arms of Lyde.

The Quakers, coached by Bob Weinhauer, played in the Ivy League and had a 25–7 win–loss record. Penn won the Ivy League regular season championship for the eighth time in 10 years and participated in the 1979 NCAA Division I Basketball Tournament. There, as the ninth seed in the 10-team East region, the Quakers defeated Iona, number one seed North Carolina, Syracuse, and St. John's to reach the Final Four. In the national semifinals, they lost to a Michigan State team that included Magic Johnson, and an overtime loss in the third-place game against DePaul ended their season. The 1978–79 Quakers are the last Ivy League team to play in the Final Four. Background During the previous decade, Penn had been highly ranked at times. In 1969–70, the Quakers lost only once in 26 regular season games and reached the top 10 in multiple national polls before a first-round loss in the NCAA Tournament. The following season, the Quakers did not lose during the regular season and achieved a year-end ranking of number three, but were routed by Villanova in the regional finals of the NCAA Tournament; in 1971–72 they ended the regular season second in the Associated Press (AP) Poll, and again lost in the regional finals. Penn won at least 17 games in each of the next four seasons, but was only able to advance out of the first round of the NCAA Tournament once, in 1973. Before the 1977–78 season, Bob Weinhauer became the Quakers' head coach, taking the job previously held by Chuck Daly. The Quakers qualified for the NCAA Tournament and won one game before being eliminated by Duke, 84–80.  Roster  Penn had four returning starters who were in their senior year at the school. Among them was 6'6\\" Tony Price, who became a leader for the team. The other senior starters were Tim Smith, Matthew White, and Bobby Willis. Price, a forward, topped the Quakers with averages of 19.8 points and 8.7 rebounds per game, and added 3.3 assists per game. Forward Smith had 13.4 points and 6.4 rebounds per game, and White, a center, averaged 11.7 points and 7.5 rebounds. Willis, a guard, contributed 9.1 points per game and led Penn with 4.2 assists per game. Other players for the Quakers included guard James Salters, who averaged 9.3 points per game, fellow guards Ken Hall and Angelo Reynolds, and forward Vincent Ross. Regular season The Quakers' non-conference schedule was described by writer Neal Geoghegan as \\"quite challenging\\". It included two games against Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) opposition, and an invitation to the Cabrillo Classic tournament in San Diego, where the Quakers were matched with Big Ten Conference team Iowa. In addition, Penn participated in the annual Big 5 series against other Philadelphia colleges, having finished in at least a share of first place in the competition six times in the previous nine years. Penn opened the season at their home arena, The Palestra, against the ACC's Virginia on November 29, 1978, winning by an 80–78 margin. Two days later, the Quakers traveled to Navy for their second game and posted an 82–66 victory. Another road game at Tulane followed, which the Quakers won by 17 points to move to 3–0. Following that game, Penn hosted La Salle, in their first Big 5 game of the season. In a close encounter, Price made a jump shot in the closing seconds to give the Quakers a 68–67 win. The Quakers then traveled to San Diego for their matchup with Iowa. The teams played into double overtime, where the Hawkeyes defeated the Quakers 87–84 to hand Penn their first loss of the season. In the consolation game of the Cabrillo Classic, the Quakers allowed San Diego State to score 110 points in a blowout loss. On January 5, 1979, Penn began their Ivy League schedule with a game at Harvard. It was the first of five consecutive away games against Ivy League competition. The Quakers tallied 103 points in a win, which was followed the next day by a 52–44 triumph at Dartmouth. Penn then faced Temple, who were ranked 18th in the country at the time. Salters contributed 21 points, and Price had 19, in a 79–74 Quakers win. Princeton was the Quakers' next opponent; the Tigers were Penn's most formidable competition in the Ivy League. The Quakers were forced into overtime, but emerged with a one-point win. With a close 43–42 victory over Saint Joseph's, the Quakers guaranteed themselves at least a share of the Big 5 championship. Following a 97–85 win against Richmond, the Quakers hosted a top-10 Georgetown team on January 20. The game was tightly contested in the closing minutes, but a score by Georgetown center Tommy Scates with 1:16 remaining gave the Hoyas a lead they held for the rest of the contest, as Penn lost by two points. Afterwards, the Quakers went on a four-game winning streak, defeating Brown, Yale, Columbia, and Cornell by double digits. By this point, the Quakers' record had improved to 15–3, and they remained undefeated in the Ivy League. The streak ended with an 89–80 loss to Villanova, which prevented Penn from sweeping its Big 5 games. Regardless, the Quakers finished tied for first in the series, giving them their seventh title in a decade. Four further wins against Ivy League teams, including another one-point win over Princeton, brought the Quakers' record to 19–4. By the time Penn suffered its first defeat in 12 conference games, against Columbia, the team had clinched the Ivy League title and become the first NCAA Tournament qualifiers of the season. With home wins over Yale and Brown, the Quakers ended the regular season 13–1 in the Ivy League record and 21–5 mark overall. Postseason In the NCAA Tournament, the Quakers were placed in the East region and given the number nine seed in that 10-team portion of the bracket. They were forced to play an opening round game on March 9 against first-time NCAA Tournament participant Iona. Behind a combined 28 points by Price and Willis, the Quakers jumped out to a 41–29 advantage at halftime, before an Iona rally in the second half brought the Gaels to within 57–55. Despite allowing the Gaels to cut their deficit to one point near the end of the second half, Penn did not relinquish their lead, holding on for a 73–69 win to advance to the second round. The result earned the Quakers a March 11 meeting with North Carolina, the number one seed in the East region and number three team in the country. Against coach Dean Smith's Tar Heels team, Price had 25 points and nine rebounds; he was one of four Quakers with at least 10 points. The Quakers gained the lead in the second half. Although the Tar Heels attempted a comeback, the Quakers managed a 72–71 victory. Penn's opponent in the East region's semifinals was Syracuse, which had become the favorite to advance to the Final Four after North Carolina and Duke had been knocked out. The Quakers played what Geoghegan called their \\"best first half of the season\\", and were up by 13 points at halftime. Syracuse came within five points at one stage in the second half, but Penn was able to clinch an 84–76 win. Price had 20 points for the Quakers, while Smith added 18. St. John's, which had previously eliminated Duke and was the team that received the final NCAA Tournament invitation as a 10 seed, was the Quakers' opponent in the regional final. Price and Smith made all 10 of their second half field goal attempts to help bring Penn back from a deficit. The game was tied with 23 seconds to play, when Salters was fouled and made two free throws to give Penn the lead. St. John's missed three shots in an attempt to tie the score before fouling Price, who scored 21 points in the game. His free throw attempt was no good, but St. John's was unable to get a shot off before the time expired, as the Quakers won 64–62. They became the first Ivy League team since Princeton in 1965 to reach the Final Four, and the fourth overall. The Quakers' imminent appearance at the Final Four in Salt Lake City sparked celebrations on the University of Pennsylvania campus, including a rally that drew almost 10,000 fans. However, the team encountered difficulties in their preparation, as their practice facility was being used to host an indoor tennis event. Penn faced Michigan State, which featured Magic Johnson. The Spartans took a commanding lead early; writer Stefan Fatsis said that they \\"missed what seemed like a hundred layups\\" as Michigan State took a 31–6 lead. At halftime, the score was 50–17. Michigan State ultimately won 101–67. Johnson led the Spartans in their victory over the Quakers with 29 points, as he made nine of his 10 shot attempts and 11 of his 12 free throws; his 10 rebounds and 10 assists gave him a triple-double. For Penn, Price was the leading scorer with 18 points. The Quakers then played a third-place game against DePaul, in which Price scored 21 first-half points (of his 31 overall) that helped reduce an early 23-point deficit to 11 by halftime. They rallied further in the second half, and a Salters basket with 11 seconds remaining tied the score at 85–85 and eventually forced overtime. However, Mark Aguirre scored eight points for the Blue Demons in the extra period, and the Quakers fell 96–93. Four Penn players fouled out, tied for the most ever in a Final Four game, as the team's fouls led to 34 DePaul free throw attempts. The defeat made the Quakers' final record 25–7. Rankings The Quakers were ranked 14th in the final AP Poll, having never entered the top 20 during the regular season. Penn did not make an appearance in the Coaches Poll in 1978–79. Aftermath and legacy After being named the Ivy League Player of the Year for 1978–79, and scoring 23.7 points per game in the NCAA Tournament, Price was chosen by the Detroit Pistons in the 1979 NBA draft. In 1979–80, Penn had a 17–12 record, including an 11–3 mark in the Ivy League. The team again reached the NCAA Tournament, but were knocked out in the second round. The following season, the Quakers won 20 games but did not make the tournament. Weinhauer coached one further season at Penn, in which St. John's defeated the Quakers in their first NCAA Tournament game, before leaving the program for Arizona State. As of 2019, the 1978–79 season is the only one in which the Quakers have reached the national semifinals in the NCAA Tournament. The program has advanced past the first round twice since then, in 1980 and 1994, and lost in the second round on both occasions. The 1978–79 Penn team was selected by USA Today in 2013 as the fourth most surprising Final Four participant. It was the first nine-seed in an NCAA Tournament to reach the Final Four, and no other team with the same seed advanced that far until 2013, when Wichita State did so. The 1978–79 Quakers were the last team from the Ivy League to play in the Final Four, and no team from the conference advanced as far as the regional semifinals again until Cornell in 2010.

Biography Ruttner was born in Eger, Bohemia as the son of a Limnologist, Franz Ruttner. He studied medicine at the University of Vienna, although in 1936 he was temporarily excluded from his studies because of illegal activities for National Socialism (Austria was not annexed by the Third Reich until 1939).Steffen Rückl: Ludwig Armbruster: Ein von den Nationalsozialisten 1934 zwangspensionierter Bienenkundler der Berliner Universität. [Ludwig Armbruster: A bee expert from Berlin University who was forced to retire by the National Socialists in 1934.] Berlin 2015, p. 53 He received his doctorate in 1938. From 1939 he was a member of the Erbbiologische Forschungsinstitut (Genetic / Hereditary Biology Research Institute) working under the eugenicist Hermann Boehm a Professor of Racial Hygiene at the Führerschule der Deutschen Ärzteschaft (Leadership School of the German Medical Association) in Alt Rehse, under whose mentorship he would have been taught the genetics of \\"hereditary biology and racial hygiene\\" in the context of Nazism and Racial Hierarchy. Membership of the School was restricted to Nazi party members that showed \\"political reliability\\", education was focused not on medical training but on ideological training in line with the racial policy of Nazi Germany with a view to achieving racial purity. As a former member of the NSDAP (Nazi Party) before and after the Anschluss, the SA (Brownshirts) and the SS, he was dismissed from university service in 1945 by order of the Allies, due to their policy of denazification. The following year, together with his brother Hans he founded the Institute for Bee Science in Lunz am See in 1946, which soon became part of the Ministry of Agriculture. In 1948 he demonstrated the first proof of the multiple mating of the queen bee during the mating flight.Hans Ruttner, Friedrich Ruttner: Untersuchungen über die Flugaktivität und das Paarungsverhalten der Drohnen.

[Drones from Apis cerana Fabr. at a drone collection site.] In: Apidologie 4, no. 1, 1973, p. 41–44. (in German) During this time he studied zoology at the University of Vienna. Ruttner became Professor of zoology at the Department of Biology in 1965. Until his retirement in 1981, he also headed the Institute for Bee Science in Oberursel. This institute discovered the first Varroa mites in Germany in 1976.Friedrich Ruttner, Wolfgang Ritter: Das Eindringen von Varroa jacobsoni nach Europa im Rückblick. [The intrusion of Varroa jacobsoni into Europe in retrospect.] In: Allgemeine Deutsche Imkerzeitung. vol. 14, no. 5, 1980, p. 130–134. (in German) Ruttner cultivated intensive research contacts with scientists and beekeepers from all over the world. Together with his French colleague Jean Louveaux, Ruttner founded the specialist journal Apidologie in 1970, today one of the most important bee science journals. Ruttner's breeding approaches and the introduction of instrumental insemination of the queen had a lasting influence on beekeeping.Friedrich Ruttner: Zur Frage der Spermaübertragung bei der Bienenkönigin. [The question of semen transfer in the queen bee.] in: Insectes Sociaux, 3 (2), 1956, p. 351-359. (in German) Ruttner wrote, among other works, the Natural History of HoneybeesFriedrich Ruttner: Naturgeschichte der Honigbienen [Natural History of Honeybees], Franckh-Kosmos-Verlag, Stuttgart, 1992. He further developed the method of morphometry in order to distinguish between different subspecies of Apis mellifera. Their physical characteristics overlap to such an extent that they can only be distinguished by synchronous measurement and comparison of numerous metrics. In particular, measuring points on the wings and the angles between wing loaders are measured and offset against each other according to certain regulations. However, the morphometric differentiation of the subspecies is difficult and the assignment of many regional forms depends on the exact measuring method.Ayça Özkan Koca & İrfan Kandemir (2013): Comparison of two morphometric methods for discriminating honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) populations in Turkey.

He served as governor of Mosul for an undetermined period under his father Caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) and was responsible for several building and infrastructural works. He also played a role in the construction of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. He was later granted property in Mosul's vicinity by Caliph al- Walid I (r. 705–715) or Caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz (r. 717–720), which he developed into an agricultural tract with a canal. In 724 and 725, he led summer campaigns against the Byzantines in Anatolia. During the brief rule of Caliph al-Walid II (r. 743–744), between February 743 to April 744, Sa'id served as governor of Palestine, but was expelled by rebels in the district after al-Walid's death. Sa'id was ultimately killed during the massacre of the Umayyad family near Ramla after the Abbasid victory over the dynasty in 750. Biography Sa'id was the son of the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik and one of the latter's concubines.Hinds 1990, p. 118. He became known as Sa'id al- Khayr,Al-Baladhuri, p. 280. which translates as \\"Sa'id the Good\\", because of his piety, pleasantness and charitable works.The Islamic Quarterly, Volume 16, 1972, p. 61.Khamis 2002, p. 145. The 9th-century historian al-Tabari notes that he was \\"man of good character\\",Hillenbrand 1989, pp. 189–190. while the historian al-Baladhuri claimed he practiced asceticism. Between 688 and 692, Sa'id was the supervisory representative of Abd al-Malik for the construction of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem.Gil 1997, p. 92. =Governor of Mosul= He was appointed by Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) as governor of Mosul,Robinson 2004, p. 77. which came under Abd al-Malik's control in . Others who served the post at some point during Abd al-Malik's reign were Sa'id's uncle Muhammad ibn Marwan and cousin Yusuf, the son of Yahya ibn al-Hakam. Sa'id was responsible for a number of building works in the city during his rule. The historian al-Waqidi attributes that Sa'id built the city walls, which were later tore down by the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid in 796.Robinson 2004, pp. 79–80. Sa'id is further credited in the medieval Muslim sources for the construction of a mosque, a monastery, a market and the paving of the city's streets.Robinson 2004, p. 80.Khamis 2002, pp. 145–146. Al-Baladhuri asserts that Caliph al-Walid I (r. 705–715) or his successor Caliph Umar ibn Abd al- Aziz (r. 717–720) granted property in the Diyar Mudar district, in the vicinity of Mosul, to Sa'id as a qati'a (land grant). He had a canal dug through the property, which was later named Nahr Sa'id (Sa'id River) after him.Kennedy 2006, p. 293. Through his irrigation and infrastructural works, he transformed his qati'a from a lion-infested swamp into an agriculturally- productive area. Umar recalled Sa'id to Syria and replaced him with Yahya ibn Yahya al-Ghassani.Khamis 2002, p. 146. =Campaigns against the Byzantines= Under caliphs Yazid II (r. 720–724) and Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 724–743), Sa'id led a number of summer campaigns against the Byzantines in Anatolia. In one of the campaigns, he commanded the left flank of the Umayyad army during the summer expedition of 724, but his forces incurred heavy losses.Blankinship 1994, p. 119. Yazid II was said to have considered Sa'id as a suitable chosen successor to the caliphate and may have encouraged Sa'id to entertain such notions. In 725, Sa'id again led the summer campaign against the Byzantines. =Governor of Palestine= During the relatively short caliphate of al-Walid II (r. 743–744), Sa'id was appointed governor of Palestine. He was known to have governed the district well.Khamis 2002, p. 147. According to al-Tabari, when al-Walid II was killed in 744, the Arab tribes of Palestine, led by Sa'id ibn Rawh, a chieftain of the Banu Judham and son of Rawh ibn Zinba, opted for their local Umayyad patron, Yazid ibn Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik, to be their governor. To that end, they demanded that Sa'id, who was encamped in Beersheba or in the vicinity of Bayt Jibrin, vacate the governorship. Sa'id obliged and sought safety with al-Walid II's successor, Yazid III, in Damascus. The latter subsequently sent an expedition against the rebels in Palestine. Sa'id's governorship lasted fourteen months, between February 743 and April 744.Khamis 2002, p. 148. In excavations carried out by an Israeli archaeological team in Beit Shean in 1990, a broken bronze weight produced on the orders of Sa'id was unearthed.Khamis 2002, p. 143. The weight was most likely produced in Ramla or Jerusalem. In addition to the Muslim statement of belief, the surviving portion of the rare weight bore an inscription in Kufic Arabic that read: \\"Ordered by the Amir (Governor) Sa'id ibn Abd al-Malik at the hands of ...\\". =Death= Sa'id was killed alongside dozens of other Umayyads in a massacre by the Abbasids at the Abu Futrus river near Ramla in the wake of the Abbasids' toppling of the Umayyad state in 750.

As a result of the Conservative's support for defence, it appealed to many Liberals who had campaigned against warfare. The Society underwent significant growth in the 1890s, leading to two petitions with a total of 533,000 signatures and a series of peace demonstrations. The organization was based on three priorities: Denmark should be neutral; arbitration treaties should be concluded with like-minded nations; and, in accordance with the principle of self-determination, a peaceful solution should be found for the Schleswig question.

At the same time, he is planning to realize his own film, a task he finds extremely difficult. First, he tries to place casting ads in a supermarket. During his daily work on the film set, the man seems frustrated. Also, he is isolated in his private life, and spends his time by watching and masturbating to his opulent VHS film collection of homosexual rape pornography and films such as Cesare Canevari’s 1977 Gestapo’s Last Orgy, Dennis Donnelly's 1978 The Toolbox Murders, Werner Herzog’s 1974 The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser, Peter Schamoni’s 1976 ', and Rino Di Silvestro’s 1976 Werewolf Woman, and tinkering with props for his own planned film. He also likes to read Astrid Proll’s works about Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof and the writings of Eduard Mörike. In his spare time, he shoots photos of animal cadavers while playing with them, also partly collecting them to take home with him, as he seems to have sexual attraction to them, and rapes women (Martina Adora, Stefanie Müller, and Carina Palmer) in the woods while they urinate. He indulges in several disturbing sexual fetishes including defecating, urinating, necrophilia, bestiality, anal fisting, rape, murder, nose-picking, and other unspeakable acts. He is in regular contact with a prostitute, Patrizia (Patrizia Johann), who puts an enema into her anus and defecates into a bucket while placing the man onto a table, shoving her fist into his anus and pulling feces out of there while he is putting the bucket to his face. By telephone, he also stays in contact with Jesús Franco, , Peter Martell, and David Hess (who composed most of this film's score). After a while, he actually contacted a woman, Franziska (Alexandra Dumas), who read his advertisement in the supermarket. They arrange a meeting in the man's house. When he tells her what he is supposed to do in his film, the woman gets scared and wants to leave the house. Then, Carsten overwhelms her and kills her by strangling her with a telephone cord and beating her head. Afterwards, he films himself as he is sexually aroused by her corpse. He cuts her nipples off in graphic detail and uses his scalpel to cut the dead woman's clitoris off. He then takes the scalpel and peels the skin off one of her fingers and eats the pieces of dismembered skin. The film ends with a scene showing Carsten burning the same woman's body and going jogging, as in the first shot of this film.

He calls for synergy between various government agencies, ministries and missions involved in investment drive. The professor of political science, thinks Nigeria's Local Government System, rather than be an instrument of development, is the most tragic aspect of the country's current democratic system as it is currently not run as it should be.

In addition, the band also stated that the album \\"coats an undercurrent of restless, anxious dread in a sheen of light, apathetic content - both real and parody - rather than wallowing in self-pity, encouraging us to celebrate the fruits of our planet, frolic in the ocean, kick up the dust, roll in the grass and enjoy the feeling of being in love - while we still can.\\"BWW News Desk. \\"Pond Announce New Album TASMANIA, Share DAISY Video\\", Broadway World, 10 January 2019 Singles \\"Burnt Out Star\\" and \\"Sixteen Days\\" were released in 2018 as the first two tracks from the album, released on 23 July and 5 October respectively.

In 1527 the early Reformer Johann Englisch (Johannes Anglicus) wrote two stanzas as a rhyming close paraphase of the Nunc dimittis, or Canticle of Simeon. The hymn is sung to a melody by Wolfgang Dachstein, written before 1530. Friedrich Spitta revised the lyrics in 1898 and added a third stanza. His revision transformed Englisch's prayer of an individual with a focus on a peaceful death to a communal one more about peaceful life in unity. This version is part of the German Protestant hymnal, Evangelisches Gesangbuch, as EG 222. An ecumenical song, it is also part of the current Catholic hymnal, Gotteslob, as GL 216. It appears in several other hymnals.  History  The development of the hymn spans four stages within the history of Christianity. Its initial inspiration draws from the account of Jesus being presented at the temple 40 days after his birth, in a ritual of purification depicted in the Gospel of Luke. On that occasion, Simeon praised the light that appeared by the baby. Centuries later, Simeon's canticle became a regular part of the Liturgy of the Hours as the Nunc dimittis, especially connected to the feast of the purification. Thirdly, during the Reformation, the was used as a prayer of thanks after communion, as documented in a Nördlingen liturgy of 1522 and a Strasbourg liturgy of 1524, the latter specifically calling for its use \\"after the meal\\" or communion (\\"\\"). The rhyming paraphrase created by Johann Englisch, or , first appearing in 1527 on a now-lost leaflet, became a regular part of Strasbourg hymnals from 1530 on. His version retains the theme of the , with its ideas of rest in peace after having seen the light of a saviour who came for all people and especially Israel. The hymn is sung to a melody attributed to Wolfgang Dachstein, written before 1530. It is one of three hymns described as ' (Simeon's song of praise) appearing in an 1848 collection of ' (\\"Treasure of Protestant church singing in the first century of the reformation\\"). The first two are the Biblical canticle in Martin Luther's translation, and Luther's paraphrase \\"\\", followed by \\"\\". A footnote marks the three songs as also suitable for funerals. Friedrich Spitta Finally, in 1898, Friedrich Spitta, a Protestant theologian, revised the song and added a third stanza, which is now usually placed between the older stanzas. He shifted the meaning from an individual prayer for a good death to a communal prayer for a meaningful life. The focus is on communion as a way for believers to see the light of Christ and thereby live in peace and unity. With additional minor changes, this version of the hymn is part of the German Protestant hymnal, ', as EG 222. An ecumenical song, it is also part of the current Catholic hymnal, ', as GL 216, in the section \\"\\" (Songs – Week – Communion – Thanks after Communion). It appears in several other hymnals.  Text  The text of the hymn is as follows, on the left as in Tucher's 1848 publication which shows Englisch's two stanzas, on the right the text from the current German hymnals: Englisch's lyrics are a close paraphrase of the , about being able to go in peace after having seen the light of the Saviour (\\"\\"). Simeon said so after actually seeing the baby Jesus, 40 days after his birth, and for him departing in peace could mean readiness to die. Englisch begins in the first person, addressing God as his Lord (\\"\\"), who prays to be allowed to rest in God's peace (\\"\\"). Spitta transfers the thought to a more general meaning, of travelling one's roads after having seen the light, adding that His mercy is unmeasurable (\\"\\"). The second stanza in Englisch's version is a paraphrase of the second part of Simeon's canticle, mentioning the dear guest (\\"\\"), alluding to Jesus, for all people including the heathen, and for the greatness of Israel. Spitta changes the focus, identifying the singer with the guest (instead of referring to Jesus), invited to a rich meal of mercy (\\"\\"). The meal offers the bread of life (\\"\\"), which joins the invited believers to God and among each other, a reason to praise, filled with sense and courage (\\"\\"). The heathen and Israel are not mentioned in his version. The final stanza is a prayer for love and faithfulness in God connecting \\"us all\\" (\\"\\"), so that hand and mouth will show the friendliness of the Lord, until after this time all may find a seat at his table. The lyrics follow a pattern of two rhyming short lines followed by a longer line, repeated three times in a stanza, with the three longer lines all rhyming: .  Melodies  From 1530, the hymn was associated with a melody attributed to Wolfgang Dachstein. The tune has an element often found in Strasbourg melodies, a rhythm of long-short-short-long, here used for the short lines. The first two long lines begin with a long note, followed by a sequence of equally short notes, ending on two long notes. The first line begins with the lowest note and rises a fourth, step by step. The other short lines have similar patterns, such as the equal lines which begin the second and third section, moving a fourth downward. The last section begins an octave higher than the second ends, a feature often found in contemporary Strasbourg melodies, especially by Matthäus Greiter, sometimes accentuating a bar form's '. The last line, beginning like the first line, is the only one which has a melisma. In Dachstein's composition, it stresses the last word by dotted notes, rising to an octave above the first note. The stressed word in the first stanza is \\"\\" (seen) and in the second \\"\\" (people, meaning Israel). Shortly before the end of the melisma, a ligature typical for German melodies of the 16th century moves around (\\"\\") the second to last note, then released to the key note. While it is usually difficult to find a relation between words and music in strophic texts, it can be assumed that peace is expressed by the calm movement, up and down in symmetry. The last rising line might even be experienced as an expression of a vision of God (\\"\\"), although it seems unlikely that the composer had that in mind. The long and complex last line is difficult for congregational singing, and later versions therefore often abbreviate the melisma, in various ways. An 1899 hymnal for Alsace-Lorraine has a version with only the ligature before the end, the version in today's hymnals. However, the first publication of Spitta's text came with Dachstein's melody.  Musical settings  Samuel Mareschall composed a four-part choral setting in 1606, published by Carus- Verlag. Herbert Beuerle composed a setting for three parts in 1953. In 1980, Aldo Clementi wrote a motet for eight voices. Bernhard Blitsch composed a motet for four parts in 2013. Gaël Liardon published an organ work in 2014.

In the game, players take control of a transforming robot named Chalvo through a series of levels riddled with hazardous obstacles to avoid across multiple worlds, while destroying or knocking out alien invaders off the area. The project was first conceptualized by designer and programmer Hideyuki Nakanishi, who wrote the idea on paper and placed it within a wall inside the offices of Japan System Supply, with his manager eventually greenlighting its development after seeing it. Although showcased at various trading shows and completed for release, it was ultimately shelved due to the failure of the Virtual Boy itself. After its cancellation, a follow-up on the Game Boy titled Chalvo 55 was released in 1997. Despite its cancellation, a ROM image of the complete game was leaked online in 2010 by the hobbyist community at Planet Virtual Boy, allowing for it to be played.  Gameplay  Bound High! uses a red-and-black color scheme standard to the Virtual Boy. Bound High! is a top-down action-puzzle game where players take control of Chalvo, a robot who transforms itself into a bouncing ball. The game's objective is to destroy or knock out enemies from the playfield and figuring out the best way to dispatch them while avoiding hazardous obstacles. Falling out of the playfield results in a lost life and all the previously defeated enemies are respawned. If all lives are lost, the game is over. Bound High! has four game modes to choose from, each one having their own ruleset and main objectives: Adventure of Chalvo, Score Attack!!, Random Game and Pocket and Cushion. Adventure of Chalvo features multiple sets of levels, with a story centered around Chalvo defending Earth from aliens. Power-ups are also available which help players defeat enemies more efficiently. Upon completing four stages, a fifth stage must be played where players join + and - orbs together to gain points. On every 10th level, a boss must be fought. Score Attack!! is a score-based mode where players attempt to defeat all enemies in a stage in the most efficient manner. Random Game is a skirmish mode where players are placed in procedurally-generated stages. Pocket and Cushion tasks players with getting balls into a hole in the fastest time possible to achieve a high score.  History  Bound High! was cancelled due to Virtual Boy's poor critical and commercial reception. Bound High! was conceived by Chameleon Twist creator Hideyuki Nakanishi at Japan System Supply, who worked as one of the designers and programmers on the project as an undergraduate student. Nakanishi had looked at game plans on the desk of the company's president and found them uninteresting. This led to Nakanishi creating a summary for Bound High! and leaving it on the wall for the president to find. This led to the project being greenlit. One of Nakanishi's co-workers handled the sound programming along with composer Takaaki Oka, while Nakanishi handled everything else. More members eventually joined the development process. Bound High! was first showcased to the video game press and attendees of Shoshinkai 1995, and later had its rights purchased by Nintendo, which originally slated it for a February 23, 1996 release. It was later showcased at E3 1996 and was set to be one of the first games for the relaunch of the Virtual Boy along with Intelligent Systems' Dragon Hopper. It was slated for a August 26, 1996 launch in both United States and Japan; however it was never released due to Nintendo discontinuing the Virtual Boy for being a commercial failure. On May 3, 2010, a complete ROM image compiled from the source code of Bound High! that was acquired by hobbyist community Planet Virtual Boy was leaked online. A limited number of reproduction copies were created and released, complete with packaging mimicking officially licensed Virtual Boy releases.  Reception and legacy  Prior to the discontinuation of the Virtual Boy that led to Bound High! being cancelled, former Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi called the game as \\"the most promising title\\" during his keynote speech at Shoshinkai 1995. In a preview, Nintendo Power referred to its design as \\"fiendish.\\" They later praised it, noting that it had the potential to be one of the best Virtual Boy releases. 1UP.coms Todd Ciolek noted it as a notable cancelled game, praising its use of the Virtual Boy's visual design. Retronauts writer Jeremy Parish speculated that the release of Star Fox 2 on the SNES Classic could lead to Bound High! seeing a proper release as well. After the release of Bound High! on Virtual Boy was cancelled, Japan System Supply took most of the ideas and the soundtrack when developing a follow-up on the Game Boy titled Chalvo 55 that was released in February 1997. Hideyuki Nakanishi was not involved during its development due to lack of interest.

He played one first- class game for the British Army cricket team in 1930. Garthwaite served in North Africa during the Second World War and was mentioned in dispatches in March 1945. He continued to be active in cricket, captaining the Army and Combined Services cricket teams into the 1950s. He retired as a Brigadier in 1963. Early life and career Born at Guisborough, his father was a land agent from County Durham who worked for the Earl of Airlie. He attended Wellington College with his identical twin-brother Peter. The brothers both played for the school cricket team and caused some confusion due to their similar looks. After completing his schooling Garthwaite attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He graduated from the academy in August 1929 and entered into the Royal Artillery as a second lieutenant. He played first-class cricket for the British Army cricket team in 1930, making one appearance against the Royal Air Force at The Oval. Garthwaite batted twice during the match, being dismissed without scoring by Reginald Fulljames in the Army's first-innings, with the same bowler dismissing him for 7 runs in their second- innings. Garthwaite served at the Shorncliffe Garrison in 1931. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in August 1932, with promotion to captain six years later in August 1938. During this period he served overseas in Hong Kong. Garthwaite was appointed adjutant on 1 April 1939 and was seconded from the Royal Artillery the next month. WWII and later career He served in World War II, commanding the Royal Artillery's 43rd Battery in North Africa, and was mentioned in dispatches in March 1945. Following the war, he was promoted to the rank of major in June 1946. In February 1952 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and served in the garrison at Shoeburyness. During this time Garthwaite remained active in army cricket. In 1953 he was looking for new team members and was able to persuade Warwickshire county player Tom Cartwright to join the Royal Artillery when his National Service call-up came through. This was despite Cartwright's preference for his county regiment, the Royal Warwickshires, and interest from the Royal Air Force. Cartwright would later play in the Army and Combined Services teams captained by Garthwaite. Garthwaite served as chairman of the Royal Artillery Cricket Club in 1955, 1956, 1961 and 1962. In June 1958 he was promoted to the rank of brigadier. He served as an aide-de-camp to Elizabeth II and was made a CBE in the 1961 New Year Honours. Garthwaite then served as commander of the garrison at the Royal Artillery Barracks. He retired from the military in February 1963 and ceased to be liable for recall in the reserves on reaching his 68th birthday. During his retirement he ran a business from his home at Larkfield, Kent. He died at Aylesbury in January 1979.

Näcke is known for his writings on homosexuality, and coining the term narcissism in 1899 to describe someone who treated his body as a sexual object.On Narcissism, p. 74  Career  He received his doctorate in 1873 in Würzburg, titled (English title translated): \\"About intestinal perforation and typhoid abdominalis\\". He worked in various Parisian hospitals; later he took an interest in psychiatry. In 1912 he became the director of the psychiatric hospital at Colditz Castle.Isidor Fischer (1932/33). Biographical Encyclopedia of the Excellent Physicians of the Last Fifty Years, Volume 2 (p. 1097). Berlin and Vienna: Urban & Fischer Näcke, along with Hans Gross, a professor of criminology, founded the archive of criminal anthropology and criminology in Dresden in 1898.Galassi, Silviana (2004). Criminology in the German Empire. History of a Broken Verschafissenschaftlichung (p. 164), Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner-Verlag In 1884 Näcke wrote the first monograph on women's crime in Germany. He suggested a \\"sensible emancipation of women\\", which was groundbreaking for the time, but did not mean equal rights. Näcke is considered a strong opponent of Positive criminology, that was founded by Cesare Lombroso. Näcke described Lombroso's work as marked by \\"arbitrariness, exaggerations, [and] jumping to conclusions\\" Näcke, Paul (1893). On the methodology of a scientific criminal anthropology. Central Journal of Neurology and Psychiatry, 16 , p. 458 According to Näcke, criminals are the product of external influences,Baumann, Imanuel (2006). On the trail of crime. A History of Criminology and Criminal Policy in Germany, 1880 to 1980 (p. 51). Göttingen: Wallstein and not only biological influences as thought by Lombroso. This does not mean that Näcke disapproved of a biological basis for crime altogether. His argument is that every human being is a \\"latent criminal\\". Näcke was one of the first advocates of the sterilization of \\"degenerate criminals\\" and \\"degenerates\\" in general.Weingart, Peter, Kroll, Jürgen Bayertz, Kurt (1998). Race, blood and genes. History of Eugenics and Racial Hygiene in Germany (p. 284). Frankfurt a. Main: Suhrkamp He saw it as a public duty to make \\"degenerates\\" infertile. By 1900, he published a work entitled The castration of certain classes of degenerates as an effective way of social protection (title translated)Kesper-Biermann, Sylvia & Overath, Petra (2007). The Internationalization of Criminal Justice and Criminal Policy (1870-1930): Comparing Germany (p. 139), Berlin BWV Näcke wrote on the subject of a Jewish character, which was described only in vague and general features, and considered that character as a reason for crimes committed by Jews.Vyleta, Daniel (2005). Jewish Crimes and Misdemeanours: In Search of Jewish Criminality (Germany and Austria, 1890-1914) European History Quarterly, 35, p. 306 Näcke stated his position in 1899: \\"the State has the holy duty to intervene... and to prevent through legislation the increase of the degenerated elements. Such an intervention would aim at the removal of a big cancer in our national body\\". He asserted that only castration could guarantee that this task was fulfilled both effectively and in the \\"easiest, cheapest way\\". In 1912, Näcke wrote against the then common diagnosis of \\"moral insanity\\". He developed the idea that homosexuality should not be regarded as a mental illness, but as an innate natural property. He described male menstruation as clear evidence of a continuum between male and female sexuality.Broich, Ulrich, Linder, Joachim & Schonert, Joerg (1981).

Näcke is said to have mastered seven languages. Näcke was married since 1886 and had several children. Throughout his life he suffered from a neurasthenia, also known as Effort syndrome.

Batocabe (April 25, 1966 – December 22, 2018) was a Filipino lawyer, politician, and member of the Ako Bicol Political Party (AKB). Batocabe served in the House of Representatives of the Philippines for three terms from 2010 until his murder in office on December 22, 2018, at a gift-giving event for senior citizens in the village of Burgos, Daraga municipality, Albay. Batocabe was the first sitting member of the House of Representatives to be killed during the administration of Rodrigo Duterte, but he was the 21st Filipino official to be murdered since Duterte's tenure began in 2016. Batocabe was a political ally of President Duterte. Biography Batocabe was born on April 25, 1966. Batocabe earned a bachelor's degree with honors in economics from the University of the Philippines Diliman. He then received his law degree from the University of the Philippines College of Law and a master's degree in public administration from the University of the Philippines Diliman. Batocabe was first elected to House of Representatives of the Philippines in 2010, an office he held until his death. =Murder= In 2018, Batocabe announced that he would not seek re-election to the House of Representatives. Instead, Batocabe announced his candidacy for Mayor of Daraga in Albay province in the forthcoming May 2019 general elections. He would have challenged Daraga Mayor Carlwyn Baldo, who was also seeking re-election (under Lakas) in 2019. On December 22, 2018, Batocabe was attending a gift giving event for senior citizens in the small village of Burgos in Daraga, Albay. Two men approached Batocabe, who was 52 years-old, at the event and shot him eight times. His police escort, Officer Orlando Diaz, was also killed, while seven elderly attendees were also wounded in the attack. Batocabe and Diaz were taken to a hospital in Legazpi City, where both were pronounced dead. By coincidence, December 22 also marked Batocabe's wedding anniversary to his wife, Gertie. On January 3, 2019, it was announced that Daraga Mayor Carlwyn Baldo had ordered the killing of Rep. Batocabe. At the time of his murder, Batocabe was running for Mayor of Daraga, while Baldo was seeking re-election. According to the police, Baldo hired six men to kill Batocabe and set up $95,000 in funds to pay for the murder. The plot had allegedly been in the works since August 2018, when Baldo supplied $4,600 to one of the hitmen to purchase guns and motorcycles. Mayor Carlwyn Baldo denied the allegations in a statement read over the phone to local radio stations, calling himself \\"a convenient scapegoat.\\" References Category:1966 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Members of the House of Representatives of the Philippines from Albay Category:Ako Bicol politicians Category:Assassinated Filipino politicians Category:Deaths by firearm in the Philippines Category:Filipino lawyers Category:University of the Philippines Diliman alumni ","title":"Rodel Batocabe"},{"id":"59656344","text":"Miraflores is a barrio in the municipality of Añasco, Puerto Rico.
