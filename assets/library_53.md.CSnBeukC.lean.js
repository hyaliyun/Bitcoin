Louie was a small chap, a loser who was constantly annoyed by life's little vicissitudes and minor moments. Hanan described his mild-mannered character as \\"the anti-Superman\\".Louie at Don Markstein's Toonopedia Biography Born in Liverpool, Lancashire, England, Harry Hanan went to the Liverpool School of Art and found employment doing layouts and illustrating articles for the Liverpool Evening Express, plus an occasional bonus for drawing a daily cartoon, eventually writing film reviews and serving as the newspaper's features editor. He also designed posters and stage sets in Liverpool. An infantry commander during the Second World War, Hanan experienced six years of military service. In post-Second World War London, he became an editorial cartoonist with The People, London's weekly tabloid with a circulation of four million. Meeting his weekly deadline in short order, Hanan created Louie in his spare time, and it was first published in The People in March 1947. When H. R. Wishengrad, head of Press Features, saw Hanan's strip, he decided to syndicate it in the United States. With Hanan drawing both the daily and the Sunday strips, Louie found a large readership in more than 100 American newspapers, initially distributed by the Hall Syndicate and later by the Chicago Tribune Syndicate. Because Louie had visual gags with no words to translate, it also appeared in more than 100 publications in 23 countries, including Turkey and Japan. Some newspapers ran it on their editorial pages. With the success of the strip, Hanan and his family left London in November 1948 and moved to the United States, where they settled in Westfield, New Jersey. Hanan's suburban lifestyle there was reflected in the strip's settings and characters. Hanan commented, \\"Even when we're settled, Louie and I tend to be shiftless. People seem to like that.\\" One comics historian noted that Louie bore a striking resemblance to Hanan, who retired in 1976 and died six years later. Exhibitions Harry Hanan's Louie (22 August 1948) Louie was included in the Renaissance Society's \\"Comic Strip as Art\\" exhibit at the University of Chicago 22 January to 22 February 1968. Hanan's paintings were exhibited at the Walker Art Gallery and the Metropolitan Museum of Art and were in the permanent collection at the William Allen White Foundation. Hanan was also a judge at juried art exhibitions. The popularity of Louie was indicated by its inclusion in the Newspaper Comic Strip Stars Drawing Tablet, published in 1959 by Hytone, a division of the Western Tablet & Stationery Corporation in Dayton, Ohio. Archives The Harry Hanan Papers are in the Special Collections Research Center of the Syracuse University Library. This consists of 128 original daily Louie strips (1953‚Äì64) (traces of graphite, Zipatone, pen and ink on illustration board, approximately 4¬æ x 17¬Ω inches), a dozen newspaper and magazine clippings about Hanan and his work (including family pictures) (1947‚Äì50), reader correspondence (1947‚Äì63), an undated photograph of Hanan and one family picture (1948), plus 27 Louie proof sheets (1964‚Äì66) (six daily strips per newsprint sheet, 9 x 16¬Ω inches).Special Collections, Syracuse University Library: Harry Hanan See also *Ferd'nand *Henry *The Little King References External links * Category:1916 births Category:1982 deaths Category:British cartoonists Category:British comic strip cartoonists Category:People from Westfield, New Jersey ","title":"Harry Hanan"},{"id":"33113791","text":"Kristen Johanssen Kristen Johanssen (19 July 1869 - May 19, 1949) was a Norwegian attorney and jurist.

It is to the east of the Julia-Ann Square Historic District and south of the Parkersburg High School-Washington Avenue Historic District. Primarily residential, it encompasses 109 acres and includes churches, a school, and a small commercial area. Built as Parkersburg's first \\"suburb\\" in the late-19th and early-20th century in popular architectural style such as Colonial Revival and Queen Anne, the district exhibits 12 distinctive types of Historic architecture. There are 358 contributing buildings, 59 of which are considered to be pivotal. U.S. Senator Johnson N. Camden (1826-1908) owned most of the land now included in the district. Located in the district are the separately listed Parkersburg Women's Club and the First Presbyterian Church/Calvary Temple Evangelical Church. It was added to the National Register of Historical Places in 1986.  History  As Michael J. Pauley, historian, explains \\"The Avery Street Historic District District, Parkersburg's first \\"suburban\\" development, is highly significant for the historic role it played in sustaining the city as one of West Virginia's leading cities, housing the families who were the \\"life-blood\\" of the city's growth and development, and is significant for reflecting the rich architectural legacy of this region. The decade of 1900-1910 was the real period of growth for the district. During this decade the \\"Avery Street Extension\\" as the area on Avery Street (8th Street to beyond 19th) was then called, took form as a real neighborhood; much of the built environment of today's district took place during this period.\\"  Architecture  The National Register of Historic Places survey identified 12 distinctive historic architectural styles, with some sub-types, within the district. Michael J. Pauley notes \\"all of these styles were flourishing throughout the united states during the time period in which the district was developed.

He was deputy Prime Minister. Biography In the 1990s, he was an officer in the Papua New Guinea Defence Force, with the rank of captain. He was involved in the aftermath of the Sandline affair in 1997. In July, he and three other soldiers accompanied Captain Bola Renagi to see newly appointed Prime Minister Bill Skate, following Prime Minister Julius Chan's resignation under military pressure over the use of mercenaries in the conflict in Bougainville province. Renagi asked Skate to disband the Special Operations Group, to which the military was hostile. Namah, Renagi and the three other men were arrested and charged with sedition for their approach to the Prime Minister; the public prosecution argued that they had been attempting to obtain a pardon from the government for the military personnel involved in the near-coup of the Sandline affair. He was tried, convicted and jailed with his fellow officers in late 1997.

When Sir Mekere Morauta stepped down from the leadership of the Opposition and of the PNG Party, in May 2010, Namah was elected to take over both, with Sam Basil (MP for Bulolo) as his deputy. Upon becoming Leader of the Opposition, and leader of the PNG Party with an eye to the 2012 general election, Namah said that any government he might lead would aim to provide free universal education (noting that education was \\"a right guaranteed under the constitution\\") and healthcare, and \\"fix the law and order problem in this country\\". In that regard, discipline would be instilled by compelling prospective students to undergo a two-year military service before entering university.

Upon taking office, Namah stated that the new government would, as a matter of priority, commit funds to provide free education to all the children in the country. As Minister for Climate Change, he also said he would be replacing PNG Climate Change Ambassador Kevin Conrad. Namah said that Conrad, who was born in the United States and lives there (although he grew up in Papua New Guinea), had insufficient knowledge and understanding of the country, its people and culture.

It lies roughly midway between the town of Leominster to the north and the city of Hereford to the south, the A49 road which links them climbing the hill in a series of sweeping bends. The north-south railway lines run within the two Dinmore Tunnels beneath the hill. In civil engineering preparation for the building of the present Hereford railway station, and as the only company planning to enter the town from the north, in 1849 the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway company built a brick works north of Dinmore Hill, which was fed by clay from the earthworks of the tunnel being dug underneath it. In 1852, 2¬Ω years later and having used 3¬º million bricks, the first tunnel was completed. At the northern foot of the hill is the hamlet of Hope under Dinmore.

It is based in Cairo. The Chairman is Abdallah Ben Abdel Mohsen At-Turki, who is also General Secretary of the Muslim World League. Principals The League has supported a revival of the traditional waqf system of private welfare, which includes separation of schools from government control. The proceedings of a 1998 conference organized by the League noted: \\"The waqf system is in harmony with the principle of economic freedom, which was historically at the basis of the Islamic economy. Islamic governments, in fact, could not intervene in the activities of the individual and the Islamic state did not have any economic role of activities, contrary to what is happening today. The waqf system allowed, on the one hand, to redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor and, on the other, to support public utilities, such as mosques, hospitals and schools that must not, in a true Islamic state, be a government duty. In January 2002 the executive council of the league of Islamic universities issued the \\"Ismailia Declaration\\". This states that Islam has always urged Muslims to conduct dialogue with others in a wise and peaceful manner. It categorically denies reports of Muslims working for the destruction of contemporary civilization. Activities In March 2005 the League announced a conference to be held in Morocco in September on 'Islam and the West: Constant Relations and New Challenges'. The League's Secretary General Jaffar Abdulsalam said the meeting of scholars would be organized with the European Islamic Conference, the General Federation of Muslims in France and the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (ISESCO). It would review relations between Islam and the west and examine how international Islamic and European organizations could enhance these relations. The League, working with the Sana'a University, organized the Second International Conference of Islamic Architecture and Arts in Sana'a, Yemen in mid-June 2010. Conference participants discussed the importance of increasing awareness of the need to preserve Islamic architecture and the arts, which in many areas is threatened by the invasion of commercial areas. Relationship to FUIW At a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation meeting in Islamabad, Pakistan in November / December 1987, it was agreed that ISESCO would set up a federation of Islamic countries' universities. Mr. Mohamed Ben Bachir, Secretary General of the League of Islamic Universities, expressed his support for the establishment of the Federation of the Universities of the Islamic World. The fourth General Conference of the Federation of the Universities of the Islamic World (FUIW) was held on 4‚Äì5 April 2007 in Kuwait. The Secretary General presented a report on \\"the Merger Project between the FUIW and the League of Islamic Universities\\". This report described the outcome of the meetings between the General Secretariat of the Federation of the Universities of the Islamic World and the League of Islamic Universities. After discussing the report, the meeting appealed to the League of Islamic Universities to enhance joint Islamic action by working towards merger with the FUIW.

Handed over to the Soviet Union following World War II, the ship was renamed Ekvator. Her ultimate fate is not known.  Design and construction  Her keel was laid at the Kaiserliche Werft at Danzig in February 1914 and Meteor was launched in January 1915. Originally intended to become a gunboat for the Imperial German Navy's colonial service she was not finished during the First World War due to limited need for lightly armed vessels. After the war the uncompleted hull was tugged to Wilhelmshaven for outfitting work at the Reichsmarinewerft. She was outfitted as a survey vessel and early sonar equipment was fitted. The ship had a steel hull with two propellers each driven by a triple-expansion steam engine. Additionally she had a brigantine rig to boost range. Career Meteor was commissioned as a military ship with the Reichsmarine but spent most of her life in a scientific role. = Scientific work = Meteor departing her homeport with full military honors An outline of Meteor, circa 1925 Meteor entered service in November 1924 and made her maiden survey expedition between 20 January and 17 February 1925 with the main purpose to check the equipment. On 16 April 1925 Meteor started the German Atlantic expedition, also known as German Meteor expedition, and did not return to Germany until 2 June 1927. During this expedition the ship sailed more than and took cross sections of the South Atlantic between Africa and South America mapping the entire ocean.Stein In the course of this survey work Meteor found a bank (seamount) that rises to below sea level from a depth of . This bank was named \\"Meteor Bank\\" (). Between 1929 and 1935 Meteor made several journeys to Iceland and Greenland, where she performed survey work as well as fishery protection duties. A North Atlantic Expedition was performed in 1937/38 in order to take cross sections of the North Atlantic that complemented the earlier survey work done in the South Atlantic. During the Gulf Stream Expedition from 1938 a plateau rising to below surface from a sea depth of more than 4,000 m was discovered. In order to distinguish it from the smaller bank found in the South Atlantic, this bank was named \\"Great Meteor Bank\\" and is today known as Great Meteor Seamount (). = Second World War = With the outbreak of the Second World War the ship was removed from service on 8 September 1939. Reactivated in 1940 Meteor was used as a tender in the Baltic Sea as well along the Norwegian Coast. With the end of the war, the ship was laid off in Kiel. = Soviet service = In November 1945 the ship was handed over to the Soviet Union, but briefly returned into German service for a few months in 1946 to perform survey work under Soviet supervision. Eventually she became the Soviet survey vessel Ekvator. Her final fate is unclear, she was either scrapped in 1968 or survived some more years as a barracks ship.

IRV is a strategy (method or style) of ventilating the lungs in such a way that the amount of time the lungs are in inhalation is greater than the amount of time they are in exhalation, allowing for a constant inflation of the lungs, ensuring they remain \\"recruited\\" (meaning they participate in gas exchange and are not allowed to deflate to get stuck together or tighten up). The primary goal for IRV is improved oxygenation by forcing inspiratory time to be greater than expiratory time (example: inhale is 3 seconds and exhalation is 1 second, a 3:1 I:E ratio) increasing the mean airway pressure and potentially improving oxygenation. Normal I:E ratio is 5:6, so forcing the I:E to be 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, (or even as high as 20:1) is the source of the term for the strategy. IRV has not often been shown to improve important clinical outcomes, such as mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, or duration of ICU stay. This may be due to the fact that IRV is not considered as a mode early enough once ARDS is diagnosed. The preponderance of evidence suggests that IRV improves oxygenation, although the evidence is weak and characterized by low quality, conflicting studies. Types IRV can be performed during pressure-controlled ventilation (PC-IRV) or volume-controlled ventilation(VC-IRV). Neither is clearly superior to the other. In a multicenter, randomized trial that compared PC-IRV to VC-IRV in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, the type of IRV did not affect mortality. Associated risk The shorter expiratory time during IRV increases the risk of auto-PEEP and its associated development of problems (e.g. pulmonary barotrauma, hypotension). IRV also appears to increase the risk of pulmonary barotrauma independent of auto-PEEP. In a study of 14 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation with PC-IRV, the incidence of pneumothorax was 29 percent despite the lack of measurable auto-PEEP. Modes that utilize IRV The most popular mode that utilizes IRV is the airway pressure release ventilation mode, also known by the brand name \\"BiVent\\". This employs an extremely high inverse ratio in a continuous pressure system similar to biphasic positive airway pressure but with several additional variables.

The official Army history of the War in southeast Asia considers him to have been a \\"key ... commander in Vietnam\\". He is the son of Richard Wetherill and Elenor Jane Eckerson. Education and early career Wetherill graduated from West Point Military Academy in 1940, as had his father and both his sons, Roderick Jr. and Robert Wetherill as well as both grandsons, Chad and Brett Wetherill. While a young Lieutenant, he married Josephine Bolling, in March 1941, at a church in Waban, Massachusetts; his bride was a daughter of Army officer Alexander R. Bolling, who later became a Lieutenant General and former Chief of Army Intelligence. He was working there at West Point after graduation, and residing in Highland Falls, New York, when his son Roderick Wetherill Jr., was born on January 20, 1942. His first son was born six weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the day after his own birthday. He was promoted several times during and after World War II. In June 1953, then- Lieutenant Colonel Wetherill took part in a \\"retrograde movement\\" at Pukhan River as commander of the 176th Field Artillery Battalion, towards the end of the Korean War. He was awarded the Silver Star and the Legion of Merit for his service. He was \\"division artillery advisor\\" at the battle of Pukhan River, and witnessed first-hand the horrible casualties; he said, \\"I could see by the gun flashes the arms legs and faces hanging all over the wire.\\" He also attempted to save some soldiers from being captured as prisoners of war by the Chinese \\"Red\\" Army. From about 1955 to 1957 was a Colonel stationed at the Headquarters, Continental Army Command. From April 1963 through December 1964, he was chief of staff of V Corps in Germany, at the rank of Brigadier General. Vietnam War Walter Cronkite reported on location during the Vietnam War. After a long military career, Wetherill rose to the rank of Major General. Wetherill was appointed the Senior Advisor, IV Corps, Delta Military Assistance Command on June 1, 1969, and served until February 1970. He advised General Abrams in June 1969 to transfer certain units of the Vietnamese army out of Saigon to the Mekong delta area to allow them to gain combat experience, but Wetherill's advice was ignored. Just as he feared, the North Vietnamese army invaded the Mekong Delta in August 1969. Wetherill was quoted extensively in a nationally syndicated UPI story about the offensive. Specifically, he noted that this was not merely the Viet Cong being involved, but regular enemy troops being engaged for the first time in the area. He famously said about those North Vietnam troop movements in the Mekong Delta: In September 1969, Walter Cronkite of CBS News reported that some civilian advisors had also advised withdrawing U.S. troops; he further quoted Wetherill as describing both the displaced persons there and the withdrawal of American troops. Fort Sill Old infantry barracks at Fort Sill, Comanche County, outside Lawton, Oklahoma. Wetherill was sent stateside to Fort Sill, which he commanded from February 1970 through the end of May 1973. As a commanding officer of Fort Sill, and its artillery school during the early 1970s, Wetherill was the named defendant in a famous conscientious objector case during the Vietnam War, Polsky v. Wetherill, 438 F.2d 132 (10th Cir. 1971). The Tenth Circuit decided Polski on jurisdictional grounds, without getting into the merits of the case, while sitting en banc. However, the Supreme Court vacated that judgment in Polsky v. Wetherill, 403 U.S. 916, 91 S.Ct. 2232, 29 L.Ed.2d 693 (1971), and remanded it to the Tenth Circuit for further consideration.Polsky v.

On remand, the Tenth Circuit ruled in favor of the petitioner 's request for a writ of habeas corpus, and against Wetherill, in Polsky v. Wetherill, 455 F.2d 960 (10th Cir. 1972). Polsky v. Wetherill was cited was precedent (\\"mandatory authority\\") in Miller v. United States Army, 458 F.2d 388 (10th Cir. 1972). He once sent an enlisted man to psychiatric evaluation, rather than trial, in Lozinski v. Wetherill, 21 USCMA 77, 44 CMR 131 (C.M.A. 1971). In another case, Robertson v. Wetherill, 21 USCMA 77, 44 CMR 131 (C.M.A. 1971), he ordered an enlisted man who was charged with possession of marijuana to face a general, rather than special, court martial. At Fort Sill, Wetherill also organized the 1970 Field Artillery Systems Review, which aimed for a major \\"Modernization of the Field Artillery System.\\" He inspected at least two college ROTC units in 1971, including that of Henderson State University in Arkansas.

Mrs George Lauri was the widow of a comedian who Butler had worked with years before. Raymond Longford was critical of the amount of time Butler spent filming, and said this caused the budget to increase. Reception Critical response was mixed. The critic from The Referee said the film \\"placed Australian film production on a higher plane\\".

Life The daughter of a Lutheran pastor, Cauer grew up in Freyenstein, in the Province of Brandenburg. She married a left-wing educator and physician, August Latzel in 1862, but was widowed in 1866. She then trained as a teacher, working in Paris for a year before marrying Eduard Cauer, a school inspector, and moving with him to Berlin. Widowed for a second time in 1881, Cauer resumed work as a teacher and started studying women's history. She founded the Women's Welfare Association (Frauenwohl) in Berlin in 1888, leading it until 1919, campaigning for women's rights and abortion rights. With Helene Lange and Franzisca Tiburtius she worked to establish the Realkurse girls' high school in Berlin, which opened in 1889 as the first educational establishment to prepare women for university study.Jean Macksey and Kenneth Macksey, The Book of Women's Achievements, Stein and Day, 1976, p. 72 She founded the Commercial Union of Female Salaried Employees, one of the first nonpolitical women's trade unions, in 1889. In 1893 she cofounded the Girls' and Women's Groups for Social Assistance Work (M√§dchen- und Frauengruppen f√ºr Soziale Hilfsarbeit).>Minna Cauer Papers In 1894 she joined with Anita Augspurg and Marie Stritt to establish the Federation of German Women's Associations (FGWA) In 1895 she co-drafted a law to abolish the Law of Association (eventually overturned in 1908), which banned women from joining political organizations. She worked for the feminist newspaper Die Frauenbewegung (The Women's Movement) from 1895 to 1919. In 1896 she was president at the International Congress of Women's Work and Women's Endeavours in Berlin, the first international women's conference to be held in Germany. Increasingly radical, Cauer helped establish the Union of Progressive Women's Associations in 1899. In 1902 the suffrage movement gained the backing of the FGWA, and with Anita Augspurg, Lida Gustava Heymann and Marie Stritt Cauer co- founded the German Union for Women's Suffrage (Deutscher Verband fur Frauenstimmrecht), which pursued both suffrage cause and moral campaigns, such as that against state-regulated prostitution. In 1908, frustrated by the disinterest of the Free-minded People's Party in women's suffrage, Cauer founded a more militant group, the Prussian Union for Women's Suffrage.

This plant is closely related to and sometimes treated as a subspecies of opium poppy (Papaver somniferum). In fact it produces a very small amount of morphine alkaloids. However, P. somniferum is diploid (n=11) and P. setigerum is tetraploid (n=22) with twice the number of chromosomes. So it cannot be considered the wild ancestral species of the opium poppy.C. G. Farmilo, H. L. J. Rhodes, , H. R. L. Hart and, H.

The stem is erect and the leaves are simple, oblong, the lower ones are sessile, deeply lobed and toothed, the higher ones shortly pedunculated. The flowers at the apex of the stem are hermaphroditic, actinomorphic (\\"star shaped\\", \\"radial\\"), 4 to 10 cm in diameter. The corolla forms a cup with four pink-purple petals, with a dark purple blotch at the base. It has several stamens with dark filaments holding yellow anthers. Flowering occurs from May through June. The fruits are glabrous capsules 2 to 3 cm long, dehiscent along the holes located under the apical disc. The kidney-shaped seeds are about 1 mm wide.Acta Plantarum Distribution This plant grows wild in the Mediterranean region, especially in southwestern Europe (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Greece) and in North Africa.setigerum&PTRefFk;=7500000 Euro+Med Plant Base Habitat This plant grows in pastures and fields, at an average altitude of above sea level.

It originally aired on September 15, 2011. The episode was written by Kevin Williamson and Julie Plec and directed by John Behring. Plot Stefan (Paul Wesley) is now with Klaus (Joseph Morgan) after promising him that he will do whatever Klaus tells him to do as exchange for saving his brother. The two of them try to find werewolves and track down one of them, Ray (David Gallagher). When they get to his house, two women are there. Klaus forces them to tell him where Ray is and then orders Stefan to kill both of them. Caroline (Candice Accola) organizes a birthday party for Elena (Nina Dobrev) despite Elena's wish not to have a party. Elena tries, with the help of Caroline's mother, to follow Klaus‚Äô victims so she will find where Stefan is. Damon (Ian Somerhalder) also tries to track down where Stefan and Klaus are with the help of Alaric (Matt Davis) but they do not tell Elena about their progress. Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen), since the moment Bonnie (Kat Graham) brought him back to life, keeps seeing the ghosts of Anna (Malese Jow) and Vicki (Kayla Ewell) but does not tell anyone about it. Later, at the birthday party, he tells Matt (Zach Roerig) that he sees things he should not see but does not clarify what. When the two of them head back home, Matt hears him calling Vicki's name and realizes what Jeremy was talking about earlier. Caroline and Tyler (Michael Trevino) grew closer during the summer but they are not together, as Caroline declines Tyler's proposal to be together. Tyler arrives with a date to Elena's birthday party, something that makes Caroline jealous and she ends up kissing him. The two of them go to Tyler's place and after having sex, Caroline tries to sneak out. Tyler's mother, Carol (Susan Walters), who suspects that Caroline must be a vampire, catches her on her way out and when Caroline tries to get her bag she burns out from vervain. Carol shoots her with more vervain injections and Caroline collapses. Damon and Alaric go to the werewolf's house after their last clues about where Stefan and Klaus might be, and find the two girls dead with their heads ripped off. Damon explains to Alaric that Stefan was the one who killed them as that is his signature and that is why he got his nickname, \\"The Ripper\\". Meanwhile, Klaus and Stefan find Ray and they torture him to tell them where the rest of his pack is. When Ray finally does, Klaus feeds him his blood and kills him to turn him into a hybrid. In the meantime, Klaus finds out that Damon still follows them, trying to find Stefan. Stefan overhears, and tells Klaus that he will handle his brother. Stefan finds Andie (Dawn Olivieri) in the TV news studio and when Damon gets there, Stefan tells him to stop searching for him. To make it clear, he compels Andie to jump off the roof. Andie dies, Stefan returns to Klaus and Damon goes home where Elena waits for him. Elena finds out that Damon was hiding things from her about Stefan. When she asks for an explanation, Damon tells her that she should forget about Stefan and that the victims they were tracking all this time were not Klaus‚Äô but Stefan's; this is why he did not want to tell her. Stefan calls Elena, but when she picks up the phone, he does not speak. Elena realizes that is Stefan and tells him to hold on, that everything is going to be fine and that she loves him.

That alone puts it above most television season openers. That the episode manages to move the audience emotionally so early in the season before viewers are usually invested in the story is extraordinary.\\" Steve Marsi from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.5/5 saying that the episode was a wild ride \\"that reaffirmed why the series has become a personal favorite and one of TV's best.\\" Diana Steenbergen of IGN rated the episode with 8.5/10 saying that the season is going to be sure \\"full of shocking twists and turns, although the season premiere largely focused on grounding the characters in their storylines.\\" Caroline Preece from Den of Geek gave a good review to the episode saying that the most exciting part \\"was the potential for Stefan the ripper and all that could entail. Viewers might be excited about showrunner's assurances of an Elena/Damon romance, but the suggestion of what the kinder, gentler brother could actually be capable of is more than a little intriguing.\\" E.

However, life again challenged her because her conditions became even worse when she was in the sixth grade. She was diagnosed as disabled and she had to drop out of school. Facing both the mentally and physically difficulties, she didn‚Äôt give in to her fate. She tried to learn at home all by herself. Her struggle against fate She had to work harder than other students because during the treatment in Nanjing she already missed many classes and the fact that she couldn‚Äôt go to school to get the teacher‚Äôs guidance means she had to depend on herself in her studies. And her body condition couldn‚Äôt allow her to study for a long time because she was so weak. So it was really strong-willed of her to achieve all the success. And after a struggling of many years, she took a test and got enrolled by Nanjing Normal University as she got the highest marks among the students who took the test. And later, after years of hard-working she became one of the best graduates in NNU and stayed to become a teacher in the university. Her achievements She also joined the Communist Party of China. And she always shows great loyalty to her country and the party. She donated much money to help the disabled children in many rural areas. And she has published a lot of articles in many famous magazines. And her struggle against fate has always been used to teach young students to cherish their better study conditions.

Hendricks (born May 22, 1945), an IBM computer scientist, developed RSCS (later known as VNET), fundamental software that powered the world‚Äôs largest network (or network of networks) prior to the Internet and which directly influenced both Internet development and user acceptance of networking between independently managed organizations. Within IBM, the resulting network later became known as VNET and grew to 4000 nodes.Varian In the academic community, VNET formed the base for BITNET which extended to 500 organizations and 3,000 nodes. VNET was also the networking design underpinning EARN in Europe, and NETNORTH in Canada.  Biography  Hendricks was born on May 22, 1945, in Lemoyne, Pennsylvania. He attended Herman Avenue Elementary School, Washington Heights Elementary School (both in Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, Lemoyne Middle School, and Cedar Cliff High School in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, all in the West Shore School District. He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in June, 1967 with a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. He began graduate studies with networking pioneer J. C. R. Licklider, but, impressed by the groundbreaking computer work being done nearby at the IBM Cambridge Scientific Center (CSC), he joined their staff in March 1968. Hendricks left the CSC in July 1977, joining the IBM San Jose Research Laboratory. In 1983, unable to convince IBM management to support his networking ideas for joining VNET and TCP/IP, he left IBM and worked as an independent consultant for several years. He then joined the Linkabit Corporation, and later became one of the very earliest employees at ViaSat in Carlsbad, CA. He now lives in San Diego, CA. Hendricks died on August 29, 2020 in Cardiff-by-the-Sea, California.  Technological Innovations  As an undergraduate, Hendricks visited the MIT student employment center where he was offered the position of computer operator, running an IBM System/360 model 65 computer. Hendricks was rapidly promoted to systems programmer. When IBM added a 2250 video display to the 360/65, Hendricks looked for a project to learn how to program it. Upstairs in the same building, Steve Russell had created ‚ÄúSpacewar!,‚Äù the first computer game, using a DEC PDP-1 computer. Hendricks wrote his own game, also named ‚ÄúSpacewar!,‚Äù which was the first computer video game to run on an IBM Computer. For several years, MIT used Hendricks version of ‚ÄúSpacewar!‚Äù at their Annual Open House, making it possibly the first video game ever to be seen (and played) by the general public. At IBM, Hendricks worked with the team that had developed the world‚Äôs first virtual machine operating systems, CP/CMS. A key problem with this new software architecture was finding a way to expand the functions of the system without significantly increasing the size of the hypervisor (control program). Hendricks developed the concept of a service virtual machine,Hendricks implemented in a simple communications system named CPREMOTE. In 1971, Norman Rasmussen, founder and manager of IBM‚Äôs Cambridge Scientific Center, asked Hendricks to find a way for the CSC machine to communicate with machines at IBM‚Äôs other Scientific Centers. Hendricks and Tim Hartmann, of the IBM Technology Data Center in Poughkeepsie, NY, produced RSCS, which went into operation within IBM in 1973. RSCS was later renamed and released to IBM customers as the VM/370 Networking PRPQ in 1975.A PRPQ (Programming Request for Price Quotation) was an IBM administrative term for software that was available but not fully supported as an IBM product.Despite this formal name, the network was almost universally referred to as VNET The importance of this subsystem as a component of VM is described by Robert Creasy.Creasy Meanwhile, in the fall of 1974, IBM announced Systems Network Architecture (SNA) as its official communications strategy. SNA was incompatible with VNET and with many of the networking ideas being developed for what would be called the Internet, particularly with TCP/IP. Hendricks and others lobbied vigorously within IBM for a change in direction, but were rebuffed. In June 1975, MIT Professor Jerry Saltzer accompanied Hendricks to DARPA, where Hendricks described his innovations to the principal scientist, Dr. Vinton Cerf. Later that year in September 15‚Äì19 of 75, Cerf and Hendricks were the only two delegates from the United States, to attend a workshop on Data Communications at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, 2361 Laxenburg Austria where again, Hendricks spoke publicly about his innovative design which paved the way to the Internet as we know it today. In 1977, Hendricks received an IBM \\"Outstanding Achievement Award,\\" for the \\"VM/370 Networking PRPQ,\\" and the IBM internal network. In the late 1970s, VNET was much larger than the ARPAnet/Internet as measured in the number of computers connected. In 1981, when the ARPAnet began converting to TCP/IP, there were about 250 ARPAnet nodes and 1000 VNET nodes.Lynn Wheeler, formerly of the IBM Cambridge Scientific Center, maintains an online archive of contemporaneous documents. These numbers, which changed rapidly, are stored at http://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2006k.html#8 verified on 2011-09-19 Hendricks and others had proposed the interconnection of the two networks. Turing Award winner Jim Gray, then at IBM, thought the VNET/ARPAnet linkup would be \\"absolutely wonderful -- with no downside except security risks, which were containable.\\" Gillmor IBM management declined.

It is a shrub or tree with compound leaves resembling fern fronds, and spherical heads of yellow or bright yellow flowers from autumn to late spring. It is a common and widespread species, especially on the coast and tablelands of New South Wales. Description Acacia filicifolia is an erect shrub or tree which grows to a height of and has smooth grey or dark brown bark which develops fissures as it ages. The smaller branches are more or less cylindrical with fine, longitudinal ridges. The leaves are compound with a petiole long with between one and five prominent glands. The rachis of the leaf is usually long with irregularly scattered glands and usually five to fourteen pairs of pinnae which are long. Each pinna has 25 to 100 pairs of pinnules, the smallest division of the leaf blade, each of which is narrow oblong to linear in shape, long and about wide. The inflorescence is a branching panicle with the flowers in spherical heads on peduncles long. Each head of flowers is in diameter and consists of fifteen to thirty individual yellow to bright yellow flowers. Flowering occurs from July to October and the fruit which develop are legumes or \\"pods\\" long and wide. The pods are more or less flat and straight- sided.Acacia filicifolia habit Taxonomy and naming Acacia filicifolia was first formally described in 1932 by Edwin Cheel and Marcus Baldwin Welch but they did not nominate a type specimen. The description was published in the Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales. The specific epithet (filicifolia) is derived from the Latin words filix meaning \\"fern\\" and folium meaning \\"a leaf\\" referring to the similarity of the leaves of this wattle to the fronds of some species of fern. Distribution and habitat Fern-leaved wattle grows in forest in sandy soil, often in gullies and creeks from south-eastern Queensland to Batemans Bay in southern New South Wales. It is mostly found on the coast and nearby tablelands.

Professor Jonathan Koomey described the trend in a 2010 paper in which he wrote that \\"at a fixed computing load, the amount of battery you need will fall by a factor of two every year and a half.\\". This trend had been remarkably stable since the 1950s (R2 of over 98%). But in 2011, Koomey re- examined this datahttp://www.koomey.com/post/153838038643 and found that after 2000, the doubling slowed to about once every 2.6 years. This is related to the slowinghttps://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/07/16/intel-rechisels-the-tablet- on-moores-law/ of Moore's Law, the ability to build smaller transistors; and the end around 2005 of Dennard scaling, the ability to build smaller transistors with constant power density. \\"The difference between these two growth rates is substantial. A doubling every year and a half results in a 100-fold increase in efficiency every decade. A doubling every two and a half years yields just a 16-fold increasehttps://www.electronicdesign.com/microprocessors/energy-efficiency- computing-what-s-next\\", Koomey wrote.  Implications  The implications of Koomey's law are that the amount of battery needed for a fixed computing load will fall by a factor of 100 every decade. As computing devices become smaller and more mobile, this trend may be even more important than improvements in raw processing power for many applications. Furthermore, energy costs are becoming an increasing factor in the economics of data centers, further increasing the importance of Koomey's law. The slowing of Koomey's Law has implications for energy use in information and communications technology. However, because computers do not run at peak output continuously, the effect of this slowing may not be seen for a decade or morehttps://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/moores-law-might-be-slowing- down-but-not-energy-efficiency. Koomey writes that \\"as with any exponential trend, this one will eventually end...in a decade or so, energy use will once again be dominated by the power consumed when a computer is active. And that active power will still be hostage to the physics behind the slowdown in Moore‚Äôs Law.\\"  History  Koomey was the lead author of the article in IEEE Annals of the History of Computing that first documented the trend. At about the same time, Koomey published a short piece about it in IEEE Spectrum.. It was further discussed in MIT Technology Review, and in a post by Erik Brynjolfsson on the ‚ÄúEconomics of Information‚Äù blog, and at The Economist online. The trend was previously known for digital signal processors, and it was then named \\"Gene's law\\". The name came from Gene Frantz, an electrical engineer at Texas Instruments. Frantz had documented that power dissipation in DSPs had been reduced by half every 18 months, over a 25 year period... Slowing and end of Koomey's law Latest studies indicate that Koomey's Law has slowed to doubling every 2.6 yearshttp://www.koomey.com/post/153838038643. However, in 2020, AMD reported that, since 2014, the company has managed to improve the efficiency of its mobile processors by a factor of 31.7, which is a doubling rate of 1.2 years https://www.thurrott.com/hardware/236987/amd- delivers-a-major-mobile-efficiency-milestone. In June 2020, Koomey responded to the report, writing, \\"I have reviewed the data and can report that AMD exceeded the 25√ó20 goal it set in 2014 through improved design, superior optimization, and a laser-like focus on energy efficiency.\\"https://www.thurrott.com/hardware/236987/amd-delivers-a-major- mobile-efficiency-milestone By the second law of thermodynamics and Landauer's principle, irreversible computing cannot continue to be made more energy efficient forever. As of 2011, computers have a computing efficiency of about 0.00001%. Assuming that the energy efficiency of computing will continue to double every 1.57 years, the Landauer bound will be reached in 2048. Thus, after about 2048, Koomey's law can no longer hold. Landauer's principle, however, does not constrain the efficiency of reversible computing. This, in conjunction with other 'beyond CMOS' computing technologies, could permit continued advances in efficiency.

Life and work  Tiburtius was one of the first two women to qualify as a doctor in imperial Germany.Paulette Meyer, From \\"Uncertifiable\\" Medical Practice to the Berlin Clinic of Women Doctors: The Medical Career of Franziska Tiburtius (M.D. Z√ºrich, 1876), DYNAMIS. Acta Hisp. Med. Sci. Hist. Illus., 19, 1999, pp. 297-303 Born on R√ºgen Island in Pomerania, Tiburtius was the youngest of nine children and daughter to tenant farmers. Though she had intended to become a teacher, her brother Karl Tiburtius (an army physician) and sister-in-law, Henriette Hirschfeld- Tiburtius (the first woman dentist in Germany) encouraged Tiburtius to pursue medicine. Refused entry to German medical programs, Tiburtius studied medicine in Zurich, passing her examinations with distinction in 1876. That year she also completed an internship as a doctor of internal medicine with the gynaecologist and obstetrician, Franz von Winckel in Dresden. In 1877, Tiburtius established a women's clinic with her fellow student Emilie Lehmus (1841-1932) in Berlin-Mitte at Sch√∂nhauser Stra√üe 23/24. Despite sustained opposition, including several court injunctions and slander, their clinic attracted a large clientele. In 1908, Tiburtius opened a Surgery Clinic for Women Doctors with her colleague Agnes Hacker, which deliberately accepted women patients lacking health insurance. The needy were provided medicine free of cost.  Legacy  Tiburtius was a member of the women's movement in Germany. Throughout her career she advocated for women's education and the repeal of extant bans barring women from continued study. In collaboration with Helene Lange and Minna Cauer, Tiburtius helped establish a two-year continuing education program, or Realschule, in Berlin. Her Berlin-based clinic also dedicated energy to women's medical education. Upon her retirement, Tiburtius traveled to America and North Africa and throughout Europe. She published an autobiography, Memories of an Octogenarian, about her childhood in R√ºgen. She died in 1927 in Berlin.

Controversies In 1986 it was revealed that Maya Hanoomanjee, then Permanent Secretary, had issued diplomatic passports on a weekend to allow four members of Parliament to travel to Amsterdam where they were arrested with 25kg of the drug heroin in their suitcase. This became known as the Amsterdam Boys scandal which was also linked to the 1989 arrest of High Commissioner of Mauritius (for UK, Vatican and West Germany) Soo Soobiah and his wife Muriel. In 2011 the Finance Minister Pravind Jugnauth and Health Minister Hanoomanjee were accused of using public funds to buy the Medpoint Clinic which was owned by Pravind Jugnauth's sister and brother-in- law. All three of them denied the allegation. She was arrested on 22 July 2011 by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ICAC) on charges of incurring losses to the State to the tune of 144 million Rupees by approving to buy a family owned clinic to be made a government geriatric clinic. Six ministers from MSM party resigned from the cabinet condemning the arrest of Hanoomanjee.

Bruce Brooks (9 June 2004), Gustaaf Schlegel, Sinology, University of Massachusetts Amherst, retrieved 17 September 2011  Life and career  Gustaaf Schlegel was born on 30 September 1840 in Oegstgeest. The son of Hermann Schlegel‚Äîa native of Saxony who had moved to the Netherlands in 1827 to work at the natural history museum of Leiden and became its second director‚ÄîGustaaf begun to study Chinese at the age of 9 with Leiden japanologist J. J. Hoffmann initially, it seems, without the knowledge of his parents. originally published in Biografisch Woordenboek van Nederland 3 (Biographical Dictionary of the Netherlands 3), The Hague, 1989 Gustaaf made his first trip to China in 1857 in order to collect bird specimens, but his notoriety as naturalist was overshadowed by that of Robert Swinhoe who completed much field work in China ahead of Schlegel. In 1861, after having learned the Fuzhou dialect, he moved to Canton to study Cantonese. In 1862, Schlegel took a job as an interpreter for the supreme court of the colonial government of Batavia. While working on this job, in 1866 he published a monograph on the Tiandihui (Heaven and Earth Society)‚Äîthe first on the topic in Dutch‚Äî, and another one on prostitution in Canton. In 1869 he was awarded a doctorate from the University of Jena; his thesis was on the customs and pastimes of the Chinese, but this writing was apparently a formality because his reputation had been established by his previous publications. Schlegel fell seriously ill in 1872 and was granted two years' sick leave to Holland. On his return, Hoffmannn met him and asked Schlegel to take his place in educating Dutch-Chinese translators. Schlegel accepted, and in 1873 he pursued the matter further writing a pro domo letter to the Colonial Minister, asking for the government to establish a university position. He was successful, and in 1875 was appointed as an \\"extraordinary professor\\" of Chinese at Leiden University, on the first position of its kind, and advanced to full professor in 1877. In 1873 he became correspondent of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, he resigned four years later, in 1877. In 1888 he became member of the Academy once more. In 1878 he married Catharina Elisabeth Gezina Buddingh. They had no children and divorced in 1890. The last years of his life were significantly affected by diabetes, as a result of which he lost sight in both eyes. He retired in 1902 and died next year. His chair at Leiden remained vacant until 1904 when Jan Jakob Maria de Groot accepted the position.  Works and legacy  Schlegel's 1866 monograph on the Heaven and Earth Society is considered the major breakthrough in its study, even in 21st century scholarship. Schlegel was fortunate that he had access to secret writings that had been seized by the police. Its impact extended beyond Dutch colonies; it was frequently cited in the writings of colonial officers in British Malaya as well. Schlegel's magnum opus was his Dutch-Chinese dictionary, published in 4 volumes between 1882-1891. It won international acclaim, including the Prix Stanislas Julien (1887). Although the German press even bracketed this work in the same category of achievements as the Forth Bridge and the Eiffel Tower, it had little impact outside Dutch sinology. The publisher, Brill, had apparently printed more copies than were ever ordered, and these were shredded only in 1975. Despite Schlegel's pleas, Dutch did not become a language of international scientific exchange in his field. (C.F.M. de Grijs, a contemporary colleague of Schlegel is almost totally forgotten today because he only published in Dutch.) Perhaps Schlegel's most lasting contribution is the founding in 1890, together with Henri Cordier, of the journal T'oung Pao, providing a joint publishing venue for the then leading Sinological centers of Europe. This journal has remained a leading Sinology journal to present times. He is also credited for being the first European to amply document the Chinese origins of gunpowder. Schlegel also wrote extensively on the geographical accounts found in Chinese historical texts like the Book of Liang.

Written by series co- creator Ian Brennan and directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, it first aired on Fox in the United States on October 4, 2011. The episode features the introduction of Emma Pillsbury's (Jayma Mays) and Mike Chang's (Harry Shum, Jr.) parents, and the final auditions for the McKinley High production of West Side Story, in which the competition between Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) and Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) leads the former to quit New Directions. An advance copy of the episode was released to several reviewers, and received a highly enthusiastic response. Once the episode aired many others were equally impressed, though not all. Brittany's (Heather Morris) \\"Run the World (Girls)\\" performance was hailed, and the entire Mike Chang storyline, especially his rendition of \\"Cool\\" and his initial solo dance sequence, also received favorable notice. The musical numbers were generally greeted positively, among them the three that featured Mercedes, particularly \\"It's All Over\\". However, her storyline had its detractors, mostly due to the recurrence of the Mercedes versus Rachel plot, and the inconsistency of her characterization with past appearances. All six songs were released as singles, available for download, and two, \\"Fix You\\" and \\"Run the World (Girls)\\", charted on the Billboard Hot 100, and \\"Fix You\\" also charted on the Canadian Hot 100. Upon its initial airing, this episode was viewed by 8.42 million American viewers and garnered a 3.6/10 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The total viewership and ratings for this episode were down slightly from the previous episode, \\"I Am Unicorn\\". Plot Harry Shum, Jr. (pictured) as Mike gives his first solo singing performance in this episode. After Mike receives an \\"A‚àí\\" on a chemistry exam, his father (Keong Sim) is upset by this \\"Asian F\\" and the danger it poses to his chances of attending Harvard, and insists that Mike focus more on his studies and give up glee club and his girlfriend Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz), who has been helping him improve his singing. Mike begs for one more chance and promises to meet with a tutor, but later decides to follow his dreams and auditions for the role of Riff in West Side Story, performing \\"Cool\\". He misses a tutoring session and is confronted by his mother (Tamlyn Tomita), and when he admits he wants to be a dancer rather than a doctor, she reveals that she gave up dreams of becoming a dancer and doesn't want her son to do the same. To promote her candidacy for senior class president, Brittany (Heather Morris) sings a rousing song of female empowerment‚Äî\\"Run the World (Girls)\\"‚Äîat an impromptu assembly, with the help of the Cheerios and Santana (Naya Rivera), who has rejoined New Directions unbeknownst to cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch). The enormous enthusiasm of the school's entire female population worries Kurt (Chris Colfer), the other candidate in the race. Kurt has given up his dream to play Tony in the musical, and gives a bouquet of roses to his boyfriend Blaine (Darren Criss), the likely choice as Tony. Will (Matthew Morrison) is insecure about his relationship with Emma because she hasn't asked him to meet her parents, so he invites them to dinner without telling her. They mock their daughter's OCD, which angers Will, and display an extreme hair-color obsession‚ÄîEmma refers to them as \\"ginger supremacists\\". Her OCD suffers a severe resurgence under the stress of their visit. A helpless Will apologizes, and joins Emma when she prays. Mercedes (Amber Riley), supported by her boyfriend Shane (LaMarcus Tinker), auditions for the role of Maria and impresses the directors‚ÄîEmma, Coach Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) and Artie (Kevin McHale)‚Äîwith her rendition of \\"Spotlight\\". They schedule a callback between her and Rachel (Lea Michele) to help them decide who should be cast in the role. Mercedes is angry about what she perceives as continued favoritism shown to Rachel, especially in the awarding of solos, and when Will pushes her in the glee club's extra dance rehearsals that Rachel is excused from, she decides she has had enough and quits glee club. When Mercedes and Rachel compete by singing \\"Out Here On My Own\\" in the callbacks, Mercedes gives a performance that Rachel privately concedes was better, which prompts Rachel to begin a last-minute candidacy for senior class president to improve her college prospects; this dismays Kurt, who now has another rival to campaign against. The three directors decide to offer the role of Maria to both contenders, with each to do half the performances, but Mercedes is convinced she deserved to win the part outright and refuses to accept half a role. She withdraws from contention, which leaves Rachel as the sole Maria, and volunteers to join Shelby Corcoran's (Idina Menzel) new glee club. The cast list is posted, with Rachel as Maria, Blaine as Tony, Santana as Anita, Mike as Riff, and Kurt as Officer Krupke. Production As Mercedes, Amber Riley (pictured) appreciated the chance in this episode to perform a modern pop song, as opposed to the character's usual \\"diva-ish\\" songs. The episode began filming on August 29, 2011; the finale was filmed on September 16, 2011. The script was written by series co-creator Ian Brennan and the episode was directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon. Two new sets of parents are introduced during the episode. Emma's parents, Rose and Rusty Pillsbury, are played by Valerie Mahaffey and Don Most. Mays was very excited when she learned Most, who played Ralph Malph on the 1970s sitcom Happy Days, had been cast, and exclaimed, \\"What? He's my father?!\\" Both Most and Mahaffey were so funny during the shooting of their sequence that she had to apologize for causing a portion to have to be reshot, telling them, \\"I'm so sorry, the back of my shoulders were shaking because I was laughing so hard.\\" Mike's parents, who may become recurring characters, are Tamlyn Tomita in the role of Julia Chang, and Keong Sim as Mike Chang, Sr. Recurring guest stars appearing in the episode include Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), football coach Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones), student Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink), teacher Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel) and football players Shane Tinsley (LaMarcus Tinker) and Azimio (James Earl). This episode features the show's first Coldplay cover, \\"Fix You\\". Coldplay had previously refused to license their music for use on Glee, but later changed their minds. Five other songs are covered, including Beyonc√©'s \\"Run the World (Girls)\\" sung by Morris, Jennifer Hudson's \\"Spotlight\\" sung by Riley, \\"Cool\\" from West Side Story sung by Shum in his first solo, \\"Out Here On My Own\\" from Fame sung by Riley and Michele, and \\"It's All Over\\" from Dreamgirls performed by Riley and most of New Directions. Riley appreciated the opportunity to perform \\"Spotlight\\", a modern pop song, \\"because Mercedes usually does the old diva-ish\\" songs. She found the episode challenging, as she \\"really had to think about who Mercedes is\\". Reception =Ratings= \\"Asian F\\" was first broadcast on October 4, 2011 in the United States on Fox. It garnered a 3.6/10 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, and received 8.42 million American viewers during its initial airing. It was second for the third week in a row in its timeslot to NCIS on CBS, which earned a 4.2/12 rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, and also by the third episode of New Girl, which follows Glee on Fox, and brought in a 4.3/11 rating/share and 8.65 million viewers. The Glee numbers were down slightly from the previous week's episode, \\"I Am Unicorn\\", which netted a 3.7/11 rating/share and 8.60 million viewers. Viewership increased markedly in other countries. In the United Kingdom, \\"Asian F\\" was watched on Sky1 by 1.10 million viewers, up over 10% compared to \\"I Am Unicorn\\" in the previous week, when 995,000 viewers were watching.UK viewership data: *\\"Asian F\\": *\\"I Am Unicorn\\": In Australia, \\"Asian F\\" was watched by 843,000 viewers, which made Glee the eleventh most-watched program of the night. The viewership was up significantly from \\"I Am Unicorn\\" the week before, which drew 729,000 viewers, and also an improvement over the season premiere's 760,000.Australian viewership data: *\\"Asian F\\": *\\"I Am Unicorn\\": *Season premiere (\\"The Purple Piano Project\\"): In Canada, 1.82 million viewers watched the episode, and it was the fourteenth most-viewed show of the week, up four slots and 21% from the 1.50 million viewers who watched \\"I Am Unicorn\\". =Critical reception= Kristin dos Santos of E! Online and Michael Ausiello of TVLine heavily praised screener copies of the episode. Dos Santos called it \\"arguably the best episode of Glee, not just this season but in the history of the series\\", while Ausiello praised the episode as \\"a standout hour\\". Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly also viewed the episode in advance, and was similarly impressed; he wrote that it was \\"one of the series' best episodes ever\\". A number of critics who viewed the episode when it aired were equally taken with \\"Asian F\\". The Atlantic Kevin Fallon called it Glee \\"best ever\\", while others, including Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone and Abby West of Entertainment Weekly said it was the best one of the new third season. Vanity Fair Brett Berk wrote, \\"This week's episode stands out as one of the most cohesive and well acted in the series's pantheon\\", though he wondered what had happened to the show's humorous side, something also noted by Futterman, who found it to be a significant problem: \\"Glee's own identity crisis of not knowing whether or not it's a sitcom has made it hard to get deeply invested in its characters.\\" Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"the producers hit every note (emotional, musical, character, plot) as squarely as Rachel Berry auditioning for a coveted role\\", and the episode \\"had emotional truth, character growth, new revelations and really good musical numbers: the kind that seem to emerge organically from the plot and deepen and advance it.\\" AOLTV Crystal Bell said the episode delivered on the setup in the previous \\"I Am Unicorn\\" outing, and said \\"it definitely seems to echo the glory days\\" of the first season. TV Guide later included \\"Asian F\\" in its list of 2011's Top TV Episodes. Others were not as impressed. Although he praised \\"fantastic performances by Harry Shum as Mike Chang and Jayma Mays as Emma\\", Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times criticized the \\"hackneyed storytelling that moves nobody forward\\", and IGN Robert Canning noted that the show's \\"inconsistent character development\\" was on display, though he gave the episode his best grade so far in the season, a \\"great\\" 8 out of 10. Samantha Urban of The Dallas Morning News likened \\"Asian F\\" to a \\"half-hearted meal\\": while she said the subplots featuring Mike and Emma \\"worked really well\\", the main storyline featuring Mercedes \\"was offensive in how lazily it was executed\\". The Mercedes storyline was met with widely divergent reactions, though her musical numbers were generally given high marks. In addition to Urban, many reviewers were unhappy with the return of the Rachel versus Mercedes rivalry, including Bell, who lamented that it had \\"been done every season\\". Nearly as many expressed the hope that Mercedes was not pregnant given her nausea in the first \\"booty camp\\" scene, including Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger, BuddyTV John Kubicek, and West. Benigno felt Mercedes was acting \\"wildly out of character\\" in the episode. Michael Slezak of TVLine was also puzzled at her change, and asked, \\"When has Mercedes ever been anything other than a team player and New Directions MVP? Seriously, nobody's going to cut her slack for a bad week?\\" Canning agreed, and wrote: \\"Schue's tough love with Mercedes came out of left field\\", and felt it added to the \\"inconsistency of these characters\\", even though \\"it ultimately made sense\\" in the context of setup for \\"It's All Over\\". Time James Poniewozik wrote that having the story \\"turn on her resentment at being overlooked by the glee club is an apt meta-touch, since she's been overlooked by the show for some time now.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was the most enthusiastic about her storyline, and called it \\"the best part of the episode\\": it was \\"all about how she now feels appreciated‚Äîbecause she has a boyfriend, sigh‚Äîand so she's willing to take on Rachel for the role of Maria (and, actually, beat her) and push for what she feels is rightfully hers, which involves more respect from New Directions.\\" Mike Chang's first major storyline was the most widely praised of the episode. West said Shum \\"really showed his acting chops\\", and Urban thought the \\"plot worked well\\", though she heaped scorn on the notion that \\"any college would consider glee club a detriment\\" in an application. Mike's \\"Cool\\" performance was very well received. Berk called it a \\"spectacular audition\\" and Bell said it was \\"one of the highlights of the episode\\"; she also noted that the episode \\"really solidified\\" Mike and Tina's relationship, though she also pointed out that Tina was \\"the most neglected member of the entire cast\\". Mike's scenes in the dance studio were even more highly praised than \\"Cool\\". The first, when Mike \\"dances alone and imagines Tina and his dad in the room with him\\" was described as \\"really beautiful\\" by Benigno. Fallon characterized it as \\"a standout scene\\": \\"the performer dances out his life frustrations, pirouetting- as-catharsis until he realizes that the only place he feels happy is on stage. It's a trademark Glee moment.\\" Hyman agreed, and wrote, \\"When he ducked into the studio and started dancing by himself, without music, it reminded me of how special a show Glee can be\\". Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter lauded the subsequent scene in the studio with his mother as the \\"most touching part\\" of the storyline, and more than one reviewer admitted shedding tears, including Reiter. Poniewozik stated that the Will and Emma storyline \\"again shows how Glee handles adults much worse than teens\\", and added, \\"there's no reason this couldn't have been a rewarding plot\\". Hyman called it a \\"bizarre subplot\\", and Berk stated that the \\"patent absurdity\\" of the \\"ginger eugenics\\" of Emma's parents \\"felt out of whack, tonally, with the rest of the episode\\". VanDerWerff felt that the story failed to work \\"despite featuring Don Most and Valerie Mahaffey doing their very best\\". Canning thought Most's role as Emma's \\"racist Ginger Supremacist father was perhaps the greatest bit of casting I've seen on television all year\\". Urban thought the subplot \\"worked really well\\", though she added that there were \\"missteps\\". Brittany's campaign rally flash mob, complete with her performance of \\"Run the World (Girls)\\", was a huge favorite; Poniewozik called it \\"an excellent Brittany dance showcase\\". Hyman was critical of the \\"ridiculousness\\" of Rachel's run for senior class president, a development Urban said \\"made absolutely zero sense\\". VanDerWerff lauded the \\"montage of the kids finding out who was cast\\" in West Side Story, and said it \\"might be the best thing the show has ever done.\\" Amy Lee of The Huffington Post wrote, \\"The football team is dancing again. This can only be good.\\" Urban mentioned that seeing \\"Cool\\" performed by the football players made her realize that \\"we haven't seen Karofsky this season.\\" Benigno was more direct: \\"where the hell is Karofsky?\\" =Music and performances= Heather Morris (pictured) as Brittany gives a standout performance of \\"Run the World (Girls)\\" in this episode. The episode's musical performances were generally well-received, though a few reviewers, including Benigno, chafed at the continued emphasis on Broadway showtunes. Both of the major dance numbers came in for considerable praise, and \\"Run the World (Girls)\\" garnered the most superlatives: Fallon wrote, \\"Brittany's performance of \\"Run the World (Girls)\\" was thrilling. It was the most adrenaline-pumping musical number the series has produced: intricately choreographed, expertly shot and edited, perfectly woven into the story, and performed exquisitely by Heather Morris.\\" VanDerWerff \\"enjoyed the ginormous production number built around it quite a bit\\", and The Wall Street Journal Raymund Flandez called it a \\"stellar performance\\". Kubicek stated, \\"this was unbelievably superb, easily my favorite performance of the entire season\\". Futterman noted that \\"Brittany's vocals are nowhere near the power of Beyonc√©'s, but they're just fine for this performance, the real focus of which is the dancing.\\" Mercedes featured in three of the episode's musical numbers. Flandez said of her solo, \\"She blew Jennifer Hudson's 'Spotlight' out of this world.\\" Benigno wrote that it was \\"great\\", but added that it was \\"not much of a stretch for Amber Riley to hit this one\\". Berk praised her \\"amazing voice\\" and gave the performance four stars out of five, and Goldberg characterized the rendition as \\"flawless\\". Other reviewers were more critical, including VanDerWerff, who said that this was the only song in the episode that \\"really didn't work\\". Slezak felt that the arrangement used was not distinct enough from the original, though he gave the performance a \\"B+\\", as did West, who wrote, \\"Mercedes looked fantastic and carried herself well, and her voice was as strong as ever but it felt a little lacking.\\" In her \\"Maria-off\\" with Rachel, Benigno said they \\"both kill it\\", characterized it as \\"easy but fun\\", and gave it an \\"A‚àí\\", as did Slezak and West, the latter of whom \\"didn't feel that Mercedes was the clear winner\\" but thought both singers were \\"fantastic\\". Kubicek thought that \\"Mercedes clearly won\\" and Flandez maintained that she \\"clearly outshone her rival\\", and continued, \\"You just believe so much of what she sings.\\" Berk agreed, and contrasted the two singers with his rating scale of one to five stars: \\"Two stars for Rachel, who sang this like Barry Manilow; four for Mercedes, who sang this like she lived it.\\" Futterman had a slightly different take: \\"Rachel puts on a diva front, but inside she's scared and nervous, while Mercedes is just a diva.\\" However, Hyman thought that the two \\"were evenly matched\\", while Canning and Billboard Rae Votta both thought Rachel was the victor; Votta stated, \\"While the show wants us to believe otherwise, Rachel clearly outsang Mercedes\\". \\"It's All Over\\" from Dreamgirls received the most enthusiastic commentary, including an \\"A+\\" from West, who wrote \\"Mercedes was at her best in this performance\\", a sentiment echoed by Benigno when he awarded the song an \\"A\\". Hyman called it \\"pretty awesome\\" and Flandez a \\"cleverly amusing take\\", while Futterman said Mercedes \\"fully embraces her inner Effie White\\" and that the song was \\"on par with the best of Glee's Broadway songs in terms of plot relevancy and vocal arrangements\\". She also praised \\"the first group showtune the New Directions have done\\" and added, \\"we want more\\". Votta characterized it as \\"a flawless fantasy homage\\" and stated, \\"It's the perfect use of the non-realism of \\"Glee\\" and the power of musical theater to express a storyline\\". Kubicek agreed it was \\"like a real musical\\" in these regards and praised Mike's short solo, and West liked the segment where Santana confronts Mercedes in the number. Slezak was not enthusiastic about the rendition, and wrote that he wished that the \\"scene gelled better than it did\\", and questioned why Mercedes was the character Effie while all the other members of New Directions were themselves. He gave the number a \\"C+\\". Votta wrote of \\"Cool\\" that \\"for Mike Chang's first solo it's impressive\\", and added, \\"maybe he should play Tony instead of Blaine\\"; Slezak also thought he should have been considered for Tony since it was \\"performed with such verve and swagger and charisma\\". Even so, he conceded that Mike (and Shum) was \\"not the strongest singer\\", an assessment echoed in the \\"decent singer\\" characterizations from Hyman and Kubicek, and the former called the performance a fine job while the latter wrote that \\"Mike Chang is the total package\\". Flandez said Mike's singing \\"wasn't so terrible\\", but while Lee said his is \\"not, by any means, a wonderful voice\\" she also said \\"he still pirouettes with the kind of easy grace that makes each move a joy to watch.\\" Futterman wrote, \\"He's got the smooth dance moves down ... but, most impressively, his slick vocals are on point, hitting nice rises and falls at certain moments but mostly staying 'real cool', as the song calls for\\", and Berk gave the performance five of five stars. \\"Fix You\\" received the least warm reception of the songs in the episode. Benigno criticized it for being \\"exactly like the original\\", though he gave it a \\"B\\" and noted that the \\"last bit is kind of chillingly good in Matthew Morrison's hands\\". Flandez felt that the show's version \\"pales in imitation to the original\\". Futterman thought it was \\"thematically appropriate\\" but \\"not Schuester's finest singing moment\\", and Lee stated that \\"the song does not fit Morrison's range comfortably\\". Kevin P. Sullivan of MTV called it a \\"surprisingly tragic and moving rendition\\", but Kubicek characterized it as an \\"emotionally manipulative song\\", and West did not like the \\"implied condescension\\" of Will singing the song to Emma and gave it a \\"B\\", though she thought Morrison \\"sounded good\\" and it was a \\"good way to close out the show\\". In December 2012, TV Guide listed the rendition as one of Glee worst performances. =Chart history= Two of the six cover versions released as singles debuted on the Billboard Hot 100: \\"Fix You\\" debuted at number fifty-three and \\"Run the World (Girls)\\" at number ninety-one.Peak chart positions for season 3 singles in the United States: \\"Fix You\\" and \\"Run the World (Girls)\\" \\"Fix You\\" debuted at number seventy-six on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100, and was the one song from the episode to appear on that chart. Both \\"Fix You\\" and \\"Run the World (Girls)\\" were featured on the soundtrack album Glee: The Music, Volume 7.

It was written by Ali Adler, directed by Adam Shankman, and was first broadcast on Fox in the United States on November 1, 2011. The episode featured the arrival of Irish foreign exchange student Rory Flanagan (Glee Project prizewinner Damian McGinty) at McKinley High, a new challenger to Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) in her congressional race, and the ongoing fragmentation of the show's central glee club, New Directions. The episode as a whole received mixed reviews from reviewers. The storyline involving Quinn, Puck and Shelby was extensively criticized, while the injection of Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) into the congressional race as Sue's opponent was greeted with enthusiasm. The music was received with somewhat more favor than the episode itself, especially \\"Candyman\\", sung by the newly constituted Troubletones. All five song covers performed in the episode were released as singles, available for download, and one of them, \\"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\\", charted on the Billboard Hot 100. Upon its initial airing, this episode was viewed by 7.47 million American viewers and earned a 3.0/8 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The total viewership numbers and rating/share were down significantly from the previous episode, \\"Asian F\\", which had been broadcast four weeks earlier on October 4, 2011. Plot Rory Flanagan (Damian McGinty), a foreign exchange student from Ireland, has begun attending McKinley High and is regularly being bullied. He is staying at Brittany's (Heather Morris) house; she believes that he is a leprechaun. Rory, who has a crush on Brittany, does not disabuse her of this belief because she has promised to let him into her \\"pot o' gold\\" if he grants her three wishes. He easily fulfills her first two wishes in mundane ways. Mercedes (Amber Riley) is recruiting for the new all-girl show choir directed by Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), and asks Santana (Naya Rivera)‚Äîa member of the school's existing glee club, New Directions‚Äîto join. Santana balks at leaving Brittany behind, and when she and Brittany go out on a dinner date, Santana tries to recruit her, but Brittany is unwilling to leave her New Directions friends. She tells Santana of Rory's supposed magical powers, and Santana later coerces Rory into telling Brittany that Santana has wished for her to join Shelby's glee club. Brittany believes she must obey that wish, but her third wish is that doing so does not hurt anybody's feelings. New Directions co-captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) tries to persuade Brittany not to leave: he tells her that leprechauns are not real and that she is being stupid. Brittany, insulted, quits anyway. Quinn (Dianna Agron) and Puck (Mark Salling) offer to babysit Beth, their biological daughter who they gave up to Shelby for adoption. While babysitting, Quinn hides hot sauce, sharp knives, books on child cannibalism and other items to make Shelby look like an unfit mother; she subsequently calls Child Protective Services, under the assumption that they will ultimately restore Beth to her after they investigate and find the evidence. Puck later returns to secretly gather up the items. He also sings \\"Waiting for a Girl Like You\\" to calm a crying Beth and to comfort Shelby, who confesses she is extremely lonely. In the episode's closing moments, Puck and Shelby kiss. Congressional candidate and cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch)‚Äîwhose campaign platform includes the elimination of funding for school arts programs‚Äîeditorializes on television to rescind the budget of the school's production of West Side Story. She succeeds after an angry mother throws a brick at Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba). Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) recruits the members to sell advertising space in the program book to raise money; when Kurt (Chris Colfer) asks his father Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) to purchase an ad, he instead gathers a group of businessmen to fund the musical. He then announces that he is running for congress against Sue. At a meeting of Shelby's group, which is dubbed the Troubletones, a newly arrived Santana overawes Sugar Motta (Vanessa Lengies) into surrendering her central role. The Troubletones later give a dynamic performance of \\"Candyman\\", which is witnessed by a dismayed Finn and Will. Finn later apologizes to Brittany for his insensitive remarks and wishes her and the Troubletones the best, after which Rory claims that he has fulfilled Brittany's third wish. However, she chastises him, saying that Finn's feelings clearly were hurt by the defection and that she now knows leprechauns are not real. Later, when Rory is being harassed by bullies, Finn comes to his rescue and invites him to join New Directions; he successfully auditions with the song \\"Take Care of Yourself\\". Production The episode was written by co-executive producer Ali Adler, making it the first episode not to be written by any of the co-creators of Glee‚ÄîRyan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan‚Äîand it was the second to be directed by choreographer Adam Shankman, who helmed \\"The Rocky Horror Glee Show\\" in the second season. Shankman started working on the episode on September 2, 2011, and filming ended on September 22, 2011. This episode and the prior one were shot in parallel for several days until \\"Asian F\\" finished filming its musical finale on September 16, 2011. McGinty, one of the two winners of The Glee Project top prize of a seven-episode recurring character role on Glee, makes his first appearance in this episode as Rory Flanagan, an Irish exchange student. Murphy revealed that on McGinty's first day of filming \\"he was shoved into a locker 25 times\\", and that on \\"his first take in his first song, the crew gave him a huge ovation.\\" Rory is living with Brittany's family, and the idea of McGinty's character interacting with Brittany was first broached in the penultimate episode of The Glee Project, with the judges speculating that Brittany would not be able to understand a word the character said due to his Irish accent. Additional recurring guest stars appearing in this episode include Menzel as Shelby Corcoran, Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), Kurt's father Burt Hummel, Burt's wife and Finn's mother Carole Hudson-Hummel (Romy Rosemont), student Sugar Motta (Vanessa Lengies), and TV news co-anchors Rod Remington (Bill A. Jones) and Andrea Carmichael (Earlene Davis). This episode features five covers, all of which were made available for download as digital singles: Christina Aguilera's \\"Candyman\\" performed by Rivera, Morris, and Riley, Katy Perry's \\"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\\" with Criss on lead vocals, Foreigner's \\"Waiting for a Girl Like You\\" performed by Salling, and \\"Bein' Green\\" from Sesame Street and Teddy Thompson's \\"Take Care of Yourself\\", both performed by McGinty. Reception =Ratings= \\"Pot o' Gold\\" was first broadcast on November 1, 2011 in the United States on Fox. It garnered a 3.0/8 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, and received 7.47 million American viewers during its initial airing. It continued the streak of coming in second in its timeslot to NCIS on CBS, which earned a 3.9/11 rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. It had been four weeks since the previous Glee episode was broadcast, and the show's viewership numbers were down over 11% from the 3.6/10 rating/share and 8.42 million viewers from the \\"Asian F\\" broadcast on October 4, 2011. \\"Pot o' Gold\\" tied for the second-lowest rating/share Glee had ever received in the 18‚Äì49 demographic‚Äîthe fourth episode of the first season, \\"Preggers\\", also earned 3.0/8 rating/share, though it only had 6.62 million viewers. It was still ahead of the eleventh episode of the first season, \\"Hairography\\", which received a 2.5/7 rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic and 6.08 million viewers when broadcast on November 25, 2009, the night before Thanksgiving. Viewership also decreased in other countries. In the United Kingdom, \\"Pot o' Gold\\" was watched on Sky1 by 1.05 million viewers, down nearly 5% compared to \\"Asian F\\" four weeks earlier, when 1.10 million viewers were watching.UK viewership data: *\\"Pot o' Gold\\": *\\"Asian F\\": In Australia, \\"Pot o' Gold\\" was watched by 724,000 viewers, which made Glee the fourteenth most-watched program of the night. The viewership was down 11% from \\"Asian F\\", which was watched by 843,000 viewers. It was the lowest number of viewers of the third season, just below the second episode, \\"I Am Unicorn\\", which drew 729,000 viewers.Australian viewership data: *\\"Pot o' Gold\\": *\\"Asian F\\": *\\"I Am Unicorn\\": In Canada, 1.62 million viewers watched the episode, and it was the eighteenth most-viewed show of the week, down four slots and 11% from the 1.82 million viewers who watched \\"Asian F\\", though up 8% from the 1.50 million viewers who watched \\"I Am Unicorn\\".Canadian viewership data: *\\"Pot o' Gold\\": *\\"Asian F\\": *\\"I Am Unicorn\\": =Critical reception= \\"Pot o' Gold\\" received mixed reviews from critics, which ranged from reasonably positive to very negative. In the latter camp were Bobby Hankinson of The Houston Chronicle, who called it \\"a disaster\\", and Rolling Stone Erica Futterman, who said it was \\"stale and unfunny\\" and \\"outright failed to keep up the momentum started by the season's first three episodes\\". Robert Canning of IGN took the opposite view from Futterman with regard to the show's progress: he gave it a \\"good\\" rating of 7.5 out of 10, and wrote that while it was not a \\"stunning return after four weeks off\\", it \\"kept the momentum and focus of the first few episodes of this season intact\\". The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff characterized it as \\"an episode that tries a lot of things\\" but \\"produced too many duds\\", while Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times felt that the fact that it was the first episode not written by one of the show's co-creators meant it was \\"a lot more subtle\\" but \\"seemed a bit lifeless at times\\". AOLTV Crystal Bell was \\"pleasantly surprised\\" and said the episode was \\"better than a majority\\" of those from the second season, and Abby West of Entertainment Weekly described it as a \\"pretty solid return\\" after the hiatus. The entire storyline that centered around Quinn, Puck and Shelby was roundly criticized by reviewers. West wrote that it made her feel \\"queasy\\", and she called Quinn's actions \\"abhorrent\\". Bell was one of several who thought it was highly implausible that Child Protective Services would be backed up, much less for two weeks, given the gravity of Quinn's accusations. Hankinson wondered why they \\"made Quinn a total sociopath\\" who went from \\"dancing on desks\\" to \\"framing someone for child endangerment\\" with great ease; VanDerWerff was also critical of these actions, and called Quinn's sabotage of Shelby's apartment \\"a move that takes a potentially good character, played by a fine actress, and just guts her\\". Kevin P. Sullivan of MTV had a different view, and wrote that the \\"storyline stuck out throughout the episode as the most interesting\\". He also noted that it was \\"cathartic and definitely nice to see a sweeter Puck balance out the earnest craziness of Quinn\\". The final scene of the episode, when Puck kissed Shelby, was characterized as \\"creepy\\" and \\"super awkward\\" by Bell, as either \\"super creepy\\" or \\"romantic\\" by BuddyTV John Kubicek, as \\"groan- inducing\\" in the \\"You're actually going to go there?\\" vein by Canning and \\"as realistic as Lord Tubbington pooping candy bars\\" by Michael Slezak of TVLine. Sue's campaign for congress in the third season has not heretofore found much favor with reviewers, though Futterman felt that the addition of Burt Hummel as a rival candidate \\"gives us a sliver of hope, mainly because Mike O'Malley has managed to do no wrong thus far\\" as Burt, and VanDerWerff, while otherwise unimpressed, said he liked \\"the idea of the show pitting its most purely heroic figure against its most purely villainous\\". Bell was pleased with the new development, and noted that in three seasons, \\"no character has grown more than Burt\\". Canning said he loved having Burt as Sue's nemesis, and Kubicek wrote that the two are \\"awesome together\\". Several reviewers felt that the introduction of Rory overdid his Irishness. Benigno called it \\"cheap stereotyping\\", and \\"juvenile\\" on the part of the writers. West, while she admitted that \\"it may have been a little heavy-handed\\" to have Rory in green, felt it \\"worked\\", especially for his opening solo and \\"his isolation\\" during it. Jen Chaney of The Washington Post characterized the tweaking of that solo to be about \\"Irish exchange students being bullied\\" as \\"forced\\", and VanDerWerff wrote that he was tired of \\"people just randomly getting shoved around for no real reason\\". Benigno noted that Sugar was also being bullied‚Äîby Santana‚Äîand wrote that he was \\"not a fan\\" of this \\"on a show that supposedly glorifies outcasts and promotes their successes\\". Santana came in for praise from Kubicek, along with Brittany, for their \\"fantastic date\\" and their relationship which is \\"the most interesting one on the show\\". The new show choir they join, the Troubletones, was acclaimed by Bell: \\"I'm really loving Shelby's diva troupe.\\" The Hollywood Reporter Lesley Goldberg called the use of Katy Perry's \\"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\\" in the episode \\"completely out of place\\", and Sullivan characterized its inclusion as \\"barely justified\\". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal pointed out that both Criss and McHale had major roles in Perry's video of the song, and the Glee performance \\"winks at [that] fact\\". West was annoyed by Finn's recent tendency to \\"succumb\\" to his less nice and less responsible side as exemplified in the episode by his failure to \\"stand up for Rory\\" and for blasting \\"Brittany's simple, goofy belief system\\", even if he does eventually do the right thing. =Music and performances= The musical performances in this episode were received with a bit more enthusiasm than the episode itself. Benigno described them as \\"decent songs\\", but though Canning wrote that \\"Candyman\\" was \\"fun\\", he also said that the \\"rest of the music\\" prevented the episode \\"from being much better\\". Indeed, \\"Candyman\\" was a favorite of many reviewers: The Star-Ledger Vicki Hyman called it \\"bouncy and fun\\", Futterman praised the \\"tight harmonies\\" and the \\"diva notes from Mercedes and Santana\\", and Slezak gave the number an \\"A\\" and said he loved the Troubletones \\"absolutely soaring\\" in their performance. Hankinson, Hyman, and Chaney singled out the production values of the number‚ÄîHyman to call them \\"amazing\\"; Chaney to note, as she gave the song an \\"A‚àí\\", that the costuming cost for the number would have rivaled the $2,004 budget of West Side Story that had Sue so upset; and Hankinson, although he said it would have been his favorite in a \\"blind test\\", to call it \\"a classic example of the kind of inexplicably elaborate performance I hate the most on this show\\". Most of the reviewers had positive things to say about new character Rory Flanagan's singing voice, including Futterman, who said his was \\"quite lovely\\" and had \\"rich tones\\", and Rae Votta of Billboard, who called him a \\"smooth crooner\\". Hankinson, however, said he had never been \\"floored\\" by McGinty's voice, \\"so both of his numbers fell extremely flat to me\\", and Futterman maintained that both songs were a \\"weird fit\\" for the episode, while Votta thought having him perform two solos was \\"overkill on his character introduction\\". In general, \\"Bein' Green\\" was considered less impressive than \\"Take Care of Yourself\\", though it had its supporters: Votta and Bell both referred to it as \\"a nice introduction\\", and West declared that his \\"simple, clear-voiced ode to being an outsider rang true and was hauntingly beautiful\\", and gave it an \\"A‚àí\\". Canning was not impressed: \\"Perhaps if it had been sung with more feeling, it could have worked better.\\" For \\"Take Care of Yourself\\", both West and Goldberg agreed with Rachel's assessment that the performance was \\"magical\\", and West graded it with an \\"A+\\". The Los Angeles Times Amy Reiter was \\"blown away\\", and Chaney gave it an \\"A\\" with the comment that Rory \\"handled it with adorable aplomb\\". Slezak and VanDerWerff, however, thought the number was somewhat sleep-inducing. Puck's rendition of \\"Waiting for a Girl Like You\\" was almost universally described as \\"sweet\\". Flandez went further, and wrote \\"he oozes sweet and sexy, and you can‚Äôt help but feel good\\", and Goldberg still further when she stated that it \\"ends up being one of the episode‚Äôs‚Äîand season‚Äôs‚Äîsweetest moments thus far\\". West praised the \\"lovely little guitar solo\\" and gave the song a \\"B\\"; Chaney bestowed the same grade and called it a \\"cheesy moment\\" but a \\"nice job\\" by Salling. Futterman commented that Puck got to \\"showcase his nice falsetto\\". \\"Last Friday Night\\" evoked a wide range of opinions from reviewers. Chaney wrote that the performance \\"incorporated several Glee tropes\\" and was a routine seen before; she gave it a \\"B‚àí\\". Futterman characterized the choreography as \\"full of forced sunshine\\" and said \\"Blaine's normally effortless voice sounds breathy\\". West noted that the song \\"wasn't the best showcase for his voice\\" but added that \\"it was exactly the playful little interlude it needed to be\\", and gave it a \\"B+\\". Goldberg called it \\"fantastic\\", and Kubicek said \\"it's hard not to love his singing\\". Slezak stated that \\"Darren Criss is better than this song\\", and gave it a \\"D\\". Votta pointed out that the song was \\"one of the first truly current pop hits on Glee this season\\", described the performance as \\"pure Glee\\" and the dancing \\"disorganized and joyful\\", and the whole number as why the show \\"connects with the youth of America\\". =Chart history= One of the five cover versions released as singles debuted on the Billboard Hot 100: \\"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\\" debuted at number seventy-two.Peak chart positions for season 3 singles in the United States: \\"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\\" \\"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\\" also debuted on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100 chart, at number eighty-six. In addition, it is the one single from the episode to be included on the soundtrack album Glee: The Music, Volume 7. An additional song from the episode, \\"Take Care of Yourself\\", was included as one of the five bonus tracks available on the Target edition of the album.

These Germani were first described by Julius Caesar, who was writing specifically about tribes near the Meuse river, who had settled among the Belgae before Roman intrusion into the area. Tribes who Caesar named as being among the Germani cisrhenani included the Eburones, the Condrusi, the Caeraesi, the Segni and the Paemani. Tacitus, writing around 100 AD when the region had been part of the Roman empire, referred to these Germani next, saying that they were by his time called the Tungri. The \\"Germani\\" name had by this time become a term used more commonly to refer to many other peoples. Name and terminology Starting with Caesar, Roman historians described the Rhine as an important natural border between Gaul on the west, which became part of the Roman empire, and the \\"Germanic\\" territories to the east. The Germani on the east side of the Rhine were considered to be living in their original homeland. So this land was referred to not only as \\"Germania Transrhenana,\\" (the opposite of cisrhenana) but also, for example by Ptolemy and Strabo, as Germania magna, meaning \\"Greater Germany.\\" In contrast, on the left bank of the Rhine, the cisrhenane Germani were regarded by Caesar as tribes who had crossed the river, and had settled among the Celtic Belgae. This territory was considered to be geographically part of Gaul. Caesar conquered it, and it became part of the Roman empire ‚Äî roughly the later province of Germania Inferior. It is possible that these original Germani on the Lower Rhine were, in modern terminology, Celtic- language speaking, and not Germanic language-speaking. The name Germani in antiquity cannot be assumed to imply linguistic unity, let alone the use of Germanic languages according to the modern definition (Indo-European languages which underwent the first Germanic soundshift). The name Germani itself is assumed to be Celtic (Gaulish) in origin, and even the tribal names from east of the Lower Rhine seem to be Celtic as well, such as the Usipetes and Tencteri. The later name of the Tungri, on the other hand, has been interpreted as being genuinely Germanic. Jacob Grimm even suggested that Germani represents the Celtic translation of the Germanic tribal name Tungri.Gustav Solling, Diutiska, an historical and critical survey of the literature of Germany, from the earliest period to the death of G√∂the (1863), p. 3. The question of the possible presence of Germanic languages on the lower Rhine in the 1st century BC has also focused upon place-name analyses, such as those of Maurits Gysseling. As for the historicity of Caesar's account of the arrival of the Germani from beyond the Rhine, Wightman (1985) distinguishes two main scenarios: *Arrival in remote prehistory, as early as Urnfield times, long before the development of Germanic as a separate linguistic phylum, and predating the arrival of the Belgae with the spread of the La T√®ne Culture after 500 BC. *Derivation of both Belgae and Germani out of the Hunsr√ºck-Eifel culture found near the Moselle river. \\"The left-bank Germans would then be people who went northward across the Ardennes rather than westwards to the Marne\\". Gallic Wars The earliest clear surviving record referring to Germani is Julius Caesar's account of the Gallic War, the \\"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\\", although there are classical citations of a lost work by Poseidonius which apparently mentioned the tribe.Athenaeus, Deipnosophists, Book 4 reports Poseidonius describing Germani who eat roasted meat in separate joints, and drink milk and unmixed wine. In the build-up to the Battle of the Sabis in 57 BCE, Caesar reported that he received information from Remi tribesman, who described a large part of the Belgae of northern France and Gaul as having \\"transrhenane\\" Germanic ancestry, but not all. At other times, Caesar more clearly divides Belgic Gaul into the Belgae and another smaller group called the Germani. page 12-13. For example, he writes that his local informants claim \\"all the rest of the Belgae were in arms; and that the Germans, who dwell on this side of the Rhine [Belgas in armis esse, Germanosque qui cis Rhenum], had joined themselves to them.\\"\\"Gallic War\\" 2.3 The reference to the Cimbric migrations means that movements of people from east of the Rhine must have happened early enough for them already to be established west of the Rhine in the 2nd century BCE. But it remains unclear which Belgic Gauls were considered Germani by ancestry and which, if any, might have spoken a Germanic language. In the list of Belgic nations given as being in arms are Bellovaci, Suessiones, Nervii, Atrebates, Ambiani, Morini, Menapii, Caleti, Velocasses, and Veromandui, who together make up a major part of all the Belgic nations. When it comes to tribes in the extreme northeast of Gaul, against the Rhine, the Condrusi, the Eburones, the Caeraesi, and the Paemani, \\"are called by the common name of Germans\\" [Germani]. These Germani provided one joint force to the alliance, and apparently the number of men they committed was uncertain to the Remi. Caesar later added the Segni to the list of tribes among the Belgae who went by the name of the Germani.\\"Gallic War\\" 6.32 There is another group living close to these tribes, in the northeast, called the Aduatuci, who descended from the above-mentioned Cimbri, but these are not referred to as Germani, even though their ancestry is clearly to the east of the Rhine also and \\"Germanic\\" in that sense.\\"Gallic War\\" 2.29 After the battle of the Sabis, which the Romans won, some Belgic tribes renewed fighting against the Romans in 54 BCE. Caesar clearly differentiates between two types of remaining rebel groups: \\"the Nervii, Aduatuci, and Menapii\\" and with them \\"the addition of all the Germans on this side of the Rhine.\\" Within this last group were the Eburones, whose king Ambiorix had become a major rebel leader.\\"Gallic War\\" 6.2 When the Eburones were defeated, the Segni and Condrusi \\"of the nation and number of the Germans [Germani], and who are between the Eburones and the Treviri, sent embassadors to Caesar to entreat that he would not regard them in the number of his enemies, nor consider that the cause of all the Germans on this side the Rhine [omnium Germanorum, qui essent citra Rhenum] was one and the same; that they had formed no plans of war, and had sent no auxiliaries to Ambiorix\\". In the time of Tacitus, long after Caesar claimed to have annihilated the name of the Eburones, the area where the Eburones had lived was inhabited by the Tungri, but Tacitus claimed that this was not their original name:- Many historians read Caesar and Tacitus in combination to conclude that Caesar was knowingly using the term Germani in both a strict sense, for a group associated by the region they lived in near the Rhine and were actually locally named this way, and in an extended sense, for tribal groups of similar perceived ancestry, most clearly those on the east of the Rhine. He was probably the first to do so. Apart from the Germani in this strict sense then, it is unclear to what extent if any that Caesar believed the other Belgae to have similar transrhenane ancestry. But in any case it is clear that he, like Tacitus, apparently makes a distinction between two types of Germani, as shown by the above quotations where the Nervii, Aduatuci, and Menapii are both contrasted with the cisrhenane Germani such as the Eburones and the Condrusi. So in the northern Belgic region of Gaul, at least some of the other Belgic nations, apart from the group containing the Eburones and Condrusi, might or might not have been considered Germani in a broad sense. Tacitus on the other hand certainly knew of such claims, but expressed doubt about them, writing of two of the tribes most geographically and politically close to the Germani, that the \\"Treveri and Nervii are even eager in their claims of a German origin, thinking that the glory of this descent distinguishes them from the uniform level of Gallic effeminacy\\".\\"Germania\\" chapter 28 One of the reasons (or excuses) for Caesar's interventions in Gaul in the first place was an apparent increase in movements of transrhenane peoples, attempting to enter Gaul, apparently due to major movements of people such as the Suevi who had come from relatively far east. While some of the original transrhenane Germani who Caesar mentions came from near the Lower Rhine, and subsequently crossed it into Gaul under its new Roman overlords. This included the Ubii, Sicambri and Tencteri and Usipetes, who all moved into Roman \\"Germania inferior\\" (Lower Germania). Similarly, some originally transrhenane groups eventually crossed to the west of the Rhine further south, Germania Superior, and Caesar and Tacitus also called these Germani. This included the Vangiones, the Triboci, and the Nemetes, who Tacitus contrasted to the Nervii and Treveri, whose Germanic status was more questionable. Caesar's use of the term Germani lumped the Suevi and other distant peoples together with these groups from near the Rhine. Later history Map of the Roman Empire and Magna Germania in the early 2nd century The older concept of the Germani being local to the Rhine remained common among Graeco-Roman writers for a longer time than the more theoretical and general concept of Caesar. Cassius Dio wrote in the 3rd century that \\"some of the Celts, whom we call Germans\\", \\"occupied all the Belgic territory along the Rhine and caused it to be called Germany\\".Cassius Dio, 53.12.6. At least two well-read 6th century Byzantine writers, Agathias and Procopius, understood the Franks on the Rhine to effectively be the old Germani under a new name, since, as Agathias wrote, they inhabit the banks of the Rhine and the surrounding territory.Procopius, Gothic War, 5.11.29; Agathias, Histories, 1.2. According to some scholars such as Walter Goffart, the theoretical descriptions of Germanic peoples by Tacitus, which have been very influential in modern times, may never have been commonly read or used in the Roman era. It is clear in any case that in later Roman times the Rhine frontier (or Limes Germanicus), the area where Caesar had first come in contact with Suevians and Germani cisrhenani, was the normal \\"Germanic\\" area mentioned in writing. Walter Goffart has written that \\"the one incontrovertible Germanic thing\\" in the Roman era was \\"the two Roman provinces of 'Germania,' on the middle and lower course of the Rhine river\\" and: \\"Whatever 'Germania' had meant to Tacitus, it had narrowed by the time of St Jerome to an archaic or poetic term for the land normally called Francia\\". and . Edward James similarly wrote: > It seems clear that in the fourth century 'German' was no longer a term > which included all western barbarians. [...] Ammianus Marcellinus, in the > later fourth century, only uses Germania when he is referring to the Roman > provinces of Upper Germany and Lower Germany; east of Germania are Alamannia > and Francia. Between the time of Caesar and Tacitus several of the transrhenane Germani peoples crossed and became established in the Roman empire in the two Roman provinces of Germania: *Germania Inferior (\\"lower Germany\\") ran along the curve of the lower Rhine and had its capital on the German frontier in Cologne, known then as Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium. Several civitates are known which form its subdivisions: :*The civitas of the Ubii included modern Cologne, Bonn, :*The civitas of the Cugerni, sometimes proposed to be descendants of the Sugambri, included Colonia Ulpia Traiana (Xanten) and Neuss. :*The civitas of the Batavi included Nijmegen, named by Tacitus as descendants of the Chatti. :*The civitas of the Cananefates, named by Tacitus as having the same background as the Batavi. :*At some point, the Civitas Tungrorum, the district of the Tungri, who lived where the supposed original Germani had lived, became part of Germania Inferior. :The origin of other peoples in this province, such as the Marsacii, Frisiavones, Baetasii, and Sunuci is less certain, but they are all thought to be Germanic. *Germania Superior was the more southern of the two provinces of cisrhenane Germania. It had its capital at Mainz and included the area of modern Alsace, and the corner of Switzerland, Germany and France. The civitates included: :*Moguntiacum (Mainz) was also the capital of the province. :*The civitas of the Vangiones, based at Worms, Germany (Borbetomagus) :*The civitas of the Nemetes, based at Speyer (Noviomagus) :*Aquae Mattiacae (Wiesbaden), east of the Rhine. Civitas of the Mattiaci. So the two Roman provinces named Germania, both mainly on the west of the Rhine, gave an official form to the concept of Germani cisrhenani. As the empire grew older, new tribes arrived into Germania cisrhenana, and these regions started to become more independent. By the time of the collapse of the empire's central power in Gaul (5th century), all or most of these peoples were unified in their use of Germanic languages or dialects. The cisrhenane Germani eventually ceased to be restricted to a band of occupation near the border, and all Roman provinces west of the Rhine were eventually conquered by Germanic tribes, speaking Germanic languages: the Franks (Germania inferior, Francia), the Alemanni (Germania superior, Alemannia), the Burgundians (Burgundy), the Visigoths (Visigothic Kingdom), and so on.

She acted as regent of Flanders from 1096 until 1100, while her husband, Robert II of Flanders, was on crusade, and in the name of their son Baldwin VII from 1111 until 1119. Background Clementia was the daughter of Count William I of Burgundy and a noblewoman named Stephanie. Her family was heavily attached to the Catholic Church, with two of her brothers becoming archbishops and another brother becoming Pope Callixtus II. Countess of Flanders In 1097, Clementia married Robert II, Count of Flanders and became Countess of Flanders. Her husband gave her an impressive dower, which included, \\"one-third of Flanders, including twelve towns located in the maritime and southwestern regions of Flanders, and stretching from Lille to Douai to Bapaume.\\"Everglades, Theodore, Aristocratic Women in Medieval France, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999, p. 111. Because her dower contained so much land and so many towns, it created the opportunity for Clementia to build relationships with the people, which further allowed her to become the \\"patron of various monasteries, [to] develop bonds of friendship with important families, and help spread comital influence throughout the area. By doing so, [she] developed the power to participate in the rule of Flanders.\\"Adair, Penelope Ann, \\"Ego et Uxor Mea... :\\"\\"Countess Clemente and her Role in the Comital Family and Flanders (1092-1133),\\" (PhD Diss, University of California at Santa Barbara, 1993), p. xiii. Clementia and her husband Count Robert II had three sons together, and it was their son Baldwin that would come into rule after the death of Robert II in 1111. =First regency= When her husband, Count Robert II, left to go on the First Crusade in 1096, Clementia became regent of Flanders. As the ruling force she influenced the production of money, such as imprinting her own name on minted coins.Everglades, Theodore, Aristocratic Women in Medieval France, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999, p. 111. She was also asked to help deal with violent matters like protecting pilgrims from assault in Bapaume.Everglades, Theodore, Aristocratic Women in Medieval France, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999, p. 112. When Robert II returned from crusading though, her power and influence did not end. They ruled together, with her name appearing on many of the charters instigated by her husband. Much of her influence after her husband's return becomes focused on her involvement with the church and specifically her patronage of multiple monasteries, abbes, and the donating of land for church use. =Second regency= In 1111 Count Robert II died in a battle at Meaux. After his death their son Baldwin VII came into power. Despite being eighteen years old and thus old enough to rule alone, Clementia was formally recognized as his co- regent throughout his reign. Clementia was extremely powerful, in particular, during his first year of reign, with all the charters of the time containing her name.Everglades, Theodore, Aristocratic Women in Medieval France, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999, p. 112. They ruled together with relative peace, until Baldwin VII began to form a stronger bond with his cousin Charles of Denmark. In 1119, Baldwin VII was killed in battle and Charles succeeded him as count. Clementia did not like Charles and used her influence to raise an army against him. She lost the battle to Charles when he captured four of her dower towns, which led to the cutting off of resources for her army.Everglades, Theodore, Aristocratic Women in Medieval France, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999, p. 113. This caused Clementia to lose her power to rule Flanders. Regardless, \\"Clematia continued to issue charters concerning her dower lands and towns until her death in 1133.\\"Everglades, Theodore, Aristocratic Women in Medieval France, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999, p. 112. Second marriage After her son, Baldwin VII, died in 1119, she married Count Godfrey I of Louvain. Clementia may have been the mother of Godfrey's son Joscelin, although some historians consider the possibility that he was born of a mistress.Sanders, I.J., English Baronies, Oxford, 1960, p. 148 Notes Sources *Adair, Penelope Ann. \\"Ego et Uxor Mea... :\\"\\"Countess Clemente and her Role in the Comital Family and Flanders (1092-1133).\\" (PhD Diss, University of California at Santa Barbara, 1993). *Bouchard, Constance B. \\"Consanguinity and Noble Marriages in the Tenth and Eleventh Centuries.\\" Speculum.

It was designed and built to his specifications by Beyer, Peacock and Company in 1924. Characteristics Six locomotives were delivered in 1924 and were erected in the Durban shops of the SAR. They were placed in service in 1924 and 1925, designated Class GC and numbered in the range from 2180 to 2185.

Like its predecessor Class GB, the heavier Class GC was also a branch line locomotive and its maximum axle load of made it suitable for light rail. It was a more powerful development of the Class GB and was very similar to the Class GK Garratts which had been acquired by the New Cape Central Railway (NCCR) in 1923, but heavier and with smaller diameter cylinders with a longer stroke. Service The locomotives were initially placed in service on the Natal South Coast line. Although they later also worked on other branch lines, they spent their entire working lives in Natal until they were withdrawn from service in 1962.

Initially introduced only in Tokyo in the late 1860s, small schools utilizing Western models were being opened by the late 1880s. In response to disaster relief, the Japanese Red Cross became an integral part of nursing development. By 1915, nurse registration had been established and public health nurses began working throughout the country. Nursing universities were established in the twentieth century and regulations were passed to develop standards for training and public health. History Nursing educator Iyo Araki, seated at center, and student nurses at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo, from a 1909 publication Care of the sick in Japan was primarily done in the home by untrained family members until the end of the nineteenth century. Nursing first emerged in Tokyo in 1869, when the Tokyo Imperial University opened a small school for nurses. Little training was given in how to care for the sick, but students were instructed in hygiene and sanitary conditions for hospitals. In 1883, foreign missionaries opened two small nursing schools, based on Western models to give theoretical training to nurses. Two years later, a doctor opened a school in Kyoto and the Canadian Episcopal Mission began a school in Kobe. The Kyoto school was begun by Linda Richards, who was sent by the American Board of Missions to organize a training school at the Doshisha Hospital. The first class of four nurses graduated in 1888. In 1887, the Japanese Red Cross (JRC) was founded and by 1890 had begun teaching and recruiting nurses for training. Though their nurses were still studying when the Sino Japanese War broke out, the JRC decided to send trainees to help with relief efforts. From 1894, JRC Nurses served in numerous conflicts helping with the wounded, including in the Boxer Rebellion (1900), the Russo-Japanese War (1904), World War I and the Japanese intervention in Siberia (1919). The JRC Nurses' training program required three years of study with the first year dedicated to theory, including courses on anatomy, bandaging, disinfection, hygiene, instruments, women‚Äôs health, obstetrics, as well as basic assistance of surgery and health treatment and the latter two years involved in practical training. Completion of the course required a final examination before diplomas were given and additional six months of training could qualify nurse candidates as head nurses. Because the JRC was under government control, their hospitals spread to all the major cities and a uniformity of training made the organization a leader in nursing development. Nursing was not an established part of Japan's health care system until 1899 with the adoption of the Midwives Ordinance. The Registered Nurse Ordinance was passed in 1915 which established a legal substantiation to registered nurses all over Japan. In the 1920s, the government began investigating the need to increase the educational requirements for nurses. Up to that time, job training was the only requirement and there was no prerequisite for a high school education to enter training at most hospitals. In 1927, St. Luke's International Hospital became the first college of nursing in the country and based its training program on the one offered at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. The program required students to be graduates of a Government High School, complete three years of standard training, and a fourth year of specialization. The first nursing association in Japan was founded in 1929 by Take Hagiwara as the Nursing Association of the Japanese Empire. By 1933, the organization had around 1500 members from throughout Japan and joined the International Council of Nurses (ICN). During World War II the Public Health Nurse Ordinance (1941) and National Medical Care Act (1942) were passed and re-affirmed in 1948 with passage of the Public Health Nurses, Midwives and Nurses Act. It established educational requirements, standards and licensure. In 1946, the Japanese Nursing Association was created, merging the Japanese Midwife Society, Japanese Public Health Nurses Association and the Nursing Association of the Japanese Empire into one umbrella organization. There has been a continued effort to improve nursing in Japan. In 1952 the first university courses on nursing were introduced, 1957 requirements for assistant nurses were introduced, in 1965 regulations were passed for nurses working night-shifts, and throughout the 1990s several legislative acts expanded training and employment protections for nurses. In 1992, the Law for Securing Nursing Personnel created new university programs to address the aging population of Japan, establish a critical scientifically based approach to training rather than a pragmatic one, unify training and licensing requirements and overall improve the image of the field. In 2009, the Public Health Nurses, Midwives and Nurses Act was amended allowing those who had graduated from a 4-year college to be eligible to take the nursing examination, revising course requirements, and making newly graduated training mandatory for nursing personnel. Types of nurses Japan recognizes four types of nurses: Public Health Nurses, Midwives, Registered Nurses and Assistant Nurses. Public health nursing is designed to help the public and is also driven by the public's needs. The goals of public health nurses are to monitor the spread of disease, keep vigilant watch for environmental hazards, educate the community on how to care for and treat themselves, and train for community disasters. Midwife nurses are independent of any organization. A midwife takes care of a pregnant woman during labor and postpartum. They assist the mother with breastfeeding, caring for the child, and related tasks. Individuals who are assistant nurses follow orders from a registered nurse. They report back to the licensed nurse about a patient's condition. Assistant nurses are always supervised by a dentist, licensed registered nurse or physician. Nursing education Requirements of nursing education in Japan are that candidates have completed twelve years of basic academic study and then three years of basic nursing education. Public health nurses and midwives require a minimum of one additional year of specialized study. After completing their studies, students must pass the national licensing examination and obtain a license from the Minister of Health, Labour, and Welfare in the case of nurses, or from the prefectural governor, for nurse assistants. Foreign nurses who wish to work in Japan are required to pass the licensing examination and obtain a Japanese nursing license. To become a registered nurse in Japan, candidates must first obtain a high school degree and then either enroll in a nursing university for four years and earn a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN); attend a junior nursing college for three years, earning an Associate of Science in Nursing (ASN); or study at a nursing training school for three years and obtain a diploma. The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) regulates the curriculum of the colleges and universities, while the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare's Division of Nursing regulates nursing diploma programs. The two Ministries jointly establish core curriculum, though individual schools may vary on additional requirements. The basic course study must include courses on: anatomy, adult health, basic nursing, children‚Äôs health, disease and recovery studies, gerontological nursing, health support and social systems, home care nursing theory, maternity, mental health, nursing integration, psychiatric nursing, scientific thinking and the understanding of humans, life and society. Both theoretical study and clinical practice are required. Upon completion of studies a national examination administered by the Division of Nursing of the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare is required. Licenses are issued for the nurse's lifetime and require no renewal or continuing education. For nurses who wish to become Public Health Nurses or Midwives, post-graduate studies are required. Colleges, junior colleges, nurse training schools or universities offer courses for the additional training which must be for a minimum of one year. Additionally master's degrees are offered at some universities. As of 2010, all nurses are required to complete postgraduate clinical training. =Credentialing= The certification of nurse specialists is not legally specified in Japan, though the practice is widely accepted. The Japanese Nursing Association (JNA) certifies nurses in three categories: Certified Nurse, Certified Nurse Administrator and Certified Nurse Specialist. All three levels of certification require that the nurse pass the national nursing examination as well as a certification test administered by the JNA. Certifications must be renewed every five years. Certified Nurses (CN) are required to take six months training in cancer and chemotherapy nursing, emergency care, hospice care, intensive care nursing, wound, ostomy, and continence nursing, and pain management nursing, after completion of their basic nursing licensing. As of July 2015, nearly 16,000 CNs were working in Japan in various specialties including cancer care, chronic care, dementia nursing, diabetes nursing, dialysis nursing, emergency care, heart care, infection control, infertility nursing, neonatal care, rehabilitative care, respiratory care, and other specialized fields. Certified Nurse Administrators (CNA) are required to complete a master‚Äôs program in management at a graduate school or university or a certification from a nurses training education program. Certified Nurse Specialists (CNS) are required to complete a master‚Äôs program for specialized fields, including Cancer Nursing, Child Health Nursing, Chronic Care Nursing, Community Health Nursing, Critical Care Nursing, Family Health Nursing, Gerontological Nursing, Home Care Nursing, Infection Control Nursing, Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing or Women's Health Nursing, after obtaining their national licensing. In addition, certification requires a minimum of five years clinical experience. Other professional groups also provide certification for clinical specialties such as community health, diabetes, disaster nursing, emergency nursing, intractable illness, nursing administration, and psychiatric nursing. These organizations predominantly emerged in the 1990s. They include the Japan Visiting Nursing Foundation, which was founded in 1994 to create and improve home care services for the elderly; the Japanese Family Nursing Society, which emerged in 1994 to focus on the education, practices and development of theory for family nurse practitioners; the Japanese Nursing Diagnosis Association and the Japan Society of Nursing Diagnosis focus on nursing diagnosis. Additional professional organizations include the Federation of Nursing Colleges and Association of Nurses, the International Nursing Foundation of Japan, the Japanese Midwives Association, and the Japanese Society of Nursing Research. =Nurse practitioners= Until 2015, nurses in Japan were required to work under the guidance of physicians. They were not allowed to diagnose conditions or prescribe medications without a doctor's directive. Socio-cultural custom giving doctors higher perceived social status and nurses the role of caretaker, led to nurses' lack of autonomy. In October 2015, the Act on Public Health Nurses, Midwives and Nurses was amended to allow nurses who had received specific training to act as nurse practitioners and intervene in certain situations without awaiting a physician's decision. The training curricula requires completion of 315 study hours of common subjects and 15 to 72 study hours of subjects for specified categories of medicine. Participants must attend both lectures and participate in practical applications. Upon completion of the coursework, applicants must receive a certificate of completion. They may then perform specific medical interventions based upon those described in procedure manuals prepared by physicians.  Current state  There is currently a shortage of nurses in Japan, in part due to the expanding population of elderly. Other reasons for the deficit in nursing applicants are poor working conditions, an increase in assigned workloads, the low social status of nurses, and the cultural idea that married women quit their jobs for family responsibilities. On average, Japanese nurses will make around 280,000 yen a month. Until 2000, nurses made up about 4.5% of the women's work force in Japan with almost two-thirds having nursing diplomas and only one percent having a BSN degree. The majority of nurses were female with only around three percent of the field being male. The largest segment of nurses are in their 30s and 40s with the average age being 41 in 2016 and hospitals are the major employer (61%) of nursing staff, followed by private clinics (21%). After 1992, Nurse Centers were created in each prefecture by the Act on Assurance of Work Forces of Nurses and Other Medical Experts. These Centers provide placement, job training and recertification, if desired. They monitor nurses who are unemployed and support those who may wish to re-enter the work force. The most common reason for nurses to leave the work force is to raise a family, though heavy responsibilities, irregular shift work, long working hours, night shift duty, and poor working conditions/treatment accounted for part of the turnover. Government programs to improve working environments have been on-going since 2011. One of the older unions that relates to nursing is the Japanese Federation of Medical Workers Union, which was created in 1957. It is a union that includes physicians as well as nurses. This organization was involved with the creation of the Nursing Human Resource Law.

This variety is more common in cuisine of the Southern United States and is most often served as a Sunday morning dish with fresh biscuits in the Ozark and Appalachian Mountain regions. Milk is commonly used as the liquid in chocolate gravy, while some recipes use water. Some recipes devised in eastern Oklahoma use more sugar, and the fat comes from the use of butter after the gravy is complete, making it more like warm chocolate pudding served over biscuits. In a traditional gravy, a roux is made with fat and flour before the milk is added; in chocolate gravy all the dry ingredients are mixed first, milk slowly incorporated, then stirred continuously until cooked. When a thick and rich consistency is achieved, the butter and vanilla are added. Other ingredients, such as crumbled bacon, are usually added afterward near the end of preparation.

He then completed four years of Arabian Studies at Sofia University, and acquired an associate degree in Banking management from the University of Veliko Tarnovo in 1997. After several years in business enterprises in Sofia, Dubai and Istanbul, Yanev embarked on filmmaking, inspired by personal acquaintance in Dubai with the late Afghan leader, Abdul Haq in Dubai.

He has worked on several film projects as an assistant director, researcher, photographer, editor and producer and director. He began work on his first films, the documentaries Six Inches and Hollywood Haq in 2005.

History In 1967, Harold Hamm founded Shelly Dean Oil Co., Continental's predecessor. In 1990, the company was renamed Continental Resources. In 1995, the company discovered what was later described as the Cedar Hills Field in North Dakota, the 7th largest onshore field in the lower 48 United States ranked by liquid proved reserves, and was the first to develop it exclusively through precision horizontal drilling. In 2003, the company drilled its first wells in the Bakken formation. In 2004, the company completed the Robert Heuer 1-17R in Divide County, the 1st commercially successful well in the North Dakota Bakken to be both horizontally drilled and completed using hydraulic fracturing. In 2007, the company became a public company via an initial public offering in which Harold Hamm sold approximately $300 million worth of his shares. In 2008, the company was the first to complete a horizontal well in the Three Forks zone. In 2010, Continental introduced the ECO-Pad¬Æ drilling technique, which involves drilling 4 wells from 1 pad. This reduced the cost of drilling and increased production output. In 2012, the company moved its headquarters from Enid, Oklahoma to Oklahoma City. In 2016, the company sold assets in North Dakota and Montana for $222 million. In 2017, the company sold 26,000 acres in the Arkoma Basin for $68 million.

It is found in the Mediterranean region, in southern Europe and northern Africa. Its scientific name lycioides refers to its resemblance to the botanical genus Lycium. Description Rhamnus lycioides is a slow growth shrub adapted to dry Mediterranean climate. It is a deciduous or evergreen shrub of 1.5‚Äì3 meters high with a tangled, thorny, and many-branched form. The bark is grayish, and the young stems are topped with a thorn. Leaves are light green and, 0.5 to 3.5 centimeters long and 0.3 to 1 inch wide. The tip is obtuse to apiculate. The leaf is entire, linear to obovate, glabrous, narrow and elongated, sometimes slightly broadened towards the apex. They are sometimes leathery and persistent. Lateral nerves have little or no markings on the underside. The yellow flowers are inconspicuous, standing in groups and appear in the winter. The calyx shows four sharp corners. The flowers are very small, solitary or in small bundles in the axils of the leaves, greenish-yellow with 4 triangular lobes. The petals are rudimentary or nonexistent. The fruits ovoid, 4-6 millimeters large, yellowish and are beginning to ripen black. The berry is having inside a single seed or more, depending on the subspecies. It does not bloom and bear fruit at the same time. Several specimens of the same population bear fruit in different months extending the availability of the species as food for birds that disperse their seeds. The berry is purgative, very bitter and in large quantities is toxic to humans. Subspecies Five subspecies are recognized: * Rhamnus lycioides subsp. lycioides * Rhamnus lycioides subsp. atlantica (Murb.) Jahand. & Maire * Rhamnus lycioides subsp. graeca (Boiss. & Reut.) Tutin * Rhamnus lycioides subsp. oleoides (L.) Jahand. & Maire * Rhamnus lycioides subsp. velutina (Boiss.) Tutin Rhamnus lycioides subsp. atlantica (Murb.) Jahand. & Maire is now known as Rhamnus atlantica. Ecology In the Iberian Peninsula is distributed throughout the central, eastern and south and its natural habitat are the sclerophyllous forest, and woods of pines, oaks, holm oaks and quercus coccifera. The species is found in the Mediterranean region, particularly in Spain and the Balearic Islands. It also grows on mediterranean Islands and islets, Norther Africa, the Apennine Peninsula and in former Yugoslavia on rocky, nutrient-poor soils. The plant appears in sclerophyllous forests, scrub, and even solitary in severely degraded drylands as a pioneer species as the species is resilient to overgrazing and trampling by livestock. It is very resistant to drought, preferring calcareous soils. In extremely dry and windy climates it appears in the rocks. It survives in desert areas with annual rainfall of 200 mm. The plant thrives in dry forests and bushes, under the Kermes oak, the Holm oak, Aleppo pine and juniper. It is a very hardy plant, which occupies poor soils, gritty and highly eroded. Along with the gorse and thistles are the latest species to disappear in overgrazed areas, being of inestimable value to small birds for its fruit and as the protection and support for their nests. The species is very important for desert birds by their fruits with high water content. The fruit can cause death in mammals, but is consumed by ants and birds.

Ltd. was an engineering and construction business serving clients primarily in the oil and gas, petrochemical and mining and metals sectors.  History  The company was founded by Michael Francis Kent as an electrical contracting business in Clonmel in County Tipperary in 1919. The business was taken over by his brother in 1948, and then by his son Frank in 1963. The business, which had been renamed MF Kent, expanded rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s as it upgraded the Irish telecommunications network. In 1987, it was acquired by Gus Kearney, its general manager, who expanded operations into Singapore, Spain and Africa. In 1992, the company made heavy losses on the refurbishment of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya and struggled to survive. Two years later, the Malaysian group, Peremba, stepped in and bought a majority stake in the business, providing much-needed capital. The company changed its name to Kentz following the purchase. Hugh O'Donnell was appointed chief executive in 2000 and the company was subsequently listed on the Alternative Investment Market in February 2008. Kentz was transferred to the main market of the London Stock Exchange in July 2011. Christian Brown became chief executive in February 2012. On 23 June 2014, Montreal's SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. agreed to acquire Kentz for about C$2.1 billion ($1.95 billion). On 22 August 2014 SNC-Lavalin Group announced that it had completed the acquisition of Kentz and that Kentz had been delisted from the London Stock Exchange. Operations Kentz has operations in 30 countries around the world, including the Americas, the Middle East, Africa, Australasia, the Far East, Russia and Europe.

He was officially rated the best European two-year-old 1993. He won two Group One races; the Dewhurst Stakes in 1993 and the St James's Palace Stakes in 1994. He is best known as a successful sire. At the time of his death he was standing at the Woodlands Stud, Denman, New South Wales. Background Grand Lodge was bred by his owner John Scott-Ellis, 9th Baron Howard de Walden, who also owned and bred The Derby winner Slip Anchor and the champion miler Kris He was sired by Chief's Crown out of Lord Howard de Walden's unraced mare La Papagena. Chief's Crown won the 1984 Breeders' Cup Juvenile and was voted the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Two-Year-Old Male Horse. He sired several other important horses including Chief Bearheart and Erhaab. La Papagena, a daughter of the Cheveley Park Stakes and Coronation Stakes winner Magic Flute, produced several other winners, the best of them probably being the Listed stakes winner La Persiana. Grand Lodge was trained throughout his career by William \\"Willie\\" Jarvis at the Phantom House stables at Newmarket, Suffolk. When Grand Lodge ran, Jarvis often wore an apricot-coloured rose as a button-hole, to match the silks of Lord Howard de Walden. Racing career =1993: two-year-old season= Grand Lodge won three of his four races as a two-year-old. On his debut he won the Granville Maiden Stakes at Ascot by six lengths. A month later at York he was beaten when odds-on favourite for the Listed Acomb Stakes, finishing third to Concordial. At Newmarket in October he won the Somerville Tattersall Stakes, leading a furlong out and going clear to beat Colonel Collins by three and a half lengths, and was then moved up to Group One class for the Dewhurst Stakes over the same course and distance two weeks later. He was made 9/4 favourite and led inside the final furlong to beat Stonehatch and Nicolotte in a driving finish. Jarvis emphasised the care that he would take with his best horse by saying 'You ought to start buying shares in cotton wool because that's what this horse is going to be wrapped in.\\" =1994: three-year-old season= Despite what his trainer had said, Grand Lodge was given a demanding schedule in 1994, running nine times, eight of them in Group One company. His only win came at Royal Ascot where he ran on under a strong ride from Michael Kinane to beat Distant View by a head in the St James's Palace Stakes. After the race Jarvis called him \\"a very easy horse to train...Even I can't bugger him up.\\" In other starts he was beaten a short head in both the 2000 Guineas and the Champion Stakes, finished third in the Sussex Stakes and Irish Champion Stakes and was fourth in the Irish 2,000 Guineas and the International Stakes. On his last start he ran one of his few bad races, finishing unplaced behind Concern in the Breeders' Cup Classic on his only race on dirt. Assessment In the International Classification for 1993, he was rated the best two-year-old colt in Europe on a mark of 120. Despite this he was beaten in the voting for the Cartier Racing Award by the Middle Park Stakes winner First Trump. At three, he was rated on 125, making him the seventh-best three-year-old in Europe, five pounds behind the filly Balanchine and three pounds below the leading colt, Distant View. Stud career Grand Lodge was retired to stand as a stallion for the Coolmore Stud, being shuttled between their main base in Ireland, Lord Howard de Walden's Plantation Stud in England and the Woodlands Stud in Australia. Grand Lodge proved to be an extremely popular stallion: between 1998 and 2003 he was covering an average of more than 300 mares a year. He sired the winners of more than six hundred races including Sinndar, Grandera, Queen's Logic, Grand Couturier (Sword Dancer Invitational Handicap), Indian Lodge and Shogun Lodge (Epsom Handicap). On 4 September 2003, Grand Lodge suffered a knee injury in the paddock of the Woodlands Stud. The injury did not respond to treatment and he was euthanized on 24 December. He was buried at the Woodlands Stud. At the time of his death his stud fee for 2004 had already been set at ‚Ç¨50,000.

It is situated at a distance of 6 km from the centre of Tambaram. It is situated in South Chennai and located 27 km from broadway. It is one of the fastest growing railway hubs outside Chennai Central in the southern direction. Everyday, on an average, around 3,50,000 commuters use the station. About 500 suburban electric trains operate from Tambaram, including those between Chennai Beach and Chengalpattu and Kancheepuram. Further, more than 25 expresses, including those bound for Howrah and other places in the north pass through the town. It is also third busiest station in the city (after Chennai Central and Chennai Egmore). The daily ticket sales at Tambaram fetch 1 million, half of which comes from suburban travellers. It is the second most revenue-generating station in Chennai after Moore Market Complex. A total of 52 trains pass through the station. Tambaram Railway Station divides Tambaram into East Tambaram and West Tambaram. There are nine platforms in the station. Platforms 1-4 are used for suburban trains between Chengalpattu and Chennai Beach and platforms between 5 and 9 are used by the suburban electric trains between Chennai Beach and Chengalpattu and Tirumalpur and also long distance express trains. Most of the suburban electric train services originating from Tambaram to Beach and Chengalpattu leave from the first two platforms. There is a foot overbridge connecting East and West Tambaram with access to all platforms. In 2008, Southern Railway started building an additional platform at the westernmost side of the railway station, making Platform No.1 a double-discharge platform, a design which helps commuters to alight on either side of the train, similar to the one at Park Railway Station, where the passengers could alight on the western side for quicker access to Chennai Central. History Station nameboard at Tambaram railway station The lines at the station were one of the first in Chennai to be electrified. They were energised on 1.5 kV DC in 1931 with the electrification of the Chennai Beach‚ÄìTambaram section, and the third line in the section was electrified on 15 January 1965. The lines further south from the station, up to Chengalpattu, were electrified on 9 January 1965. On 15 January 1967, all the lines were converted to 25 kV AC. Traffic Every day, 160 train services are operated between Chennai Beach and Tambaram, 70 between Tambaram and Chengalpet and 16 between Tambaram and Kancheepuram. Ticket sales at Tambaram Station are the highest on the suburban sector. Monthly sales of tickets, which stood at 0.712 million in November 2010, went up to 0.75 million in November 2011, when the state government hiked bus fares. It shot up to 0.837 million in December 2011 and to 0.871 million in January 2012. In April 2012, the figure touched 0.826 million. Nearly 95 percent of the tickets sold are on the suburban sector, while the remaining are to neighbouring and southern districts. As of 2013, about 20,000 people buy tickets at the station daily. Hub terminal In an effort to decongest the traffic at the Chennai Central railway station, Egmore was announced as the second terminal, and the railways has decided to make Tambaram as the third terminal so that the trains from southern districts could halt there. The station's proximity to the Central Warehousing Corporation's godown located at Chitlapakkam makes it technically important. Four railway lines exist between Chennai Beach and Tambaram, two for up and down long distance trains and two for up and down suburban services. However, only two rail lines exist between Tambaram and Chengelpet, which are not enough to meet the growing demand of the section let alone its future requirements. March 2013 has been set as the deadline for the completion of the first phase of Tambaram station development project, and Southern Railway had prepared and submitted to the railway board a proposal to lay additional lines for a 30 km stretch from Tambaram to Chengelpet at an estimate of 2000 million but the board is yet to give its approval. As a first step towards this, Southern Railways plans to set up a coaching terminal at Tambaram at an approximate cost of 340 million. It will have pit lines for maintenance, stabling lines and additional platforms. ;Sheds The station had a huge metre- gauge freight marshalling yard for Chennai, which has been closed. It is also a former electric shed and home to the YAM-1 locomotives. Presently, the station has a broad-gauge EMU maintenance and car shed. The EMU car shed was established in 1931 and has adequate facilities to maintain 12-coach rakes. As of 2006, the number of staff in charge of maintenance at the car shed is six per car. Developments EMU car shed at Tambaram railway station The first broad gauge line at Tambaram was laid in 1995‚Äì96, which was part of the broad gauge conversion from Egmore. In 2004, platform 2 was converted to broad gauge line. In 2008, platform 1 was built. Subsequently, the conversion of lines at platforms 3, 4 and 5 into broad gauge was taken up but had to be halted due to a shortage of funds. A new station building with 10 ticket counters at the western side of the track was constructed at a cost of 13 million in 2003. Space was provided for food courts, coffee parlours, a medical shop and public call offices and also for shunting wagons. It was designed to have six retiring rooms, three of which were to be air-conditioned, in addition to two air-conditioned dormitories, deluxe waiting halls and a VIP lounge. Along the lines of a similar facility at the Chennai Central railway station, the Southern Railways constructed a bus bay in 2006 to serve the more than 100,000 passengers who travel by Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses in Tambaram. On an average, Tambaram records an increase of 30,000 passengers every year for MTC buses. Everyday, 1,500 MTC buses are run from Tambaram to Mamallapuram, Tiruporur (on OMR), Kovalam and Vadamalli (on ECR), Sriperumbudur and Walajabad, among other places. On 5 January 2012, Southern Railway started preliminary works for shifting south-bound trains to Tambaram junction although there were protests against the proposal of making Tambaram the third terminal of Chennai after Chennai Central and Chennai Egmore. To begin with, the Southern Railway decided to construct an escalator at the main entrance and another at the eastern side (facing Madras Christian College). It was also decided to install common escalators for platforms 1 and 2 where passengers of suburban trains alight besides another one for passengers alighting from south-bound express trains on platforms 6 and 7, a feature already available at Egmore junction. The station has enough space to build three additional platforms. In 2014, an escalator connecting East Tambaram with the foot over bridge and platform 1A was installed in the station, the first of its kind in a suburban station around Chennai. The new coach terminal constructed on the eastern side of the station became operational in June 2018. Security In 2011, the measures were taken to enhance the security at the railway station. Work on the integrated security system began on 17 August 2011, which will include more closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras, door- frame metal detectors, baggage screening devices costing about 4 million and a separate control room for the Railway Protection Force (RPF) for better communication and co-ordination with the headquarters. The station, which has 14 CCTV cameras, will get 26 more CCTV cameras in important locations, including on Platforms 3 and 4, the parking lot and the coach shed. Laying of cables has already begun. The existing analogue cameras at Tambaram will be converted into digital cameras. The high-resolution CCTV cameras, capable of zooming down to 100 m and being remote controlled, are enabled with Internet Protocol. The 400-million Integrated Security Surveillance System (ISSS) project is implemented jointly by the Southern Railways and HCL Infosystems. Accident rates On the Guindy‚ÄìChengalpet suburban section, comprising 17 stations, the Chromepet‚ÄìTambaram stretch remains the deadliest with at least 15 accidents a month. Train timings Tambaram has train facility from Early Morning 4 AM to Mid night 12 AM. For every 10 minutes we have beach to tambarm train. Chengalpattu to beach train flows for every 30 minutes. In the morning, the station is full of office goers.

The walls were constructed between 1283 and 1292 after the foundation of Caernarfon by Edward I, alongside the adjacent castle. The walls are long and include eight towers and two medieval gatehouses. The project was completed using large numbers of labourers brought in from England; the cost of building the walls came to around ¬£3,500, a large sum for the period. The walls were significantly damaged during the rebellion of Madog ap Llywelyn in 1294, and had to be repaired at considerable expense. Political changes in the 16th century reduced the need to maintain such defences around the town. Today the walls form part of the UNESCO world heritage site administered by Cadw. Archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham describe the defences as \\"a remarkably intact walled circuit\\".Creighton and Higham, p. 274. History =13th century= Model replica showing the town walls shortly after their completion in the 13th century, as seen from the west Before the English construction of the town of Caernarfon, the area had been occupied first by the Romans, who built the fort of Segontium, and later by both the Normans and the Welsh princes.Taylor, pp. 5-7. As a result of this long history, depicted in the Welsh saga of Mabinogion, the site was both culturally and politically significant to the medieval Welsh.Taylor, pp. 5, 7. The English kings and Welsh princes had vied for control of North Wales since the 1070s and the conflict had been renewed during the 13th century, leading to Edward I intervening in North Wales for the second time during his reign in 1282.Ashbee, p. 5; Taylor pp. 6-7. Edward invaded with a huge army, pushing north from Carmarthen and westwards from Montgomery and Chester. By summer 1283 Edward had secured Caernarfon and the surrounding area.Taylor, p. 7. The king decided that the location would become the centre of a new county and the capital of the principality of North Wales, with a new castle and walled town forming the administrative centre.Taylor, p. 38. Edward's plan was a colonial enterprise and placing the new town and walls on the Caernarfon site was in part a symbolic act to demonstrate English power; the walls also symbolised the town's status as the capital of North Wales.Creighton and Higham, pp. 32, 101. Traditionally Caernarfon's design and defences have been thought to have been inspired by the growth of the bastides. The bastides were new planned towns created in both France and English-held Gascony during the period, characterised by grids of straight streets, often defended by combinations of castles and town walls.Creighton and Higham, p. 99. More recent research, however, has shown that English town design played a more significant role in shaping Caernarfon and other Edwardian town plans.Lilley, pp. 109-111. In the case of Caernarfon, the town plan and walls were adapted to fit around the site of the former Norman castle on the site, which lay just outside the new town and was used a market place.Creighton and Higham, pp. 4, 99-100. The East Gate, showing a mixture of medieval, 18th and 19th century architecture The walls of Caernarfon were built at the same time as the castle, under the overall supervision of Master James of Saint George, Edward's chief architect in North Wales. Between 1283 and 1284, Richard the Engineer acted as James' deputy on the site; later, between 1295 and 1308, Walter of Hereford performed a similar role, and may have also been responsible for earlier work on the walls as well.Taylor, pp. 8-9; Turner, p. 49; World Heritage Site Management Plan: Part 1, Cadw, p. 18. Huge amounts of labourers were mobilised from across England for the task, massed at Chester and then brought into Wales for each summer building season.Brown, pp. 123-5; Taylor, p. 8. Work on the walls progressed quickly, albeit in uneven bursts: local houses were demolished to make way for the fortifications and the stone walls and gates were probably finished by 1292.World Heritage Site Management Plan: Part 1, Cadw, p. 18; Creighton and Higham, p. 102. The cost of building the town walls was around ¬£3,500, a large sum for the period.Taylor, p. 13; Creighton and Higham, p. 102. Otto de Grandson, a favourite of Edward I, was appointed as constable of Caernarfon and justiciar of North Wales, with responsibility for security in the region.Taylor, p. 39. In 1294, however, Madog ap Llywelyn revolted against English rule and undertook a wide campaign across North Wales, attacking the town of Caernarfon.Taylor, pp. 12-13. Despite the walls, the town was overrun, the walls badly damaged, and the castle--still largely unfinished --was easily taken and set on fire.Taylor, p. 13. Edward responded with military force the next year: he retook Caernarfon and ordered the town walls to be fully repaired by November 1295, at a cost of around ¬£1,195. =14th to 18th centuries= The walls and Caernarfon Castle, seen from the north-west The new town of Caernarfon was populated by English settlers, particularly from nearby Cheshire and Lancashire, and the town walls were in part designed to encourage immigrants and royal officials to settle there in safety.Longley, p. 23; Taylor, p. 38. The town of Caernarfon did not prove a successful settlement, however; by 1298 it had only 59 burgage tenements--properties paying rent to the king--making it far less prosperous than either neighbouring Conwy or Beaumaris, and the situation did not improve during the 14th century.Prestwich, pp. 5-6. In 1400 Welsh prince Owain Glynd≈µr rose in rebellion against English rule, but despite attempts to take Caernarfon in 1403 and 1404, the town's defences held out.Ashbee, p. 12; Taylor, p. 16 The ascension of the Tudor dynasty to the English throne resulted in a change in the way Wales was administered.Ashbee, p. 13; Taylor, p. 16. The Tudors were Welsh in origin, and their rule lessened hostilities between the Welsh and English, reducing the need to maintain Caernarfon's castle and walls and easing the restrictions on Welsh access to the town--the Welsh were finally allowed to live inside Caernarfon in 1507.Taylor, p. 16; Creighton and Higham, p. 212; World Heritage Site Management Plan: Part 1, Cadw, p. 18; World Heritage Site Management Plan: Part 2 , Cadw, pp. 53-4. Around 1800, Caernarfon's local corporation undertook a programme of modernisation work, inserting several new gateways in the town walls; other changes were also made to the walls during the period, with some towers being converted for use as administrative buildings and the gatehouses altered to accommodate more modern offices.Taylor, p. 42-3; The Bath Tower, The Landmark Trust, accessed 17 September 2011. During the 19th century the town of Caernarfon grew considerably, prompted by the slate trade and the construction of the Chester to Holyhead railway line.Taylor, pp. 18-9. As a result of this population pressure, by the 20th century housing had encroached along the inside and outside of the town walls, so that in many places the walls had vanished from view.The Bath Tower, The Landmark Trust, accessed 17 September 2011. During the 20th century the walls were gradually acquired by the state and these houses demolished.World Heritage Site Management Plan: Part 1, Cadw, p. 20. Today Caernarfon's walls are managed by the Welsh heritage organisation Cadw as a tourist attraction, although only a small part of the wall-walk is open to the public.Creighton and Higham, p. 273; World Heritage Site Management Plan: Part 1, Cadw, p. 20. The walls require ongoing maintenance; in the financial year between 2002 and 2003, for example, maintaining the historic fabric of the walls and the castle cost ¬£4,500 (¬£5,710 in 2010 terms).World Heritage Site Management Plan: Part 2 , Cadw, p. 56; Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1830 to Present , Measuring Worth, Lawrence H. Office, accessed 10 September 2011. The walls were declared part of a UNESCO world heritage site in 1986 and are classed as a grade 1 listed building and hold scheduled monument status. They are considered by archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham to be \\"a remarkably intact walled circuit\\".Creighton and Higham, p. 273. Architecture Plan of the walls in 21st century The Caernarfon town walls today present an unbroken, long circuit around the town, enclosing , and are unusually well preserved.Creighton and Higham, p. 273; Taylor, p. 41; Lilley, p. 106. They are mostly built from the same carboniferous limestone used at the castle.World Heritage Site Management Plan: Part 1, Cadw, p. 21. The eight towers along the wall are mostly \\"gap-backed\\", lacking walls on the inside of the towers, and originally included removable wooden bridges to allow sections of the walls to be sealed off from attackers. The two original entrances to the town were through the West and East Gates. The West Gate faced onto the harbour, and was also known as the Golden Gate (); in the medieval period, this name would have evoked images of imperial Roman and Arthurian power, as it was the name of the primary gateway in the city of Constantinople. It was originally defended by a portcullis, but was modified with additional Gothic features in the 19th century.Taylor, p. 43. The East Gate formed the landward entrance to the town, originally overlooking the river Cadnant--the river is now culverted over.Taylor, pp. 41-2. The gatehouse contained offices for most of the period since its construction in the 13th century, first housing the royal exchequer, then Caernarfon's town hall and finally the guildhall. The offices were finally removed in the 1960s.Taylor, p. 42; World Heritage Site Management Plan: Part 1, Cadw, p. 20. Little of the original gatehouse remains, due to 18th and 19th century building work, although the base of the towers remains medieval.Taylor, p. 42; Creighton and Higham, p. 273. Newer entrances to the town, made by creating additional gateways in the walls, include Northgate, Greengate and the entrance to Market Street.Taylor, pp. 42-3. In the north-west corner of the walls is the 14th-century chapel of Saint Mary, built into the defences and using the only fully circular tower in the walls as a vestry.Taylor, p. 42. Further along the west side of the walls, several of the towers have been converted for various uses. One forms part of the County Offices, having been incorporated into the former County Gaol in the 19th century; another has been used by the Royal Welsh Yacht Club since the 19th century, and a third has been converted into a holiday home by the Landmark Trust.Taylor, p. 43; World Heritage Site Management Plan: Part 1, Cadw, pp. 20-1.

Life Dr. Abrosimov was born in 1948 in the city of Kuibyshev (now Samara). In 1971, he graduated from the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics of State University of Gorky (now Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod). Dr. Abrosimov undertook graduate studies in the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics of Lomonosov Moscow State University under the supervision of Professor Boris Shabat. In 1984 he defended his Ph.D. dissertation ‚ÄúComplex Differential Systems and the Tangential Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann Equations‚Äù. Dr. Abrosimov was Associate Professor in the Theory of Functions Subdepartment in the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics and Invited Lecturer in the Advanced School of General and Applied Physics (the base department of the Institute of Applied Physics and the Institute for Physics of Microstructures of the Russian Academy of Sciences). Work Beginning from his first works in 1971‚Äì3, Dr. Abrosimov studied overdetermined systems of partial differential equations where he successfully applied an original approach developed. A bright mathematical work in 1988 was devoted to an explicit procedure enabling one to decide whether two given smooth real hypersurfaces are locally CR-diffeomorphic. Subsequently, Dr. Abrosimov applied his original technique to describe CR-automorphisms of real quadrics of higher codimension. In this direction, he obtained important results and elaborated methods nowadays well known to CR-geometry specialists. First, Dr. Abrosimov proved that holomorphic automorphisms of a quadric of codimension two are furnished by birational transformations of degree two. Secondly, he convincingly demonstrated the power of the machinery of differential algebra in CR-geometry. In particular, he proved that under mild conditions the stabilizer of a point in the group of automorphisms of a quadric in Cn is a linear group. Thirdly, he was amongst the first researchers to look into scrutinizing a class of CR-manifolds of codimension one. To date, the class has remained a focus of active attention and efforts of research. Overall, Dr. Abrosimov published more than 25 scientific works on complex analysis. Some of the works of Dr. Abrosimov in CR-geometry and adjacent fields in complex analysis are deemed pioneering and his contribution important. Selected papers 1\\\\. A.V. Abrosimov and L.G.

History In June 1905 the company took a lease on the Poole and District Electric Tramways and a connection was made to this system for through running. Until May 1911, part of the system was equipped with conduit supply to avoid unsightly overhead wiring on the central section of the tramway. From May 1911, overhead wiring was introduced. Infrastructure The system extended to the suburb of Winton to the north and to the adjacent towns of Poole to the west and Christchurch to the east. Routes were centred on The Square at . The major lines were: * heading east along Old Christchurch Road, Christchurch Road, Seabourne Road, Belle Vue Road, Foxholes Road, Belle Vue Road, Stour Road, Bargates then High Street (Christchurch) to a terminus at Christchurch Castle at . * heading west along Commercial Road, Poole Road, Ashley Road, North Road, Parkstone Road then Longfleet Road to a terminus at Poole railway station at . * heading north along Richmond Hill then Wimborne Road to a terminus at its junction with Redhill Crescent at . There were four depots: * depot with workshops and generating station off Southcote Road at . * depot off Christchurch Road near Pokesdown railway station at . * depot off Ashley Road (Poole) at . * depot off Wimborne Rd (Moordown) at . Tramcars The fleet, in a livery of chocolate and cream, consisted of: * 151 double deck tramcars. * 1 single deck tramcar. Closure The tramway system began its closure in 1929 when motorbuses of Hants and Dorset Motor Services were introduced as a tram replacement on the Lower Parkstone route. In 1933 Bournemouth Corporation began to open trolleybus routes, and in 1936 the remaining tram routes were converted to operation by the trolleybuses of Bournemouth Corporation. Preserved tramcar Bournemouth tram number 85 is now preserved and on static display at the Crich National tramway museum before its transfer it lived at the Museum of Electricity in Christchurch. The body of car 106 was discovered on a Dorset farm, and eventually presented to Seaton Tramway in 1974. Due to the narrow gauge at Seaton (2 ft 9in/838mm), the body was narrowed and rebuilt as an enclosed single deck saloon and was launched into service in 1992, bearing the fleet number 16 and a livery closely resembling that of the Bournemouth system.

The feature-length documentary tells the story of the Bulgarian transition period and includes reconstructions, TV archive from Bulgarian National Television (BNT), NOVA TV, bTV and features interviews with contemporary Bulgarian figures like Palmi Ranchev, Atanas Orachev, Rumen Leonidov, Haralan Alexandrov, Andrey Pantev and Georg Kraev. Other witnesses and participants in the power structures tell their stories of the establishment of VIS & SIC and the fierce brutality that is required to survive the days of the transition. Produced and directed by Demir Yanev the film was chosen to participate in the Al Jazeera Documentary Film Festival in April, 2011 and also in the Golden Rhyton in Plovdiv. Plot Bulgaria being part of the Eastern bloc joined the race for freedom and democracy during the 1990s. Thousands flooded the streets speaking their minds with blistering hopes of developing new democratic forms of society. Within a few years the new systems of government transformed released criminals, prisoners and other sportsmen, mainly wrestlers into groups of street gangs, racketeers and security companies. With these gangs of thugs the newly appointed democrats privatized the country... 20 years later one man stood out to tell his and their story... A former wrestler himself ‚Äì Georgi Stoev. Archive Selected parts of Georgi Stoev's last TV interviews with Bulgaria's E- host lead the narrative of this film. Other TV archive material with the most spectacular contract killings in Bulgaria illustrate the heavy criminal transition in Bulgaria from the late 1990s up to present day. Reconstructions Reconstructions portray meetings and events described in Georgi Stoev's books. With a precise cast of characters almost every hero in Georgi Stoevs' books takes part in this film. Secret meetings between General Gotzev and Mladen Mihalev ‚Äì Madjoe mark a deep blueprint in the film's plot. Poly Pantev & The Jenya's rise to power in the SIC also take a leap into the storyline as do Georgi Stoevs' own stories and ambitions. A dynamic editing style and Vasil Genev's own music additionally highlight a structure of portraying Georgi Stoev's agonic clash with the police and the prosecution and furthermore deconstructs several secret, allegorically coded characters from Christo Kalchev's books. The crew filming on set Crew After several unsuccessful attempts with different crews the production came to a halt for an uncertain period of time during the early autumn of 2009. Not after too long, however, producer, director Demir Yanev finds Martin Balkansky (DoP) and Vlado Kaloyanov (Sound) and the filming resumes once again.

The group have labeled themselves as anarchists several times. Their lineup, which usually features about eight to ten musicians, is constantly changing, though a smaller group of core players have remained consistent long-term members. Over 100 different people have been part of the group at some point. Most members go by unusual pseudonyms, such as Captain Napkins or Friar Flute Flakes.  Style  Their musical style is based around the consistent use of acoustic instruments. Their compositions are heavily influenced by punk rock, traditional near-eastern music, as well as by other folk traditions such as bluegrass, and klezmer. While they make frequent use of instruments uncommon in American music, such as the bouzouki and kemenche, other, more common instruments, such as the banjo or accordion, are used as well. Their lyrical themes are generally centered on either the worship of God, or the implications of living out the gospel today. These themes reflect singer Scott Krueger's view that \\"our Christian walk is supposed to affect every aspect of our lives. So as artists, we want to have that shape our art.\\" Songs about living out the gospel are often political, anti-patriotic, anti- violence, and pro-justice.

Ub Iwerks was the animator. It was the eleventh Mickey Mouse short to be produced, the eighth of that year, and was one of the series of early Disney cartoons that led Mickey Mouse to become a national fad by the end of 1929. Originally in black and white, this cartoon was of the ten Mickey Mouse cartoons colorized by the Walt Disney Company in 1991.PAu001629050 / 1991-10-31 Plot The cartoon opens with Mickey piloting a 2-2-0 steam engine, ringing his bell and blowing the engine's whistle. As the engine and his coal tender back to collect a boxcar, the engine rests with Mickey, his railroad engineer, fuelling him, and feeding his engine with coal from the tender. As the engine eats too much coal and burps, Mickey decides to have some spaghetti, until Minnie comes along. After Mickey finishes his lunch, Minnie arrives with a violin that she can play, and hops onto the freight car. Minnie plays a musical song (Dvo≈ô√°k's Humoresque) while Mickey does the same. As Mickey looks at his watch, only to realize that they are late, he yells 'All aboard!' to the engine, which whistles in cheerful response after Mickey gets on board. The engine slowly starts out of the station and chuffs cheerfully through the beautiful countryside toward a hill and struggles up it. The engine ends having problems and starts to cry. The cartoon ends with Mickey pushing the boxcar so hard that it comes loose from the engine, runs into a cow, and explodes. In the final shot, Mickey and Minnie ride a handcar into the sunset.Walt Disney Treasures: Mickey Mouse in Black & White, Volume 2 DVD Review on DVDizzy Production Some of the gags in the cartoon are recycled from the 1927 Oswald the Lucky Rabbit short Trolley Troubles. This is the first cartoon in which Mickey says more than a couple of words, \\"this time in a voice that sounds like Walt's.\\" The soundtrack includes Mickey singing \\"I've Been Working on the Railroad\\" and playing part of Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k's Humoresques on his spaghetti. Minnie's ride on the train is set to the tune of \\"Dixie\\". The closing image of Mickey and Minnie operating a handcar inspired a famous toy version, manufactured by the Lionel Corporation. The toy company made so much money from this item and others like it that Mickey was known as \\"the mouse that saved Lionel.\\" Reception In Mickey's Movies: The Theatrical Films of Mickey Mouse, Gijs Grob writes, \\"The finale of Mickey's Choo-Choo is remarkably fast and full of action. Moreover, it's the first Disney cartoon to feature real dialogue. Most of the cartoon, however, has a remarkably slow pace, and even some awkwardly silent moments. There's hardly any plot and Mickey and Minnie's designs are inconsistent, ranging from sophisticated (with an extra facial line) to downright poor.

Her work engages relational practices rooted in sustained collaborations with groups or communities through social, theatrical and textual processes that often operate outside the studio/gallery environment. Her varied research- centric projects have taken her to military base, remote societies and institutional spaces that result in performances, films, videos, audio recordings and books, and involve provocative reflections of social, political, institutional and aesthetic power relations. Her recent projects involve an extended engagement with the sites of their production in order to trace broader social and ideological histories.  Biography  Althea Thauberger was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, in 1970. She currently lives and works in Vancouver, where she is an assistant professor in the Department of Art History, Visual Art and Theory at the University of British Columbia. Thauberger obtained her Bachelor of Fine Arts in Photography at Concordia University in 2000 and went on to complete her Master of Fine Arts at the University of Victoria in 2002. In 2009‚Äì2010, she studied at the European Graduate School as a PhD candidate. Before Thauberger's professorship at University of British Columbia, she had taught at Emily Carr University of Art and Design, Simon Fraser University, and University of Victoria as a sessional instructor, and was invited to teach at Akademie v√Ωtvarn√Ωch umƒïni v Praze (Academy of Fine Arts, Prague) as a guest professor, and at Concordia University as a visiting professor. In 2003, Thauberger was awarded a Vancouver Arts Development Award and was a regional finalist for the Sobey Art Award. She was also the recipient of British Columbia's most prestigious annual awards for the visual arts, VIVA award in 2011.  Major works  = Preuzmimo Benƒçiƒá (Take Back Benƒçiƒá) (2014) = Set against the highly complicated political and economic context of the former Yugoslavian state, on the site of Benƒçiƒá, the former worker-managed factory in Rijeka, the fifty- seven minutes experimental film is a socially engaged and layered documentation that offers an idiosyncratic approach to the investigation of the complexities of expressing labour, the revelation of boundaries and social class, and the exploration of alternative models of governance. Thauberger initiated the film as a framework for continuing a critical and generative dialogue about the multiple values of the factory, the restructuring of Rijeka's political economy, and the paradigms of cultural industries. She worked with sixty-seven local children performers who are divided into the roles of ‚Äúartists‚Äù or former workers who have been permitted to temporarily re-occupy the complex, and ‚Äúmayors‚Äù who discuss their own plans for its regeneration. By using children as her cast, Thauberger is able to conjure an inviting illusion of play whilst still encouraging scrutiny of the larger issues underlying the project and the potential socioeconomic failures related to creative regeneration. Preuzmimo Benƒçiƒá, is akin to 20th century forms of radical theatre, such as Bertolt Brecht‚Äôs Lehrst√ºcke or techniques within Augusto Boal‚Äôs Theatre of the Oppressed. In both forms, there is no division between the actors and the audience and play-acting is employed as an instructive process. Thauberger sees the explorations of the relations between work, art and play as the fundament of this project, and her experience of working with children as mutual empowerment process that invokes imagination, wonder and empathy. = Marat Sade Bohnice (2012) = Thauberger produced Marat Sade Bohnice in collaboration with Akanda, an experimental theatre company in Prague. The forty-seven minute film centres on the staging of the decommissioned waterworks and laundry facilities of Bohnice, another post- revolutionary institution and the largest psychiatric clinic in the Czech Republic. It consists of filmic documentation of the Bohnice psychiatric hospital performance as a reenactment of Peter Weiss‚Äô 1963 play Marat/Sade, as well as documentation of Thauberger's interviews with Bohnice patients and staff. As Thauberger brings various threads together‚Äîparticularly as she includes hospital staff and residents in the work‚Äîshe inserts a raw humanism into her deep-time inquiry of mental illness, pointedly linking Marat's revolutionary apprehension to growing contemporary cynicism about institutions. Marat Sade Bohnice approaches philosophical and art histories, questions art's agency and its role within therapy, as well as troubles the systems of human (un)freedom.

She was the first female law student at the University of Michigan, and to be admitted to the State Bar of Michigan, becoming the first woman to both graduate from law school and be admitted to the Bar of any state in the United States. Life Killgore Wertman was born in Jefferson, Clinton County, Indiana on March 1, 1843 to David and Elizabeth Killgore. Killgore's father was a prominent local attorney and encouraged his daughter's study of the law. Her religious upbringing led Killgore to attend seminary school, graduating from Ladoga Seminary in Ladoga, Indiana in 1862. She then worked for a number of years as a school teacher. She began studying law at Chicago University (now the University of Chicago) in 1869, and went on to study law at the University of Michigan Law School, becoming the first female law student in the School's history. Killgore Wertman graduated from the University with an LL.B. in March 1871. Later that year she was admitted to the Michigan State Bar.Michigan Bar Journal, Volume 63, No. 6 (June 1984). Reprinted here In 1875 she married Jackson S. Wertman, an attorney, and the pair moved to Indiana and opened a joint practice there. Under Indiana law, however, women were not eligible for admission to the bar, and so she handled the practice's real estate matters as well as office tasks, while her husband made court appearances. The couple had three children, Shields K., Helen M., and Clay (who died in infancy). In 1878, the couple moved to Ashland, Ohio and Killgore Wertman retired from law practice in order to raise the couple's children. In September 1893, she sat for and passed the Ohio bar examination. Once admitted to the Ohio bar, Killgore Wertman returned to her husband's law practice, specializing in real estate law. Killgore Wertman was also a lifelong member of the Equity Club, an organization of women lawyers based at the University of Michigan. Killgore Wertman and her husband later followed their children to Washington state, settling in Seattle, where she continued to reside until her death in 1935.

John Carter (born 1738, mysteriously disappeared, presumed dead, 1807) was nicknamed the \\"King of Prussia\\" in reference to his smuggling operations with some of his brothers, Harry Carter (1749-1809) and Charles Carter (?). John obtained the nickname because he was said to closely resemble Frederick the Great, the King of Prussia, and was said to much admire him, and gave his name to the cove, located east of Penzance. The BBC said of the brothers, \\"The Carters of Prussia Cove are among the most famous of all the Cornish smugglers.\\" By all accounts, despite his profession, John Carter was a devout Methodist and was noted for his honest dealing as a smuggler.

College Ruland, a native of Annapolis, Maryland, played high school basketball at Annapolis High School for four years before spending one postgraduate year at Fork Union Military Academy. He chose to attend JMU to play for the Dukes and was a 6'8\\", 240-pound center. He is credited with being a key player during what some consider JMU's greatest era of men's basketball, one in which they earned three straight trips to the NCAA Tournament and won each of their opening round games against traditionally national powerhouse basketball programs. During Ruland's collegiate career, he scored 1,255 points and grabbed 640 rebounds. He improved his season scoring averages each successive year: 5.9, 8.4, 12.7 and 15.1 points per game, respectively, for a career average of 10.1 points per game. James Madison won the ECAC South regular season title in 1982 and won the ECAC Tournament championships in 1981 and 1983. In each of his final three years, the Dukes qualified for the NCAA Tournament, where they won each of their first-round games against Georgetown (1981), Ohio State (1982) and West Virginia (1983), giving them a reputation as a \\"giant killer\\" during the postseason. In 1984‚Äì85, the ECAC South became what is now known as the Colonial Athletic Association, an NCAA Division I athletic conference, but the CAA considers its awards to be official dating back to the days of the ECAC South. Ruland was named the co-CAA Player of the Year with Carlos Yates of George Mason, which was the first-ever CAA Player of the Year honor in men's basketball. Through the 2017‚Äì18 season, it is still the only tie in the award's history. Professional and later life After college, Ruland was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers in the third round (70th overall) in the 1983 NBA Draft. He never played in the league, however, and spent the next eight years playing at various clubs in Europe, the United States' Continental Basketball Association and the United States Basketball League. Since 1991, he has worked regular jobs in his post-professional basketball life.

History of the Maquis This passage,This document was entrusted by Vital Bonato, a former member of the Maquis du Haut du Bois to be published on Wikipedia. No text today gives as much detail about the bravery and dedication of many young men, most of them hardly out of adolescence. completed by Colonel Pierre Aiguier of √âloyes, resulted in the collection of information on witnesses of that time and both published and unpublished documents. =First operations led at √âloyes= From February 1944, Hubert Hocquaux (23 years old), known as \\"Grizzli\\", organized the first meetings and formed a resistance group at √âloyes, whose were all very young. Weapons initially came from \\"cachettes\\" maintained since 1940. Some weapons recovery missions from German depots, stationary trains and from the Pouxeux barracks, or from the Kaiser (Wallach) factory allowed the equipment of part of the force. The group met at Idoux's place (the caf√© du Cin√©ma), Pierrat's place, the tinsmith, and in other places, particularly at the initiative of Pierre B√©del, head of the boys' school. Some met at Mrs. Mougel's place, who was known as Grande Yvonne and was the tenant proprietor at a caf√© at Arches. All answered \\"present\\" when the BBC radio from London broadcast the message \\"Croissez roseaux, bruissez feuillages, je porterai l'√©glantine\\" (Grow, you reeds, rustle, you leaves, I will bring the wild rose). =Creation of the maquis= On 24 July 1944, after a mission, two members of the French Forces of the Interior, Maurice Hocquaux and his aide, were arrested by French detectives. Thanks to much support, their freedom was obtained. The group built itself up and reached about thirty men through the addition of fighters from neighbouring villages. The Maquis d'√âloyes was created in Haut- du-Bois, in the commune of Xamontarupt, as part of the 2nd Vosges formation. Its first leader was Lieutenant Romann, a former policeman. The parachute drop location of l'Aclimont, just nearby, was approved by London under the codename \\"Roitelet\\". A tented camp with parachutes allowed men to be accommodated. Supplies were acquired from \\"collaborators\\" (or people presumed to be such). A baker in √âloyes provided bread, while the miller, Hocquaux, supplied dough. In such a time of want, this nonetheless allowed for a sufficient diet. While guards made sure of short-range defense, long-range protection was not adequate. The constant coming and going of many people and vehicles interfered with the secrecy of the operation, and discipline in general lacked rigor. Missions followed. An initial exchange took place at the Croix Bouquot, not far from the maquis, between an FFI patrol and a small German detachment whose members were staying in √âloyes. The leader gave the order to pull back because their weaponry was not sufficient. The first parachute drop took place at Arches on 2 August 1944. The code was \\"le ch√™ne\\" (oak) and the personal message was \\"Le coq mange des noisettes\\" (the rooster is eating hazelnuts). It was to arm √âpinal. On 26 August 1944, the maquis fighters of Haut du Bois received their own first parachute drop. It was containers with grenades, machine guns, machine pistols and rifles with the appropriate ammunition. The personal message was \\"Le soleil √† rendez-vous avec la lune\\" (the sun has a meeting with the moon), quoting the refrain of a popular song \\"Le Soleil et la Lune\\" by the famous French vocalist Charles Trenet. Three lights in a triangle and one sudden light on the right-hand side was the signal for the release of the parachute. On 28 August 1944, the thirty or so members of the maquis led by adjutant Munch carried out an ambush just before the Tendon falls. The aim was to rescue prisoners who were being transferred to Germany. After a few gunshots, the FFI were compelled to retreat due to the Germans' superior numbers. The only weapons deliveries were where the \\"Jedburghs\\" were parachuted under Operation Jedburgh. These last \\"Jeds\\" were groups of three men: A British liaison officer, a French officer and an English non- commissioned officer, charged with radio links. Parachuted from mid-August 1944, their missions were to support or coordinate and encourage FFI operations. It was in this fashion that a French-British mission composed of British Major Oliver Brown, French Captain Ren√© Karri√®re, and English radio Sergeant Schmich was parachuted in near Rambervillers. Hubert Hocquaux went to look for them on foot and led them through the woodland before leaving them secretly in the mill of his cousine Marcel Hocquaux on the evening of 31 August 1944. After the parachutists set up in Hocquaux' mill, Captain Karri√®re made immediate contact with the liberators. Thence he pursued his activities coordinating FFI operations and linking up with the Americans. Major Brown did the same from the farm where he had been hidden for several days. The third member of the team, Radio-Sergeant Schmith, was already with the Americans, at the house of Gustave Mathieu at Chaud C√¥t√©. At the times of the Maquis' attack he had gone to this place to pursue his duties of contacting London by radio in a more secure environment. While he was hidden in the house's attic, Germans, not knowing he was there, entered the farm to dump their supplies. Despite the danger, the Mathieu family took charge of helping him get away to the forest, all the time continuing to provide him with food. The resistance fighters acted from their various bases: the Hocquaux mill, Idoux's caf√© du Cin√©ma and Pierrat the tinsmiths put themselves immediately at the disposal of the liberators to serve as guides. During the night of 8‚Äì9 September 1944, a second parachute drop with the same code and personal message as the first, brought 150 grenades, 11 Sten automatic pistols, 9 rifles, 250 individual dressings and some clothing. This, however, was not enough to arm the whole FFI. More and more escapees from the Service du Travail Obligatoire were arriving from √âloyes and neighbouring communes; some were in fairly well-armed units such as the Golbey group and the \\"thirty\\" from the Val-d'Ajol. The operatives surpassed 300 men; the new head of the Maquis, Henri Perrin d'√âpinal, known as \\"Achille\\", decided to send home a certain number of them who had no weapons. Attack on the maquis For several days the maquis had known that an attack on the camp was imminent, through information that had come to them about German troop movements. However, on the morning of 9 September 1944, \\"Achille\\", head of the maquis, left the camp to make contact in Eloyes with Major Brown, head of the Franco-British mission. On arrival at the village, he was arrested by a German patrol, interrogated and held in the former post office building near the hospice. He was freed the same evening. Lieutenant Romann, head of the first \\"hundred\\" was likewise away from the maquis since he had left the camp beforehand with an overarmed group. Resistance members (\\"about a hundred\\") who had just received a second package of light weapons, were present on the maquis. In their leader's absence, Lieutenant Girod had taken command. For effective defence, he had a machine- gun set towards the north of the camp, and another above the Ruxelier stream gorge, to control the routes leading towards Chenim√©nil et Jarm√©nil. A third machine gun was hidden at the source of the Ruxelier. Similar positions were taken in the direction of Eloyes by Lieutenant Scheider, and towards the east by Lieutenant Gaillot. Meanwhile, Sub-lieutenant Villemin and adjudant Pierson ensured the evacuation of the remaining unarmed maquisards toward Purifaing in good order. At about 11 o'clock, Mrs Alexandre n√©e Hocquaux of Jarm√©nil went to the maquis to warn the fighters that the enemy was arriving. A German battalion manned by SS troops had been deploying since dawn in Eloyes, Chenim√©nil et Jarm√©nil. From these bases they were besieging the Haut-du-bois plateau with trucks and two troop transport tankettes. The attack began at midday in the Ruxelier gorge, which the Germans approached by crawling up each side. The fighting was fierce but clearly unequal, although a German tankette was destroyed. Lieutenant Girod stood in front of the defenses, and was hit by a bullet in the scapula, two in the calf, and by a grenade blast in the right thigh. His comrades evacuated, and he was later cared for at the hospital in Remiremont. The maquisards were obliged to fall back under German pressure and having sustained losses of dead and injured, but not before destroying the ammunition dump. The order of retreat given by adjudant Munch saved the life of many FFI fighters who managed to get away, with about 20 injured, towards the Fossard massif, getting through across the German block which was set up on the road leading to the Hocuaux mill at la Bisoire. They left behind 10 dead, namely Marcel Bolmont, √âmile Deschaseaux (Val d'Ajol), Paul Dufour (Eloyes), Andr√© Lacuve, Ren√© Legrand, C√©sar Remy, Alphonse Rost, Marcel Valentin (Archettes), Christian Lhoner (Remiremont) et Jean Schneider (Arches). At the same time, Paul Dufour's father, Louis Dufour, was shot at Jarm√©nil. In the afternoon, allied aircraft, who had been warned by the Franco-British liaison group's English radio sergeant, arrived at base in Saint-Dizier. In two passes to flush the trees in the direction of Eloyes- Jarm√©nil, they strafed the German troops, who sustained heavy losses, apparently over a hundred dead and two hundred wounded. After the attack, the thirty or so maquis fighters stayed together in a dedicated unit and continued their action. Part of this group fell at M√©nafaing. Other awaited the Americans on the banks of the Moselle or towards Dounoux and Xertigny. Many of the Haut-du-Bois fighters pursued the struggle in the French Army until the end of the war. On Saturday 23 September 1944, Eloyes was liberated by the 143rd regiment of the United States infantry, commanded by Colonel Paul D. Adams. The ambush at the Perrin farm On 25 September 1944 at midday, the US Army 143rd Infantry Regiment, whose units were finding themselves in difficulty from the direction of M√©nafaing, requested help trying to contain a German counter-attack. As a result of a misunderstanding, an officer from the 143rd who was in √âloyes asked an NCO of the maquis for FFI reinforcements. They were to plug a hole in the Fossard system with all available forces, judged to be about 20 men. A group of poorly trained and lightly armed resistance fighters was formed immediately. A GMC truck brought them towards the Fossard Massif via the Ch√™nes et la Suche road. The men dismounted from the truck at Chaud C√¥t√© in front of the Gustave Mathieu farm, and some among them asked the son of the house, Georges (22 years), to join them. Georges Mathieu had just returned from a long mission guiding Americans towards Tendon, and hoping to eat something first, declined. Without waiting for him, the fighters set off on the mission. Their march through the forest passed without difficulty. At a certain point, the group separated in two, with one team continuing through the forest along the brook, while the other aimed to make more rapid progress. For this group, the path took them out of cover, into the long sloping meadow which led to the Perrin farm in M√©nafaing. A German machine gun squad, which had moved in recently after the partial and temporary retreat of an American unit, had the opportunity to observe the group approach at their leisure. The Perrin family, whose cellar was being occupied, was composed of the mother, Louise, and some children including the 10-year-old Jean-Marie. A neighbour, Mrs. Ancel n√©e Thomas was with them. Lucien Perrin was in the Mathieu farm at Chaud C√¥t√©. Unsuspectingly, the maquis passed by the farm. At the moment when they were about to reach the edge of the wood through a hollow and re-enter cover, they were mowed down in a hail of machine gun bullets at point-blank range. Some were killed on the spot, while others who were wounded were subsequently finished off with a pistol shot to the neck. One man alone, Jules Hingray, despite being hit, managed to escape the killing by hiding behind a rock and feigning death. He stayed there for 24 hours without aid. Learning that the patrol was in difficulty, the Americans gave a barrage of covering fire allowing them to fall back, although not to recover the dead and injured. A shell set fire to the hangar of the farm. The other team managed to shelter from enemy fire. Seven FFI were killed in all: Maurice Nurdin, Marcel Bichotte (of Arches), Raymond Varoy (of Pouxeux), Andr√© Bosselmeyer, Louis Trinquart, Robert Cipollini and Ernest Pierre (of Eloyes). One of the victims, le FFI fighter Robert Cippollini aged 34, was the uncle of Colonel Pierre Aiguier- Cipollini. The Germans passed the night in the farm, and evacuated the following morning. By the end of the afternoon of 26 September, calm had returned, and civilians overheard the cries of Hingray, who had been hit in the legs. He was transported to the house in a wheelbarrow. Lucien Perrin, who had returned to his farm, drove Hingray in a cow truck towards Mathieu's farm at Chaud C√¥t√©, where he received care from a US Army medic before being evacuated to hospital. The FFI agents were warned and Perrain took on the task of bringing down the bloodied corpses to Eloyes through heavy rain on his plate carriage, drawn by two oxen. The municipality set up a chapelle ardente at the mairie, where the comrades of the seven dead watched over their remains. In the midst of the confusion which reigned, the dead were put in their bier along with their equipment and with ammunition in their magazines. On Friday 28 September 1944 at 10am, Father Gerrard, the curate of Eloyes, celebrated a funeral service in the village church, with significant attendance. It was a long and very emotional ceremony. Members of the American Staff and numerous FFI were present, with their head Ren√© Matz (\\"Commandant Didier\\"), the departmental FFI leader. Lieutenant Romann, first head of the Eloyes maquis, gave the deceased a vibrant elegy. The next day, the 29 September, Lieutenant Romann was killed in a car incident at \\"Trou Vauthier\\" in unclear circumstances. On Monday 2 October 1944, a ceremony took place at the church for the dead of the maquis du Haut-du-Bois and others who were shot at Jarm√©nil. A detachment of FFI gave the honours. People present included Mr. Parisot, prefect of Vosges, the gendarmerie captain Gonsard de Remiremont, Lieutenant Fleurot, and Commandant Didier. Regarding those shot at Jarm√©nil, the wife of Haut-du-Bois fighter Maurice Grosdemange from Archettes indicated that four men died there the same day. Mr Grosdemange would have cleaned the faces of his comrades at the age of 20.  Resistance operations  A distribution network for clandestine tracts was put in place by Miss Marie Joseph Blaise, a student at the Nancy who lived at Saint-√âtienne-l√®s- Remiremont. Blaise had made contact with the resistance to ensure that circulation of these papers in St-√âtienne-l√®s-Remiremont. The various Maquis des Vosges paid a heavy price in the fight against the Germans and their allies. The seven men of the shooting at M√©nafaing on 23 September 1944 in the √âloyes, were also members of the Maquis du Haut-du-Bois. An annual commemoration is planned each year; in 2008 the event took place on Sunday September 21. Remiremont and √âpinal were liberated on 23 and 24 September 1944, followed by Saint-√âtienne-l√®s-Remiremont on 25 September, by the United States Seventh Army.

It features a cruciform plan, gothic arched windows and a turreted bell tower. The stone for the Gothic Revival structure was quarried near Stockett. It is Great Falls' largest church. The former church building was remodeled for a parochial school. The current rectory was built in 1931 and designed in a style similar to the cathedral. The old church was demolished and the Heisey Youth Center built on the site in 1936. It is also used as a parish center. The cathedral was extensively renovated in 1953 in anticipation of the diocese's Golden Jubilee the following year. Pope John Paul II renamed the Great Falls Diocese as the Diocese of Great Falls-Billings on February 14, 1980.

While his vocals were anything but luscious, Bromberg's deep, growl-like singing made every word heartfelt. Showing the depths of his songwriting with four self-composed tunes...

It is Grade II* listed on the National Heritage List for England. In addition to the main house, the boundary wall, summerhouse and the gates and piers to the hall are all separately Grade II listed. and stands immediately to the south of the parish church. An earlier wooden manor house may have been on the same site or nearby. The earliest parts of the present building are the tower with its battlements and the dining room with its oak ceiling. The hall has a collar beam roof. At the house's north-east corner is a polygonal stair turret, and the chimneys of the west wing rise higher than the battlements of the main tower. The local landowner John Payne acquired Hutton, amongst several other local manors, and by 1466 had established it as his primary residence. He died in 1496, passing it on to his son Thomas Payne and his descendants. By 1604 Nicholas Payne was in financial difficulties, and John Still, bishop of Bath and Wells, purchased the manor of Hutton and the residence of Hutton Court. His son Nathaniel Still built the western part of the court. On his death in 1626 the estate included the Court, two gardens, of meadow, of pasture and of other land. It passed via the marriage of Nathaniel's daughter Anne to the Codrington family. William Codrington (died 1728), a descendant of Nathaniel Still, lived at Hutton Court. In 1730 the house was bought by Humphrey Brent, a Bristol lawyer, and was passed on in the Brent family until 1837 when it was sold to Henry Adolphus Septimus Payne. By 1848 the house had been let to Edward Bowles Fripp, and in 1849 it was substantially altered by Samuel Charles Fripp, a Bristol architect. The next owner was Edward Bisdee (1802‚Äì1870), a native of Oldmixon near Hutton who had made a fortune in Tasmania. He held the house and manor from the 1850s until his death, when he left them to his brother Alfred Henry Bisdee (1819‚Äì1898).Ida McAulay, Bisdee, Edward (1802‚Äì1870) in Australian Dictionary of Biography online. Retrieved 19 September 2011 He in turn passed Hutton Court on to his son Thomas Gamaliel Bisdee (1852‚Äì1933). It was then left to Thomas Edward Bisdee DSO, MC, (1888-1934), recently retired from the regular army, who was killed in a riding accident in April 1934. Due to incurring two lots of death duties within one year, the family could not afford to keep the Property and so in 1935 the house and contents were sold by auction, when the house was bought by a Captain Stamp. In 1948 it was sold again to a Captain G. W. Gwynne, who owned it until the 1950s, when it was sold to the Palmer family who lived there until the late 1970s. Hutton Court then became a hotel, but in the 1990s a new owner returned it to use as a private residence. It has now been subdivided into two or three separate residences.

In May 2015, it moved to Dakar, at the Place du Souvenir Africain et de la Diaspora (Corniche Ouest). A project conceived in 1987 by the filmmaker Ousmane William Mbaye, it was opened in 1994 under the direction of Annette Mbaye d'Erneville. Collections There were two levels within this colonial residence, built in 1777 during the French colonial period, having belonged to a wealthy signare, Victoria Albis. Until 1962, it was the property of the Angrand family, notably Armand-Pierre Angrand, a descendant of the signare, writer, a mayor of Gor√©e and the first mayor of colour of Dakar in 1936. Museum exhibits include common objects from the colonial period, farming tools, musical instruments, pottery, basketry, as well as photographs allowing a better understanding of the daily life of women in the country. The prominent figures of Senegalese women's emancipation are celebrated, for example the novelist Aminata Sow Fall. The building was also previously a courthouse, then the Museum of the Institut fondamental d'Afrique noire which was succeeded in 1966 by Institut Fran√ßais d'Afrique Noire. Activities The former home of Victoria Albis. Workshops were organized there and women of the island gather there to work together, to follow literacy courses, or to receive artisanal training (cloth dyeing, batik, weaving, glass painting, or traditional embroidery). Specific projects are aimed at disabled women. Other facilities The museum has a number of facilities in addition to the artifact displays. It includes an audiovisual room; a boutique; a garden cafe, and an \\"Espace Culturel et Artisanat\\" (cultural and artisan space) enabling groups of women from all regions and ethnic backgrounds of Senegal to work at the museum and demonstrate their wide knowledge to visitors.

Heidegger suggested the work relates to the unwritten \\"second half\\" of his 1927 magnum opus Being and Time. The work is also notable for a discussion of the Presocratics and for illustrating Heidegger's supposed \\"Kehre,\\" or turn in thought beginning in the 1930s‚Äîas well as for its mention of the \\"inner greatness\\" of Nazism. Background and publication history Introduction to Metaphysics, originally a summer lecture course at the University of Freiburg in 1935, was published eighteen years later by the Max Niemeyer Verlag (Halle, Germany), simultaneously with the Seventh German Edition of Being and Time. This post-war edition of Being and Time included a one-page preface in which Heidegger wrote that the newly available Introduction to Metaphysics, would \\"elucidate\\" material contemplated for the once-promised but long-abandoned \\"second half\\" of Being and Time. The preface also noted that the text of this latest B&T; edition had eliminated several references to itself as a \\"first half.\\" Being and Time, Author's Preface to the Seventh German Edition.See also, Emily J. Hughes' review of \\"Division III of Heidegger‚Äôs Being and Time. The Unanswered question of Being\\", in Phenomenological Review. Hughes writes that \\"As some of the essays in this collection note, Heidegger directs us to two quite different texts to help us better understand the (incomplete) project of Being and Time: the Basic Problems of Phenomenology and the Introduction to Metaphysics.\\" https://doi.org/10.19079/pr.2016.5.hug The work is included in Volume 40 (1983) of Heidegger's Gesamtausgabe (collected works) edited by Petra Jaeger. Among English translations, the second edition (2014) of a version by Gregory Fried and Richard Polt from Yale Press (New Haven) was in print as of 2020. Ralph Manheim produced a 1959 translation praised by Fried and Polt in their acknowledgements as \\"largely responsible for introducing Heidegger to the English-speaking world.\\" But Manheim worked prior to the 1962 Macquarrie version of Being and Time‚Äîwhich established several conventions for Heidegger's English translators. Presocratic Revivalism Introduction to Metaphysics \\"was not about early Greek thought, and yet the Presocratics are at the pivotal center of discussion,\\" writes W. Julian Korab-Karpowicz. In this view, \\"the thinking of Heraclitus and Parmenides, which lies at the origin of philosophy, was falsified and misinterpreted\\" by Plato and Aristotle, thus tainting all of subsequent Western philosophy.W. Julian Korab- Karpowicz, The Presocratics in the Thought of Martin Heidegger (Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang, 2016), page 58. Heidegger aimed to correct this misunderstanding (Charles Guignon 2014) by reviving Presocratic notions of 'being' with an emphasis on \\"understanding the way beings show up in (and as) an unfolding happening or event.\\" Guignon adds that \\"we might call this alternative outlook 'event ontology.'\\"Guignon \\"Being as Appearing\\" in \\"A companion to Heidegger's Introduction to Metaphysics,\\" page 36 ( The concept of Ereignis, or \\"event,\\" is more fully developed in Contributions to Philosophy 1938.) https://www.beyng.com Heidegger used his discussion of Heraclitus' and Parmenides' respective notions of logos in his argument that to avoid nihilism, modern philosophy must \\"reinvert\\" the traditional, post- Socratic conception of the relationship between being and thinking, according to Daniel Dahlstrom.Dahlstrom, \\"The Scattered Logos,\\" in \\"A Companion to Heidegger's Introduction To Metaphysics\\" page 92 The psychologist/philosopher Miles Groth characterized \\"Heidegger's readings of Heraclitus and Parmenides\\" as \\"famously idiosyncratic\\" and labeled as \\"challenging\\" what Groth called Heidegger's suggestion that the two Presocratics \\"fundamentally agree.\\" Being and the 'Kehre' Further information: Kehre In a significant contrast with Being and Time eight years earlier, Heidegger's Introduction to Metaphysics \\"no longer places the inquiry into the Being of Dasein at the center of his work,\\" Instead, the author \\"looks to language as the site of a meaning of Being.\\" according to Brian Bard's 1993 essay titled \\"Heidegger's Reading of Heraclitus.\\" The work \\"clearly shows the shift\\" in Heidegger's thought, Bard writes.Brian Bard, 1993, essay, see sections one and three https://sites.google.com/site/heideggerheraclitus/ The book is typically seen as the first instance of Heidegger's much-discussed Kehre, or turn in thinking, that became evident from the 1930s onward, writes Thomas Sheehan. But this supposed change is \\"far less dramatic than usually suggested,\\" according to Sheehan, and merely entailed a shift in focus and method.Thomas Sheehan, \\"Kehre and Ereignis, a proglenoma to Introduction to Metaphysics\\" in \\"A companion to Heidegger's Introduction to Metaphysics\\" page 15, 2001, Separately, Mark Wrathall argued (2011) that the Kehre itself is a complete misconception on the part of interpreters, while pointing to Heidegger's supposed consistency of purpose throughout his career.Wrathall, Mark: Heidegger and Unconcealment: Truth, Language, and History, Cambridge University Press, 2011 (Both Sheehan and Wrathall, separately, assert that Heidegger's central focus was never on \\"Being.\\" Wrathall wrote that Heidegger's elaborate concept of \\"unconcealment\\" was his central, life-long focus, while Sheehan proposed that the philosopher's prime focus was on that which \\"brings about being as a givenness of entities.\\") Wrathall, Mark: Heidegger and Unconcealment: Truth, Language, and History, Cambridge University Press, 2011see also, Sheehan, \\"Making sense of Heidegger. A paradigm shift.\\" New Heidegger Research. London (England) 2015. Heidegger wrote separately from this work that metaphysics grounds an age by providing \\"the basis upon which it is essentially formed.\\" These metaphysical questions‚Äîand the manner of their asking‚Äîare thus proposed as relevant to the disclosure or \\"unconcealment\\" of Dasein, with the larger aim of restoring \\"the historical Dasein ... back to the power of Being that is to be opened up originally\\". Politics Gregory Fried and Richard Polt praised the work for \\"the range and depth of its thought as well as for its intricate and nuanced style\\", arguing that it deserved its status as the successor to Being and Time. Regarding its mention of National Socialism, they write that, ‚ÄúInterpreters differ widely, and often acrimoniously, on whether Heidegger‚Äôs Nazism was due to a personal character defect‚Äù or whether the philosophy itself reflects a fascist outlook. Heidegger refers in the work to the \\"inner truth and greatness of the movement,\\" but adds a qualifying statement in parentheses: \\"(namely, the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity).\\" The qualification wasn't in the original lecture, although Heidegger falsely claimed otherwise. Moreover, the controversial page of the 1935 manuscript is missing from the Heidegger Archives in Marbach. See also J. Habermas, \\"Martin Heidegger: on the publication of the lectures of 1935\\", in Richard Wolin, ed., The Heidegger Controversy (MIT Press, 1993). The controversial page of the 1935 manuscript is missing from the Heidegger Archives in Marbach; however, Habermas's scholarship leaves little doubt about the original wording. Heidegger defended the \\"inner greatness\\" comment in a 1966 interview with Der Spiegel (posthumously published 1976), claiming it was intended to mislead Nazi informants who observed his lectures. Heidegger asserted that dedicated students would understand that the comment wasn't a celebration of Nazism.McGrath, S. J., Heidegger: A (Very) Critical Introduction (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2008), p. 92. Heidegger's former student Jurgen Habermas appeared highly critical of the \\"inner greatness\\" statement, writing in a 1953 review of the published work in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that \\"it's time to think with Heidegger against Heidegger.\\"Theodore Kisiel \\"Heidegger's Philosophical Geopolitics\\" \\"Companion to IM\\" page 239 Although Julian Young claims (1998) that the book is \\"widely considered fascist in character,\\" this characterization is false according to Young, who writes that the work implicitly condemns Nazism for its racism, militarism and attempted destruction of civil society. The work has also been seen as being critical of Nazism for being insufficiently radical and suffering from the same spiritual impoverishment as the Soviet Union and the United States.

Fielding IAF Flight Academy aircraft, it flew the Boeing-Stearman Kaydet during the 1956 Suez Crisis and the Fouga Magister during the 1967 Six-Day War, in the course of which it suffered six fatalities. Between 1978 and 1986 it flew the A-4 Skyhawk.  Formation  In January 1953 the IAF formed the flight academy's fleet of Stearmans into a reserve liaison and surveillance unit, to be activated in times of emergency. Seconded to 100 Squadron, the unit was initially designated 1000 Squadron, but was redesignated 147 Squadron on January 1, 1955. It was activated on October 27, 1956, for the Suez Crisis. Commanded by Captain Meir Shefer, the unit had 25 serviceable aircraft but only 12 pilots, consisting of both reserves and qualified students and including Rina Levinson, one of a handful of female pilots serving with the IAF. 147 Squadron flew 401 sorties during the war, clocking 233 hours. Flying from Ramla, next to IAF headquarters, the squadron flew communications, liaison, transport, patrol and reconnaissance missions, operating during both day and night.Norton 2004, p. 145 Once the fighting was over, the aircraft reverted to their original training role and the squadron was deactivated.  Six-Day War  The Fouga Magister entered service with the IAF Flight Academy in 1960, and on November 1, 1961, 147 Squadron was reformed to operate the type during emergencies. The squadron was reactivated at Hatzerim in May 1967, on the eve of the Six-Day War. Commanded by Major Arieh Ben-Or, there were 44 aircraft and 42 pilots on hand on the morning of June 5, when Israel launched Operation Focus, the strike that started the war. While the Fougas were initially slated to participate in attacks on the Egyptian air bases at El Arish and Jabl Libni, their light armament and lack of effective combat range led to their reassignment to the deception, interdiction and close air support roles.Shalom 2003, pp. 109, 119 Thus, while the majority of IAF combat aircraft were en route to their respective targets in Egypt and the Sinai, 147 Squadron Fougas took to the air flying seemingly routine training missions and generating seemingly routine radio traffic to give the impression that Israel was on a low state of alert. Other Fougas, however, were making their way to attack Egyptian troop concentrations along the front in support of the Israeli push into the Sinai.Shalom 2003, p. 182 The first strikes targeted a pair of Egyptian radar stations near El-Arish, during which the squadron suffered its first fatality of the war, deputy squadron leader Arnon Livnat. With the IAF's combat squadrons occupied by Focus, 147 Squadron's Fougas were effectively the only attack aircraft available to provide support for IDF ground forces. They subsequently attacked Egyptian artillery in the northern Sinai, convoys, supply trains and troop concentrations. 147 Squadron was also active on other fronts, and late on June 5 the Fougas went into action against the Jordanians in the West Bank. Several aircraft struck Jordanian artillery that had been shelling various points in Israel, tanks operating in the Jenin region were attacked as well, while the squadron also managed to halt a Jordanian armored brigade attempting to intervene in the heavy fighting under way in Jerusalem. Three further aircraft and their pilots were lost. 147 Squadron returned to the West Bank on the morning of June 6, flying 104 sorties and firing over 1200 rockets at Jordanian targets throughout the region. One aircraft was lost and its pilot killed by the time the squadron was ordered to stand down during the latter half of the day. Having flown an average of 5 sorties on June 5, 147 Squadron pilots flew an average of 3 on June 6. Operations on the Jordanian front resumed the following day, during which Iraqi reinforcements were attacked, but on June 8 the squadron was informed that its role in the fighting had come to an end. Fighting on the Golan Heights, however, prompted a change of heart, and on the morning of June 9 147 Squadron deployed to Ramat David. The first formation to head into action over the Golan, led by squadron leader Ben-Or, encountered heavy Syrian anti-aircraft fire. Ben-Or was killed and further Fouga missions were promptly canceled. The squadron claimed 128 tanks destroyed during the war, 43 other armored vehicles, 292 lorries, 2 trains, 47 artillery pieces, and 4 anti-aircraft guns. 419 sorties had been flown and 4,384 rockets expended, including Egyptian stocks captured at the air base at El Arish. Slow, lightly armed, lacking both defensive armor and ejection seats, six Magisters and their pilots had been lost, including both the squadron leader and his deputy. Virtually every single aircraft suffered battle damage. The end of the war led to the deactivation of the squadron and the Fouga Magisters were henceforth restricted to the training role.Shalom 2003, p. 248  Flying the A-4 Skyhawk  147 Squadron A-4 Skyhawk at the Israeli Air Force Museum, Hatzerim 147 Squadron was reactivated once again at Hatzerim on August 6, 1978, commanded by Hanoch Patishi. Operating a mix of A-4Es, A-4Fs and A-4Ns, it was the IAF's eighth and last A-4 Skyhawk squadron. Initially conceived as a unit manned by reservists with a skeleton crew of air force regulars, this arrangement was soon found unsatisfactory by both groups and the squadron reverted to the usual IAF combination of regulars, emergency postings and reserves. It adopted an emblem depicting a ram with wings against a yellow background, an all-yellow rudder and yellow-tipped external fuel tanks.Norton 2004, p. 226 The squadron flew its first operational mission on April 24, 1979, when four aircraft struck Palestinian artillery north of Tyre. In subsequent years the squadron routinely took part in IAF operations in Lebanon, as fighting intensified in that country. In 1981 it was transformed into a reserve squadron, maintained by a small cadre of air force regulars, and was finally disbanded in 1986, its A-4Ns passing to 102 Squadron.Norton 2004, p. 224  References  = Notes = = Bibliography =   External links  * IAF Flying Ibex Squadron at the A-4 Skyhawk Association website Category:Israeli Air Force squadrons Category:Six-Day War ","title":"147 Squadron (Israel)"},{"id":"33119197","text":"Administrative offices The National University of the West (, UNO) is an Argentine national university, situated in San Antonio de Padua, Merlo Partido, Buenos Aires Province.

P. Koirala in December 1960. Under his direct rule King Mahendra introduced the four tired structure‚Äîvillage, town, district and national Panchayat‚Äîon the basis of limited elected executive committee. Mahendra consolidated power by institutionalizing and invoking the three pillars of national identity‚ÄîHindu religion, Nepali language and Monarchy‚Äîas a foundation of everyday social and religious life. Moreover, the system propagated the idea of Ek Raja, Ek Bhesh, Ek Bhasa, Ek Desh (One King, One Dress, One Language, One Nation). Background In 1960, King Mahendra used his emergency powers and took charge for the betterment of the State once again claiming that the Congress government had fostered corruption, promoted party above national interest, failed to maintain law and order and \\"encouraged anti-national elements\\". Political parties were outlawed and all prominent political figures, including the Prime Minister, were put behind bars. Civil liberties were curtailed and press freedom muzzled. King Mahendra, then, through an \\"exercise of the sovereign power and prerogatives inherent in us\\" promulgated a new constitution in December 1959 introducing a party-less Panchayat system. The political system (Panchayat System) was a party-less \\"guided\\" democracy in which the people could elect their representatives, while real power remained in the hands of the monarch. Dissenters were called anti-national elements. The Panchayat System was formulated by King Mahendra after overthrowing the first democratically elected government and dissolving the parliament in 1960. On December 26, 1961, King Mahendra appointed a council of five ministers to help run the administration. Several weeks later, political parties were declared illegal. At first, the Nepali Congress leadership propounded a non- violent struggle against the new order and formed alliances with several political parties, including the Gorkha Parishad and the United Democratic Party. Early in 1961, however, the king set up a committee of four officials from the Central Secretariat to recommend changes in the constitution that would abolish political parties and substitute a \\"National Guidance\\" system based on local panchayat led directly by the king. Adopted on the second anniversary of the dissolution of the government, the new constitution of December 16, 1962, created a four-tier panchayat system. At the local level, there were 4,000 village assemblies (gaun sabha) electing nine members of the village panchayat, who in turn elected a mayor (sabhapati). Each village panchayat sent a member to sit on one of 75 districts (zilla) panchayat, representing from 40 to 70 villages; one-third of the members of these assemblies were chosen by the town panchayat. Members of the district panchayat elected representatives to fourteen zone assemblies (anchal sabha), functioning as electoral colleges for the National Panchayat, or Rastriya Panchayat, in Kathmandu. In addition, there were class organizations at village, district, and zonal levels for peasants, youth, women, elders, laborers, and ex-soldiers, who elected their own representatives to assemblies. The National Panchayat of about 90 members could not criticize the royal government, debate the principles of party-less democracy, introduce budgetary bills without royal approval, or enact bills without approval of the king. Mahendra was supreme commander of the armed forces, appointed (and had the power to remove) members of the Supreme Court, appointed the Public Service Commission to oversee the civil service, and could change any judicial decision or amend the constitution at any time. Within a span of ten years, the king had, in effect, reclaimed the sovereign power exercised by Prithvi Narayan Shah in the eighteenth century. King Mahendra in 1967 The first elections to the National Panchayat took place in March-April 1963. Although political parties officially were banned and the major opposition parties publicly refused to participate, about one-third of the members of the legislature were associated with the Nepali Congress. Support of the king by the army and the government bureaucracy prevented opposition to his rule from developing within the panchayat system. Real power came from the king's secretariat, and in the countryside influence rested in the offices of zonal commissioners and their official staffs or the parallel system of development officers. Founded on the idea of having a system \\"suitable to the soil\\" by King Mahendra, the Panchayat polity was marked by a party-less system that emphasized decentralization while class coordination was to be implemented \\"only through active and dynamic leadership of the crown\\". Mahendra dismissed the first ever democratically elected government of BP Koirala and the Panchayat polity‚Äôs legacy has had a lasting impact on Nepal‚Äôs history. The Panchayat equated nationalism with the Nepali language, Daura-Suruwal and Hindu religion. It led an aggressive campaign to mold a Nepali identity along these lines. However, the institutions and policies of Panchayat were riddled with contradictions. Reforms during Panchayat Regime Under the direct leadership of the king, the government implemented some of the major projects that were initiated under the previous regime and oversaw further steps toward the development of the country. Land reforms led to the confiscation of large Rana estates. Rajya reform abolished special privileges of some aristocratic elites in western Nepal. A new legal code promulgated in 1963 replaced the Muluki Ain of 1854. A major land reform program launched in 1964 essentially was a failure. The new panchayat system managed to bring 50,000 to 60,000 people into a single system of representative government in a way that had been rendered impossible for the elite-based political parties. Nepal was able to carry out its second plan (1962-65) and third plan (1965-70), and to begin the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1970-75). Eradication of malaria, construction of the Mahendra Highway, or East-West Highway, along the southern foot of the hills, and land settlement programs contributed to a massive movement of population from the hills into the Terai, resulting in a large increase in the area devoted to agriculture. Amendments to the 1962 Panchayat Constitution Back to the Village National Campaign (2023 B.S.), the first amendment to the 1962 Constitution, was one of the major rural development efforts of the Panchayat system to be launched in 1967. Later Politics For Development was another amendment that aimed at developing Nepal during the Panchayat Era(26 Mangsir ,2032 B.S.) which also made \\"Back to Village National Campaign\\" a constitutional organ. End of Panchayat Regime There was resentment against the authoritarian regime and the curbs on the freedom of the political parties. There was widespread feeling of the Palace being non-representative of the masses, especially when the Marich Man Singh government faced political scandals on charges of misappropriation of funds allotted for the victims of the earthquake in August 1991 or when it reshuffled the Cabinet instead of investigating the deaths of the people in a stampede in the national sports complex in a hailstorm. Also the souring of the India-Nepal trade relations affected the popularity of the Singh government. In April 1987, Nepal had introduced the work permit for Indian workers in three of its districts, and in early 1989, Nepal provided 40% duty concession to Chinese goods and later withdrew duty concessions from Indian goods in such a manner that the Chinese goods became cheaper than the Indian goods. This led to the souring of relations which were already strained over the purchase of Chinese arms by Nepal in 1988. India refused to renew two separate Treaties of Trade and Transit and insisted on a single treaty dealing with the two issues, which was not acceptable to Nepal. A deadlock ensued and the Treaties of Trade and Transit expired on March 23, 1989. The brunt of the closure of the trade and transit points was mainly faced by the lower classes in Nepal due to the restricted supply of consumer goods and petroleum products like petrol, aviation fuel and kerosene. The industries suffered because of their dependence on India for resources, trade and transit. The Government of Nepal tried to deal with the situation by depending on foreign aid from the US, UK, Australia and China. However, the government's strategy to manage the crisis could not satisfy those people who desired negotiations with India rather than dependence on foreign aid as a solution. Taking advantage of the uneasiness amongst some people against the government and the strained India-Nepal relations, the Nepali Congress (NC) and the left-wing parties blamed the government for perpetuating the crisis and not taking any serious measures to solve it. In December 1989, the NC tried to utilize B.P. Koirala's anniversary by launching a people's awareness program. The left-wing alliance known as the United Left Front (ULF) extended its support to the NC in its campaign for a party system. On January 18-19, 1990, the NC held a conference in which leaders from various countries and members of the foreign Press were invited. Leaders from India attended the conference; Germany, Japan, Spain, Finland supported the movement; and the Embassies of the USA and West Germany were present on the occasion. Inspired by the international support and the democratic movements occurring throughout the world after the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1989, the NC and the ULF launched a mass movement on February 18 to end the Panchayat regime, and the installation of an interim government represented by various parties and people. On April 6, the Marich Man Singh government was dismissed and Lokendra Bahadur Chand became the Prime Minister on the same day. However, the agitating mob was not satisfied with the change of government as they were not against the Singh government per se but against the party-less system. The people became violent and a few people were killed in an encounter with the Army. On April 16, the Chand government was also dismissed and a Royal Proclamation was issued the next day which dissolved the National Panchayat, the Panchayat policy and the evaluation committee and the class organizations. Instead, the proclamation declared \\"functioning of the political parties\\" and maintained that \\"all political parties will always keep the national interest uppermost in organizing themselves according to their political ideology.\\"  References  Category:Politics of Nepal ","title":"Panchayat (Nepal)"},{"id":"33119209","text":"Brian Eddie (born c. 1952) is a Scottish former footballer who played as a defender best known for his time with Dundee United in the early 1970s where he made only three appearances with his debut coming against Celtic at Tannadice on 10 March 1973 in the Scottish First Division.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat;=19730310&id;=POI9AAAAIBAJ&sjid;=VkgMAAAAIBAJ&pg;=3121,2107784 Eddie then went on to play for Stevenage Town.http://www.neilbrown.newcastlefans.com/dundeeutd/dundeeutd.html References Category:1950s births Category:Living people Category:Scottish footballers Category:Dundee United F.C. players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Stevenage Town F.C. players Category:Whitburn Junior F.C. players Category:Association football defenders ","title":"Brian Eddie"},{"id":"33119214","text":"Bj√∂rn Karlsson (born January 7, 1989) is a Swedish professional ice hockey defenceman.Eliteprospects.com - V√§xj√∂ Lakers References External links * Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Swedish ice hockey defencemen Category:V√§xj√∂ Lakers players ","title":"Bj√∂rn Karlsson"},{"id":"33119222","text":"Zababa-≈°uma-iddinaWritten as mdZa-ba4-ba4-MU-A≈†. was the 35th and penultimate king of the Kassite or 3rd dynasty of Babylon, who reigned for just one year,Kinglist A, column 2, line 14. ca. 1158 BC (short chronology). He was without apparent ties to the royal family and there is uncertainty concerning the circumstances of his coming to power. Biography =Ascendancy= A late Assyrian tablet provides a prophetic narrative and suggests it was his predecessor Marduk-apla-iddina I, who did indeed reign for 13 years, and who was overthrown by the Elamites, perhaps combining the two sequential reigns into a single individual: =Invasions by Assyria and Elam= His short unhappy reign was subjected to invasions on two different fronts. One of these was where Assyrian forces under the leadership of A≈°≈°ur-dan I annexed the region lying between the Lower Zab and the Adhaim, or Al Uzaym River, seizing control of Zaban, Irriya and Urgarsallu, and carrying off much plunder.The Synchronistic Chronicle (ABC 21), K 4401a +, tablet B, column 2, lines 10 to 12. His lack of connection to the previous royal family into which the Elamite rulers had intermarried for several generations led Kudur-Nahhunte, king of Elam, and whose father, Shutruk-Nahhunte, was married to the thirty-third Babylonian king Meli-≈†ipak‚Äôs eldest daughter, to believe his claim to the throne of Babylon was more legitimate. A Neo-Babylonian copy of a literary text which takes the form of a letter, now located in the Vorderasiatisches Museum in Berlin, is addressed to the Kassite court by an Elamite King, thought to be Kudur-Nahhunte, Note 58. and details the genealogy of the Elamite royalty of this period. He casts aspersions on their choice of king and then declares: There are some concerns over the authenticity of this ‚Äúletter‚Äù as it makes a derogatory reference to a later king, Nabu-apla-iddina, ca. 888 ‚Äì 855 BC. It may, however, preserve some traditions of the period. Kudur-Nahhunte led an assault on northern Babylonia which resulted in the end of Zababa-≈°uma-iddina‚Äôs reign. The event is described in a late Babylonian poetic textTablet K. 2660. purporting to be narrated by a later king, possibly Nab√ª-kudurrƒ´-u·π£ur I. He left his inscriptions on many of the trophies he collected for display in the temples of Susa, each with its boastful addendum, to confirm it was he who had conquered Babylonia. A fragment of an Elemite stele describes crossing the river Ulai and seizing seven hundred towns. Another fragment lists the northern cities that had been overthrown including Dur-Kurigalzu, Sippar, Opis, perhaps Akkad and Eshnunna.

Baisigou Square Pagoda (Chinese ) was a brick pagoda in Helan County, Ningxia, China, built during the early years of the Western Xia dynasty (1038‚Äì1227), circa 1075‚Äì1076. It is situated in an isolated location about 10 km into the Baisigou Valley on the eastern side of the Helan Mountains, northwest of Yinchuan, but may have been the site of an important Buddhist temple during the Western Xia. The pagoda was illegally destroyed in 1990; archaeological investigation of the ruins has uncovered a large number of Tangut artefacts and Buddhist relics, including books and manuscripts written in the Tangut language and script. Investigation of the ruins of the pagoda On 28 November 1990 a local peasant discovered that the pagoda had suddenly collapsed, and when the Ningxia police investigated they discovered that the pagoda had been blown up by unknown criminals, apparently with the intention of stealing any historical relics inside the pagoda. The pagoda was reduced to rubble, with only a fragment of the northwest corner left intact. Local archaeologist Niu Dasheng (ÁâõÈÅîÁîü) (b. 1933), who worked at the Ningxia Museum, thought that there may be cultural relics at the pagoda, or even an underground chamber like the one found at Famen Temple after its pagoda semi- collapsed in 1981, therefore he organised an expedition to carry out an archaeological investigation of the site and to clear the rubble. In addition to archaeologists, his team included two police officers who were investigating the crime, and twenty or so soldiers from a unit of the People's Liberation Army who were to help move the rubble. In August 1991, after receiving permission from the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, Niu's team headed off to the site of the ruined pagoda, which was several hours from the nearest road, and could only be reached by foot, with donkeys carrying their equipment. The team lived in caves near the pagoda for the duration of the expedition, but there was no source of drinkable water nearby, and so bottled water had to be transported in by donkey. Front cover of a volume of the Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union On the sixth day the team uncovered a large number of historical artefacts dating to the Western Xia period (1038‚Äì1227), including: * coins; * wooden knives; * pieces of silk cloth; * woodblock Buddhist prints; * miniature moulded clay sculptures of stupas; * a bag containing Buddhist relics and fragments of bone; * miniature moulded clay sculptures of Buddhas (over 5,000 pieces); * a handwritten scroll 5.74 m in length written in cursive Tangut characters; * more than thirty printed books and manuscripts in both Chinese and Tangut; * wooden tablets inscribed in ink with Tangut characters (datable to the period 1102‚Äì1114). These objects were all concentrated in an area about 2 m in diameter, underneath about 1 m of rubble in the centre of the ruins, and were mixed in with earth, branches, bird carcasses and bird skeletons. The archaeologists determined that the artefacts had been housed in chambers occupying the tenth and twelfth stories of the pagoda, and that as these chambers had an opening to the outside on the south side they had thus been used as a roost for birds. The books and manuscripts comprised both religious texts (Buddhist sutras) and secular texts, including the first known collection of Chinese poetry written by Tangut poets. The most important text discovered was a printed edition in nine volumes of a previously unknown Tangut translation of a Tibetan Tantric Buddhist text and commentaries entitled the Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union, which has been identified as being the earliest known example of a book printed using wooden movable type. Construction of the pagoda Wooden central supporting pillar (cut into sections) from the Square Pagoda After excavating the base of the pagoda, archaeologists were able to determine that the pagoda was built during the Western Xia dynasty, during the reign of Emperor Huizong (reigned 1067‚Äì1086), not during the Ming dynasty as was previously thought. The primary evidence for the date of construction of the pagoda comes from an ink inscription in Chinese on a section of the central supporting pillar made of pine wood which was discovered in the ruins (there is also an ink inscription in Tangut, but that is largely illegible). The Chinese ink inscription is dated the 5th month of the cyclical year yinmao ÂØÖÂçØ in the 2nd year of the Da'an era (1076). Yinmao is not a valid cyclical date, and is thought to be a mistake for yimao ‰πôÂçØ, however yimao corresponds to the first year of the Da'an era (1075). Therefore, it is thought that the pagoda must have been constructed in 1075‚Äì1076. A wooden tablet with ink inscriptions in Tangut on both sides records repairs made to the pagoda during the reign of Emperor Chongzong (reigned 1086‚Äì1139) between the 13th and 23rd days of the 5th month of the 13th year of the Zhenguan era, i.e. 27 June to 7 July 1113 in the Julian calendar. Excavation of the pagoda base indicated that the pagoda was originally thirteen stories in height, not eleven as it had previously appeared to be, as the lowest two stories had been covered up by mudslides over the centuries. There was also no specially built foundation platform underneath the pagoda, as is usually the case, but it was built on a foundation of broken stones. The pagoda was solid inside, with a wooden central supporting pillar that was grounded in a depression 1.4 m in circumference and 2.1 m deep at the bottom of the pagoda. Although the pagoda was solid, there were small, square rooms built into the third, tenth and twelfth stories, with windows on the south side. Matching false windows were built into the south side of all the other stories. Investigation of the surrounding area showed that there was a large Western Xia site to the west of the pagoda, from which archaeologists recovered pieces of tile ends, roof sculptures, and guttering, some of which was glazed in green or blue. As the Laws of the Western Xia specify that red, green and blue glazed tiles are only permitted for use in temples or palaces, these remains are thought to come from a Buddhist temple associated with the pagoda. Although the pagoda is now in a very isolated location, the mouth of Baisigou Valley is guarded by two Western Xia pagodas, and there are a large number of Western Xia sites with broken pottery, bricks and tiles all along the valley leading up the square pagoda, and so Niu Dasheng has suggested that the temple and pagoda at Baisigou were an important religious site during the Western Xia. The name Baisigou (ÊãúÂØ∫Ê≤ü) means \\"Valley of the temple\\" in Chinese. There are no known historical records of the pagoda, but Niu speculates that this was the site of the Temple of Five Platforms Mountain (Wutaishan Si ‰∫îÂè∞Â±±ÂØ∫), named after the famous Buddhist mountain, Wutaishan, in Shanxi.

Training includes course based curriculum at vocational technical training centers and apprenticeship at private or public organizations. Higher education in vocational fields could be archived though several universities. The National Vocational Qualifications Systems in Sri Lanka (NVQSL) provides a structured seven levels of qualifications from Level 1 to Level 7. Vocational education and training is carried out for degree level at the Open University, Sri Lanka and the University of Vocational Technology, as well as at diploma level at 37 technical colleges, Institute of Engineering Technology, Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technological Education and the Sri Lanka School of Agriculture. History The beginnings of modern higher education in Ceylon commenced in 1870 with the establishment of the Ceylon Medical School, followed by Colombo Law College (1875), School of Agriculture (1884) and the Government Technical College (1893). The origins of the modern university system in Sri Lanka dates back to 1921 when a University college, the Ceylon University College was established at the former premises of Royal College Colombo, and was affiliated with the University of London. The college provided courses of study in art and humanities, science and medicine prepared undergraduates for examination at the University of London. In 1942 the first university was established in the country was the University of Ceylon which had several campuses island wide, Colombo (established 1942), Peradeniya (established 1949), Vidyodaya (established 1959), Vidyalankara (established 1959) and Katubedda (established 1972). Vidyodaya and Vidayalankara were established under the Vidyodaya and Vidayalankara University Act No 45 of 1958. The University of Ceylon was modelled on the Oxbridge formula, at its inception the university only accommodated 904 students, which later expanded to cover a number of universities and it remained as an elite-oriented university as stated by Sir Ivor Jennings, catering to a small number of students and exclusively residential. It was dissolved in 1972 to establish the University of Sri Lanka. In 1974 the Jaffna campus was added to the University of Sri Lanka. The change of the government in July 1977 led to dismantling of the single university apparatus with the plan of establishing independent universities. With the promulgation of the Universities Act. No 16 of 1978, state university status was restored to the six separate campuses. The University Grants Commission (UGC) was also created to plan and coordinate the state university education. After that, a number of state universities were created. All these state universities are registered under the University Grants Commission, but a few come under the auspices of ministries other than the Ministry of Higher Education, in which the UGC is a part of. Most of the state universities depend on funds given by the University Grants Commission, as it is their primary and sometimes only source of funding. Therefore, the UGC has a direct control over these universities and administer the undergraduate intake. The UGC is subordinate to the Ministry of Higher Education. Legislation Universities in the Sri Lanka have generally been instituted by Special Presidential Decree, University Orders, Acts of Parliament and the Higher Education Act 1978. =Ordinance= *Ceylon University Ordinance No.20 of 1942 =Acts of Parliament= *Ceylon University (Amendment) Act No.36 1956 *Vidyodaya University and Vidyakara University Act No.45 of 1958 *Higher Education Act No.20 of 1960 *University of Ceylon Act No.01 of 1972 *Universities Act No.16 of 1978 (this Act established the University Grant Commission and a University Service Appeals Board provided for the administration of universities with their campuses and outset the six campuses of the single University of Sri Lanka, the set up under the previous Act No.1 of 1972, were converted to six independent universities on 1 January 1979) Admission process Undergraduate education in state universities is free but entrance is extremely competitive, limited and standardized. Fewer than 16% (less than 16,000 students) of those who qualify get admission to state universities and of that only half graduate.Undergraduate statistics 2000-2007 Admission to the university system is based on the highly competitive GCE Advanced Level examination. Selection of students is done on the basis of rank order on average Z Scores obtained by candidates at the GCE Advanced Level to replicate a district basis representation. Only the top students from each district get admissions, as appose to their overall island rank. Funding All state universities are funded through the government and undergraduate education is free in these universities.

As a result, many students who are not granted admission find other means of higher education. =Graduate unemployment= Sri Lanka has a large number of unemployed graduates numbering 43,000 in 2017.

But with the emergence of JVP-backed student unions such as IUSF, ragging has served primarily to ensure the continuing domination of JVP political power within the universities, academics suggest with several student death associated to it. =Academic standards= The academic standards of Sri Lankan universities have been questioned as they fare extremely low in international rankings with the University of the Colombo ranked 801 in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings and 8 in South Asia.Sri Lanka Universities of international standards to attract foreign students References Sri Lanka ","title":"Higher education in Sri Lanka"},{"id":"33119356","text":"The Bully Police Squad is an organization with a purpose of educating parents, teachers and children of all ages about bullying and its effects on the world.

(DHS Club) is an American company based in Englewood, Florida. It was formed and incorporated in June 1997 by its founder and CEO, Richard Burke. The DHS Club is a multi-business operation that consists of the ClubShop Mall (online shopping), Glocal Income (affiliate marketing), Glocal Generation (personalized networking), DHS Club Kids (non- profit organization), Ducks Nest Retreat (cabin rentals) and ClubShop Rewards (customer loyalty reward program).  History  The DHS Club was founded in 1997 by Richard Burke, in an apartment over his garage. Soon after, the DHS Club started hiring employees and moved into a small office in Englewood, Florida. To establish a membership base, Burke recruited his oldest son Will Burke and his friend Paul Spence to become DHS Club independent sales representatives (VIP Members). The incentive to become a DHS Club VIP Member was to create a residual income by recruiting others to become DHS Club VIP Members and to save money on the products and services the DHS Club had to offer. One of the first main products the DHS Club had to offer at a discount was the Web TV. By 2000 the DHS Club had created an online shopping mall for their DHS Club Members that rewarded their members back with cash back rebates. ClubShop Mall online stores included Best Buy, Wal-Mart, Amazon and Dell. By 2001, The DHS Club had over 1 million people join the DHS Club's online shopping mall and affiliate marketing programme. In 2002, The DHS Club launched, ClubBucks Rewards, an offline shopping rewards program with participating merchants, so that members could get discounts and loyalty points. The DHS Club also purchased around of land in Southeast Tennessee and created a corporate retreat property and cabin rental property. In December 2006, the DHS Club and ClubShop Mall were featured on the American television show, The World's Greatest. By the end of 2007, ClubShop Malls were opened in the Netherlands Antilles, Malaysia and Suriname. = From DHS Club to Clubshop = In 2009 all business operations were unified under the Clubshop brand. Outside America, the Club was particularly booming in Italy, France, Netherlands, Belgium. The members base kept growing up to nine million members. Thousands of online and offline stores in the five continents became Clubshop Rewards Merchant Affiliates. In 2018 the Clubshop brand was acquired by Proprofit Worldwide Ltd. Proprofit is a marketing company founded in 2013 by Fabrizio Perotti and Giuseppe Francavilla, the Clubshop Executive Directors who successfully developed the DHS-Club and Clubshop brands in Italy from 2001 to 2012. Since 2018 Clubshop, started a process of profound renovation in every aspect of its business, aimed at gradually recreating the full operation and prosperity that the Club had in the first decade of the 2000s.  Controversy  In the early 2000s, DHS Club policy allowed DHS Club VIP members to sign up people for free to become DHS Club members. With this policy making it so easy to sign up new members, a few DHS Club VIP Members took advantage of the policy by signing people up to be DHS Club members without their consent. As a result, the DHS Club was put on many blacklists by spam prevention groups such as Spamhaus to prevent the DHS Club from sending email and DHS Club revenues dropped 70%. A Spamhaus spokesman said that spam played a major role in the club's success. In 2002, the DHS Club created a policy against spamming, and instituted a double opt-in process for all membership requests, to prevent anyone from being registered as a DHS Club member without expressly confirming their membership request.

Biography Varadarajan's father, Seshadri, was an Inspector of Schools in the Department of Education. He was transferred to Madras and there the medium of instruction was generally English. After his high school studies, Varadarajan joined Intermediate for two years at Loyola College, Madras where he was taught mathematics by K.A. Adivarahan, a very strict disciplinarian who made a strong impression on Varadarajan. Varadarajan received his undergraduate degree in 1957 from Presidency College, Madras and his doctorate in 1960 from the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta, under the supervision of C. R. Raohttps://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=36691. He was one of the \\"famous four\\" at the Indian Statistical Institute during 1956-1963 (the others being R. Ranga Rao, K. R. Parthasarathy, and S. R. Srinivasa Varadhan). In 1960, after his doctorate, Varadarajan went to Princeton University as a post-doctoral fellow and in the Fall of 1960 he went to the University of Washington, Seattle where he spent the academic year, followed by a year at the Courant Institute at NYU, after which he returned to the Indian Statistical Institute in 1962. He joined the Department of Mathematics at UCLA in 1965. Varadarajan was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study during the periods September 1968 until December 1968 and January 1976 until June 1976 https://www.ias.edu/scholars/veeravalli-s-varadarajan.

Contributions Varadarajan's early work, including his doctoral thesis, was in the area of probability theory. He then moved into representation theory where he has done some of his best known work. In the 1980s, he wrote a series of papers with Donald Babbitt on the theory of differential equations with irregular singularities. His latest work has been in supersymmetry. He introduced Kostant‚ÄìParthasarathy‚ÄìRanga Rao‚ÄìVaradarajan determinants along with Bertram Kostant, K. R. Parthasarathy and R. Ranga Rao in 1967, the Trombi‚ÄìVaradarajan theorem in 1972 and the Enright‚ÄìVaradarajan modules in 1975. Recognition He was awarded the Onsager Medal in 1998 for his work. He was recognized along with 23 Indian and Indian American members \\"who have made outstanding contributions to the creation, exposition advancement, communication, and utilization of mathematics\\" by the Fellows of the American Mathematical Society program in 1 November 2012.

Students of land management are prepared to work in local governments in the fields of real estate management and turnover, spatial planning, property counselling and expertise. Research on application of global satellite navigation systems, improving methods of acquiring, gathering and processing geodetic and satellite data and their use in special information systems as well as optimizing methods of space management are only a few examples of scientific fields of interest of the faculty employees. History The idea of creating a Geodetic Department is owed to the representatives of the Olsztyn geodetic institutions. Their initiative met with the support of the authorities of the University of Agriculture and the recognition and assistance of the regional authorities. This resulted in the creation of the Professional Study of Geodesy of Agricultural Equipment on October 1, 1960. The first recruitment of candidates for geodesy and agricultural engineering was held in 1960. Next, it was decided to acquire the necessary scientific and didactic staff for the Study. Thanks to the help of the Faculty of Geodesy and Cartography of Warsaw University of Technology the first researchers began their work. On December 3, 1967, the Department of Geodesy of Agricultural Equipment (WGUR) was renamed to the Department of Geodesy and Agricultural Equipment. On November 26, 1971, the Faculty obtained the first doctoral degree in scientific sciences and a PhD in agricultural sciences. October 1, 1972, with the transformation of the University of Agriculture in Olsztyn in the Agricultural and Technical Academy in Olsztyn, the Space Flight Planetarium was opened. On 11 September 1978, the Satellite Observatory in Lamk√≥wko, near Barczewo and the Astronomical Observatory in Olsztyn were opened. On July 1, 1989, the Faculty was granted the title of doctoral degree in geodesy and cartography. On September 1, 1992, the last name of the Faculty was changed to the Department of Geodesy and Spatial Management. On October 1, 1997, the spatial planning program was launched, and a year later the IT department, which was moved to the newly established Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science in 2001. On September 1, 1999, after the merger of three higher education institutions into the University of Warmia and Mazury, the Faculty was incorporated into its structure. On 1 January 2015 the name of the unit was changed to the Department of Geodesy, Spatial Engineering and Construction, and the Faculty took over from the Faculty of Technical Sciences education in the fields of construction.

To date it contains three species found in Madagascar and Comoros. Species *Eutetramorium mocquerysi Emery 1899 ‚Äì Madagascar *Eutetramorium monticellii Emery 1899 ‚Äì Comoros *Eutetramorium parvum Bolton & Fisher, 2014 ‚Äì Madagascar Description The queen is extremely ergatoid in E. mocquerysi, alate in E. monticellii. In E. parvum a normal dealate queen is present in the type- series, but there is also a specimen that may be an ergatoid or a worker-queen intercaste, or possibly merely an oversized worker. Males are known only for E. mocquerysi, where it is smaller than conspecific workers. Taxonomy This small genus was established by Emery (1899) for two conspicuous, large, darkly coloured Madagascan species that superficially resemble Tetramorium. Initially, Emery (1912, 1914) was of the opinion that the genus was referable to the tribe Myrmecinini, but Ashmead (1905) and Wheeler (1910) had already referred it to Tetramoriini, an opinion that Emery (1915, 1924) also came to accept. Bolton (1976) excluded Eutetramorium from Tetramoriini on morphological grounds, and tentatively transferred it to Myrmicini. This placement persisted until recently, when a molecular analysis of Myrmicini by Jansen & Savolainen (2010) showed that the monophyly of the tribe was dubious, and that Eutetramorium formed a clade with Huberia. The yet unpublished, more detailed, DNA analysis of Myrmicinae by Philip S. Ward has established that Eutetramorium belongs in a strongly supported, endemic Madagascan clade that also includes the other four genera: Malagidris, Myrmisaraka, Royidris and Vitsika.

He currently lives and works in Kyoto. He graduated from the Faculty of Arts and Design at Osaka Seikei University, where he learned and matured his craft in both Japanese painting. Since his first solo exhibition \\"Beautiful Thing\\" in Kyoto in 2006, he has been expressing his love and devotion for nature and townships primarily through his unique and striking black and white paintings. He has also participated in several high profile and successful solo and group exhibitions throughout Japan in recent years. Artwork By studying on his own, Syoh Yoshida pursued the expression of ink painting. Starting at the age of 20, he focused his efforts on flower paintings, using sumi-ink and gofun- chalk on eginu-silk. In cooperation with those who were qualified in the Kyoto Hyogu traditional craftsmenship, he tailored his works on the hanging scrolls and folding screens that had been arranged in a modern way, based on the concept of \\"Hyogu suited to modern architecture\\", while maintaining the classical Japanese mounting style. Being in prominent collections, his works have attracted the attention of numerous collectors, both at home and abroad. As a result, he has been engaged in a wide range of activities as a creator, participating solo exhibitions and group exhibitions both at home and abroad, with Kyoto as his base, as well as participating in all kinds of design projects that took advantage of his inherent design sensibilities. In recent years, in collaboration with long-established traditional artisans, such as those specializing in kimono, Kyoto lacquerware and Kyoto fans, whose art had been revered for many centuries, he created yukata (a casual summer kimono), lacquerware and fans that featured his original design. Having also attracted avid attention by the works which he had achieved in cooperation with the Grand Master Potter of tea ceremony utensils and the Grand Master of flower arrangement whose art had continued for centuries in Kyoto, he has been extremely active as a young ink painter and a man of culture who represented Kyoto.

Career Den Constitutionelle, its first edition from 1 February 1836 Dahl started working for Gyldendalske Boghandel in Copenhagen from he was 15 years old. In 1829 he moved to Christiania (now Oslo) Norway to help with J√∏rgen Wright Cappelen's new bookstore. In 1832 he established his own bookstore in Christiania, which came to be an important meeting place for the literary and cultural elite in the 1830s and 1840s. He also established a publishing house. Among his published books were Amtmandens D√∏ttre by Camilla Collett, Synn√∏ve Solbakken by Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson, and Kongs-Emnerne by Henrik Ibsen. A controversy occurred in 1836, when Dahl published Andreas Munch's poetry collection Ephemerer. The police demanded that the book should be censored before its publication, while Dahl, in opposition to censorship, refused. The case eventually ended in a victory for Dahl in the Supreme Court. Dahl founded the newspaper Den Constitutionelle in 1836, with assistance from Ulrik Anton Motzfeldt and Carl Andreas Fougstad. He was a co-founder of the art gallery and art society Christiania Kunstforening (now Oslo Kunstforening) in 1836, along with Johan Sebastian Welhaven, Frederik Stang and Henrik Heftye. Dahl is immortalized through Henrik Wergeland's farce Papeg√∏ien (The Parrot) from 1835, where his course of life forms the basis for a wild parody. When Dahl learned about the farce, he offered to publish the book, something Wergeland found amusing and agreed to. But as a revenge Dahl put a label on the title page of the book, without Wergeland's knowledge, where it said that the complete profit was to be donated to charity.

With a population of about 7,520 (2011 Census). This village falls under an administration of the Southern District Council which is headquartered in Kanye. History Molapowabojang is just shy of its 100th year, found in 1914. The village is 'Multi-cultural' as it has people from all over Botswana but has most of its inhabitants are from the Southern District/Ngwaketse District. It is believed that the Matabele tribe once inhabited the place and used it as a harbor during the Mzilikazi Kingdom. This is evidenced by the foot prints and butt prints that are visible in some rocks of Motsenekatse Hill and the name Motsenekatse has also been derived from \\"Mzilikazi\\". Geography Molapowabojang is built along the river, hence the name Molapowabojang which means \\"Rivergrass\\". This river runs almost around the village and it is believed that it used to supply the village with fresh water before they had clean drinking water supply. There are also several hills in the village, Motsenekatse which is the largest, Chichi Hill, Ntomalome and several other smaller hills. Education Molapowabojang has two Primary schools, the oldest being Molapowabojang and Pitsonyane being the newer primary, about 14 years old. In addition to these primary schools, there is a Community Junior Secondary School, Chichi Hill, named after the hill due to its proximity to the hill. Chichi Hill CJSS caters for both primary schools in Molapowabojang as well as other surrounding villages like Kgomokasitwa, Maisane, etc. Shopping and entertainment Bashanka Enterprises is one of the oldest Lucky 7 stores in Molapowabojang, followed by Moonyana, Ga Bushi, Square Deal and Value Stores \\"Choppies\\". There is a lot of night entertainment which includes bars and a Recreational Prak, Molapowabojang RecPark which sees a lot of local musicians as well as South African musicians every year. The RecPark is one of the well known entertainment centers across Botswana among the night crawlers, especially the youth. Developments Molapowabojang residents have been struggling with their water supply, they could go for days without water as they were being supplied by the water trucks which had to fill up the supply tank. Recently Molapowabojang water supply has been connected to the Lobatse pipe lines to provide a steady water supply for the village. There is also a Geographical Survey (GS) building just opposite Bashanka Enterprises which has its headquarters in Lobatse. There is also a newly built motel in the village, just close to the RecPark. The motel serves both the local residents as well as tourists and other people coming from outside the village either passing by or staying for entertainment purposes.

GXG Markets utilised its parent company's, GXG Global Exchange Group's proprietary electronic trading platform, GXG Tellus. The GXG Markets had two kinds of members: Corporate Advisors and Broker Dealers. A Corporate Advisor was responsible for listing firms on the Market, while an official (regulated) Broker Dealer could set up trading accounts, trade and clear shares or debt of the exchange on the MTF and Regulated Markets.  Market Identifier Codes  GXGR (GXG Official List - \\"Regulated Market\\"), GXGM (GXG Main Quote - \\"MTF\\"), GXGF (GXG Fist Quote - \\"OTC\\"). According to ISO10383 and ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority).  Background  GXG Markets was originally established in 1998 as Dansk Autoriseret Markedsplads. The company was the first to be approved by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority to operate an authorized marketplace. In August 2010, the company was acquired by Swedish GXG Global Exchange Group. By 2011 Swedish GXG Global Exchange Group was running short of funds, and the regulatory working capital of GXG Markets was removed by owner Michael Rosenberg and used to buy out the initial shareholders. At the end of 2011 Rosenberg sold the group to a new group of investors ‚Äì Per and Olle Setterberg, and Carl-Henrik Sellman. They retained Group Chairman Carl-Johan Hogbom and CEO Peter Almberg, who continued to the date of closure but had no executive control. They pushed for new listings to be made and GXG listings grew from 12 (Sept. 2012) to 100+ by mid 2014. Initial growth came from companies moving from other markets where regulations were being tightened. Many companies listed were from outside the EU. In 2013, the UK's HMRC added both the GXG Official List and GXG Main Quote markets to the list of designated recognised stock exchanges. Its business model was based on providing a listing venue which had a very low cost when considering the total fee stack (ie, the total of exchange fees and adviser fees). As the market was designed for professional investors, it could achieved this by reducing the reporting burden on companies planning to list on the market when compared to similar EU markets. As only professional investors were allowed to trade on the market, they would be able to make their own decisions on the companies without needing additional reporting like, for example, expensive independent reports on working capital to justify the Directors' assertions of having sufficient working capital. As such, the GXG was of interest to: * very small companies who could not afford the costs of more well known markets * international companies with no effective local stock exchange * early stage companies that did not have the history or could not provide the information required on other markets * or speculative companies and their brokers and advisers. It is this last group that were most problematic for the GXG. Much of the promotion of its listing services was done from its London office which operated under the EU's financial services passporting arrangements which were in force during the UK's membership of the EU. The GXG market was particularly attractive in London where the total listing cost on GXG might be less than a third when compared to established UK markets like AIM or what was then known as Plus Market. While trading volumes on AIM or PLUS were potentially higher, there was little difference between GXG and the very bottom end of the UK markets. As such, the GXG offering represented a potentially serious competitive threat to UK junior markets and the revenue of the adviser network of NOMADS/sponsors, lawyers and accountants. This created tension between the Danish and UK regulatory authorities. The advantages that GXG's different approach to operating a market might offer when compared to the traditional London markets and the UK regulator's views was little understood and poorly articulated by GXG. This was further acerbated by weaknesses in the GXG's internal compliance screening of listing candidates, the low quality of some of the advisers they approved as sponsoring agents, and the rapid growth of the market. This resulted in the quality of companies listed by the GXG market being heavily criticised without regard to it being a market only for professionals. Over time, the GXG strengthened its listing requirements following the pattern of \\"lawyering up\\" seen in the UK markets under pressure from UK regulatory authorities via the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority. These steps included forcing all already listed companies to undertake further due diligence reporting or face delisting. While poor management and weak execution appear to be largely to blame, the exact role of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the demise of the GXG has not be fully explained. A Freedom of Information request for information held by the UK's FCA was turned down. The role that the Danish regulator played in its demise has also not been publicly examined and in particularly its ability to regulate a market offering services to small companies from non-EU jurisdictions and the role of fringe international financial advisers.  Leadership  GXG Markets was chaired by Carl Johan Hogbom, formerly the CEO of the OMX Stockholm Exchange, now known under the name Nasdaq Nordic. The CEO was Peter Almberg.  GXG Official Broker Dealers  * GXG Brokers  GXG Corporate Advisors  * Corporate Advisors  Closure, Allegations of Poor Management & Claims for Losses  In May 2015 the Danish Financial Services Authority raised serious questions about the operations of the GXG. They stated \\"that GXG repeatedly and grossly neglected and disregarded its own rules and internal guidelines. As a consequence of this neglect, GXG exposed itself and the market to the exact same risk elements that the very same rules are intended to manage and mitigate. Against this backdrop, Finanstilsynet assesses that GXG has failed to operate its regulated market and multilateral trading facilities in an adequate and appropriate manner. Such operation is irreconcilable with continuation of the company's licences and therefore, Finanstilsynet assesses that the company's licenses should be withdrawn.\\" As a result, despite attempts to find a new regulator, on 29 June 2015 GXG announced that it would cease all new listings. On 6 July it announced that it had decided to close with last trading on the market on August 18. On 22 July 2015 the Channel Islands Securities Exchange (CISE) Chairman, Jon Moulton, announced that it had made an offer for the market. Shortly after it announced on 31 July that it would not proceed following due diligence . GXG Markets officially closed on August 18, 2015 at 1 p.m. 17.00 CET. At least one group has filed legal claims against GXG and its Chairman, Carl Johan Hogbom alleging billions of Euros in fraud were facilitated by GXG and direct losses of ‚Ç¨50 million. * Lawsuit for ‚Ç¨50 million * Finanstilsynet (the Danish FSA)Statement on GXG  See also  *London Stock Exchange *Alternative Investment Market *Markets in Financial Instruments Directive  References  Category:Financial services companies of Denmark Category:Stock exchanges in Europe ","title":"GXG Markets"},{"id":"33120371","text":"Mikhail Lyubich (born 25 February 1959 in Kharkiv, Ukraine) is a mathematician who made important contributions to the fields of holomorphic dynamics and chaos theory.

Important Bird Areas factsheet: Phillip Island. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2011-09-17. Birds The site has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports over 1% of the world populations of little penguins (with up to 26,000 birds), short-tailed shearwaters (up to 450,000 pairs) and Pacific gulls (with an estimated 52-490 birds). In the past it was occasionally visited by small numbers of orange-bellied parrots. One of the largest breeding colonies of crested terns in Victoria (2800 pairs) is at the Nobbies. Pied and sooty oystercatchers, as well as hooded plovers, use the beaches. = Little penguin colony = The colony's population has fluctuated over time with changes in land use and tourism practises evolving. A 1918 count estimated 200,000 birds. By 1987 the population had plummeted to 20,000. In 1940, the population was believed to have dropped from approximately 2000 birds to 200 rapidly due to a disease or pathogen, though these figures are inconsistent with the scientific literature. In 2011 the colony was estimated to contain up to 26,000 birds. An early detailed account of a visit to the colony was written by Donald Macdonald and published in The Argus in 1902. The high public profile of the colony has assisted conservation efforts; as has its economic value as a tourist attraction. In 1987, more international visitors witness the penguins coming ashore at Phillip Island than visited Uluru. In the financial year 1985-86, 350,000 people saw the event, and at that time audience numbers were growing 12% annually. Seals Seal Rocks has the second largest colony in the world of Australian fur seals, with some 20,000-25,000 seals (25-30% of the global population) breeding or hauling-out there.

In 1884 von Miller acquired Karneid Castle, a 13th-century Tyrolean castle near the town of Bolzano, from his sister-in-law Ida, who had inherited it from her father Carl Mayer von Mayerfels. Miller embarked on an extensive restoration project, making the structure habitable again after 200 years of neglect. After being expropriated after the 1st & 2nd World Wars, the property is today owned by Miller's direct descendants. In 1892 he was made a member of the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art. In 1912 he was made an honorary citizen of the city of Munich, and was promoted to Bavarian Freiherr (Baron) on 22 June 1912 in Berchtesgaden.Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels (German), Adelslexikon Band IX, Band 116 der Gesamtreihe, C.

The article discusses seven phases of investigations by the Met and several investigations of the Met itself, including critiques and responses regarding the Met's performance. Separate articles provide an overview of the scandal and a comprehensive set of reference lists with detailed background information. By 2002, the practice by news media organizations of using private investigators (\\"law enforcement\\") to acquire confidential information was widespread. Some individuals used illegal methods to accomplish this. Victims of illegal phone hacking included celebrities, politicians, law enforcement officials, solicitors, and ordinary citizens. As this illegal activity became apparent, suspects were arrested and some were convicted of crimes. Some victims retained solicitors upon learning their privacy had been violated, and filed suit against news media companies and their agents. Some victims received financial payments for violation of privacy. Successful suits and publicity from investigative news articles led to further disclosures, including the names of more victims, more documentary evidence of wrongdoing, admissions of wrongdoing by some news media agents, and payments potentially related to the scandal. Allegations were made of poor judgement and cover-up by news media executives and law enforcement officials. As a result, additional investigations into illegal acquisition of confidential information were initiated and several senior executives and police officials were forced to resign. There were also significant commercial consequences of the scandal. Contemporary commentators made comparisons with the Watergate scandal. The Metropolitan Police conducted several investigations between 1999 and 2011. The first three investigations, involving phone taps and seizure of records, successfully gathered large quantities of evidence that confidential information was being acquired illegally, sometimes with the help of public officials including policemen. By 2006, seven men had been found guilty, but no further arrests were made until 2011. The Met was criticized for not aggressively pursuing all the significant leads available from this evidence, for not adequately informing all individuals who were victims of the phone hacking, and for allegedly misleading the public and Parliament about the scope of the problem. While continuing to investigate illegal acquisition of confidential information, the Met itself became the object of several investigations about the diligence of its probes and possible involvement of its own personnel in illegal activities. After the scope of the phone hacking scandal became generally known in July 2011, the top two officials of the Met resigned. The new Met leadership augmented the ongoing investigations with the unusual measure of bringing in an independent police organization to help. By mid-July 2011, there were as many as ten separate investigations active at the Met, Parliament and other government agencies. Investigations by the Metropolitan Police more than 90 arrests. =Operation Nigeria (1999)= From at least the 1990s, private investigator Jonathan Rees reportedly bought information from former and serving police officers, customs officers, a VAT inspector, bank employees, burglars, and from blaggers who would telephone the Inland Revenue, the Driving & Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), banks and phone companies, deceiving them into providing confidential information. He then sold that information to News of the World, the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and the Sunday Times. News of the World alone paid Rees more than ¬£150,000 a year. In response, and because Rees was also suspected in the 1987 murder of his former partner, the Met's anti-corruption squad CIB3 ran Operation Nigeria. It involved tapping Rees' phone at his agency, Southern Investigations, from April to September 1999 to obtain evidence about the murder and about whether confidential information was being acquired illegally by police and/or reporters. Recorded telephone conversations revealed that Alex Marunchak of News of the World was a regular customer of the agency. It was determined that Rees was purchasing information from improper sources, but no evidence became public that Marunchak or other journalists had committed criminal offences or that they were aware of how Rees acquired the information. The bugging operation ended when it was learned that Rees was planning to plant drugs on a woman so that her husband, Rees' client, could win custody of their child. Rees and others whose voices were recorded during Operation Nigeria (including Austin Warnes, Duncan Hanrahan, Martin King, Tom Kingston, Sid Fillery) were successfully prosecuted and sentenced to jail for various offenses unrelated to illegal acquisition of confidential information. Rees and another private investigator, Sid Fillery, who later became Rees' partner at Southern Investigations, were under suspicion for the 1987 murder of Daniel Morgan, yet another private investigator and Rees' partner at the time of his murder. Morgan's family claimed Morgan was planning an article to expose police corruption. One of the Met's officers investigating the murder charges, Detective Chief Superintendent David Cook, was warned by Surrey Police and Scotland Yard that he may have become a surveillance target of Sid Fillery. Fillery reportedly used his relationship with Alex Marunchak to arrange for Glenn Mulcaire, then doing work for News of the World, to obtain Cook's home address, his internal payroll number at the Metropolitan police, his date of birth and figures for the amount that he and his wife were paying for their mortgage. Surveillance of Cook is also reported to have involved physically following him and his young children, attempts to access his voicemail and that of his wife, and possibly attempts to send a \\"Trojan horse\\" email in an attempt to steal information from his computer. Paperwork reportedly in the possession of the Scotland Yard shows that \\"Mulcaire did this on the instructions of Greg Miskiw, the paper's assistant editor and a close friend of Marunchak.\\" When one of the two vans parked outside Cook's home was stopped by Met officers, the driver turned out to be a photojournalist for News of the World. The vans were also licensed to the newspaper. During the same week, it appeared that attempts had been made to open letters which had been left in Cook's external postbox, indicating a \\"possible attempt to pervert the course of justice.\\" The Met handled this apparent attempt by agents of News of the World to interfere with a murder inquiry by having informal discussions with Rebekah Brooks, then editor for News of the World. \\"Scotland Yard took no further action, apparently reflecting the desire of Dick Fedorcio, who had a close working relationship with Brooks, to avoid unnecessary friction with the News of the World.\\" Fedorico was Director of Public Affairs and Internal Communication for the Met. As of July 2011, Cook and his wife were believed to be preparing a legal action against the News of the World, Marunchak, Miskiw and Mulcaire. Marunchak was also identified by BBC as the News of the World executive who had arranged for someone to plant a Trojan on the computer of a former British intelligence NCO, Ian Hurst. In 2000, Rees was sentenced to seven years in prison and served five. Upon release in 2005, he resumed his private investigative work for News of the World, where Andy Coulson by that time had succeeded Rebekah Brooks as editor. Coulson has maintained in evidence given to parliament and under oath in court that he did not know anything about illegal activity during the seven years he spent near or at the top of the News of the World. No one was charged with illegal acquisition of confidential information as a result of Operation Nigeria. According to Nick Davies, reporter for The Guardian, the Met collected hundreds of thousands of documents during the investigations into Jonathan Rees over his links with corrupt officers and over his alleged murder of Daniel Morgan. Although charges of murder against Rees were dismissed in 2011, Mr. Davies believes these \\"boxloads\\" of paperwork \\"could include explosive new evidence of illegal news-gathering by the News of the World and other papers.\\" =Operation Glade (2003)= For years, private investigators in addition to Rees were plying the lucrative trade in illegally acquired confidential information. The specialty of John Boyall's agency, Liberty Resources & Intelligent Research Limited, was acquiring information from confidential databases. Boyall's assistant was Glenn Mulcaire until the autumn of 2001, when News of the World's assistant editor, Greg Miskiw, attracted Mulcaire away by giving him a full-time contract to do work for the newspaper. Boyall eventually attracted the attention of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which is not a police organization but an independent authority with a mandate to \\"uphold information rights in the public interest, promoting openness by public bodies and data privacy for individuals.\\" With the assistance of the Devon & Cornwall police, the ICO raided Boyall's premises in November 2002. Documents seized there led the ICO to yet another private investigator, Steve Whittamore, who, with his wife, ran JJ information Limited. In March 2003, Whittamore's premises were raided under what was by then dubbed Operation Motorman. Documents from this raid established that confidential information was illegally acquired from telephone companies, the Driving & Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and the Police National Computer. It was reported that \\"media, especially newspapers, insurance companies and local authorities chasing council tax arrears all appear in the sales ledger of the dodgy agency.\\" Prices were clearly established: \\"Ex-directory telephone numbers cost [a] Hampshire detective ¬£40, and he sold them on for ¬£70. A vehicle check cost ¬£70, and customers were charged ¬£150. And so on.\\" In May 2006, the ICO issued a report titled \\"What price privacy?\\" Afterward, they received a request under the Freedom of Information Act \\"for further information about the publications that the 305 journalists were employed by and a breakdown of their activity.\\" Some information was provided to the requester, and a follow-up report was issued by the ICO in December 2006 titled \\"What price privacy now?\\"\\" However, much of the information obtained through Operation Motorman has never been released to the public. As recently as September 2011, the ICO declined to release information under another Freedom of Information Act request. Many people were involved in the illegal trafficking of confidential information. Paul Marshall, a former civilian communications officer based at Tooting police station in London, provided confidential police information to Alan King, a retired police officer, who passed it along to Boyall, who gave it to Whittamore, who in turn sold it to agents of news media organizations. Whittamore's network of information gatherers gave him access to confidential records at telephone companies, banks, post offices, hotels, theatres, and prisons, including BT Group, Cr√©dit Lyonnais, Goldman Sachs, Hang Seng Bank, Glen Parva prison, and Stocken prison. \\" Although there was evidence of many people being engaged in illegal activity, relatively few were questioned. Operation Motorman's lead investigator said in a 2006 inquiry that \\"his team were told not to interview journalists involved. The investigator...accused authorities of being too 'frightened' to tackle journalists.\\" Learning that Whittamore was obtaining information from the police national computer, the Information Commissioner contacted the Metropolitan Police, then headed by Commissioner Ian Blair with Deputy Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson second in command. In response, the Met's anti-corruption unit initiated Operation Glade. Whittamore had kept detailed records of his transactions with his clients, including the News of the World. \\"He identified 27 different journalists as commissioning his work ‚Äì well over half of the news and feature writers on the paper, spending tens of thousands of pounds. News of the World's Greg Miskiw alone was recorded as making 90 requests.\\" Invoices submitted to News International, which owned News of the World, \\"sometimes made explicit reference to obtaining a target's details from their phone number or their vehicle registration.\\" Miskiw was reportedly questioned by the Met about whether he had paid cash to Boyall to obtain information from the police computer, but no charges were made. Between February 2004 and April 2005, the Crown Prosecution Service, then headed by DPP Ken Macdonald, charged ten men working for private detective agencies with crimes relating to the illegal acquisition of confidential information. No journalists were charged. Whittamore, Boyall, King, and Marshall pleaded guilty in April 2005. According to ICO head Richard Thomas, \\"each pleaded guilty yet, despite the extent and the frequency of their admitted criminality, each was conditionally discharged [for two years], raising important questions for public policy.\\" The following year John Gunning was convicted of acquiring private subscriber information from British Telecom's database. According to Nick Davies of The Guardian, the illegal acquisition was not limited to the rich and powerful and the prosecution was inadequate.}} Documents seized from Stephen Whittamore's home in 2003 included \\"more than 13,000 requests for confidential information from newspapers and magazines.\\" There is no indication that a significant portion of this was evaluated by the police as potential evidence against other persons. It was not until February 2011, when Mr Justice Geoffrey Vos ordered the disclosure of this material in response to the phone hacking claim being brought by the politician George Galloway, that any significant release of the seized material was made. =The Royal Household / Goodman inquiry (2006)= In November 2005, within months of the guilty pleas resulting from Operation Glade, the Metropolitan Police Service was notified of irregularities with the telephone voicemails of members of the royal household. By January 2006, Scotland Yard determined there was an \\"unambiguous trail\\" to Clive Goodman, the News of the World royal reporter, and to Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator who was contracted to do work for the paper.\\" The voicemail of one royal aide had been accessed 433 times. The Met's counter-terrorism group, then led by assistant commissioner Andy Hayman, had responsibility for the security of the royal family and was charged with making the investigation. There was concern about diverting resources to this effort because of the demands of other priorities, including following up on the 2005 London transit bombings and surveillance operations on possible bomb plotters. On August 8, 2006, detectives from the Met went to News of the World with a search warrant to search Clive Goodman's desk. They reportedly faced resistance in the newspaper‚Äôs lobby from executives and lawyers for the paper over searching the newsroom as two veteran reporters stuffed documents into trash bags and removed them. As it happened, detectives limited their search to Goodman‚Äôs desk. At the same time, police raided the home of Glenn Mulcaire and seized \\"11,000 pages of handwritten notes listing nearly 4,000 celebrities, politicians, sports stars, police officials and crime victims whose phones may have been hacked.\\" The names included eight members of the royal family and their staff. There were \\"dozens of notebooks and two computers containing 2,978 complete or partial mobile phone numbers and 91 PIN codes; at least three names of other News of the World journalists; and 30 tape recordings made by Mulcaire. In the upper-left-hand corner of each document page was the name of the reporter or editor Mulcaire was helping. Also seized was a recording of Mulcaire instructing a journalist how to hack into private voice mail, particularly easy if the phone's factory settings for privacy had not been changed. The records also included a transcript of voice mail messages between Professional Football Association's Gordon Taylor and his legal adviser, Jo Anderson. This document was titled \\"Transcript for Neville\\" and is alleged to have been for Neville Thurlbeck, another reporter for News of the World. The email appeared to indicate that use of illegal interception of voice mail messages was being used at News of the World by more than just Clive Goodman. Met detectives did not then question Thurlbeck or any other News of the World journalist or executive as part of their investigation. This may have been in part because of the Met's relationship with the press.}} The Met's investigation under Hayman stayed narrowly focused on the victims in the royal household and a few other victims on a short \\"target list\\" obtained during the Mulcaire raid. Hayman had seen but had not acted upon a much longer list that was 8 to 10 pages in length, single-spaced, that \\"read like a British society directory.\\" The five other victims that were included in the indictment of Mulcaire were notified about violation of privacy. Of the thousands of people who may also have been victims, the Met decided to notify only those that were members of the government, police, military, or otherwise of national-security concern. Politician George Galloway was notified by a detective on 24 August 2006 that his voicemail had been hacked and advised to change his PIN code to prevent re-occurrence. Galloway asked who had accessed his phone messages, but the detective refused to tell him. Hayman's investigation also stayed narrowly focused on the activities of Goodman and Mulcaire. No News of the World executives or reporters other than Goodman were questioned about phone hacking until Operation Weeting was initiated more than four years later. Met officials consulted with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) headed by Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Ken Macdonald about the best general way to proceed with the investigation and prosecution. The Met did not disclose all available evidence to senior CPS prosecutors at this time, reportedly omitting documents indicating that reporters in addition to Clive Goodman appeared to have been using Mulcaire's services. The CPS appears to have provided some rationale to the Met for limiting the investigation by initially advising that \\"phone hacking was only an offence if messages had been intercepted before they were listened to by the intended recipient.\\" In fact, the hacking was illegal under the 1990 Computer Misuse Act regardless of whether messages had already been listened to by their intended recipient even if it was not illegal under the 2000 Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. The precise nature of the guidance given by CPS to the Met became the subject of public disagreement between them in 2011, at which time it was noted, among other things, that the charges brought against Goodman and Mulcaire included counts where there was no evidence provided regarding whether messages had already been heard or not. Goodman and Mulcaire were arrested in August 2006. During their court proceedings, a small number of other victims of Mulcaire's phone hacking were mentioned, including Sky Andrew, Max Clifford, Simon Hughes, Elle Macpherson, and Gordon Taylor. On 29 November 2006, Goodman and Mulcaire pleaded guilty to conspiracy to intercept communications without lawful authority with respect to three of the royal aides. The work of the Metropolitan police had resulted in guilty pleas within 12 month of when the crimes against royal aides were committed. However, it was clear from court testimony that Mulcaire had hacked at least five other phones and that he did work for more than just Goodman. Within weeks of the arrests of Goodman and Mulcaire, a \\"senior police officer\\" reportedly advised Rebekah Brooks there was strong circumstantial evidence in the documents seized from Mulcaire that News of the World journalists in addition to Goodman were implicated in phone hacking. In early autumn 2006, Tom Crone, legal manager for News International, reportedly contacted several other executives, including then News of the World editor Andy Coulson, informing them of what the Met told Brooks. Coulson resigned, accepting responsibility for the illegal activity, but denied knowing about it. The documents seized during the Mulcaire raid remained largely unevaluated until the autumn of 2010. No one at News of the World other than Goodman was questioned by the Met until March 2011. Nonetheless, ‚Äúsenior Scotland Yard officials assured Parliament, judges, lawyers, potential hacking victims, the news media and the public that there was no evidence of widespread hacking by the tabloid.‚Äù According to The New York Times, ‚Äúthe police agency and News International ‚Ä¶ became so intertwined that they wound up sharing the goal of containing the investigation. Mary Ellen Field was a highly paid adviser to Elle Macpherson. Macpherson blamed Field when confidential information about Macpherson began appearing in News of the World and fired her. After Glenn Mulcaire was arrested and jailed, acknowledging he had hacked Macpherson's phone, Field wrote to the police requesting information that might help exonerate her. No one replied. =The Yates review of evidence (2009)= On 8 July 2009, The Guardian published three articles authored by journalist Nick Davies and Vikram Dodd titled: # \\"Murdoch papers paid ¬£1m to gag phone-hacking victims\\" # \\"Trail of hacking and deceit under nose of Tory PR chief.\\" # \\"Ex-Murdoch editor Andrew Neil: News of the World revelations one of most significant media stories of our time.\\" The articles alleged: * Rupert Murdoch's News Group Newspapers (NGN) agreed to large settlements with hacking victims, including Gordon Taylor. The settlements included gagging provisions to prevent release to the public of evidence then held by the Metropolitan Police Service that NGN journalists repeatedly used criminal methods to get stories. \\"News Group then persuaded the court to seal the file on Taylor's case to prevent all public access, even though it contained prima facie evidence of criminal activity.\\" That evidence included documents seized in raids by the Information Commissioner's Office and by the Met. * If the suppressed evidence became public, hundreds more phone hacking victims of NGN might be a position to take legal action against NGN newspapers including News of the World and The Sun. It might also provoke police inquiries into reporters and senior newspaper executives. * When Andy Coulson, then chief press adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron, was editor and deputy editor at News of the World, journalists there openly engaged private investigators that used illegal phone hacking, paying invoices for this work that itemised illegal acts.}} * Neil also said that everybody at News of the World knew what was going on, that there was no public interest defense for the phone hacking, and that the way the case was pursued raises serious questions about the Metropolitan Police, the Crown Prosecution Service, and the court which, \\"faced with evidence of conspiracy and systemic illegal actions,...agreed to seal the evidence.\\" * The Met held evidence that thousands of mobile phones had been hacked into by agents of News of the World, including Members of Parliament from all three parties and including cabinet ministers. * The Metropolitan Police decided not to inform the public figures whose phones had been targeted and the Crown Prosecution Service decided not prosecute News Group executives. * Statements by executives misled a parliamentary select committee, the Press Complaints Commission and the public about the extent of their newspaper's illegal acquisition of confidential information. Later that same day, Metropolitan Police Service Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson asked Assistant Commissioner John Yates to take a fresh look at the phone hacking to see if it should be reopened in the light of these allegations. Yates reportedly took just eight hours to consult with senior detectives and Crown Prosecution lawyers to conclude there was no fresh material that could lead to further convictions. His review did not include examination of possible leads from the thousands of pages of the available evidence seized in raids between 1999 and 2006. In September 2009, Yates reported his conclusions to the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee saying there were insufficient evidence for arresting or even interviewing anyone else and that no additional evidence had been brought forward. Upon review of the first inquiry, he concluded that there were just a handful, only hundreds, not thousands of potential victims. Although Yates was aware of the \\"Transcript For Neville\\" email during his fresh look, he did not believe it would be worthwhile to interview Neville Thurlbeck. Further, Yates did not believe it would be worthwhile to interview other journalists at News of the World that Glenn Mulcaire may have worked with or to look into the cases of victims beyond the eight that were pursued in 2006. Eventually, as queries continued to come in from celebrities and politicians asking if they had been victims of hacking, Yates directed that the evidence from the Mulcaire raid that had been in stored in trash bags for three years be entered into a computer database. Ten people were assigned this task. Yates himself did not look at the evidence saying later, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to go down and look at bin bags. I am supposed to be an Assistant Commissioner.\\" He did not re- open the investigation. =Operation Weeting (2011): interception of voicemail= Some of the few individuals who did become aware that their voicemail messages had been intercepted by Glenn Mulcaire for News of the World initiated legal action against Mulcaire and the newspaper. Progress of these suits and the evidence released by the Met to the courts as a consequence received public scrutiny as The Guardian and other newspapers kept the story in public view. In 2005, Mark Lewis, solicitor for the Professional Footballers' Association, suspected that News of the World hacked phones to get information for a proposed story concerning Gordon Taylor. His beliefs were confirmed late 2007 at Mulcaire's judicial proceedings, at which Mulcaire pleaded guilty and apologized to Taylor and seven others for accessing their voicemail messages. Lewis sued News of the World on behalf of Taylor, and filed actions with the court to obtain relevant documents. As a result, on 27 June 2008, the court ordered that documents held by the Metropolitan Police that had been obtained in the raids on Mulcaire and Steve Whittamore be turned over to Lewis. One of these documents was the \\"Transcript For Neville\\" email. Within 24 hours, News of the World began settlement discussions. Taylor received ¬£700,000, and Lewis became the first solicitor to win a settlement from the newspaper for phone hacking. The settlement remained secret until it was reported by The Guardian on 8 July 2009 in one of the three articles relating to phone hacking published that day. Days later, Max Clifford, another of the eight victims named in the 2006 indictment of Mulcaire, announced his intentions to sue. In March 2010, News International agreed to settle his suit for ¬£1,000,000. These awards encouraged other possible victims and their solicitors to explore possibilities, resulting in more and more queries to the Metropolitan Police about whether their names were on Mulcaire's lists. Responses from the Met were difficult to obtain. Solicitor Charlotte Harris, who represented Clifford, wrote to the Metropolitan Police about other clients, Leslie Ash and her husband Lee Chapman, \\"asking whether they had also been hacked. The police took three months to reply.\\" On 3 July 2009, shortly before The Guardian articles were published, Stuart Kuttner resigned from News of the World. He had been managing editor. The Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee had begun holding hearings on phone hacking beginning in March 2007, shortly after Goodman and Mulcaire were sent to prison. These hearings were renewed in July 2009, shortly after The Guardian's three articles were published. After taking testimony from the police and from several News International representatives, the Committee's released its findings February 2010. The Committee was critical of the police for not pursuing \\"evidence that merited a wider investigation\\" and criticized News International executives for their ‚Äúcollective amnesia.‚Äù The hearings did not result in a renewed police investigation, there being no enthusiasm at Scotland Yard to go beyond Mulcaire and Goodman.}} On 1 September 2010, The New York Times published a lengthy article by Don Van Natta Jr., Jo Becker, and Graham Bowley echoing the Committee's concerns and specifically contradicting testimony made by former News of the World editor Andy Coulson in which he claimed not to be aware of phone hacking. Among other things, the article alleged: * The Met failed to follow leads that indicated News of the World routinely used phone hacking to get leads for stories. * Several Met investigators said the Met \\"was reluctant to conduct a wider inquiry in part because of its close relationship with News of the World.\\" * Former editor Andy Coulson, who was then the communications director for Prime Minister David Cameron, had been fully aware that phone hacking was being used by his newspaper's journalists and that he even encouraged it.}} On 15 December 2010, The Guardian published an article authored by Nick Davies disclosing that documents, seized from the home of private investigator Glenn Mulcaire by Metropolitan Police Service in 2006 and only recently made available to the public by court action, implied that News of the World editor Ian Edmondson specifically instructed Mulcaire to intercept voice messages of Sienna Miller, Jude Law, and several others. The documents also implied that Mulcaire was engaged by others at News of the World, including chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and assistant editor Greg Miskiw, who had then worked directly for editor Andy Coulson. This contradicted testimony to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee by newspaper executives and senior Met officials that Mulcaire acted on his own and that there was no evidence of hacking by other than him and a single \\"rogue reporter,\\" namely Clive Goodman. Within five weeks of this article appearing, Ian Edmundson was suspended from News of the World, Andy Coulson resigned as Chief Press Secretary to David Cameron, the Crown Prosecution Service began a review of evidence it had, and the Met renewed its investigation into phone hacking, something it had declined to do since 2007. The renewed Met investigation was titled Operation Weeting and began on 26 January 2011. It was led by Sue Akers, a Deputy Assistant Commissioner with the Metropolitan Police, and was focused on the illegal interception of voicemail. Between 45 and 60 officers began looking over the 11,000 pages of evidence seized from Mulcaire back in August 2006. By mid-April, Thurlbeck, Edmondson, and James Weatherup, a senior News of the World journalist, had been arrested. In May 2011, News International's law firm, Hickman & Rose, hired former Director of Public Prosecutions Ken Macdonald to review the emails newspaper executives had used as the basis of their claim that no one at News of the World but Clive Goodman had been involved in phone hacking. Macdonald immediately concluded there was evidence of criminal activity, including payments to serving police officers, leading the Met to open an investigation focused on bribery and corruption within its ranks. (See discussion of Operation Elveden, below.) On 4 July 2011, The Guardian published an article authored by Nick Davies and Amelia Hill titled \\"Missing Milly Dowler's voicemail was hacked by News of the World.\\" This article disclosed that voicemail messages from Milly Dowler's phone had been hacked back in 2002 by an agent of News of the World looking for a story. This disclosure inflamed public opinion and led to loss of advertising for News of the World and subsequent closure of this 168-year-old newspaper. Within two weeks, senior News Corporation executives resigned, including Les Hinton, chief executive of Dow Jones & Company, Rebekah Brooks, chief executive of News International, Tom Crone, legal manager of News International, and Lawrence Jacobs, general counsel for News Corporation. Also within two weeks, the two top officials of the Metropolitan Police Service resigned, namely Commissioner Paul Stephenson and Assistant Commissioner John Yates. The new Met Commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howe, took the unusual step of asking a team from an outside police force, the Durham Constabulary headed by Jon Stoddart, to review the work of Operation Weeting. Between 4 July and early September 2011, about ten people, mostly editors and journalists who had at one time worked for News of the World, were arrested in conjunction with illegal acquisition of confidential information. These included Rebekah Brooks, Andy Coulson, Neil Wallis, Stuart Kuttner, Greg Miskiw, James Desborough, Dan Evans, Ross Hall, and The Times deputy editor Raoul Simons. On 22 September 2011, The Independent published an article authored by James Cusick and Cahal Milmo reporting that, within weeks of the arrests of Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire in August 2006, \\"a senior police officer\\" advised Rebekah Brooks there was substantial \\"circumstantial evidence\\" in the documents seized from Mulcaire that News of the World journalists in addition to Goodman were implicated in phone hacking. It also reported that in early autumn 2006, Tom Crone, legal manager for News International, contacted several other executives, including then News of the World editor Andy Coulson, informing them of what the Met told Brooks. News International executives, including Crone, had maintained they were not aware of such evidence until almost two years later, in May 2008, when they received a copy of the \\"Transcript for Neville\\" in conjunction with Gordon Taylor's lawsuit. On 15 May 2012, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) charged six individuals with conspiring to pervert the course of justice. Charged in relation to removal of documents and computers to conceal them from investigating detectives were former News International CEO Rebekah Brooks, her husband, her personal assistant, her bodyguard, her chauffeur, and the head of security at News International. These charges were made about 1 year after the Metropolitan Police Service reopened its dormant investigation into phone hacking, about 3 years after the then Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service told the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee that \\"no additional evidence has come to light,\\" 5 years after News International executives began claiming that phone hacking was the work of a single \\"rogue reporter, 10 years after The Guardian began reporting that the Met had evidence of widespread illegal acquisition of confidential information, and 13 years after the Met began accumulating \\"boxloads\\" of that evidence but kept it unexamined in trash bags at Scotland Yard. On 24 July 2012, charges were brought against eight former employees or agents of News of the World including head editors Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson. All eight were charged regarding illegal interception of communications relating to specific individuals =Operations Tuleta (2011): computer hacking= After Jonathan Rees was released from prison in 2005, he resumed private investigative work for News of the World, then under the leadership of Andy Coulson. Documents seized as part of the ongoing investigation of Rees for the murder of Daniel Morgan included 5 July 2006 fax containing extracts from Ian Hurst's emails sent by Rees to the News of the World‚Äôs Dublin office which included information on \\"Stakeknife\\". Hurst had not had contact with Stakeknife. Mr Marunchak was then editor of the newspaper's Irish edition. At that time, Martin Ingram, aka Ian Hurst, was a British Army intelligence sergeant in Northern Ireland who falsely claimed responsibility for contact with the agent \\"Stakeknife,\\" reportedly a double agent imbedded in the Provisional IRA and potentially at high risk for assassination. Very few people knew of the agent's whereabouts, which was kept secret for his protection. Hurst's personal computer was allegedly hacked by Marunchak with a Trojan programme which copied emails and relayed them to the hacker who in turn passed them along to newspaper personnel, putting the agent at risk. No apparent investigative action was taken by the Met from the time documentary evidence of the computer hacking came into its possession until 10 June 2011, when Operation Tuleta was launched. Like Operation Weeting, Tuleta was led by the Met's Sue Akers. Hurst stated the Met notified him of the 2006 hacking in July 2011. =Operation Elveden (2011): bribery, corruption= From 2003 to 2008, Ken Macdonald was Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) at the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). During this period, Andy Hayman of the Metropolitan Police Service limited the Met's investigation of alleged phone hacking to Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire. John Yates later claimed the investigation was limited as a result of collaboration with the CPS because CPS indicated no law was broken unless the voice messages were listened to by phone hackers before the intended recipient listed to them. Macdonald recused himself from these strategy sessions because of his acquaintance with the then editor of News of the World, Andy Coulson. On 29 November 2006, Clive Goodman pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring confidential information of the royal household to write stories for News of the World. A few months later, Goodman was sentenced to prison and dismissed from News of the World. He filed a wrongful dismissal suit, claiming in part that others were well aware of his activities. This suit was settled in March 2007. News International, owner of News of the World, selected about 300 emails between Goodman and other News of the World reporters and editors and asked the law firm of Harbottle & Lewis (H&L;) to review them and report whether there was evidence that others, including Andy Coulson, were aware of Goodman's hacking or engaged in hacking themselves. H&L; also served as counsel to the royal family at the time. On 29 May 2007, H&L;'s Lawrence Abramson sent the final draft of a letter whose text had negotiated between the law firm and its client to News International, stating that the review of the e-mails had found no such evidence. In his testimony to the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee on 19 July 2011, News International's James Murdoch claimed to have relied on this letter containing \\"outside legal advice from senior counsel‚Äù to publicly maintain that the phone hacking had been the work of a single \\"rogue reporter,\\" namely Goodman. These 300 emails were not at that time provided to the police. News International faced growing skepticism and criticism from newspapers, Parliament, and the police about the single \\"rogue reporter\\" stance. There were also questions about illegal action by the police themselves. As a result, News International's parent company, News Corporation arranged for another review of the emails. In May 2011, their law firm, Hickman & Rose, hired Ken Macdonald, still an acquaintance of former News of the World editor, Andy Coulson, to review the emails H&L; had held since 2007. When Macdonald reviewed the e-mails, it took him less than five minutes' to conclude that it was \\"blindingly obvious\\" that they represented evidence of criminal wrongdoing. He advised the News Corporation board to give the emails to the police, \\"a move that set off the current investigation into the payments made to the police by journalists at The News of the World. The company then trawled through other documents, including its cash authorization records, and found 130,000 pounds‚Äô worth of payments to a group of officers over several years, according to officials with knowledge of the inquiry. Included within those records was documentation of a thousand-pound cash withdrawal around the date of Mr. Goodman‚Äôs e-mail concerning his purchase of the Green Book from a police officer.\\" On 20 June, Macdonald gave papers he had reviewed relating to allegations of illegal payments to the police. On 4 July, The Guardian broke the Millie Dowler story. On 6 July 2011, it was announced that Operation Elveden had been initiated to investigate alleged bribery and corruption within the Metropolitan Police. Investigations of the Metropolitan Police As the Met initiated new investigations, it became the object of investigations by others. =Investigative reporting by newspapers= As early as 2002, when the Metropolitan Police's anti-corruption unit was engaged in Operation Nigeria, The Guardian raised questions about whether all the evidence relating to police corruption was being pursued. Between February 2004 and April 2005, as a result of Operation Glade, ten men working for private detective agencies were charged with crimes relating to the illegal acquisition of confidential information. Some of the information they obtained reportedly came from serving police officers. Only four of the accused were ultimately found guilty of crimes but did not serve prison time. The Guardian reported that the investigation and prosecution ended in fiasco since Whittamore and three others received conditional discharges. A trial of other members collapsed before it had even gotten started.\\" The Guardian also observed that enormous amounts of information seized in raids had not been evaluated. After the 2006 imprisonment of Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire, and with assurances from News International executive and senior Metropolitan Police officials that a thorough investigation of evidence identified only these two as being involved in phone hacking, the public perception was that the matter was closed. Nick Davies and other journalists from The Guardian continued to critically examine evidence available from court cases and reported information contradicting official positions. Other newspapers, including The New York Times, The Daily Telegraph and The Independent, also published key articles critical of the Met's performance. These news media organizations persisted in obtaining and evaluating information from court records, Freedom of Information requests, and field contacts, reportedly including police officers. As in the case of the Watergate scandal of 1972, dogged investigative reporting led to public inquiries by national oversight bodies, intensified police investigations, and resignations by senior law enforcement officials. =Investigation by national oversight bodies= Commons Culture, Media, and Sport Select Committee The House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee held hearings regarding phone hacking by news media companies in March 2007, July 2009, and again in July 2011. Representatives of the Metropolitan Police Service gave evidence to the committee on several occasions, including oral evidence as follows: :2 September 2009 John Yates, Assistant Commissioner :2 September 2009 Philip Williams, Detective Chief Superintendent :24 March 2011 John Yates, Acting Deputy Commissioner :March 2007 The 2007 inquiry regarding \\"Privacy and media intrusion\\" began shortly after Goodman and Mulcaire were sentenced. It was focused on activity at News of the World. The then executive chairman of News International, Les Hinton, assured the Committee that a \\"full, rigorous internal inquiry\\" had been carried out and, to his knowledge, Goodman was the only person at News of the World that knew about hacking. Hinton said, ‚ÄúI believe absolutely that Andy Coulson did not have knowledge of what was going on.‚Äù :July 2009 Prompted by the allegations in the three articles published by The Guardian around 8 July 2009, the Committee convened new hearings. Chairman John Whittingdale questioned whether the Committee had been misled by News International executives who testified two years before that Goodman and Mulcaire acted alone. The Committee again heard evidence from Les Hinton, then chief executive officer of Dow Jones & Company, and Andy Coulson, then director of communications for the Conservative Party. They also heard from Met assistant commissioner John Yates and Detective chief superintendent Philip Williams. The Committee's findings, released in February 2010, were critical of News International executives for their ‚Äúcollective amnesia‚Äù and critical of the police for not pursuing \\"evidence that merited a wider investigation.\\" :July 2011 After The Guardian publicized the 2002 hacking of Milly Dowler's phone, the Committee renewed hearings to follow up on the 2009 inquiry into press standards, privacy and libel. Again evidence was given by John Yates and News International executives, this time including Rebekah Brooks, James Murdoch, and Rupert Murdoch. By this time, there was substantial evidence from various sources that phone hacking had been widespread, that senior newspaper executives were aware of it sooner than had been claimed, and that Parliament had been misled. Home Affairs Committee The Home Affairs Select Committee held hearings regarding phone hacking by news media companies beginning in July 2009 and in September 2010. :July 2009 Like the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, the Home Affairs Select Committee questioned the Met's decision not to reopen the investigation following allegations that 27 other News International reporters may have illegally commissioned private investigators to carry out tasks. The Met's assistant commissioner John Yates responded that he had only looked into the original inquiry of Goodman. :September 2010 As information continued to emerge from court cases and investigative reporting, the Home Affairs Committee initiated another inquiry on 1 September 2010. The Committee again received evidence from the Met, newspaper journalists and executives, Shortly after the hacking of Milly Dowler's phone became public in 2011, committee chairman Keith Vaz wrote to Prime Minister David Cameron asking him to consider points raised during the committee's inquiry, including: * \\"Why there was such an extensive failure by the Metropolitan Police properly to investigate allegations of telephone hacking and other illegal activity when those allegations were first made; * \\"Whether the advice on the interpretation of section 1 of RIPA given by the CPS inappropriately limited the scope of the Metropolitan Police inquiry in 2006 * \\"The police response to such offences, especially the treatment of those whose communications have been intercepted; * \\"The legal situation surrounding payment of police officers; * \\"Whether police officers were compromised by their relationships with journalists during the 2006 inquiry; * \\"Whether police officers were subject to blackmail by those they were investigating;\\" * \\"Whether criticism of the Metropolitan Police Service was suppressed by the use of public money to threaten legal action; * \\"Whether there should be advice to/restrictions on senior public officials such as the Director of Public Prosecutions about taking employment with those previously subject to investigations in which the officials were involved.\\" The committee issued its report finding that difficulties justifying the failure to investigate further were insufficient and that there appeared simply to be no real overcome obstacles. Leveson Inquiry Two days after The Guardian article regarding Milly Dowler was published, Prime Minister David Cameron announced that a public government inquiry would be initiated. Cameron named Lord Justice Leveson to chair the inquiry into phone hacking at News of the World and other newspapers, the diligence of the initial police inquiry, alleged illegal payments to police by the press, and the general culture and ethics of the media, including broadcasters and social media. The Leveson Inquiry would be conducted in two parts. Part 1 of the inquiry would focus on ethical questions, specifically \\"the culture, practices and ethics of the press, including contacts between the press and politicians and the press and the police.\\" Part 2 would focus on legal questions, specifically \\"the extent of unlawful or improper conduct within News International, other media organisations or other organisations. It will also consider the extent to which any relevant police force investigated allegations relating to News International, and whether the police received corrupt payments or were otherwise complicit in misconduct.\\" Part 2 would not begin right away because of ongoing investigations by law enforcement organizations. The Leveson Inquiry's press release of September 2011 named the Met along with 46 celebrities, politicians, sportsmen, other public figures, and members of the public who may have been victims of media intrusion, granting them all \\"core participant\\" status in the initial module of the inquiry. Core participants could, through their legal representatives, ask questions of witnesses giving oral evidence. =Internal Met investigations= By early July 2011, Metropolitan Police Service commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson was facing questions and accusations from several quarters about potential conflicts of interest arising from his social relationships with News International executives. On 14 July 2011, Neil Wallis was arrested. Wallis was formerly executive editor at News of the World and was arrested on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications In 2009 and 2010, while Wallis' public relations firm, Chamy Media, was being paid ¬£24,000 by the Met for him to do public relations work two days each month, Wallis also received more than ¬£25,000 from News International for providing ‚Äúcrime exclusives‚Äù using details of Met investigations. For one story, he was paid ¬£10,000. His contract with the Met reportedly had a confidentiality clause, a Data Protection Act clause and a conflict of interest clause. During January 2011, Stephenson accepted a five-week stay worth an estimated $19,000 from Champneys, a health farm at the time the spa's public relations were being handled by Wallis's firm. Three days later, on 17 July, Stephenson resigned. He claimed his relationship with Wallis was that of an acquaintance and maintained only for professional purposes. He denied having suspected Wallis was involved in phone hacking, relying upon senior figures from News International claiming misbehaviour was confined to a few rogues. Finally, he claimed to have been unaware of any other documents in the Met's possession of the nature that subsequently emerged.\\" The next day, 18 July, an initiative was announced by Home Secretary Theresa May to examine the ethical considerations regarding the replations between the Metropolitan police and the media. It was to be led by Elizabeth Filkin, the former Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, and intended to create a framework for how officers should interact with journalists. May also noted that she had asked the Independent Police Complaints Commission to determine whether it needs the authority to question civilian witnesses during the course of their investigations and whether it should be able to investigate \\"institutional failings\\" of entire forces in addition to allegations against individual officers. On 1 September 2011, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary began an inquiry to address alleged corruption and abuse of power in police relationships with the media.\\" This, too, was ordered by Home Secretary Theresa May and led by a former chief constable of Essex, Roger Baker. His area of investigation was to include payments made to custody sergeants for tip-offs about arrests as well as buying drinks and providing lavish hospitality. Later in September, in what may also be considered an internal investigation, the new Met Commissioner, Bernard Hogan- Howe, took the unusual step of asking the Durham constabulary to review the work of Operation Weeting. Criticisms and responses Investigations of the Met gave rise to criticisms of the Met's role in the phone hacking scandal. Commentators observed that the personal relationships among individuals variously in law enforcement, news media, and political institutions may have compromised principles and judgments, sometimes leading to inappropriate favors and even illegal payments. This entanglement of personal and commercial interests led some commentators to believe that a disincentive was created for police officials to thoroughly investigate allegations of wrongdoing. This may have resulted in the failure to notify victims in a timely manner, led to misleading statements to the public and government oversight bodies to cover- up wrongdoing, and/or led to attempts to stifle the voices of whistle-blowers. Metropolitan Police spokespersons have maintained that investigations were pursued appropriately in light of information and guidance available to them and in light of competing priorities for their resources. =Personal relationships and potential conflicts of interest= While Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police from 1993 to 2000, Paul Condon established the Met's anti- corruption unit, acknowledging that police corruption was not an occasional threat, but a permanent, ongoing one. Condon's initiatives all but closed down communication between Met police and the news media. Condon's successor, John Stevens was Met commissioner from 2000 to 2005. He was credited with reopening communication between the Met and the news media, consciously cultivating relationships with them. In this, he was assisted by the Met's public affairs head, Dick Fedorcio. One senior officer reportedly said that Stevens was a master of the media who had not understood the complications that could arise from close relationships with the media. After retiring, Stevens wrote a column for the News of the World. In his autobiography, he stated that he had worked hard to maintain good relations with the press and, in doing so had made himself \\"available\\" to editors such as Rebekah Brooks (then Wade) at The Sun and Andy Coulson at the News of the World. Ian Blair was commissioner from February 2005 to December 2008. Apparently less skilled than Stevens in working with the media, Blair made high-profile media gaffes that contributed to his losing support and ultimately led to his resignation. Blair later wrote an article for the New Statesman in which he agreed with Condon that there would always be some small number of corrupt staff in the Met. Then in his role as journalist, the former commissioner held the view that only a small fraction of policemen became compromised and that the principal problem stemmed from their relationships with politicians rather than with journalists.}} By the time Paul Stephenson became Met commissioner in January 2009, News Corporation executives had well established, interdependent relationships with both politicians and the police. In the 15 months following his becoming Prime Minister, David Cameron met with News International executives 26 times. James Murdoch, Rebekah Brooks, and Andy Coulson had all been his guests at the Prime Minister's official country residence. According to The Independent, Mr Cameron held at least twice as many meetings with Murdoch executives as he held with any other media organisation. Leaders of both major parties cultivated relationships with the Murdochs. Since 2006, Met commissioner Paul Stephenson dined with executives and others at News Corporation 18 times, including 8 times with Neil Wallis, one of which was in September 2006 during the Royal Household/Goodman inquiry when Wallis was deputy editor of News of the World. Andy Hayman who led that inquiry, attended several dinners, lunches and receptions with News of the World editors. One such dinner was on 25 April 2006 while his officers were gathering evidence in the cases. Shortly after Mr. Hayman left the Metropolitan Police in December 2007 he was hired to write a column for The Times of London, another publication of News International. Home Secretary Theresa May, expressed concerns over the closeness of the relationship between News International and the police. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg expressed concerns about growing public perception of police corruption. Labor MP Paul Farrelly said the meetings demonstrated inappropriate ties with the Murdoch organisation. The report of the Home Affairs Select Committee noted a \\"level of social interaction which took place between senior Metropolitan Police Officers and executives at News International while investigations were or should have been being undertaken into the allegations of phone hacking carried out on behalf of the News of the World.\\" Paul Stephenson resigned 17 July 2011. This was the result of speculation about the Met's ties to senior people at News International including Neil Wallis who had been arrested in connection with Operation Weeting.\\" There was potential for mutual benefit from these various relationships, some of which could be rationalized to be in the public interest. Personal ties could help journalists obtain information on which to base news stories the public should know about. The police might obtain information from journalists that helped solve crimes. In defense of investigative reporting by News of the World, The New York Times noted that even disregarding sex scandals, wrongdoing resulting in dozens of criminal convictions had been reported. However, some mutual benefit from these personal ties was less focused on the public good. As early as 1997, it was customary for newspapers, including News of the World, about to publish a story about alleged criminal activity, to tip-off the police in advance so that the police could make arrests and get favorable publicity from the newspaper. Police officials might receive favors or even payment for information. Questionable aspects of their private life might also receive less scrutiny from the press. Politicians might receive influential support from newspapers. Every Prime Minister beginning with Margaret Thatcher reportedly benefited from News Corporation endorsement. Newspaper executives in return might receive preferred access to politicians that could help their companies. For example, News Corporation Chairman in Europe, James Murdoch dined at the Prime Minister's official country residence during the period that he was promoting the company's bid for British Sky Broadcasting Group (BSkyB). In the worst case, such personal relationships could create a conflict of interest making senior Met officials less willing to act in the public interest. The Daily Beast concluded the current situation between the Met and News International was too cozy.}} =Limited, incomplete investigations= Critics of the Met's investigation into phone hacking noted that large amounts of evidence available to them was inexplicably left unevaluated and unused. It was speculated during a Parliamentary Debate in September 2010, that, if Andy Hayman, the Met officer who headed the phone hacking 2006 investigation, had been placed in charge of the Watergate inquiry, \\"President Nixon would have safely served a full term.\\" Critics also noted the legal criteria the Met used to guide its investigations was incorrect, and that conflicts of interest may have contributed to limiting the investigations. The Met responded that there were higher priority investigations competing for the limited resources available, and that they conducted appropriate investigations based upon their knowledge and guidance at the time. Responding to a critical New York Times article, the Metropolitan Police Service released a statement defending its actions.}} Eventually, with increasing publicity regarding the phone hacking scandal, a total of 185 people were committed to investigations relating to illegal acquisition of confidential information. Specifically, by mid-July 2012, 96 officers and civilians were working on Operation Weeting (phone hacking), 19 officers working on Operation Tuleta (computer hacking), and 70 working on Operation Elveden (bribery, corruption). Unevaluated evidence The Met began accumulating evidence against Jonathan Rees beginning in 1987 relating to the murder of Daniel Morgan and other crimes. Nick Davies, reporter for The Guardian, believes these \\"boxloads\\" of paperwork \\"could include explosive new evidence of illegal news-gathering by the News of the World and other papers.\\" There has been no indication that this evidence was thoroughly evaluated for evidence of illegal acquisition of confidential information. Documents dating back to the 1990s seized in 2003 by the Information Commissioner's Office from the home of private investigator Stephen Whittamore as part of Operation Motorman may not have been thoroughly evaluated by the Met for evidence of illegal acquisition of confidential information. Seized documents included 13,343 requests for confidential information from 305 journalists In 2007 the information commissioner \\"berated the police and PCC over their feeble prosecution and condemnation, respectively, of a range of offences, from garnering ex-directory numbers to hacking into the police national computer.\\" Staff at News of the World reportedly reported to the police in 2002 that the paper only had access to Milly's voice mails and that no one had been accused of phone hacking at that time.\\" Documents seized by the Metropolitan Police in August 2006 from the home of private investigator Glenn Mulcaire totaled 11,000 pages of evidence, including a voicemail target list with over 4,000 names on it. According to The New York Times, no one at the Met cataloged this evidence until late 2010, even though senior Scotland Yard officials told Parliament, judges, lawyers, potential hacking victims, the news media and the public that there was no evidence of widespread hacking by the tabloid. According to The Daily Telegraph, evidence had been kept in trash bags for three years before deputy commissioner John Yates ] had the names entered on to a computer database to permit thorough examination for leads. Only eight of 4,000 potential victims became the subject of charges against Mulcaire in 2006. A key document seized from Mulcaire's premises in August 2006 was the \\"Transcript for Nevile\\" email. The names appearing on this document indicated that News of the World journalists in addition to Clive Goodman were involved in phone hacking. The Met acknowledged the existence of this document 1 November 2007 in response to inquiries related to the civil claim brought against News of the World by Gordon Taylor. The court ordered the Met to turn the document over to Taylor on 7 December 2007 and Farrer and Co, which then represented News Group Newspapers, received a copy by 2 April 2008. The chairman of Culture, Media and Sport Committee asked Yates why this document did not provoke someone to interview Neville.}} The committee criticized this 2006 decision not to investigate further, concluding that there had been evidence of additional lawbreaking by others and that more thorough police investigation had been warranted. The Committee criticized Yates judgment. The following year, the Home Affairs Select Committee conducted an inquiry and leveled similar criticism at the Met \\"for its failures to pursue inquiries.\\" Priorities Faced with criticism for not thoroughly pursuing available evidence in 2006, the Met asserted that the Royal Household/Goodman inquiry was limited \\"because the counter-terrorism unit, which was in charge of the case, was preoccupied with more pressing demands.\\" According to deputy assistant commissioner Peter Clark, the unit then had over 70 live operations regarding terrorist plots and that not all of these were being investigated because of a shortage of officers to do so. Assistant commissioner John Yates pointed to the fact that, two days after Mucaire was arrested, the counter-terrorism unit foiled an Al-Qaeda plan to blow up transatlantic airliners. The Home Affairs Select Committee acknowledged that the anti-terrorist unit had conflicting priorities and that Clark gave higher priority to protecting life threatened by terrorists than to criminal activity resulting only in breaches of privacy. Nonetheless, it was critical of not looking into the evidence it had in hand.}} Incorrect legal criteria As part of setting their investigative priorities in 2006, the Met consulted with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to agree upon a strategy for pursuing the Royal Household/Goodman inquiry. Assistant commissioner John Yates claimed that the Met was guided by advice from the CPS, then headed by Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Ken Macdonald, that \\"phone hacking was only an offence if messages had been intercepted before they were listened to by the intended recipient.\\" Yates told Parliament on four separate occasions that it was on the basis of this legal theory that Yates repeatedly claimed that only 10 to 12 phone hacking victims had been identified. Yates maintained his position to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee in 2011 that the guidance received by the Met was \\"unequivocal.\\" This account was challenged by Keir Starmer, who succeed Macdonald as DPP. Starmer told the Home Affairs Select Committee that the Met were not given advice which limited their investigation. Specifically, he claimed: * The Met had been advised that phone hacking was an offence under the 1990 Computer Misuse Act, regardless of whether messages had or had not been heard by their intended recipient. * Although a CPS lawyer had raised the possibility early in the inquiry that, under the 2000 Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA), it might be necessary to prove voicemail messages had been intercepted before listened to by the intended recipient, an email sent to the Met in April 2006 cautioned that this was an untested view that warranted further consideration. Furthermore, after David Perry became the prosecutor in July 2006, he advised the Met that this was a narrow interpretation. * When charges were brought against Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire, no mention was made as to whether messages had already been listened to by the intended recipient. Conflict of interest Some observers expressed the view that the decision to limit the investigation was in part due to conflict of interest by Met officials. According to The New York Times, some investigators acknowledged that Scotland Yard was reluctant investigate more fully in part because of its close relationship with News of the World.\\" The New York Times further observed that, such interviews, combined with testimony before the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, indicated that ‚Äúthe police agency and News International ‚Ä¶ became so intertwined that they wound up sharing the goal of containing the investigation. In reply, the Met insisted that they followed the lines of inquiry that they thought was likely to produce the best evidence, and that the charges that were brought were appropriate for the criminality uncovered. A former senior Met official denied the department was influenced by any alliance with News of the World. Met assistant commissioner John Yates expressed his views to The Daily Telegraph in an interview that mistakes had been made, but that they reflected \\"cock-up, not conspiracy.\\" The Met had simply taken a narrow view of what constituted a \\"victim,\\" leading them to report publicly that there were a small number, a \\"handful,\\" perhaps hundreds of victims, but not thousands. =Illegal payments to officers= Allegations of illegal payments to police officers date back to the earliest period of the phone hacking scandal. During the 1990s, Jonathan Rees reportedly had a network of sources within the Metropolitan Police Service, including serving officers, providing him with confidential information that he sold at a profit to news media organizations. In March 2003, Rebekah Brooks, editor of The Sun, and Andy Coulson, editor of News of the World testified together before the Commons media select committee. Brooks responded to a question about payments to the police saying that the organization paid the police for information in the past. Asked if she would do so again in the future, her answer was pre-empted by Coulson who stated that, if there is a clear public interest, they would continue with that practice. It was pointed out to Coulson that it was always illegal to pay police officers, regardless of public interest. Coulson suggested he had been talking about the use of subterfuge.\\" According to The Guardian, the Met received documents in June 2011 from News International indicating that News of the World paid a total of ¬£100,000 to between 3 and 5 as yet unidentified Met officers in 2003 while Coulson was editor. Former Met commissioner Ian Blair noted that this represents only \\"five junior police officers out of the Met's 52,000 staff.\\" The Guardian believes evidence in the hands of the Met indicates there are more serving officers receiving thousands of pounds in brown envelopes from newspaper's crime reporters and that, when the attempts were made to stop the corruption, serving officers tipped them off so they could evade detection. The New York Times reported that, at best, the police have been lazy, incompetent and too cozy with the people they should have regarded as suspects. At worst, some officers might be committing crimes themselves.\\" In addition to cash payments, there is concern that Met officers may be influenced by favors or promises of employment, since senior Met officers sometimes land jobs with newspapers. The report of the Home Affairs Select Committee concluded that they were seriously concerned about allocations of payments made to serving police officers.}} =Victims not notified or information not released to them= As of June 2011, according to The Guardian, Scotland Yard is believed to still have hundreds of thousands of documents obtained during investigations into private investigator Jonathan Rees. Rick Davies, reporter for The Guardian, believes review of these \\"boxloads\\" of paperwork could expose explosive new evidence of illegal news- gathering by the News of the World and other news organizations. According to his sources, confidential information sold to newspapers may have been obtained through blagging, burglaries, bribery, and blackmail, sometimes involving corrupt customs officers, VAT inspectors, bank employees and police officers. In 2003, a raid by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) was made as part of Operation Motorman on the home of private investigator Steve Whittamore. This resulted in seizure of records including more than 13,000 requests for confidential information from newspapers and magazines. In 2006, Information Commissioner Richard Thomas stated that hundreds of journalists may have illegally bought private information. In 2006, the Metropolitan Police Service (Scotland Yard) seized records from another private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, and found a target list with over 4,000 names on it. Release of \\"the totality of the Mulcaire information\\" has not yet been achieved but has been requested through the courts. According to The Guardian, that seized material included 4,332 names or partial names, 2,987 mobile phone numbers. 30 audiotapes, and 91 pin codes for accessing voicemail. There is no indication of a systematic effort by the Met to identify or notify the thousands of potential victims whose names were obtained during the taping of Rees's phone in 1999 or the raid on Whittamore's premises in 2003. After the raid on Glenn Mulcaire's premises in 2006, the Met reportedly alerted the royal household and five other victims who would be included on the formal indictment of Mulcaire. The Met also claimed they notified \\"select individuals with national-security concerns: members of the government, the police and the military.\\" The precise number of phone hacking victims is unknown, but a Commons Home Affairs Select Committee report noted in July 2011 that \\"as many as 12,800 people may have been victims or affected by phone hacking.\\" It was estimated in July 2011 that only 170 of these victims had been informed. In October 2011, it was estimated that only 5%, or about 200, of people whose confidential information had been acquired by Mulcaire had been notified. In contrast, John Yates told the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee in September 2009 that the police had only found evidence indicating that \\"it is very few, it is a handful\\" of persons that had been subject to message interception. Further, Mr. Yates assured the public that all those affected had been notified. For this, Yates was criticised by John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee. As late as February 2010, the Met continued refusing to report how many victims it had warned that their voicemail may have been hacked. The first solicitors to win financial settlements for their clients for phone hacking had to deal with the Met as an obstacle rather than a resource. In some cases, the Met's failure to notify potential victims in a timely manner resulted in their having to pay their own solicitors to simply find out whether they had been victims of phone hacking crimes. George Galloway, a member of Parliament, was alerted by a detective that his messages had been hacked in August 2006. Galloway said the detective urged him to change his PIN code. But when Galloway asked who had accessed his phone, the man from Scotland Yard ‚Äúrefused to tell me anything.\\" In most cases, the failure to notify delayed or even precluded legal action by victims against perpetrators. Some possible hacking victims said that by sitting on the evidence for so long, the police have made it impossible to get information from phone companies. Not only were potential victims denied the opportunity to check the call data, which the phone companies only keep for 12 months, they also did not become aware of the desirability of changing their access codes or of considering what damage might have been done to them as a result of interception. Only after The Guardian's article of July 2009 making public the details of the settlement News of the World made with Max Clifford was there a broad initiative by solicitors and barristers to force disclosure of phone hacking evidence held by the Met since at least August 2006.\\" Two dozen people brought civil cases against News International, that forced the Met to release information relating to Mr. Mulcaire. Even then, obtaining useful information from the Met was not easy for victims. A woman who believed her phone had been hacked because details about her life appeared in News of the World wrote to the police for information. Two months later, she received a reply confirming that her number had been found among the documents seized from Mulcaire and suggested she contact her phone-service provider. In summary, according to The New York Times Scotland Yard chose to notify only a fraction of the victims of phone hacking. This had effectively shielded News of the World from many civil lawsuits.}} In the case of four people, including former deputy prime minister John Prescott and former senior police official Brian Paddick, lawyers for the Met told the court phones of the four had not been hacked. It turned out that they had, leading their attorney to accuse the Met of misleading the court. Outraged, Prescott filed suit against the Met because police initially declined to hand over details about him taken from the office of Glenn Mulcaire. =Misled prosecutors, courts, Parliament, and the public= Senior Police officials, both in the Met, City, and other territorial forces have been accused of misleading victims, the public, Parliament, prosecutors, and courts. The public was not generally aware of the narrow interpretation used by the Met of what constituted illegal phone hacking, i.e., it was only considered illegal if the hacker heard the message before the intended victim. Consequently, the Met's indicating there were just a \\"handful\\" of victims misled victims, the public, and Parliament regarding how widespread the practice was of intercepting confidential communications, regardless of when the intended recipient heard them. Scotland Yard originally claimed there were only eight victims. As late at mid-2009, John Yates claimed there were \\"hundreds, not thousands\\" of potential victims. This same narrow interpretation was used by the Met when it assured everyone that all affected individuals had been notified by claiming the police had taken all appropriate action to ensure that people were informed where ever there was evidence of their being subject of any form of phone tapping. In September 2010, Yates told the Home Affairs Select Committee that all reasonable steps had been taken with the major telephone service providers to ensure victims were notified \\"where we had even the minutest possibility they may have been the subject of an attempt to hack or hacking.\\" According to Yates, this included speaking to the potential victims directly or ensuring that a phone company had done so. The four leading mobile phone companies denied that the police asked them to warn any victims. Met officials may have made misleading statements when they gave assurances that no evidence of widespread hacking had been found even though they had not thoroughly searched for it.}} The Crown Prosecution Service (CPP) claimed it was misled by the Met during consultations on how broadly to investigate during the Royal Household/Goodman inquiry. Met officials reportedly didn‚Äôt discuss certain evidence with senior prosecutors, who were later stunned to discover evidence had not been shared. A Met spokesman responded that CPP had access to all the evidence. In its report, the Home Affairs Select Committee did not expressly accuse Mr. Hayman of lying to them but did say that it was difficult to escape the suspicion that he deliberately mislead them. Member of Parliament Chris Bryant directly accused assistant commissioner Yates of misleading two parliamentary committees and of failing to correct himself to Parliament after errors in testimony became apparent to him. Yates responded to accusations by The Guardian by hiring a well known libel firm to threaten legal action against various media outlets for reporting he had misled parliament. \\" Yates legal fees were reportedly paid by the Met. =Discouraging whistleblowers= During parliamentary debate in July 2011, Baroness Berridge observed that more, not fewer, whistleblowers were needed since whistleblowers speak out in the public interest. This is not the same as leaking information. In September 2011, as the Met conducted its three newly initiated investigations of illegal acquisition of confidential information, it pursued ongoing leaks from the Met concerning evidence it held as well as earlier leaks that gave rise to the various investigations. In an apparent effort to discourage future leaks, the Met took the unusual action of invoking the Official Secrets Act, which provides for severe penalties. Specifically, the Met used the Act to call for the journalists at The Guardian to reveal their sources for information upon which the Milly Dowler revelations were based. This action was immediately and widely condemned as an attempt to discourage whistleblowers and intimidate the media. The Guardian reported it had received papers demanding that reporters hand over anything that could lead the police to whistleblower for the Dowler story.}} The Met's action was criticized by chairman Keith Vaz of the Home Affairs Select Committee and chairman John Whittingdale of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee. A representative on freedom of the media for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, wrote to foreign secretary, William Hague expressing concern over the potentially chilling effects on investigative reporting and press freedom.\\" The Met initially sought to clarify its use of the Official Secrets Act but soon retreated from this initiative and withdrew its demand.}} Timeline * 1987 ‚Äì Daniel Morgan is murdered. * April to September 1999 ‚Äì MPS gathers evidence from tap on phone of Jonathan Rees as part of Operation Nigeria. * September 1999 ‚Äì MPS raids Jonathan Rees' premises, seizing a large cache of documents. * Autumn, 2001 ‚Äì Glenn Mulcaire is given a full-time contract to do work for News of the World. * March 2002- Milly Dowler's phone is hacked by agents of News of the World * November 2002- Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) raids John Boyall's premises seizing many documents. * March 2003- ICO raids Steve Whittamore's premises as part of Operation Motorman, seizing a large cache of documents. * February 2004- Whittamore, Boyall, King, and Marshall are arrested and charged with crimes as a result of Metropolitan Police Service investigations under Operation Glade. * April 2005- Whittamore, Boyall, King, and Marshall plead guilty to charges related to illegal acquisition of confidential information. * 29 June 2005- Ross Hall (aka Ross Hindley), journalist at News of the World, sends an email to Glenn Mulcaire titled \\"Transcript for Neville.\\" * November 2005- Senior aides to Britain‚Äôs royal family notice irregularities with their telephone voicemail messages.

His grandmother's South Melbourne address was on the permit but in reality lived in Caulfied, which was in St Kilda's zone.

The ruins are listed as grade II. and the moat, with the surrounding grounds, is a scheduled monument. Excavations carried out between 1964 and 1972 proved that there had been two halls on the island, an earlier large 13th-century building with clay-bonded foundation walls, and a later c. 1450 stone H-plan building. The later building showed signs of renovation in the 16th century, when a paved floor, plaster walls and a chimney were added. History This is the original coat of arms for the Thornhill Family, before they intermarried with the Saviles. In the reign of Henry III, Thornhill Hall was the seat of the Thornhill family, who intermarried with the De Fixbys and Babthorpes in the reigns of Edward I and Edward II. In 1370, in the reign of Edward III, Elizabeth Thornhill, the only child of Simon Thornhill, married Sir Henry Savile. This extinguished the family line of Thornhills of Thornhill which now passed down the Savile line. Thornhill Hall then became the principal seat of the powerful Savile family. The Saviles later intermarried with the Calverley family, so that when Sir John Savile died in 1503 in Thornhill, he left provision in his will for his sister Alice, who had married Sir William Calverley.Will of Sir John Savile, J. W. Clay, Yorkshire Archaeological Journal, 1920 George Savile was created a baronet in 1611. The Saviles remained here until the English Civil War when in 1643 the house was besieged by the forces of Parliament, (having been previously fortified by Sir William Savile, the third baronet of the family). In August 1643 troops of Lady Anne Savile, under Capt. Thos. Paulden defended the hall against the Parliamentary forces under Col. Sir Thos. Fairfax. They were forced to surrender but the hall was accidentally blown up and destroyed. after which the family moved their seat to Rufford Abbey in Nottinghamshire. Some ruins of the house and the moat still remain at Thornhill Rectory Park. This large house had a secret underground passage, that lead to Thornhill Parish Church. just a few hundred yards away from the park. The passage remained until the early 1990s when it was filled in due to safety reasons. Recent events The Heritage Lottery Fund awarded a grant to the architectural study of the ruins in the summer of 2011.

The area is a part of Tinn today. Among his folk tunes are \\"Haavard Gib√∏ens draum ved Oterholtsbrue\\" and \\"Gib√∏ens bruremarsj\\". These tunes formed the basis for two compositions by Edvard Grieg, included in his opus 72, Sl√•tter. Life H√•vard Gib√∏en came from a gifted family, and his father, Knut Gib√∏en, also played the fiddle. His mother, √Ösne, was related to the Berge family at Rauland, to whom many other folk musicians were connected. Like his contemporary Myllarguten, he was taught by the known fiddler Knut Lur√•s from Tinn. H√•vard was of small stature, and played in weddings and at feasts from early on. In his early years, he was so tiny he had to sit on a barrel, placed on a table, to be seen and heard. Unlike Myllarguten, he never left his home area, and hardly travelled farther than Kongsberg. He lived his whole life on his mountain farm, and eventually died there in 1873. His son, Kjetil, and his grandsons after him, were fiddlers in the same tradition - carried on to this very day. Musical style As Myllarguten was known for his improvisations and reshaping of tradition, H√•vard was \\"traditional\\", and kept his fiddle tunes unchanged. Thus, he became a valuable source for an older tradition. H√•vard was reckoned to be introvert, and preferred more melancholic tunes. His tonality, which was passed on after him, was old-fashioned, even \\"medieval\\" to some extent. His musical style were preserved, not only by his sons, but also by the fiddler Knut Dahle and his grandsons in Tinn. In Telemark, it is common knowledge that the tradition of H√•vard survived in the eastern parts, Tinn and Tuddal, while the tradition of Myllarguten was preserved in the west: Rauland and Vinje. The two traditions tend to meed at county of B√∏.

The team was established in 1994 after two local teams, Akamas Polis Chrysochous and Demetrakis Argakas, were united. Early years After the unification of the two local clubs, the whole Chrysochous area was united to provide a single Professional Football Team (EN for Enosis or in English United, A for Akamas and D for Demetrakis ). The team started playing for the local unprofessional championship of the Pafos area. In 2002 EN.A.D. entered the 4th Division of the Cyprus Championship. After a successful year in the 4th Division, the team was promoted to the Cypriot 3rd Division in 2003 where they played for four consecutive seasons. Among their achievements during that period is the participation in the National cup league group stage for the 2004‚Äì05 season, with teams from all professional CFA divisions. In 2007‚Äì08 the club was relegated back to the 4th Division. This was mainly caused through financial problems created by having to play the club‚Äôs home games at other grounds in the Pafos area, away from their own fan base, whilst the Polis Stadium was developed. Nevertheless, after a reestablishment to the management status of the club, in the 2008‚Äì09 season, EN.A.D. managed to return to the 3rd Division, despite the difficulties, which is where they play today. EN.A.D. in their ground ENAD Polis Chrysochous FC at 2010‚Äì11 Cypriot Cup for lower divisions final. ENAD Polis Chrysochous FC at 2012‚Äì13 Cypriot Cup for lower divisions final. The past three seasons have seen the club playing in the new Municipality Stadium of Polis and consolidate its position in the 3rd Division finishing 4th in 2010 ‚Äì 2011 just missing promotion to the 2nd Division. Moreover, during this same season the team won through to the Cup Final for Divisions 3 and 4, but they were defeated 1 ‚Äì 0. With the team returning to its own ground, there was a large increase in the fans support. Indeed, this can be exemplified by the fact that during the past season, EN.A.D. remained undefeated in all home games. Of course, people close to the team know that this is not enough. Increasingly the Club has to make changes to its Financial Structure and Organization to meet the challenges ahead. Their philosophy however is to make the club successful and closer to the community. This in turn and at the same time can help to develop and grow the prosperity and well-being of this region's whole community. EN.A.D. Football Academies After returning to Polis, the academy saw 130 young people receiving expert coaching, with many young players promoting to the First Team making their debuts for the club at the age of even 14 years old. Last season saw the academy Under 17 team achieving 4th position in the Cyprus U-17 National League. This season the club will have a U-21 and U-15 team and it is hoped that more young players will be able to rise to the First Team Squad. Young players are, of course, the life blood of any football club.

Benoist (December 29, 1874 ‚Äì June 14, 1917) was an American aviator and aircraft manufacturer. In an aviation career of only ten years, he formed the world's first aircraft parts distribution company, established one of the leading early American aircraft manufacturing companies and a successful flying school, and from January to April 1914 operated the world's first scheduled airline.airandspacemuseum.org Roos, Frederick W., \\"The Brief, Bright Aviation Career of St. Louis's Tom Benoist,\\" American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., 2005.   = Early life = Thomas Wesley Benoist was born on December 29, 1874, in Irondale, Missouri, the son of Pierre E. Benoist and the former Anna S. Gregory. One of the first industrialists in St. Louis, Missouri, he was a successful businessman in the automobile industry by 1904. = Louisiana Purchase Exposition = In 1904, Benoist was among the sponsors of an unsuccessful lighter-than-air flying machine somewhat similar to a helicopter which the balloonist John Berry attempted to fly at that year's Louisiana Purchase Exposition, also known as the St. Louis World's Fair. While attending the fair, he observed an observation balloon tethered at an altitude of 1,000 feet (305 meters) and glider demonstrations by William Avery, an associate of the noted aviation pioneer Octave Chanute. Despite the failure of Berry's aircraft, what Benoist saw at the fair piqued his interest in aviation, and he oriented his future career toward it. = Aerosco = In 1907, Benoist in partnership with E. Percy Noel founded the Aeronautic Supply Company, known as Aerosco, the world's first aircraft parts distributor. At first, Aerosco limited itself to dealing in raw materials and parts for use in aviation experiments, but it soon expanded to sell kits allowing customers to assemble complete airplanes, including those by leading manufacturers of the day, such as Bl√©riot monoplanes, Curtiss biplanes, Farman biplanes, and Wright Flyers. It also sold a wide range of books on aviation topics. = Aviator = Benoist making his first flight, in a Gill-Curtiss biplane at Kinloch Field in Kinloch, Missouri, on September 18, 1910.Benoist soon purchased a Curtiss-type airplane built by Howard Gill and learned to fly it, making his first flight on September 18, 1910, at the Kinloch Park Aero Club field in Kinloch, Missouri. He gave flying exhibitions in the Midwestern and Southern United States, but an injury he suffered in a flying mishap during one of them prevented him from taking part in an international aviation meet in mid- October 1910. = Aerosco Flying School and Benoist Aircraft Company = In March 1911, Benoist established the Aerosco Flying School at Kinloch Field, and it soon drew students from throughout the United States; it later was renamed the Benoist Flying School. At around the same time, he bought out his partner and moved the original Aerosco company to a larger facility in a suburb of St. Louis, renaming it the Benoist Aircraft Company. With the name change, he reoriented the company from dealing in aviation parts and kits for aircraft by other manufacturers to building airplanes of original design. As an intermediate step, he designed and manufactured a version of the Curtiss- Gill airplane he had purchased in 1910. The flying school and manufacturing concern were both so successful that Benoist airplanes and pilots soon were appearing all over the United States. On October 20, 1911, the Benoist Aircraft factory burned to the ground, destroying five complete airplanes, many tools, machinery, and all of the company's files. Although the loss was not insured, Benoist bounced back quickly, opening a new factory nearby, bringing aviator Tony Jannus - who would soon become its chief pilot - into the company in November 1911, and designing and building the first Benoist airplane of completely original design, the Type XII Headless, before the end of 1911. By 1912, Benoist Aircraft was one of the leading aircraft companies in the world. The Type XII Headless made history when, piloted by Jannus, it carried Albert Berry over Kinloch Field on March 1, 1912, and Berry made the world's first successful parachute jump from an airplane. Improvements in the Type XII led to the development of the Land Tractor Type XII later in the year, which, configured as a floatplane, set a distance record for overwater flight in a journey of 1,973 miles (3,177 km) down the Missouri and Mississippi rivers from Omaha, Nebraska, to New Orleans, Louisiana, between November 6 and December 16, 1912. Jannus performed 42 aerial exhibitions during the trip, exposing thousands of people in the central and southern United States to aviation. In December 1912, Benoist Aircraft produced its first flying boat, the Type XIII Lake Cruiser, which the company demonstrated widely during the summer of 1913. A larger Type XIV flying boat soon followed. During the Great Lakes Reliability Cruise in 1913, Benoist entered three aircraft, flown by Antony Jannus, Hugh Robinson, and Benoist himself. Throughout the spring and summer, Aero and Hydro (a newsletter published by Benoist's partner E. Percy Noel) promoted the Reliability Cruise, listing Benoist aircraft as the first three entrants. = First scheduled airline = In 1913, Percival E. Fansler brought in Benoist to start an air passenger service using Benoist Aircraft's new flying boats to connect St. Petersburg and Tampa, Florida, two cities that otherwise were a day's travel apart at the time. Benoist signed a three-month contract to provide the service with the St. Petersburg Board of Trade on December 17, 1913, subsidizing 50% of the costs for starting the airline. Benoist initiated the service, the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line, using a Benoist XIV flying boat, on January 1, 1914. It was the first scheduled airline service in the world. Two Benoist XIVs provided twice-daily service across Tampa Bay and by the time the initial contract expired on March 31, 1914, had transported 1,204 passengers without injury, losing only four days to mechanical problems. A decline in business led the airline to shut down in late April 1914 and sell its two flying boats. = Transatlantic flight ambition = In early 1913, Benoist and Jannus initiated the development of a large new flying boat capable of transatlantic flight. When in early 1914 the Daily Mail of London offered a $50,000 prize for the first transatlantic flight of under 72 hours, the two men developed the Type XV flying boat, capable of remaining aloft for 40 hours with six passengers on board. It was ready to fly in 1915, but by then the outbreak of World War I in late July 1914 had made a transatlantic attempt impossible. Benoist Aircraft and the St. Louis Car Company jointly proposed the construction of 5,000 Type XVs for the United Kingdom for use on antisubmarine patrols, but the British preferred Curtiss flying boats and nothing came of the idea. = Financial troubles and later designs = Unable to secure a large contract for its airplanes during the war, Benoist Aircraft began to experience financial problems by 1915. To reduce costs, Benoist moved the company first to Chicago, Illinois, and then to Sandusky, Ohio, where it affiliated with the Roberts Motor Company, which was Benoist's preferred source for aircraft engines. Benoist designed the Type XVI flying boat and Type XVII landplane, both of which appeared in 1916. = Death = On June 14, 1917, Benoist died when he struck his head against a telephone pole while stepping off a streetcar in front of the Roberts Motor Company in Sandusky. With him gone and facing continued financial problems, the Benoist Aircraft Company and the Roberts Motor Company both went out of business in early 1918. Benoist Aircraft had built just over 100 airplanes in its history by the time it ceased operations. Benoist is buried at Hopewell Cemetery in Hopewell in Washington County, Missouri.

It gave rise to the wider Occupy movement in the United States and other countries. The Canadian anti-consumerist and pro- environment group/magazine Adbusters initiated the call for a protest. The main issues raised by Occupy Wall Street were social and economic inequality, greed, corruption and the undue influence of corporations on government‚Äîparticularly from the financial services sector. The OWS slogan, \\"We are the 99%\\", refers to income and wealth inequality in the U.S. between the wealthiest 1% and the rest of the population. To achieve their goals, protesters acted on consensus-based decisions made in general assemblies which emphasized redress through direct action over the petitioning to authorities. The protesters were forced out of Zuccotti Park on November 15, 2011. Protesters then turned their focus to occupying banks, corporate headquarters, board meetings, foreclosed homes, and college and university campuses. Origins The original protest was called for by Kalle Lasn and others of Adbusters, a Canadian anti-consumerist publication, who conceived of a September 17 occupation in Lower Manhattan. The first such proposal appeared on the Adbusters website on February 2, 2011, under the title \\"A Million Man March on Wall Street.\\" Lasn registered the OccupyWallStreet.org web address on June 9. The website has since been taken down. That same month, Adbusters emailed its subscribers saying \\"America needs its own Tahrir.\\" White said the reception of the idea \\"snowballed from there\\". In a blog post on July 13, 2011, Adbusters proposed a peaceful occupation of Wall Street to protest corporate influence on democracy, the lack of legal consequences for those who brought about the global crisis of monetary insolvency, and an increasing disparity in wealth. The protest was promoted with an image featuring a dancer atop Wall Street's iconic Charging Bull statue. Meanwhile, several similar proposals were being explored by independent groups, as reported by journalist Nathan Schneider in his book Thank You, Anarchy: Notes from the Occupy Apocalypse. Thousands of people organized by a group of labor unions marched on Wall Street 12; the online collective Anonymous attempted an occupation on June 14; activists planned an indefinite occupation of Freedom Plaza in Washington, D.C., which eventually became known as Occupy Washington, D.C.; in New York City a group of protesters met for several months to plan an occupation which was originally to be stationed at Chase Plaza, with Zucotti Park as \\"Plan B\\". On August 1, 2011, almost a month prior to the major media event, a group of artists were arrested after a series of days protesting nude as an art performance on Wall Street. This event may have inspired or triggered the major event to follow. This was a protest by the 49 participants on American Institutions and was titled \\"Ocularpation: Wall Street\\" by artist Zefrey Throwell. Then in an unrelated incident, a group called New Yorkers Against Budget Cuts (NYAB) was formed, which promoted a \\"sleep in\\" in lower Manhattan called \\"Bloombergville\\", in July 2011, preceding OWS, and provided a number of activists to begin organizing. Activist, anarchist and anthropologist David Graeber and several of his associates attended the NYAB general assembly but, disappointed that the event was intended to be a precursor to marching on Wall Street with predetermined demands, Graeber and his small group created their own general assembly, which eventually developed into the New York General Assembly. The group began holding weekly meetings to work out issues and the movement's direction, such as whether or not to have a set of demands, forming working groups and whether or not to have leaders. The Internet group Anonymous created a video encouraging its supporters to take part in the protests. The U.S. Day of Rage, a group that organized to protest \\"corporate influence [that] corrupts our political parties, our elections, and the institutions of government\\", also joined the movement. The protest itself began on September 17; a Facebook page for the demonstrations began two days later on September 19 featuring a YouTube video of earlier events. By mid- October, Facebook listed 125 Occupy-related pages. The original location for the protest was One Chase Manhattan Plaza, with Bowling Green Park (the site of the \\"Charging Bull\\") and Zuccotti Park as alternate choices. Police discovered this before the protest began and fenced off two locations; but they left Zuccotti Park, the group's third choice, open. Since the park was private property, police could not legally force protesters to leave without being requested to do so by the property owner. At a press conference held the same day the protests began, New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg explained, \\"people have a right to protest, and if they want to protest, we'll be happy to make sure they have locations to do it.\\" Because of its connection to the financial system, lower Manhattan has seen many riots and protests since the 1800s, and OWS has been compared to other historical protests in the United States. Commentators have put OWS within the political tradition of other movements that made themselves known by occupation of public spaces, such as Coxey's Army in 1894, the Bonus Marchers in 1932, and the May Day protesters in 1971. More recent prototypes for OWS include the British student protests of 2010, 2009-2010 Iranian election protests, the Arab Spring protests, and, more closely related, protests in Chile, Greece, Spain and India. These antecedents have in common with OWS a reliance on social media and electronic messaging, as well as the belief that financial institutions, corporations, and the political elite have been malfeasant in their behavior toward youth and the middle class. Occupy Wall Street, in turn, gave rise to the Occupy movement in the United States. David Graeber has argued that the Occupy movement, in its anti-hierarchical and anti-authoritarian consensus-based politics, its refusal to accept the legitimacy of the existing legal and political order, and its embrace of prefigurative politics, has roots in an anarchist political tradition. Sociologist Dana Williams has likewise argued that \\"the most immediate inspiration for Occupy is anarchism\\", and the LA Times has identified the \\"controversial, anarchist-inspired organizational style\\" as one of the hallmarks of OWS. Background = \\"We are the 99%\\" = \\"We Are The 99%\\" The Occupy protesters' slogan \\"We are the 99%\\" referred to the protester's perceptions of, and attitudes regarding, income disparity in the US and economic inequality in general, which were main issues for OWS. It derives from a \\"We the 99%\\" flyer calling for OWS's second General Assembly in August 2011. The variation \\"We are the 99%\\" originated from a Tumblr page of the same name. Huffington Post reporter Paul Taylor said the slogan was \\"arguably the most successful slogan since 'Hell no, we won't go!'\\" of the Vietnam War era, and that the majority of Democrats, independents and Republicans saw the income gap as causing social friction. The slogan was boosted by statistics which were confirmed by a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report released in October 2011. =Income and wealth inequality= A chart showing the disparity in income distribution in the United States. Wealth inequality and income inequality have been central concerns among OWS protesters. Income inequality and Wealth Inequality were focal points of the Occupy Wall Street protests. This focus by the movement was studied by Arindajit Dube and Ethan Kaplan of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who noted that \\"inequality in the U.S. has risen dramatically over the past 40 years. So it is not too surprising to witness the rise of a social movement focused on redistribution ... Greater inequality may reflect as well as exacerbate factors that make it relatively more difficult for lower-income individuals to mobilize on behalf of their interests ... Yet, even the economic crisis of 2007 did not initially produce a left social movement ... Only after it became increasingly clear that the political process was unable to enact serious reforms to address the causes or consequences of the economic crisis did we see the emergence of the OWS movement ... Overall, a focus on the 1 percent concentrates attention on the aspect of inequality most clearly tied to the distribution of income between labor and capital ... We think OWS has already begun to influence the public policy making process.\\" An article on the same subject published in Salon Magazine by Natasha Leonard noted \\"Occupy has been central to driving media stories about income inequality in America. Late last week, Radio Dispatch's John Knefel compiled a report for media watchdog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR), which illustrates Occupy's success: Media focus on the movement in the past half year, according to the report, has been almost directly proportional to the attention paid to income inequality and corporate greed by mainstream outlets. During peak media coverage of the movement last October, mentions of the term \\"income inequality\\" increased \\"fourfold\\"... tokens of Occupy rhetoric ‚Äî most notably the idea of a \\"99 percent\\" against a \\"1 percent\\" ‚Äî has seeped into everyday cultural parlance.\\" As income inequality remained on people's minds, Republican Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney said such a focus was about envy and class warfare. = Goals = occupied by protesters. OWS's goals included a reduction in the influence of corporations on politics, more balanced distribution of income, more and better jobs, bank reform (especially to curtail speculative trading by banks), forgiveness of student loan debt or other relief for indebted students, and alleviation of the foreclosure situation. Some media labeled the protests \\"anti-capitalist\\", while others disputed the relevance of this label. Nicholas Kristof of The New York Times noted \\"while alarmists seem to think that the movement is a 'mob' trying to overthrow capitalism, one can make a case that, on the contrary, it highlights the need to restore basic capitalist principles like accountability\\". Rolling Stone writer Matt Taibbi asserted, \\"These people aren't protesting money. They're not protesting banking. They're protesting corruption on Wall Street.\\" In contradiction to such views, academic Slavoj Zizek wrote, \\"capitalism is now clearly re-emerging as the name of the problem,\\" and Forbes columnist Heather Struck wrote, \\"In downtown New York, where protests fomented, capitalism is held accountable for the dire conditions that a majority of Americans face amid high unemployment and a credit collapse that has ruined the housing market and tightened lending among banks.\\" Some protesters favored a fairly concrete set of national policy proposals. One OWS group that favored specific demands created a document entitled the 99 Percent Declaration, but this was regarded as an attempt to \\"co-opt\\" the \\"Occupy\\" name, and the document and group were rejected by the General Assemblies of Occupy Wall Street and Occupy Philadelphia. However others, such as those who issued the Liberty Square Blueprint, are opposed to setting demands, saying they would limit the movement by implying conditions and limiting the duration of the movement. David Graeber, an OWS participant, also criticized the idea that the movement must have clearly defined demands, arguing that it would be a counterproductive legitimization of the power structures the movement sought to challenge. In a similar vein, scholar and activist Judith Butler challenged the assertion that OWS should make concrete demands: \\"So what are the demands that all these people are making? Either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused. Or they say that demands for social equality, that demands for economic justice are impossible demands and impossible demands are just not practical. But we disagree. If hope is an impossible demand then we demand the impossible.\\" Regardless, activists favored a new system that fulfills what is perceived as the original promise of democracy to bring power to all the people. During the occupation in Liberty Square, a declaration was issued with a list of grievances. The declaration stated that the \\"grievances are not all-inclusive\\". = Protester demographics = Early on the protesters were mostly young. As the protest grew, older protesters also became involved. The average age of the protesters was 33, with people in their 20s balanced by people in their 40s. Various religious faiths have been represented at the protest including Muslims, Jews, and Christians. Rabbi Chaim Gruber, however, is reportedly the only clergy member to have actually camped at Zuccotti Park. The Associated Press reported in October that there was \\"diversity of age, gender and race\\" at the protest. A study based on survey responses at OccupyWallSt.org reported that the protesters were 81.2% White, 6.8% Hispanic, 2.8% Asian, 1.6% Black, and 7.6% identifying as \\"other\\". According to a survey of occupywallst.org website visitors by the Baruch College School of Public Affairs published on October 19, of 1,619 web respondents, one-third were older than 35, half were employed full-time, 13% were unemployed and 13% earned over $75,000. When given the option of identifying themselves as Democratic, Republican or Independent/Other 27.3% of the respondents called themselves Democrats, 2.4% called themselves Republicans, while the rest, 70%, called themselves independents. A study released by City University of New York found that over a third of protesters had incomes over $100,000, 76% had bachelor's degrees, and 39% had graduate degrees. While a large percent of them were employed, they largely reported they were \\"unconstrained by highly demanding family or work commitments\\". The study also found that they disproportionally represented upper-class, highly educated white males. A survey of 301 respondents by a Fordham University political science professor identified the protester's political affiliations as 25% Democratic, 2% Republican, 11% Socialist, 11% Green Party, 0% Tea Party, and 12% \\"Other\\"; meanwhile, 39% of the respondents said they did not identify with any political party. Ideologically the Fordham survey found 39% self-identifying as extremely liberal, 33% as Liberal, 8% as slightly liberal, 15% as moderate/\\"middle of the road\\", 2% as slightly conservative, 3% as conservative, and 1% as extremely conservative.http://www.fordham.edu/download/downloads/id/2538/occupy_wall_street_survey.pdf = Main organization = Protesters engaging in the 'human microphone' The assembly was the main OWS decision-making body and used a modified consensus process, where participants attempted to reach consensus and then dropped to a 9/10 vote if consensus was not reached. Assembly meetings involved OWS working groups and affinity groups, and were open to the public for both attendance and speaking. The meetings lacked formal leadership. Participants commented upon committee proposals using a process called a \\"stack\\", which is a queue of speakers that anyone can join. New York used a progressive stack, in which people from marginalized groups are sometimes allowed to speak before people from dominant groups. Facilitators and \\"stack-keepers\\" urge speakers to \\"step forward, or step back\\" based on which group they belong to, meaning that women and minorities often moved to the front of the line, while white men often had to wait for a turn to speak. In addition to the over 70 working groups, the organizational structure also includes \\"spokes councils\\", at which every working group can participate. = Funding = During the initial weeks of the park encampment it was reported that most of OWS funding was coming from donors with incomes in the $50,000 to $100,000 range, and the median donation was $22. According to finance group member Pete Dutro, OWS had accumulated over $700,000. The largest single donor to the movement was former New York Mercantile Exchange vice chairman Robert Halper, who was noted by media as having also given the maximum allowable campaign contribution to Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. During the period that protesters were encamped in the park the funds were being used to purchase food and other necessities and to bail out fellow protesters. With the closure of the park to overnight camping on November 15, members of the OWS finance committee stated they would initiate a process to streamline the movement and re-evaluate their budget and eliminate or merge some of the \\"working groups\\" they no longer needed on a day-to-day basis. Met with increasing costs and significant overhead expenses in order to sustain the movement, an internal audit from the fiscal management team known as the \\"accounting working group\\" revealed on March 2, 2012, that only $44,000 of the several hundred thousand dollars raised still remained available. The report warned that if current revenues and expenses were maintained at current levels, then funds would run out in three weeks. Some of the movement's biggest costs include ground-level activities such as food kitchens, street medics, bus tickets, subway passes, and printing expenses. In late February 2012 it was reported that a group of business leaders including Ben Cohen, Jerry Greenfield, Danny Goldberg, Norman Lear, and Terri Gardner created a new working group, the Movement Resource Group, and with it have pledged $300,000 with plans to add $1,500,000 more. The money would be made available in the form of grants of up to $25,000 for eligible recipients. = The People's Library = The People's Library at Occupy Wall Street was started a few days after the protest when a pile of books was left in a cardboard box at Zuccotti Park. The books were passed around and organized, and as time passed, it received additional books and resources from readers, private citizens, authors and corporations. As of November 2011 the library had 5,554 books cataloged in LibraryThing and its collection was described as including some rare or unique articles of historical interest. According to American Libraries, the library's collection had \\"thousands of circulating volumes\\", which included \\"holy books of every faith, books reflecting the entire political spectrum, and works for all ages on a huge range of topics.\\" Following the example of the OWS People's Library, protesters throughout North America and Europe formed sister libraries at their encampments. Zuccotti Park encampment People's Library\\" with over 5,000 books, wi-fi internet, and a reference service, often staffed by professional librarians, procuring material through the interlibrary loan system. Prior to being closed to overnight use and during the occupation of the space, somewhere between 100 and 200 people slept in Zuccotti Park. Initially tents were not allowed and protesters slept in sleeping bags or under blankets. Meal service started at a total cost of about $1,000 per day. While some visitors ate at nearby restaurants, according to the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post many businesses surrounding the park were adversely affected. Contribution boxes collected about $5,000 a day, and supplies came in from around the country. Eric Smith, a local chef who was laid off at the Sheraton in Midtown, said that he was running a five-star restaurant in the park. In late October, kitchen volunteers complained about working 18-hour days to feed people who were not part of the movement and served only brown rice, simple sandwiches, and potato chips for three days. Many protesters used the bathrooms of nearby business establishments. Some supporters donated use of their bathrooms for showers and the sanitary needs of protesters. New York City requires a permit to use \\"amplified sound\\", including electric bullhorns. Since Occupy Wall Street did not have a permit, the protesters created the \\"human microphone\\" in which a speaker pauses while the nearby members of the audience repeat the phrase in unison. The effect has been called \\"comic or exhilarating‚Äîoften all at once.\\" Some feel this provided a further unifying effect for the crowd. During the weeks that overnight use of the park was allowed, a separate area was set aside for an information area which contained laptop computers and several wireless routers. The items were powered with gas generators until the New York City Fire Department removed them on October 28, saying they were a fire hazard. Protesters then used bicycles rigged with an electricity-generating apparatus to charge batteries to power the protesters' laptops and other electronics. According to the Columbia Journalism Reviews New Frontier Database, the media team, while unofficial, ran websites like Occupytogether.org, video livestream, a \\"steady flow of updates on Twitter, and Tumblr\\" as well as Skype sessions with other demonstrators. Zuccotti Park, cleared and cleaned on November 15, 2011 On October 6, Brookfield Office Properties, which owns Zuccotti Park, issued a statement saying: \\"Sanitation is a growing concern ... Normally the park is cleaned and inspected every weeknight [but] because the protesters refuse to cooperate ... the park has not been cleaned since Friday, September 16 and as a result, sanitary conditions have reached unacceptable levels.\\" On October 13, New York City's mayor Bloomberg and Brookfield announced that the park must be vacated for cleaning the following morning at 7 am. However, protesters vowed to \\"defend the occupation\\" after police said they would not allow them to return with sleeping bags and other gear following the cleaning, and many protesters spent the night sweeping and mopping the park. The next morning the property owner postponed its cleaning effort. Having prepared for a confrontation with the authorities to prevent the cleaning effort from proceeding, some protesters clashed with police in riot gear outside City Hall after it was canceled. MTV followed two protesters for their series True Life; one of whom, Bryan, was on the sanitation crew. Filming took place during the time when the cleanup happened. On October 20, residents at a community board meeting complained about inadequate sanitation, verbal taunts and harassment by protesters, noise, and related issues. One resident angrily complained that the protesters \\"[a]re defecating on our doorsteps\\"; board member Tricia Joyce said, \\"They have to have some parameters. That doesn't mean the protests have to stop. I'm hoping we can strike a balance on parameters because this could be a long term stay.\\" Shortly after midnight on November 15, 2011, the New York City Police Department gave protesters notice from the park's owner (Brookfield Office Properties) to leave Zuccotti Park due to its purportedly unsanitary and hazardous conditions. The notice stated that they could return without sleeping bags, tarps or tents. About an hour later, police in riot gear began removing protesters from the park, arresting some 200 people in the process, including a number of journalists. Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello playing Occupy Wall Street in New York, October 2011 On December 31, 2011, protesters started to re-occupy the park. At one point, protesters started to push police barricades into the streets. Police quickly put the barricades back up. Occupiers then started to take down barricades from all sides of the park and stored them in a pile in the middle of Zuccotti Park. Police called in reinforcements as more activists entered the park. Police tried to enter the park but were pushed back by protesters. There were reports of pepper-spray being used by the police. At about 12:40 am, after the group celebrated New Years in the park, they exited the park and marched down Broadway. Police in riot gear started to clear out the park around 1:30 am. Sixty-eight people were arrested in connection with the event, including one accused of stabbing a police officer in the hand with a pair of scissors. When the Zuccotti Park encampment was closed, some former campers were allowed to sleep in local churches. Since the removal, New York protesters have been divided in their opinion as to the importance of the occupation of a space, with some believing that actual encampment is unnecessary, and even a burden. Since the closure of the Zuccotti Park encampment, the movement has turned its focus on occupying banks, corporate headquarters, board meetings, foreclosed homes, college and university campuses, and Wall Street itself. Since its inception, the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York City have cost the city an estimated $17 million in overtime fees to provide policing of protests and encampment inside Zuccotti Park. On March 17, 2012, Occupy Wall Street demonstrators attempted to mark the movement's six-month anniversary by reoccupying Zuccotti Park. Protesters were soon cleared away by police, who made over 70 arrests. Veteran protesters said the force used by police was the most violent they had witnessed and a Guardian reporter witnessed a protester being slammed into a glass door by a police officer. On March 24, hundreds of OWS protesters marched from Zuccotti Park to Union Square in a demonstration against police violence. On September 17, 2012, protesters returned to Zuccotti Park to mark the one-year anniversary of the beginning of the occupation. Protesters blocked access to the New York Stock Exchange as well as other intersections in the area. This, along with several violations of Zuccotti Park rules, led police to surround groups of protesters, at times pulling protesters from the crowds to be arrested for blocking pedestrian traffic. A police lieutenant instructed reporters not to take pictures. The New York Times reported that two officers shoved city councilman Jumaane D. Williams off a bench with batons after he refused two orders to move. A spokesman for Williams later stated that he had been pushed by police while trying to explain his reason for being in the park, but was not arrested or injured. There were 185 arrests across the city.  Occupy media  Occupy Wall Street activists disseminated their movement updates through variety of mediums, including social media, print magazines, newspapers, film, radio and live stream. Like much of Occupy, many of these alternative media projects were collectively managed, while autonomous from the decision making bodies of Occupy Wall Street. = Occupied Media Pamphlet Series = Occupied Media Pamphlet Series, published by Zuccotti Park Press was co-founded by Open Magazine Pamphlet Series and Adelante Alliance. A published series of 5 mini- books available for purchase, by different renowned academics and activists offering their perspectives and visions for the Occupy movement. Occupy, the first book in the series, by Noam Chomsky was launched on May 1, 2012. = Occupied Wall Street Journal = Arun Gupta, editor of Occupied Wall Street Journal holding a copy of the first issue, standing inside Zuccotti Park. The Occupied Wall Street Journal (OWSJ) was a free newspaper founded in October 2011 by independent journalists Arun Gupta, Jed Brandt and Michael Levitin.  Over $75,000 was raised through Kickstarter to fund the distribution and printing of the newspaper. Indypendent Media provided the printing facilities. It featured the voices of prominent activist/academics as well as lesser known members of the 99% in four page color issues. The first issue had a total print run of 70,000 copies, along with an unspecified number in Spanish. Its last article appeared in February 2012. OWSJ was not an official organ of the Occupy movement, but it did publish official statements of the Occupy movement, for example, in its first issue, it disseminated The Declaration of Occupy Wall Street and meeting minutes from the General Assembly decision-making bodies. = Occuprint = Occupier reading the special edition of Occupied Wall Street, with posters curated by Occuprint. The Occuprint collective, founded by Jesse Goldstein and Josh MacPhee, formed through the curation of the fourth and special edition of The Occupied Wall Street Journal (OWSJ), featuring 21 posters and graphics highlighting Occupy art. Afterwards, it continued to collect and publish images under the Creative Commons for non commercial use license, to spread the artwork throughout the movement. In addition to sending out posters across the different Occupy encampments, Occuprint collaborated with the OWS Screen Printing Guild to make buttons and silk screen clothing free of cost. Jesse Goldstein, Dave Loewenstein, Alexandra Clotfelter and Marshall Weber of Booklyn Artist Alliance selected 31 hand silk-screened prints out of hundreds of submissions, with the goal that limited editions of them end up in museums, libraries, archive centers and universities, preserving and sharing Occupy's legacy. Tens of thousands more copies were distributed for free across the country to different Occupy groups. In October 2013, the Museum of Modern Art confirmed it acquired the originals of the Occuprint portfolio. As part of the Occupy Sandy disaster response to Hurricane Sandy, Occuprint created a 12-page resource pamphlet on how to survive and seek help, after determining that the FEMA booklets were incomplete. 6,000 copies were made in first print run, with a total circulation of 12,000. = Occupy! Gazette = The Occupy! Gazette was founded by editors Astra Taylor, Keith Gessen of N+1 and Sarah Leonard of Dissent Magazine. It published five issues from October 2011 to September 2012, with a commemorative sixth issue published in May 2014, to support OWS activist Cecily McMillan during the sentencing phase of her trial. Each issue ranged from thirty to forty pages and was featured in a different color theme each time. Articles from Occupy! were later anthologized in a book titled Occupy!: Scenes From Occupied America, published by Verso Books in 2012. = Tidal = Tidal: Occupy Theory, Occupy Strategy magazine was published twice a year, with its first release in December 2011, the fourth and final issue in March 2013. It consisted of long essays, poetry and art within thirty pages. Each issue had a circulation of 12,000 to 50,000. Security, crime and legal issues OWS demonstrators complained of thefts of assorted items such as cell phones and laptops; thieves also stole $2,500 of donations that were stored in a makeshift kitchen. In November, a man was arrested for breaking an EMT's leg. NYPD spokesman Paul Browne said protesters delayed reporting crime until three complaints were made against the same individual. The protesters denied a \\"three strikes policy\\", and one protester told the New York Daily News that he had heard police respond to an unspecified complaint by saying, \\"You need to deal with that yourselves\\". After several weeks of occupation, protesters had made enough allegations of rape, sexual assault, and gropings that women- only sleeping tents were set up. Occupy Wall Street organizers released a statement regarding the sexual assaults stating, \\"As individuals and as a community, we have the responsibility and the opportunity to create an alternative to this culture of violence, We are working for an OWS and a world in which survivors are respected and supported unconditionally ... We are redoubling our efforts to raise awareness about sexual violence. This includes taking preventive measures such as encouraging healthy relationship dynamics and consent practices that can help to limit harm.\\" It was revealed that an internal Department of Homeland Security report warned that Occupy Wall Street protests were a potential source of violence; the report stated that \\"mass gatherings associated with public protest movements can have disruptive effects on transportation, commercial, and government services, especially when staged in major metropolitan areas\\". The DHS keeps a file on the movement and monitors social media for information, according to leaked emails released by WikiLeaks.  Government crackdowns  = Surveillance = An internal document of the United States Department of Homeland Security showed that the U.S. government was keeping tabs on protesters As the movement spread across the United States, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) began keeping tabs on protesters. A DHS report entitled \\"SPECIAL COVERAGE: Occupy Wall Street\\", dated October 2011, observed that \\"mass gatherings associated with public protest movements can have disruptive effects on transportation, commercial, and government services, especially when staged in major metropolitan areas.\\" On December 21, 2012, Partnership for Civil Justice obtained and published U.S. government documents revealing that over a dozen local FBI field offices, DHS and other federal agencies monitored Occupy Wall Street, despite labeling it a peaceful movement.Revealed: how the FBI coordinated the crackdown on Occupy, The Guardian, Naomi Wolf, December 29, 2012, http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/29/fbi-coordinated- crackdown-occupy The New York Times reported in May 2014 that declassified documents showed extensive surveillance of OWS related groups across the country.Moynihan, Colin. \\"Officials Cast Wide Net in Monitoring Occupy Protests.\\" The New York Times. The New York Times, May 22, 2014. Web. May 30, 2014. https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/23/us/officials-cast-wide-net-in- monitoring-occupy-protests.html Site where the Brooklyn Bridge Arrest took place = Arrests = Gideon Oliver, who represented Occupy with the National Lawyers Guild in New York, said about 2,000 [protesters] had been arrested just in New York City alone. Most of these arrests in New York and elsewhere, are on charges of disorderly conduct, trespassing, and failure to disperse. Nationally, a little under 8,000 Occupy affiliated arrests have been documented by tallying numbers published in local newspapers. In a report that followed an eight-month study, researchers at the law schools of NYU and Fordham accuse the NYPD of deploying unnecessarily aggressive force, obstructing press freedoms and making arbitrary and baseless arrests.  Brooklyn Bridge arrests  On October 1, 2011, a large group of protesters set out to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge resulting in 768 arrests, the largest number of arrests in one day at any Occupy event. Some said the police had tricked protesters, allowing them onto the bridge, and even escorting them partway across. Jesse A. Myerson, a media coordinator for Occupy Wall Street said, \\"The cops watched and did nothing, indeed, seemed to guide us onto the roadway.\\" A spokesman for the New York Police Department, Paul Browne, said that protesters were given multiple warnings to stay on the sidewalk and not block the street, and were arrested when they refused. By October 2, all but 20 of the arrestees had been released with citations for disorderly conduct and a criminal court summons. On October 4, a group of protesters who were arrested on the bridge filed a lawsuit against the city, alleging that officers had violated their constitutional rights by luring them into a trap and then arresting them. In June 2012, a federal judge ruled that the protesters had not received sufficient warning. = Court cases = In May 2012, three cases in a row were thrown out of court, the most recent one for \\"insufficient summons\\". In another case, photographer Alexander Arbuckle was charged with blocking traffic for standing in the middle of the street, according to NYPD Officer Elisheba Vera. However, according to Village Voice staff writer Nick Pinto, this account was not corroborated by photographic and video evidence taken by protesters and the NYPD. In yet another case, Sgt. Michael Soldo, the arresting officer, said Jessica Hall was blocking traffic. But under cross-examination Soldo admitted, it was actually the NYPD metal barricades which blocked traffic. This was also corroborated by the NYPD's video documentation. In 2011, eight men associated with Occupy Wall Street were found guilty of trespassing, having intended to set up a camp on property controlled by Trinity Church. One was also convicted of attempted criminal mischief and attempted criminal possession of burglar's tools for trying to slice a lock on a chain-link fence with bolt cutters, spending a month in prison. The rest were sentenced to community service. One defendant, Michael Premo, charged with assaulting an officer, was found not guilty after the defense presented video evidence which \\"showed officers charging into the defendant unprovoked\\", contradicting the sworn testimony of NYPD officers. A court has ordered that the City pay $360,000 for their actions during the November 15, 2011 raid. That case, Occupy Wall Street v. City of New York, was filed in the US District Court Southern District of New York. Further, the City of New York has since begun settling cases with individual participants. The first of which was most notably represented by students of Hofstra Law School and the Occupy Wall Street Clinic. Nkrumah Tinsley was indicted on riot offenses and assaulting a police officer during the Zuccotti Park encampment. On May 21, 2013 Tinsley pleaded guilty to felony assault on a police officer, and will be sentenced later 2013.NYS Court's official website  log on as public user, type in defendant's name, and look at the charges In April 2014, the final Occupy court case, the Trial of Cecily McMillan began. Cecily McMillan was charged with and convicted of assaulting a police officer and sentenced to 90 days in Rikers Island Penitentiary. McMillan claimed the assault was an accident and a response to what she claimed to be a sexual assault at the hands of said officer. The jury that found her guilty recommended no jail time. She was released after serving 60 days.  Anarchism  Many commentators have stated that the Occupy Wall Street movement has roots in the philosophy of anarchism. David Graeber, an early organizer of the movement, is a self-proclaimed anarchist. Graeber, writing for The Guardian, has argued that anarchist principles of direct action, direct democracy and rejection of existing political institutions are the foundations of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Graber associated Occupy with anarchism ideology because of Occupy's refusal to make demands on the existing state. The view was that had Occupy made demands, it would be reiterating the legitimacy of the people who made the demands; refraining from making demands, Occupy refused to legitimize the existing political structure of the United States. Graeber also believes that radical segments of the civil rights movement, the anti-nuclear movement and the global justice movement have been based on the same principles. As \\"Occupy\\" encompassed a range of perspectives, some participants viewed it as an anarchist movement and others argued it could not be labeled as such. John L. Hammond attributes three core Occupy beliefs and practices ‚Äì horizontalism, autonomy, and defiance ‚Äì as also being anarchist values and argued that Occupy's emphasis on the experience of occupation aligns with the principles of libertarian anarchists. Horizontalism, meaning an equal distribution of power, was demonstrated through the creation of a direct democracy that eliminated hierarchy and representative structures. Occupy operated using mutualism and self-organization as its principles. The General Assemblies practiced direct democracy using consensus to the extent of practicality. Outside of the General Assemblies, Occupy protesters organized into decentralized groups. Occupy's practice of horizontal organization rejected the legitimacy of the existing hierarchical political structure in the United States. Some writers have argued that by questioning institutions like the existing state Occupy demonstrated both autonomy and defiance. Thai Jones, an anarchist writing for the Jewish-American weekly newspaper, The Forward, asserted that the Occupy movement demonstrated that the invigorating potential of anarchist political theory can be a feasible model of governance. According to Jones, contemporary anarchists involved in the Occupy Wall Street movement face the same dilemma as their early predecessors ‚Äî whether to use violence. Michael Kazin, writing for The New Republic, analyzed the composition of the Occupy Wall Street movement. He argued that Occupy members are different from political activists of the late 19th century and early 20th century counterparts, citing contemporary rejection of violent methods as the main difference. Kazin described the Occupy Wall Street anarchists as \\"ultra- egalitarian, radically environmentalist, effortlessly multicultural and scrupulously non-violent\\", describing them as the \\"cyber-clever progeny of Henry David Thoreau and Emma Goldman.\\" Social media played a vital role in the Occupy movement and Kazin noted that instead of authoring essays or promoting feminism and free love, the Occupy Wall Street anarchists stream videos and arrange flash mobs. In November 2011, approximately 100 people participated in Portland's \\"Anarchist General Assembly\\" and discussed ways to spread anarchist ideas and how to interact with police. The organizers of the assembly published a flier that read, \\"This is a call to the anarchist and broader anti-authoritarian community to reconvene in assembly and continue to develop ourselves as members of a larger network here in Portland.\\" Notable responses October 5, 2011, in Foley Square, members of National Nurses United labor union supporting OWS During an October 6 news conference, President Barack Obama said, \\"I think it expresses the frustrations the American people feel, that we had the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression, huge collateral damage all throughout the country ... and yet you're still seeing some of the same folks who acted irresponsibly trying to fight efforts to crack down on the abusive practices that got us into this in the first place.\\" On October 5, 2011, noted commentator and political satirist Jon Stewart said in his Daily Show broadcast: \\"If the people who were supposed to fix our financial system had actually done it, the people who have no idea how to solve these problems wouldn't be getting shit for not offering solutions.\\" Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said that while there were \\"bad actors\\" that needed to be \\"found and plucked out\\", he believes that targeting one industry or region of America is a mistake and views encouraging the Occupy Wall Street protests as \\"dangerous\\" and inciting \\"class warfare\\". Romney later expressed sympathy for the movement, saying, \\"I look at what's happening on Wall Street and my view is, boy, I understand how those people feel.\\" House Democratic Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi said she supports the Occupy Wall Street movement. In September, various labor unions, including the Transport Workers Union of America Local 100 and the New York Metro 32BJ Service Employees International Union, pledged their support for demonstrators. Five days into the protest, political commentator Keith Olbermann, formerly of CurrentTV, vocally criticized mainstream media outlets for failing to cover the initial Wall Street protests and demonstrations adequately. On October 19, 2011, Greenpeace Executive Director Phil Radford spoke on behalf of Greenpeace supporting Occupy Wall Street protesters, stating: \\"We stand ‚Äì as individuals and an organization ‚Äì with Occupiers of all walks of life who peacefully stand up for a just, democratic, green and peaceful future.\\" The Internet Archive and the Occupy Archive, a project at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University, has been collecting material from Occupy sites beyond New York. In November 2011, Public Policy Polling did a national survey which found that 33% of voters supported OWS and 45% opposed it, with 22% not sure. 43% of those polled had a higher opinion of the Tea Party movement than the Occupy movement. In January 2012, a survey was released by Rasmussen Reports, in which 51% of likely voters found protesters to be a public nuisance, while 39% saw it as a valid protest movement representing the people. Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning journalist Chris Hedges, a supporter of the movement, argues that OWS had popular support and \\"articulated the concerns of the majority of citizens.\\" American political philosopher Jodi Dean, while critical of the movements focus on autonomy, leaderlessness and horizontality which she argues was self-destructive, says that \\"Occupy ruptured the lie that 'what is good for Wall Street is good for Main Street'.\\" Many notable figures joined the occupation, including David Crosby, Kanye West, Russell Simmons, Alec Baldwin, Susan Sarandon, Don King, Noam Chomsky, Jesse Jackson, Cornel West, and Michael Moore. = Occupy Yale = In November 2011, some students started an Occupy Yale movement, discouraging fellow students from joining the finance sector. 25% of Yale graduates join the financial sector. = Time Magazine: Person of the Year 2011 = OWS was mentioned by Time Magazine in its 2011 selection of \\"The Protester\\" as Person of the Year. = Occupy George = Occupy George was an interactive art project inspired by Occupy Wall Street that circulated dollar bills stamped with fact-based infographics. It informed the public of America's economic disparity one dollar bill at a time. Criticism A number of criticisms of Occupy Wall Street have emerged, both during the movement's most active period and subsequently after. These criticism include a lack of clear goals, false claim as the 99%, a lack of measurable change, trouble conveying its message, a failure to continue its support base, pursuing the wrong audience, and accusations of anti-Semitism. = Lack of clear goals = Although the movement's primary slogan was \\"we are the 99%,\\" it was criticized for not encompassing the voice of the entire 99%, specifically lower class individuals and minorities The Occupy Movement has been criticized for not having a set of clear demands that could be used to prompt formal policy change. This lack of agenda has been cited as the reason why the Occupy Movement fizzled before achieving any specific legislative changes. Although the lack of demands has simultaneously been argued as one of the advantages of the movement, the protesters in Occupy rejected the idea of having only one demand, or a set of demands, and instead represented a host of broad demands that did not specifically allude to a desired policy agenda. = Lack of minority representation = Although the movement's primary slogan was \\"We are the 99%,\\" it was criticized for not encompassing the voice of the entire 99%, specifically lower class individuals and minorities. For example, it was characterized as being overwhelmingly white and poorly representative of the needs of the immigrant population. The lack of African American presence was especially notable, with the movement being criticized in several news outlets and journal articles about its lack of inclusivity and racial diversity. = Lack of measurable change = Some publications mentioned that the Occupy Wall Street Movement failed to spark any true institutional changes in banks and in Corporate America. This idea is supported by the number of scandals that continued to emerge following the financial crisis such as the London Whale incident, the LIBOR-fixing scandal, and the HSBC money laundering discovery. Furthermore, the idea of excess compensation through salaries and bonuses at Wall Street banks continued to be a contentious topic following the Occupy protests, especially as bonuses increased during a period of falling bank profits. = Trouble conveying its message = Another criticism was the idea that the movement itself was having trouble conveying its actual message. The movement was criticized for demonizing the rich and establishing a theme of class warfare. Another issue that was raised was that the Occupy Movement was attempting to indict the entire 1% and argue for wealth redistribution, when in fact, the focus of the movement was centered around upward mobility and fairness for all through government regulation and taxation. = Failure to continue its support base = The movement was also criticized for not building a sustainable base of support and instead fading quickly after its initial spark in late 2011 through early 2012. This may be attributed to Occupy's lack of legislative victories, which left the protestors with a lack of measurable goals. It was also argued that the movement was too tied to its base, Zuccotti Park. Evidence of this lies in the fact that when the police evicted the protestors on November 15, the movement largely dissipated. While there is evidence that the movement had an enduring impact, protests and direct mentions of the Occupy Movement quickly became uncommon. = Wrong audience = Many people felt that Occupy had the wrong target in mind, and that the federal government, politicians, or the Federal Reserve should have received much of the rebuke for ignoring the warning signs leading up to the financial crisis and not taking action more quickly. In addition, the movement was criticized for demonizing banks and the entire financial industry, with the argument being that only a certain portion of Wall Street workers contributed to the actions that eventually sparked the financial crisis. = Anti-semitism accusations = Some Occupy Wall Street protests have included anti-zionist and anti-Semitic slogans and signage such as \\"Jews control Wall Street\\" or \\"Zionist Jews who are running the big banks and the Federal Reserve\\". As a result, the Occupy Wall Street Movement has been confronted with accusations of anti-Semitism by major US media. Subsequent activity =May Day 2012= Occupy Wall Street mounted an ambitious call for a citywide general strike and day of action on May 1, 2012. Recalls journalist Nathan Schneider, \\"The idea of a general strike had been circulating in the movement since who-knows-when. There was a woman who called for it back on September 17th. Occupy Oakland tried to mount one on November 2nd, with some success and a few broken windows. Soon after, Occupy LA took the lead in announcing a target that seemed sufficiently far off to be feasible, and sufficiently traditional to seem plausible: May Day.\\" Though the day fell short of its wildest ambitions, tens of thousands of people participated in a march through New York City, demonstrating continued support for Occupy Wall Street's cause and concerns. =Occupy Sandy= Occupy Sandy is an organized relief effort created to assist the victims of Hurricane Sandy in the northeastern United States. Occupy Sandy is made up of former and present Occupy Wall Street protesters, other members of the Occupy movement, and former non-Occupy volunteers. =3rd anniversary= Three years after the original occupation, there were fewer people actively involved in Occupy than at its height. However, a number of groups that formed during the occupation or resulted from connections made at that time were still active. = Strike Debt = To celebrate the third anniversary of the occupation of Zuccotti Park, an Occupy Wall Street campaign called \\"Strike Debt\\" announced it had wiped out almost $4 million in student loans, amounting to the indebtedness of 2,761 students. The loans were all held by students of Everest College, a for profit college that operates Corinthian Colleges, Inc. which in turn owns Everest University, Everest Institute, Heald College, and WyoTech. The loans became available when the banks holding defaulted loans put the bad loans up for sale. Once purchased, the group chose to forgive the loans. The funds to purchase the loans came from donations to the Rolling Jubilee Fund, part of the Occupy Student Debt program. As of September 2014, the group claimed to have wiped out almost $19 million in debt. As of September 2014, Rolling Jubilee claims to have cancelled more than $15 million in medical debt. Strike Debt, and a successor organization, The Debt Collective, were active in organizing the Corinthian 100 students who struck against Corinthian college, a for-profit school that was shut down by the U.S. Department of Education. =Occupy the SEC= Occupy the SEC came together during the occupation. The group seeks to represent the 99% in the regulatory process. They first attracted attention in 2012 when they submitted a 325-page comment letter on the Volcker Rule portion of Dodd Frank. =Alternative Banking= Another offshoot of the Occupy Movement, calling itself the OWS Alternative Banking Group, was established during the occupation of Zuccotti Park in 2011. In 2013, the group published a book titled \\"Occupy Finance\\" and distributed copies in Zuccotti Park at the second anniversary and elsewhere. FT Alphaville gave it \\"two thumbs up for discussable policy proposals\\" while the New York Times Dealbook called it \\"a guide to the financial system and the events surrounding the crisis, and it proposes a policy framework that it calls 'popular regulation.'\\" As of 2020, the group continues to meet weekly at Columbia University including a speaker series. From 2015 to 2017, the group published several blog post in the Huffington Post. Alternative Banking ran Occupy Summer School at the Urban Assembly Institute of Math and Science for Young Women in July 2015. =Influence on movement for higher wages= In 2013, commentators described Occupy Wall Street as having influenced the fast food worker strikes. Occupy Wall Street organizers also contributed to a worker campaign at Hot and Crusty cafe in New York City, helping them obtain higher wages and the right to form a union by working with a worker center. Occupy Wall Street has been credited with reintroducing a strong emphasis on income inequality into broad political discourse and, relatedly, for inspiring the fight for a $15 minimum wage.

He was instrumental in developing Tenby into a seaside resort. Early life Paxton's family originated from Auchencrow near to Paxton, Berwickshire. He was the son of John Paxton, chief clerk to Scottish wine merchant Archibald Stewart, who had become Lord Provost of Edinburgh. In 1745, when Charles Edward Stuart, \\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\\", marched down from Caledonian with his army of Highlanders to make his bid for the throne, Stewart feebly opposed him. Arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London from where, after six weeks, he was released on a bail of ¬£15,000. Two years later, he was found \\"not guilty\\" but Stewart found his name sullied in the eyes of the Edinburgh public and decided to transfer home and business to London. Stewart resultantly moved his business and his trusted agent John Paxton to No.11 Buckingham Street, just off the Strand, where the Paxton family lived in a flat on the upper floor. His elder brother Archibald helped his father run the Stewart wine business. Stewart's son John had made his fortune in the East India Company, before becoming an MP. On his death, John and Archibald Paxton took over the Stewart wine business. His middle brother John became a painter and artist, whose works were displayed at the Royal Academy. Royal Navy career John Stewart's connections into the EIC allowed William, aged 12, to join the Royal Navy as Captain William Gordon's captain's boy in November 1755, aboard HMS St Albans. This allowed the quiet but arithmetically skilled boy to be schooled further, and his ship saw action with the bombardment and capture of Louisburg (French Canada) in July 1757. In 1760 he joined the new HMS Thunderer as Midshipman officer, under Captain Charles Proby. Business career =East India Company= At the end of the Seven Years' War, like many military men, Paxton was technically made redundant from the Royal Navy. On 1 June 1764, Paxton walked from his family's London apartment to the Berkeley Square home of Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive. Carrying a letter of recommendation written by John Stewart, he became a free mariner on an in-country privateer ship for the East India Company, plying trade between different ports on the east of the Cape of Good Hope and across Asia. After a period he was assigned to Calcutta, where he worked with Charles Cockerell, brother of the architect Samuel Pepys Cockerell. =Bengal Presidency Assayer= By 1772, John Stewart had been appointed within the administration of the Bengal Presidency, and was working with and had befriended Sir George Colebrooke, 2nd Baronet. The pair had speculated on shares in London, which Paxton had facilitated through his connections to allow them to undertake riskier trades, for which he took a small percentage on the sums placed. Unfortunately, Colebrooke's speculation had over stretched his finances, which would eventually bankrupt him, and Stewart was equally in financial trouble. To enable him to repair his wealth, Stewart offered to sponsor Paxton to join the Bengal Presidency. As a result, Paxton returned to London and trained with Francis Spilsbury in Westminster. After seven months training, he passed his assay exams over four days in the Tower of London. Sponsored by Sir James Cockburn, former EIC Director and John Stewart's cousin, and William Brightwell Sumner, formerly a member of the Bengal Council; on 4 March 1774 Paxton became Assay Master to the Bengal Presidency under the governorship of Warren Hastings. =Master of the Mint, Bengal Presidency= Having been sounded out by Philip Francis on a plan of currency reform in 1776, in January 1778 he succeeded Charles Lloyd as Master of the Mint of Bengal. This placed him in a very important position, as the official issuer of the Sicca \\"Silver\\" (freshly minted and assayed) rupee. British expatriates had come to India to make money to enable them to live a secure and ideally wealthy retirement back in the United Kingdom. But to do so they needed to make sure that their money was easily transferable back to London. Paxton could both assure them through the process of assay that their money was good, and then transfer the fresh Sicca rupees to bank accounts in London securely. For this private service, Paxton charged both an official fee for assay, and a percentage fee for transfer to London. However, the EIC restricted the amount of money that could be transferred, by limiting the number and scale of the Bills of exchange. Further, there was far more money required to be repatriated to London, than was requested to be expatriated to India. However, Paxton developed other methods of money transfer which were not controlled by the EIC. Non-British companies trading into India needed to either transfer cash out with their goods, risking either loss through shipwreck or piracy; or arrange payment through assayed currency in country. Paxton developed relationships with these companies, particularly the Dutch in Chinsura, the French in Chandernagore, and the Danish in Serampore. This allowed them to ship goods into India, receive additional Sicca Rupees in payment in return for European Bills of Exchange, and then buy returned trade in an assured local currency. This allowed them to decrease or even stop their bullion imports from Europe, reducing risk and increasing profits. With Dutch Bills of Exchange easily tradable in London, Paxton developed his closest relationships with them. From 1777 he began depositing large sums of Sicca Rupees in the Dutch treasury at Chinsura in exchange for Bills of Exchange on Amsterdam. This trade developed quickly, and in 1781 he agreed to supply one million Sicca Rupees, half of the Dutch company's Bengal investment in that trading season. These trades were a reflection of the trust he had developed with both the Dutch, his British expatriate clients with whose fortunes he was dealing, and the EIC. =Calcutta Agency House= As the influence and geography of the Bengal Presidency extended, so did its trade problems. Calcutta became the centre of Bengal Presidency, but now inland trade routes became long, and with inland piracy a risk alongside degradation of goods, and return home with cash, traders needed a new solution. Paxton had the ability to create this new business, which became termed an Agency House: *Paxton would take note from farmers and traders of what they had, which he would secure for them in Calcutta once the goods arrived; this enabled the trader to not have to travel the long distance to Calcutta *Paxton would hold the goods until the market was at the highest point, or above a sum defined by the farmer. Once sold, these sums would be placed into the traders bank current account *Paxton would often group separate trader's goods and sell in bulk to the shipping companies. This enabled him to directly gain Bills of Exchange in return for the required goods, without the need or cost for exchange into local currency *Paxton now had access to a stream of European sourced Bills of Exchange, which were not regulated or hence controlled by the EIC At each stage of the process, Paxton would charge a fee of between 1% and 5%, allowing him to amass a huge fortune. After he gained the contract to supply saltpetre (Potassium Nitrate) to the Danish, the EIC were so impressed and assured of his skills, they would themselves place orders for cotton and saltpetre with Paxton. =Paxton and Cockerell= However, the business that Paxton had created was not without its problems. The start of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War in 1780, resulted in Governor General Hastings ordering that the Dutch settlement at Chinsura be taken in 1781. Once the British Army was in control, Paxton calculated that his clients had invested some 629,391 Sicca Rupees, which he had to recover. As it was illegal and against company rules for administrators to trade with foreign powers, Paxton was in a weak position, even though he had key sponsors whom he had traded, across the company and up to board level. Although Hastings and his board recommended to London that Paxton and his clients be paid out of the liquidation of the Dutch colony's assets, which would take 12 months to realise, the London board were not enthused to openly approve an illegal operation. They advised Hastings that any administrators who were found to be undertaking such activity in the future would be instantly dismissed without any access to compensation. Paxton moved to both protect his interests and distance himself from his Agency House business, while not giving up his interests or ability to conduct business. He formed a partnership with Charles Cockerell, with whom he would have a lifetime business relationship, into which he placed all assets and operations of his Indian businesses. =Voyage home= After the London EIC board agreed Hasting's plan, on 27 January 1785, Paxton asked permission to resign from his office as Master of the Mint, and to proceed to Europe. Up until then, his brother Archibald had represented the business in London, but Paxton had been made aware of how large the companies trade had become, and the necessity to have direct representation. He advertised his personal assets in India for sale in the Calcutta Gazette that day, including three houses and eight horses; the normal level for a rich British expatriate in India at that time would have been one house and two horses. Departing the Hughli in February 1785, he made the six-month journey with his six-year-old daughter, whose mother knew the relationship would only survive in India. Also travelling with Paxton was Welshman David Williams, a retiring Captain of the East India Company's military service. Paxton had arranged for Williams monies to be transferred to London via Bills of Exchange and diamonds, which Archibald had then encashed, placing some in an account to allow William's father to buy him a small estate in Henllys, Carmarthenshire. On landing in London, Williams and Paxton agreed that they would meet again soon in Wales. However, Paxton immediately continued his voyage alone to Amsterdam. There with Dutch bankers Hope & Co., he encashed Bills of Exchange to the value of 470,241 Sicca Rupees, given him by the Dutch treasurer at Chinsura in 1781. Having already recovered 159,150, he returned to London to clear his client accounts and hence preserve his business. =Paxton, Cockerell, Trail & Co.= Returning to his room in the family home in Buckingham Street, Paxton established Paxton & Co. as the London-based agency for the Calcutta-based Agency House partnership. In the time he had taken to travel back to London, Charles Cockerell had added Philip Delisle to the partnership, renaming the agency Paxton, Cockerell & Delisle. While the simple business of Paxton & Co. was to encash their client's monies being repatriated from India, Paxton's reputation allowed the company to quickly expand its services. While some simply wanted their monies placed into current accounts, or exchanged into other currencies; others trusted Paxton to trade and invest their funds in commodities, bonds, and the stock market. Making small fees on each transaction, Paxton & Co. quickly consolidated Paxton's personal fortune. By the 1790s, the business had expanded again, with new partners joining in India under Cockerell. Cockerell hence came to London to introduce Paxton to their new fellow partners, the outcome of which was the establishment of the business formally as a merchant bank under the name Paxton, Cockerell, Trail & Co. Middleton Hall estate Paxton's Tower near Llanarthney in the River Tywi valley In 1789, Paxton bought the Middleton Hall estate, in Carmarthenshire for about ¬£40,000. Turning the original hall into Home Farm, he commissioned architect Samuel Pepys Cockerell to design him a new home, which was built between 1793 and 1795. Paxton employed engineer James Grier as estate manager, and surveyor Samuel Lapidge, who had worked with Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown, to design and landscape the gardens. The pair created an ingenious water park, with water flowing around the estate via a system of interconnecting lakes, ponds and streams, linked by a network of dams, water sluices, bridges and cascades. Spring water was stored in elevated reservoirs that fed into a lead cistern on the mansion's roof, allowing Paxton's residence to enjoy piped running water and the very latest luxury, water closets. Middleton Estate was described in a 19th-century sale catalogue as \\"richly ornamented by nature, and greatly improved by art.\\"National Botanic Garden of Wales: History In 1806, Saxton engaged Pepys Cockerell again to design and then oversee the construction of Paxton's Tower, which was completed in 1809. A Neo-Gothic folly erected in honour of Lord Nelson, it is situated on the top of a hilltop near Llanarthney in the River Tywi valley. By the time of his death in 1824, Middleton Hall estate covered some . The estate fell into decline in the early 20th century; the house was destroyed by fire in 1931. Today, the Middleton Hall estate is the site of the National Botanic Garden of Wales. The tower is under the care of the National Trust. Political and Parliamentary career =Newark-on- Trent= In the 1790, Paxton stood as a Whig party candidate in the Newark-on- Trent constituency, to become junior to the Duke of Portland. Winning by 72 votes, his opponents contested the result, and finding that Paxton had spent far too prodigiously, he was dismissed. Six years later he stood for the same constituency, but having arrived only 10 days before election day, withdrew on poll data obtained against his opponents Thomas Manners-Sutton and Colonel Mark Wood. Despite his efforts and renewed expenses, Paxton \\"declined giving further trouble\\" after hearing the results of the first day of the poll and withdrew. =Carmarthen= In 1793 Paxton was admitted as a Burgess to Carmarthen Borough. Now resident in West Wales, in the 1802 General Election he stood representing the Whig party in Carmarthenshire, against local Welsh Conservative James Hamlyn Williams. Inexperienced in electioneering but with lots of money, Paxton's accounts show that he bought voters: 11,070 breakfasts; 36,901 dinners; 25,275 gallons of ale; 11,068 bottles of spirits; and spent ¬£768 on blue ribbons. The total bill amounted to ¬£15,690. Two months after losing the election by 46 votes, on 4 October 1802 he was elected Mayor of Carmarthen. Although he then returned to London at this point to deal with business matters, leaving daily operations to his Deputy Mayor, he took his duties seriously. Lobbying friends in Westminster, he enabled the Bill that ensured installation to the town of pipes to distribute fresh water, and a second Bill that started the Loyal Carmarthen Volunteers militia brigade. As a result, he was knighted in 1803. It is during his period as Mayor that in 1802 he met Lord Nelson in person, and hence may have been inspired to build Paxton's Tower folly after his death at the Battle of Trafalgar. In 1803, standing MP John George Philipps resigned his seat in Parliament in favour of Paxton. At the 1806 General Election, Paxton took the Carmarthenshire seat unopposed. But in the run-up to the 1807 General Election, after much local opposition, he withdrew his candidacy, allowing Sir George Campbell to take the seat. =Carmarthenshire developer= After his withdrawal defeat in 1807, many would not have been surprised at Paxton's complete withdrawal from public life in West Wales. However, he continued his good works by becoming a key investor in many schemes, including: *Llandeilo to Carmarthen toll road, south of the River Tywi *Improvements to the harbour at Kidwelly, together with investments in the Kidwelly and Llanelly Canal that ran along the Gwendraeth valley, through Pembrey to Llanelli =Tenby= Tenby House, built by Sir William Paxton. Now a hotel, it has a Blue Plaque on the side in commemoration of his residency But his largest investment was in reviving the town of Tenby. A once thriving medieval seaport that had trade routes all over Europe, the English Civil War followed by a plague epidemic in 1650 had killed half its population. Resultantly bereft of trade, the town was abandoned by the merchants, and slid inexorably into decay and ruin. By the end of the eighteenth century, the visiting John Wesley noted: \\"Two-thirds of the old town is in ruins or has entirely vanished. Pigs roam among the abandoned houses and Tenby presents a dismal spectacle.\\" With the Napoleonic wars restricting rich tourists from accessing the spa resorts in Europe, the need for home-based sea bathing grew. In 1802, Paxton bought his first property in the old town. From this point onwards he invested heavily in the town, with the full approval of the town council. Engaging the team who had built Middleton Hall, engineer Grier and architect Pepys Cockerell were briefed to create a \\"fashionable bathing establishment suitable for the highest society.\\" His baths came into operation in July 1806, and after acquiring the Globe Inn transformed it into \\"a most lofty, elegant and convenient style\\" to lodge the more elegant visitors to his baths. Cottages were erected adjoining the baths, and livery stables with an adjoining coach house. In 1814 a road built on arches overlooking the harbour was built at Paxton's full expense. However, although he later got passed a Bill in Parliament to enable fresh water to be piped through the town, his 1809 theatre was closed in 1818 due to lack of patronage. Paxton also took in \\"tour\\" developments in the area, as required by rich Victorian tourists. This included the discovery of a chalybeate spring at Middleton Hall, his Paxton's Tower in memorial to Lord Nelson, and coaching inns developed from Swansea to Narberth. Paxton's efforts to revive the town succeeded, and even when victory at the Battle of Trafalgar reopened Europe, the growth of Victorian Tenby was inevitable. Through both the Georgian and Victorian eras, Tenby was renowned as a health resort and centre for botanical and geological study.Victorian History Tenby Personal life A year after returning from India, Paxton married Ann Dawney in 1786. The daughter of Thomas Dawney, a magistrate from Aylesbury who died when she was only six years old, Ann was 20 years younger than her new husband. The first of their ten children was born a year later, with Ann providing a step-mother to Paxton's existing daughter, Eliza. After his withdrawal from the 1807 election, Paxton built himself a new seaside home at Tenby House, and then organised the rebuilding of the town as a Victorian seaside resort. Aged 80, Paxton died in 1824 whilst in London on business, at his Piccadilly home. Paxton provided in an equal manner in his will for each of his five daughters and six sons, by instructing his executors to liquidate the major parts of his estate after his death; hence the Middleton Hall estate was immediately put up for sale. His wife Ann and eldest daughter Eliza were well provided for in a supplemental manner, and donations were made to several other members of the family and to a number of charitable institutions. He is buried in the catacombs at St Martin-in-the-Fields, while a Blue Plaque commemorates his residency on the side of Tenby House hotel. His wife Ann died in 1846. References *Jones, D.

The program debuted September 17, 2011 as Up with Chris Hayes, and was hosted by Hayes until March 2013 when he left for All In with Chris Hayes, a new MSNBC weekday primetime program. Steve Kornacki's first episode aired April 13, 2013; he left in October 2015 for MSNBC dayside. The program ended in January 2016 for MSNBC's special political coverage. MSNBC Live aired in its place with Alex Witt and Frances Rivera from 2016 to 2018. The program was revived in 2018 with David Gura as host until being replaced in 2020 by a new program hosted by Ali Velshi. Background Prior to his position at MSNBC, Hayes was Washington D.C. Editor of The Nation. On August 1, 2011, MSNBC announced that Hayes would host a two-hour morning program on Saturdays and Sundays on the network. The first airing of Up with Chris Hayes was September 17, 2011 and featured a live interview with current-Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The premiere of the Sunday program featured an appearance by MSNBC host Rachel Maddow. In addition to hosting \\"Up,\\" Hayes would also continue to serve as a contributor to other MSNBC programs as well as continuing his work at The Nation as Editor-at-Large based in NYC. Up was, at the time of its premiere, the most recent of MSNBC's attempts to place political opinion or talk shows on weekends; two other programs, Jesse Ventura's America (aired in 2003) and Weekends with Maury and Connie (aired in 2006), experienced short, months-long runs on weekend slots. According to Cenk Uygur, a former host on MSNBC, he was offered a weekend slot in return for letting go of his early-2011 slot on weekday evening airings of MSNBC Live, but turned it down and left the channel due to managerial disputes (commentator Al Sharpton was eventually appointed to Uygur's former slot, renamed PoliticsNation with Al Sharpton in August 2011; Uygur, instead, became a contributor and later host of The Young Turks on Current TV). It was announced that January 5, 2012 that fellow The Nation and MSNBC contributor Melissa Harris-Perry would host her own weekend program, beginning February 4, 2012 at 10:00 am, following Up and leading to Weekends with Alex Witt. Hayes gave up weekends and hosted the 8 PM ET hour on MSNBC weekdays, with his first nightly show taking place on April 1. On March 19, Steve Kornacki was named as the new host. His first episode aired April 13, 2013. Kornacki indicated that the program would maintain continuity, saying \\"a lot of progressive ideas were expressed through Up [with Chris Hayes], but I think the common thread through all the ideas, whether they‚Äôre progressive or whether they‚Äôre coming from the right, is that... they‚Äôre ideas that are worthy of discussion and worthy of exploration.\\"Erik Hayden, Steve Kornacki, New Host of MSNBC's 'Up', on Replacing Chris Hayes, Moving to Weekends The Hollywood Reporter March 20, 2013 In April 2013, Anne Thompson left her role as the Democratic National Committee's director of video production to become a segment producer for the program. In October 2018, Up returned to MSNBC's weekend programming, with David Gura as host. In January 2020, MSNBC announced a new lineup with a program hosted by former Velshi & Ruhle anchor Ali Velshi replacing Up's timeslot. Format From the beginning, Up has had a more panel-driven, opinion format than most traditional morning news programs and is more comparable to MSNBC weekday prime-time programming. To prepare new guests for the program, Hayes advises them, \\"The first and foremost important rule of the show: we're not on television ‚Äî no talking points, no sound bites... We have a lot of time for actual conversation. So actually listen, actually respond.\\" The program is \\"slightly wonky, fairly serious, but without taking itself more seriously than the stories it covers\\". A typical show consists of a 4-person panel discussion of relevant topics as well as several segments detailing specific stories or interviews with newsmakers. Hayes has stated that, in general, the Saturday program will analyze the stories of the previous week, while the Sunday program will serve as a look ahead at the week to come. Hayes notes that \\"Cable news is very white, male and straight\\", and aims for a younger more ideologically idiosyncratic set of guests who are reflective of the diversity of the country. Much of this same ideology continued into the David Gura era, with the format being almost unchanged. The official Twitter hashtag of the program is #uppers which began as a joke about the early show time that went viral. Up was broadcast from 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City.

Biography Wagenar was the son of a country priest from Neuruppin. After studies and graduation in Salzwedel in 1835 he studied legal science in Berlin. He was interested in the judicial philosophy of Friedrich Julius Stahl and the economic theories of Karl Ludwig von Haller regarding political legitimacy. He followed the usual legal career, becoming a law clerk in 1838 at the Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt (Oder) under vice president Ludwig von Gerlach and worked from 1844 to 1847 as an attorney at the Prussian land- improvement bureau and later at the consistory at the province of Saxony. In 1847 he became an appellate court attorney representing the consistory in Madeburg where he was assigned to prosecute liberal clergyman Leberecht Uhlich. He left government service in 1848 and established himself as a lawyer at the High court, and at the request of Gerlach founded the organ of the Prussian conservative party, the New Prussian Newspaper to Save the Monarchy. He served as its chief editor until 1854. Theodor Fontane, who worked with him at the time, said in his memoirs Wagenar was a \\"sort of side-sun to Bismarck.\\" Through his close-working with Otto von Bismarck, Wagenar became one of the best-known and controversial conservative pundits. In 1848 he founded the \\"Society for King and Fatherland.\\" In 1854 he retired from editing the newspaper (called the Kreuzzeitung because it featured a large iron cross) and invested his severance in a scheme in Neustettin (now Szczecinek) and worked as a criminal lawyer in Berlin. In 1856 he resigned his position as Justizrat and settled in Farther Pomerania to run for office. He became a clever and quick-witted speaker of the Prussian House of Representatives (Preu√üisches Abgeordnetenhaus) and provided great service to his party from 1867 in the North-German and from 1871 in the German Reichstag. His views often came with scientific justification, compiled in his 1859 \\"State and Society Dictionary.\\" In 1861 he participated in the founding of a Prussian Volksverein, a conservative society that was active until 1872. On March 29, 1866 he was appointed by Bismarck as an advisor to the department of State against the wishes of King Wilhlem I. Bismarck also consulted Wagener on social issues (Fontane reported he tried to instill upon Bismarck \\"fight against the hated bourgeoisie through social democracy,\\" meaning he encouraged Bismarck's talks with Ferdinand Lassalle). In the first German parliament he supported Bismarck in his speeches about the German constitution and the Kulturkampf. His efforts to establish a social conservative party in 1872 failed. In 1873 he became the first Council in the state department, but the Emperor refused to admit him personally. There had been bad rumors about Wagener's involvement in the Pommersche Centralbahn, a railway company. In a speech by Eduard Lasker on February 7, 1873, Lasker exposed the railways financial mismanagement, and it soon went bankrupt. Wagner was forced to resign in the scandal and was also fined in court 40,000 Taler for illegal profiteering. This cost Wagener his entire fortune. In 1878 he founded the interdenominational \\"Social Conservative Association.\\" Wagener published numerous writings, especially on social issues. His most important work was the 1862 Political and Social Lexicon. He wrote the 1876 platform of the German Conservative Party. He was also the spiritual father of labor insurance. Although a Catholic, he sought to curb the political influence of the Catholic Church. For this he advocated the creation of a \\"social pope\\" or \\"social emperor.\\" Writings * Das Judentum und der Staat. Berlin 1857.

Biography Clark's career as a drummer began when he was a teenager in New Zealand. In 1963, he became the drummer for the Zodiacs, followed by a 1964 stint with The Chequers. In 1965, he joined the Auckland-based pop band, The Silhouettes, who had a number of local hits, as well as a national hit with \\"Theme From The Endless Summer\\". He was also a founding member of the very successful Australian pop band, The Executives. Between 1966 and 1969, the Executives had a number of hit records, performed throughout Australia, and appeared on many television shows, including their own nationwide television specials, as well as in a number of commercials for such companies as Coca- Cola, Qantas, P&O; and Revlon. In 1969, the Executives recorded an album in the United States, but they disbanded shortly thereafter. Some of the band members returned to Australia, but Clark stayed in the States and became a Los Angeles-based session musician. Between 1971 and 1975, Clark toured with Billy Joel and worked on his albums Cold Spring Harbor and Piano Man. Clark was also the drummer on Joel's breakthrough Sigma Sound radio concert, broadcast on WMMR-FM in April 1972, as well as at the Mar y Sol Festival two weeks prior, where they played to a crowd of 50,000. After his time with Joel, Clark ultimately hooked up with Hoyt Axton, and toured and recorded with him from 1979 through 1999. In the 1990s, he also began touring with Freddy Fender, as well as the Texas Tornados, which he did until Fender died in late 2006. Since 2006, Clark has performed with a number of artists, such as Johnny Rodriguez, Sam the Sham, Charlie Rich Jr., Jann Browne, Chris Gaffney, Sweethearts of the Rodeo, Rosie Flores, Wanda Jackson, Michael Chain and Rick Shea. In September, 2013, Clark reunited with his former Billy Joel bandmates, Larry Russell and Don Evans, along with singers/piano players, David Clark and Elio Pace, to re- create the WMMR/Sigma Sound concert that jump-started Joel's career. They did two sold-out performances of \\"Long Long Time: A Historic Tribute to Billy Joel\\", in New York, and in Philadelphia where the original show was broadcast. A documentary and CD will be released in early 2014 with more shows to follow.

At that time, economy and technology was not developed, the residents made a living by salt making and agriculture. Therefore, residents held Buddhist meetings every year to pray for good crop weather and bumper grain harvest which was called Shangtongzi. Thereafter more than 1000 years, it mixed together with the local dialect, the culture, the custom and the public sentiment which contributed to the embryonic form of Tongzi opera. In the end of the Qing Dynasty, performers modified the lines, appeared on the stage with make-up, which contributed to its prototype. Formulated in Dongzhou and popular in the Tang Dynasty. =Development= After the founding of the People's Republic of China, performers went a step further to abandon some superstition contents, using its unique talking and singing form, adapted the Tongzi opera to modern opera, successfully transformed it into Nantong opera. After the reforming and opening up, some young performers were cultivated in the support of Nantong Culture Administration. With the rapid development of market economy, a number of folk performance teams sprang up. In recent years, the endangered Tongzi opera has received much more attention and concerns home and abroad.

The head has long antennae, large compound eyes, and powerful jaws. There are white hairs on the pronotum and the sides of the abdomen.Natural Heritage Endangered Species Program: Northeastern Beach Tiger Beetle The pale coloration provides camouflage for the beetle on the light sand. The larvae are grub-like, with long, segmented bodies and large jaws similar to those of adults. Cicindela dorsalis dorsalis, commonly known as the Northeastern beach tiger beetle, is the largest subspecies of Cicindela dorsalis. In 2012, the genus was reclassified under the name Habroscelimorpha, but the names are used synonymously in recently published literature.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Virginia Field Office. (2019, August 28). 5-Year Review of the Northeastern Beach Tiger Beetle. Retrieved April 17, 2020, from https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/five_year_review/doc6121.pdf Fitting to its name, the Northeastern beach tiger beetle dwells along the U.S. northeast coast in small sand burrows. The beetle is highly susceptible to abundant human activity and beach erosion, and in 1990, the Northeastern beach tiger beetle was listed as ‚Äúthreatened‚Äù under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). It is the only subspecies to be listed under the ESA.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. (n.d.). Listed Animals. Retrieved April 19, 2020, from https://ecos.fws.gov The larva of the subspecies C. d. media is notable for its ability to leap into the air, loop its body into a rotating wheel and roll along the sand at a high speed using wind to propel itself. If the wind is strong enough, the larva can cover up to in this manner. This remarkable ability may have evolved to help the larva escape predators such as the thynnid wasp Methocha. Wheel locomotion in nature is extremely rare and has only been observed in a few animals around the world.Wind-Powered Wheel Locomotion, Initiated by Leaping Somersaults, in Larvae of the Southeastern Beach Tiger Beetle (Cicindela dorsalis media) Range and habitat Cicindela dorsalis dorsalis Four subspecies of C. dorsalis are known. C. d. media is found along the southeast coast of the United States, including South Carolina. C. d. dorsalis is found along the northeast coast. C. d. saulcyi and C. d. venusta occur along the coasts of Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, and Mexico. In general, C. dorsalis is most abundant on broad, fine-sand beaches that are highly exposed to tidal action and relatively undisturbed by humans. In order for the beetles to breed, beaches need to be at least long and wide, 5-8 being the optimal width.USFWS. Cicindela dorsalis dorsalis Five-year Review. The eastern beach tiger beetle prefers a climate with average temperatures exceeding 15 ¬∞C and moderate to arid rainfall totals.Animal Diversity Web. Cicindela dorsalis (northeastern beach tiger beetle) Biology The entire life cycle lasts 2 years. Adults emerge between mid-June and mid-August, usually reaching peak abundance by mid-July and declining by September. They spend the day foraging in the intertidal zone when the weather is warm and sunny. They feed on small invertebrates including flies, ants, and amphipods, but will also scavenge dead fish and crabs.The State Of New Jersey. Northeastern Beach Tiger Beetle, Cicindela d. dorsalis Mating takes place between mid-July and early August when the weather is warm and humid. Females lay their eggs in the intertidal zone. They use sensitive hairs on their abdomen to determine whether the soil moisture content is suitable for larval survival and development. Oviposition takes place at night. The female uses her ovipositor to create a small hole in the sand where she deposits the eggs individually.Observations of Oviposition Behavior Among North American Tiger Beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae: Cicindelinae) Species and Notes on Mass Rearing Eggs hatch in mid-August, and the larvae dig vertical burrows where they secure themselves using hooks along their abdomen. They are predatory and prey on passing insects and other small invertebrates. Tiger beetle larvae go through three instars before pupating. They usually reach the second instar by September. As winter approaches, the larvae dig new burrows higher up the beach to protect themselves against storms and wave activity. After overwintering, they emerge in late May and June. Then they reach the third instar and overwinter again. The following spring they pupate in their burrows and emerge as adults. Status The subspecies C. d. dorsalis (northeastern beach tiger beetle) suffered a major decline over the last 20 years. It used to be found all along the Atlantic coast of the USA from Massachusetts to Virginia. Today it only occurs in the Chesapeake Bay of Maryland, Martha's Vineyard island off the coast of Massachusetts, and Virginia. This decline was caused by the destruction and disturbance of the beetle‚Äôs natural beach habitat by human activity, one of the greatest threats being shoreline hardening by the placement of rip-rap. Other threats include pollution and pesticides, as well as the use of off-road vehicles that crush adults and larvae, also damaging larval burrows. In 2009 the United States Fish and Wildlife Service recommended C. d. dorsalis be uplisted to endangered status.

He is married to publisher Juliet Annan. Life He was educated at Ampleforth College and graduated from Clare College, Cambridge University and the Royal London Hospital in 1974, and worked as a junior doctor at the Renal Transplant Unit and Cardiology Department of the Royal Free Hospital and St Mary‚Äôs Hospital in London. For 20 years he combined working as a general practitioner with writing medical columns for the Sunday Telegraph and Daily Telegraph as well as contributing reviews and articles to The Times, The Spectator, The British Medical Journal and Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine.Biography of James Le Fanu, jameslefanu.com, retrieved September 17, 2011. His books include The Rise and Fall of Modern Medicine (1999) which won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize in 2000, Why Us?: How science rediscovered the mystery of ourselves (2009) and Too Many Pills: How too much medicine is endangering our health and what we can do about it (2018). In an interview in The British Medical Journal in 2015, he was described as having \\"spent the past 30 years shedding light in places that others believed to be already illuminated. Prescient and provocative, Le Fanu is the goad to keep doctors humble and scientists on the right track.\\" He admitted the worst mistake in his career was to mistake potassium for aminophylline causing his patient to have a cardiac arrest, \\"though luckily the crash team did not get stuck in the lift or ask too many searching questions.\\". He was elected a Fellow of The Royal College of Physicians in 2014. Medicine In his book The Rise and Fall of Modern Medicine, Le Fanu challenges the conventional view of the history of post-war medicine as a continuous upwards curve of knowledge and achievement. Rather, he argues, it falls into two distinct phases, a \\"Golden Age\\", from the 1940s to the 1970s whose twelve \\"definitive moments\\" include antibiotics, cortisone, open heart surgery, kidney transplants, the cure of childhood leukaemia, etc. This was followed, for complex reasons, by a decline in the rate of therapeutic innovation creating an intellectual vacuum filled by two complementary scientific disciplines, epidemiology and genetics, that sought to explain the causes of disease. They were \\"The Social Theory\\" that attributed common illnesses such as circulatory disorders and cancer to a \\"high fat\\" diet and unhealthy lifestyle and \\"the New Genetics\\" that promised to identify the genetic causes of ill health. These two disciplines continue to dominate medical research but their promise remains unfulfilled. His 2018 book, Too Many Pills, investigates the reasons behind the threefold rise in the number of prescriptions issued by doctors in Britain over the prior 15 years and the consequences for many of what he calls a \\"hidden epidemic\\" of drug-induced illness. Evolution Le Fanu is an open critic of materialism (scientism) and the explanatory power of Darwin's evolutionary theory whose fundamental premises he argued in his book Why Us? are undermined by the findings of the two revolutionary technical developments of genome sequencing and brain imaging. The discovery of the equivalence of genomes across the vast range of organismic complexity has failed to identify the numerous random genetic mutations that, according to Darwinian theory, would account for the diversity of form of the living world. As for neuroscience, while the sophisticated PET and MRI scanning techniques allow scientists to observe the brain in action from the inside, the fundamental question of how its electrochemistry translates into subjective experience and consciousness remains unresolved. According to the New Scientist, Le Fanu argues for the existence of a non- material \\"life force\\" that may explain many of the mysteries unexplained by material science.Amanda Gefter, Review of Why Us? by James Le Fanu, New Scientist 5 February 2009, retrieved September 17, 2011.

A lifelong Democrat, Boothe helped lead his party's progressive faction, particularly as they opposed the Byrd Organization's policy of Massive Resistance to racial integration in Virginia's public schools. Early life and education Boothe was born in Alexandria, Virginia, on September 23, 1907, to Gardner Lloyd and Eleanor Harrison Carr Boothe. He attended Episcopal High School and graduated from the University of Virginia, receiving his A.B. in 1928. He was chosen as a Rhodes scholar in 1929 and received a B.A. in Jurisprudence from Oxford University in 1931. In 1934 Boothe married Elizabeth Ravenel Peelle of Washington, D.C., and they ultimately had three daughters, Julie Perry, Eleanor Smith and Elizabeth Davis. Legal career Admitted to the Virginia bar in October 1931, Boothe began practicing law with his father, Gardner L. Boothe's Alexandria firm: Boothe, Dudley, Koontz, Blakenship & Stump. He served as a lawyer for the United States Department of Justice from 1934 to 1936, and was Alexandria City Attorney from 1938 to 1943. Boothe left Alexandria to serve as a naval air combat intelligence officer through the United States Naval Reserve. He served in the Pacific Theater during World War II (1939‚Äì1945), then returned to private practice. Political career Boothe was elected to his first term in the Virginia House of Delegates (a part-time position) in 1948, and was re- elected until 1955, when he ran for State Senate, also from Alexandria, Virginia. From 1956 to 1963 Boothe served in the State Senate, in newly created (because of census changes) District 36.The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia 1940 - 1960 Register Boothe was classified as a \\"militant moderate\\" or \\"Young Turk\\", one of a group challenging the Byrd Organization of conservative, mainly rural Democrats led by U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd. In 1948, Boothe derailed an attempt by Byrd forces to keep Harry S Truman off the Presidential ballot in Virginia. In 1950 he introduced bills to create a state civil rights commission and repeal laws segregating transportation.James R. Sweeney, Race, Reason and Massive Resistance: the diary of David J. Mays (University of Georgia Press, 2008) p. 94 Boothe is best remembered for his consistent fight to integrate Virginia's public schools, which he began predicting in a Virginia Law Review article published in 1949. Boothe and Stuart B. Carter of rural Fincastle, Virginia, led a group of mostly World War II veterans and from Virginia's growing cities and suburbs, which were forming a progressive wing (or challenging the Byrd Organization). The Young Turks began by securing greater education funding (Virginia had traditionally one of the lowest per capita funding levels in the country, even worse for African Americans). In 1952 they secured Virginia's approval of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a symbolic gesture since women had been granted the right to vote based on other states' actions. In 1954 the Young Turks deadlocked the General Assembly for hours past its scheduled adjournment, winning a compromise whereby part of the state's surplus revenue would fund additional services rather than dispersing everything as a tax refund (Virginia's taxes also being among the lowest in the county). After the United States Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education (and companion cases including one from Prince Edward County, Virginia) in 1954, racial integration became likely. However, when the Supreme Court the following year revisited and reaffirmed Brown I in what became known as Brown II, Southside Virginia and other conservative Byrd Democrats began a program of Massive Resistance to racial integration. They initially appointed a commission under State Senator Garland Gray to study options, but Gray and U.S. Senator Byrd (and others) became radicalized before the commission (of legislators, thus having no African -Americans) issued its report. On January 4, 1956, he and Arlington School Board president Elizabeth Campbell went to Richmond to debate segregation and the Gray plan with Dowell Howard and Henry T. Wickham.Sweeney p. 94 When the legislature finally met, it debated the a radicalized version of the Gray Commission plan, which became known as the Stanley Plan. That in part proposed to fund segregation academies through tuition grants, which Boothe opposed. He and Republican state senator Ted Dalton led a \\"valiant last ditch effort\\" to insert a \\"local option\\" in the Stanley Plan legislative package, beyond the racially segregated \\"pupil placement\\" plans, so public schools which complied with judicial desegregation orders would not have to close and deprive all students of education as the Stanley Plan proponents wanted.Robert A. Pratt, The Color of Their Skin: Education and Rade in RichmondVirginia1954-89 (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1992) at p. 8 However, Boothe, Dalton and other moderates failed in that effort; Byrd Democrats proposed such closures despite a provision of the state constitution requiring free public education, proposing instead to modify the state constitution. Moreover, Byrd forces in the state Senate retaliated against Bootheby giving him two minor committee assignments, neither important, which some considered a way of isolating him.Sweeney at p. 103, citing \\"When Reason collides with Prejudice: Armistead Lloyd Boothe and the Politics of Desegregation in Virginia, 1948-1963, Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 102 (1994) at pp. 18-19, 28, 30-31 Boothe thus became known for his battle to keep Virginia's public schools, including those in nearby Arlington, Virginia, open in 1958 and 1959 despite Governor Thomas B. Stanley's ordering them to close to avoid integration.The Almanac of Virginia Politics, Crater, VanTrease, Williams. 1977. Arlington voters had rejected the proposed constitutional amendment, but it passed statewide, so that when federal judge Albert Bryan ordered those schools integrated, the Stanley administration had ousted Campbell and the rest of Arlington's elected school board and imposed the racially segregated pupil placement plan. However, on January 19, 1959 (Robert E. Lee's birthday), both the Virginia Supreme Court and a panel of three federal district court judges in Virginia declared the Stanley Plan unconstitutional. The new governor James Lindsay Almond Jr. initially protested vehemently, but a month later broke with the Byrd Organization and allowed the public schools in Norfolk and Arlington to remain open and integrate peacefully pursuant to federal court orders. Boothe handily won reelection in 1959 despite a primary challenge for allowing such integration (as did segregationist James Thomson, who had succeeded him as Alexandria's delegate). Thus, Massive Resistance did not end for several more years. A lifelong Democrat, Boothe sat on the Virginia Code Commission throughout his legislative service. He also supported the Kennedy-Johnson campaign in Virginia in 1960. In 1961 Boothe made an unsuccessful bid for Lieutenant Governor of Virginia on a ticket with Democratic candidates A. E. S. Stephens (lieutenant governor running for Governor) and T. Munford Boyd (running for attorney general). The Byrd Organization candidates, however, defeated them in the Democratic primary (Boothe losing to Mills E. Godwin 46% to 54%, the narrowest margin of any of the progressive candidates) and ultimately won election in November. Boothe declined to seek re-election in 1963, and was succeeded by Leroy S. Bendheim. When Senator Byrd announced his retirement from the United States Senate (and died several months later), Boothe ran for the seat, proclaiming a progressive agenda, including diplomatic recognition of China. However, he lost the 1966 Democratic primary to Byrd's son, Harry F. Byrd Jr. (whom, ironically, Boothe had met during their mutual naval service in World War II), by a very small margin (less than 1%, or 8,225 votes statewide). After that loss, Boothe retired from the electoral arena, although he remained politically active until ultimately sidelined by Alzheimer's disease. Boothe headed Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 Presidential campaign in Virginia. The following year, Boothe survived major heart surgery, and concluded his legal career. Boothe spent his final years before retiring to an assisted living facility as Director of Development for and as assistant to the dean of the Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria. Death and legacy Boothe died in Falls Church, Virginia, in February, 1990, and was interred at the Virginia Theological Seminary. The City of Alexandria named a newly created park in the Cameron Station subdivision after Armistead Boothe in 1999. The Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia has his papers.

J. Foakes Jackson and Kirsopp Lake. Part 1, the Acts of the Apostles. The Women's Court existed in the Second Temple, and there are sources which say it existed even in the Tabernacle at Shiloh and in the First Temple. Second Chronicles 20: 5 states that King Jehoshaphat stood \\"... in the house of the Lord before the new court.\\" a court identified by the Talmud as the Court of the Women. In contemporary synagogues, this term is used for the area allocated to women for the purpose of prayer. The Name The reason for calling it for \\"The Court of the Women\\" was that, although it served both men and women equally, during the Simchat Beit Hashoeva (Water Drawing Festival) special balconies were installed for the women to stand upon. The gemara in Tractate Sukkah states that. \\"Initially, women would stand on the inside of the Court of the Women, closer to the Sanctuary to the west, and the men were on the outside in the courtyard and on the rampart. And they would come to conduct themselves with inappropriate levity in each other‚Äôs company, as the men needed to enter closer to the altar when the offerings were being sacrificed and as a result they would mingle with the women. Therefore, the Sages instituted that the women should sit on the outside and the men on the inside, and still they would come to conduct themselves with inappropriate levity. Therefore, they instituted a ruling, in the interest of complete separation, that the women would sit above and the men below. \\"(Sukkah 51b). The Area and Structure The area of the Women's Court was 135 by 135 cubits (61.72 x 61.72 meters). On the western side, between the chambers, semicircular steps were built, each one at a height and width of half a cubit (0.23 meters) which led to the court and served the Levites as a platform to stand upon while singing and playing during the Simchat Beit Hashoeva . The Songs of Ascents (or Songs of Degrees) in Psalms (Chapters 120‚Äì134) are so called because they were sung on these steps. During the time of the Feast of Sukkot (The Feast of Tabernacles), balconies were built that stood out from the walls and the women came by stairs, where the women who came to participate would stand during the Feast of Tabernacles. In addition, they would erect many lamps during Sukkot to illuminate the people celebrating at night, which the priests would light before the celebrations began. Its Use The use of the Court of the Women, apart from the regular use of the priests and the people that came to the house of God, included the celebrations of Simchat Beit Hashoeva, and the assembly of the people during the Hakhel (Deuteronomy 31:12). A special wooden platform would be built for the king's seat who read the Torah to the people. Its Holiness The Court of the Women was considered more holy than the surface of the terrace (or the Chel) that surrounded it. because any person who was newly immersed, that is, a person who had been immersed that same day, was forbidden to enter there. This law did not come from the Torah but from a decree decreed by Jehoshaphat the king of Judah to the people, and therefore if they enter its area on the day they are immersed they are not obligated to bring the sin offering. Its Chambers In each corner of The Court of Women was a roofless chamber 40 meters long and wide. Most commentators believe that the chambers were within the Court of the Women. But it is worth noting the opinion of Rabbi Asher ben Jehiel that the chambers were in fact connected to it from the outside. The Chamber of Wood was in the northeast corner, and is where the priests checked the firewood that was to be burnt on the altar for worm-eaten wood. According to one Talmudic tradition, the Ark of the Covenant was hidden beneath the floor of this chamber. (Tractate Shekalim 6:2) Chamber of the Nazarites - was in the southeast corner. Nazarites, at the end of the period of their Nazarite vow, would shave off their hair that had grown long and threw it into the fire under the vat that cooked the meat of their peace offering sacrifice. The Chamber of Oils (or the Chamber of the House of Oils) - in the south- western corner, where the oil and wine were stored for the purposes of the Temple, such as lighting the Menorah The Lepers Chamber, In the northwestern corner, had a mikvah where the lepers who had come to sacrifice the offerings that they were commanded to sacrifice on the day of their purification were immersed There too, they would cook some of the offerings after they were sacrificed. Two other chambers, the entrances of which was in the Court of the Women, were the two Chambers of Musical Instruments, which served as the storehouse for the Levites. The chambers themselves were not in the Court of Women but rather was dug beneath the floor of the Court of the Israelites, but the entrances to these chambers were within the Court of Women, on either side of the steps leading up to the Nicanor Gate. The dimensions of these chambers are unknown. The Court of the Women according to Josephus According to the historian Flavius Josephus in his book \\"The Wars of the Jews \\" (Book 5, chapter 5), the Court of the Women had three gates, one from every direction. In his book \\"Against Apion\\" (Book 5, chapter 8), the Court of the Women was described as a courtyard that allowed both sexes to mix: \\"Into the first court everybody was allowed to go, even foreigners, and none but women, during their courses, were prohibited to pass through it; all the Jews went into the second court, as well as their wives, when they were free from all uncleanness; into the third court (The Court of the Israelites) went in the Jewish men, when they were clean and purified.

Discovered in 1890, and made famous by Edward Doheny's successful well in 1892, the field was once the top producing oil field in California, accounting for more than half of the state's oil in 1895.

Setting Detail of the Los Angeles City Field, showing locations of former wells, and single active well remaining in 2011. The Los Angeles City field is one of many in the Los Angeles Basin. To the west are the still-productive Salt Lake and Beverly Hills fields; to the south is the Los Angeles Downtown Oil Field. Ten miles east-southeast is the Brea-Olinda field, the first to be worked in the region. Even larger fields are still productive in other parts of the basin, such as the giant Wilmington field which stretches from Carson to Long Beach. Terrain in the vicinity of the Los Angeles City field includes gently rolling hills cut by ravines draining south. Elevations range from around 250 to above sea level, with the highest elevations in Elysian Park near Dodger Stadium. Urban development is dense in the part of Los Angeles containing the field's former productive area, with numerous apartment blocks mixed with commercial and light industrial structures. U.S. Highway 101, the Hollywood Freeway, parallels part of the field to the north, and California State Route 110, the historic Arroyo Seco Parkway ‚Äì the first freeway in the United States ‚Äì cuts directly through the eastern part of the field immediately south of Dodger Stadium. The neighborhoods that contain the field include, from west to east, Koreatown, Westlake, Echo Park, Chinatown, and Elysian Park.Mapping Los Angeles: Los Angeles Times Some significant public facilities built directly on the area of former oilfield operations include Shriners Hospital for Children, St. Vincent Medical Center, Belmont High School, and the Edward R. Roybal Learning Center. Geology Los Angeles City Oil Field Geologic map and cross section Oil in the Los Angeles City field is relatively close to the surface. Every productive deposit has been in a single geologic unit, the shallow Miocene-age Puente Formation. Covering the Puente Formation throughout most of the area is a thin layer of Pliocene- and Pleistocene-age alluvium and terrace deposits. Structurally the field is a faulted anticline which trends generally east to west, with oil accumulations trapped in sand units dipping south, ending to the north either at a fault ‚Äì in the eastern part of the field ‚Äì or at the surface as tar seeps, in the western area. Mechanisms of entrapment include pinchouts and local changes of permeability ‚Äì forms of stratigraphic traps ‚Äì and structural traps such as oil-bearing units blockaded by unrelated, impermeable units put there by motion along faults. Three separate producing horizons, or vertical zones, are present in the Puente Formation, and are given ordinal numbers: First, Second, and Third zones. In addition to these zones, small pockets of oil have been found throughout the upper part of the Puente.DOGGR, 258‚Äì259 The average depth of the three zones from top to bottom is 900, 1,100, and 1,500 feet.DOGGR, 259 Although wells have been drilled to much greater depths ‚Äì for example, Seaboard Oil Company of Delaware drilled over into the Topanga Formation, of Miocene age ‚Äì no commercial quantities of oil have been found at these great depths. The field is split into three geographic zones, unrelated to the three vertical zones. The Western Area contains seeps that were known prehistorically; it is separated from the Central zone by a fault. The Central Area, the first to be exploited, extends from the fault to approximately the intersection of the Hollywood and Pasadena Freeways, and the Eastern Area extends northeast from that intersection.DOGGR, 258 Oil in the field is generally heavy, with API gravity averaging about 14, and ranging overall from 12 to 20. An early assessment by Paul Prutzman (1913) rated the quality of the oil from the field as low, due to the high sulfur content and absence of light fractions suitable for refining. The main use for oil taken from the field during the first decades of the 20th century was fuel oil, and it was also sprayed onto the young city's dirt roads to settle the dust.Prutzman, 206 History, production, and operations The field in 1895 The field in 1905, near the corner of First and Belmont, facing east =Early development= Tar seeps have been known in the area from prehistoric times, and the Native American population of the Los Angeles basin used the tar for waterproofing and other purposes. The Spanish settlers used it for their lamps, as a sealant for roofs, and as grease for wagon wheels.Crowder, 68 The earliest known well on the field, called the \\"Dryden Well\\", was a relatively shallow hole hand-dug near the intersection of 3rd Street and Coronado Street in 1857. It produced some heavy oil, tar, and asphaltum during the next 30 years, but the amounts were not recorded. The growing town purchased the product from the well owner to oil the streets. Another early well, this one a failure, was dug to almost in 1865 near the intersection of Temple and Boylston, but the attempt was abandoned after encountering hydrogen sulfide gas from the oil deposits, which were not far below. More persistent drilling in 1890 by several groups of prospectors, including Maltman and Ruhland, succeeded in establishing production of several barrels of oil a day, and the California Department of Conservation credits these drillers with discovering the field.Prutzman, 201 However, it was Edward Doheny and Cannon's well, begun on November 4, 1892, that brought the field instant fame. They had dug a well to , halting because of the accumulation of toxic hydrogen sulfide gas in the hole; however the oil seeps they encountered encouraged them to continue. Doheny brought in a sharpened eucalyptus log and used it as an improvised percussion hammer to deepen the well, and shortly afterwards they punctured an oil reservoir, and began producing about seven barrels a day.Crowder, 68‚Äì69 While hardly a gusher, their first well at the corner of Colton and Patton Streets was in the middle of an area of hundreds of small town lots that had been sold in a land boom of 1887. Since there were no regulations in California on well spacing at this time, anyone with a lot, and the $1,000 to $1,500 to drill an oil well, could potentially become rich ‚Äì especially if they could get their well into production before their neighbors drained the oil reservoir. Within a year of the Doheny well there were 121 wells on the field interspersed with homes and businesses, and the field's cumulative production had reached .Crowder, 77 Well crowding was extreme: the town lots were often only 50' by 150', and sometimes contained as many as four wells.Crowder, 69 By the end of 1895, the field was producing of oil a day, had produced in the preceding year, and accounted for sixty percent of the state's oil production. But it was still expanding: in 1896 a new well found oil east of the fault zone near Sisters Hospital which had previously been considered to be the eastern boundary of the field. By the end of 1897, 270 wells had been drilled into this new area. Cumulative production from the entire field at the end of that year had passed a million barrels, from 551 wells. =The \\"Oil Queen of California\\"; peak years = During the early development of the field, no single firm had a dominant share. Drillers started their own companies, flooding the local stock exchange with shares of start-up oil firms. There were so many of these that the Los Angeles Stock Exchange had to open a separate facility just to deal with oil stocks. By far the most successful entrepreneur on the field, however, was a piano teacher from Kentucky named Emma Summers, soon nicknamed the \\"Oil Queen of California.\\" She purchased a half-interest in an oil well for $700 in the area of the present-day Civic Center, using the proceeds from her piano lessons, and then purchased some others on credit. As her wells became successful, she shrewdly acquired others, forcing other operators out of business, and selling her oil to various local power companies, hotels, and utilities, all while doing her own accounting and continuing to give piano lessons at night. When the price of oil peaked around $1.80 a barrel, she controlled about half of the wells on the central portion of the field. In 1903 the boom briefly turned to bust as the price of oil dropped to only fifteen cents a barrel, due to abundant oil flooding the market from the Los Angeles field and others just opening up both in the Los Angeles basin and in the San Joaquin Valley. The peak year for the field was 1901, during which 1,150 active wells pumped over . Over 200 separate companies were in operation on the field at this time. Of these, the largest were Union Consolidated Crude Oil Company, L.A. Terminal & Transport, and Westlake Oil Company.Crowder, 69‚Äì70 Edward A. Clampitt, an eastern businessman who had come to Los Angeles to make a fortune in the oil industry, was also one of the principal operators in the first decade of the 20th century. Production declined quickly after the peak; there were simply too many wells draining a reservoir of limited capacity and pressure, and less and less oil was able to be profitably extracted. After 1915 only two new wells were drilled on the field. The early years on the field were not without mishap. In 1907, one of the gigantic redwood oil tanks near Echo Lake ruptured, and crude oil flooded downhill into the lake, catching fire and burning on the water for three days. The lake is now part of Echo Park, within the neighborhood of the same name. Lawlessness was a problem during the boom period as well, with oil thieves draining tanks overnight, stealing tools, and sabotaging wells of competitors.Crowder, 69‚Äì70 As the boom years of the field occurred before the formation of regulatory agencies in California, record keeping was sometimes sparse, not only for oil production but for the very existence and location of the wells. R.E. Crowder, writing in 1961, counted 142 wells which likely existed, but could not be located; some may have been dry holes.Crowder, 75 A more recent survey suggested that up to 300 wells may have been drilled within the vicinity of the oil field but abandoned without a trace. By 1961 most of the oil field was dedicated to redevelopment as a residential area, under the auspices of the Los Angeles Urban Renewal Association. At this time, 93 wells still remained active in the field, run by 22 separate companies. One by one the wells have been abandoned, with the one remaining well quietly pumping behind a fence on South Mountain View Avenue. =Recent land use controversies= After an explosion which leveled a Ross Dress for Less in the Fairfax District in 1985, caused by an overnight accumulation of methane which had seeped up from the underlying Salt Lake Oil Field,Ramos, Los Angeles Times, 1989 construction over Los Angeles's old oil fields became much more controversial and difficult. The city defined \\"methane zones\\" around all oil fields within its limits, and then enacted ordinances to ensure that new and existing structures within these zones were sufficiently ventilated to prevent the accumulation of explosive levels of methane. Mitigation systems for modern buildings include subsurface barriers, ventilation systems, methane detectors, and alarms. Thousands of buildings in the Los Angeles area have such systems, including the Staples Center and Los Angeles Convention Center.Bonner, Los Angeles Times, 1999 Construction of the Belmont Learning Center, now known as the Edward R. Roybal Learning Center, \\"the nation's most expensive high school\\" began in 1988 adjacent to, and partially above, the former oil field, and within a methane zone. Soil tests in the early 1990s showed methane at high levels, possibly migrating up from old wellbores (not all of which were mapped, let alone abandoned to modern standards). Construction of the complex continued intermittently, with partial demolition and reconstruction after additional contamination and an earthquake fault were found. The Learning Center eventually was completed at a cost of $377 million, not far from the area that was the field's center of operations 100 years before.

From Sunset magazine, 1911. Emma Summers (n√©e McCutchen, 1858 ‚Äì 1941) was an American oil tycoon in the 1890s and the early years of the twentieth century.  Personal life and education  Emma McCutchen, whose father was a banker and local official, was born in Kentucky in 1858. She later attended the New England Conservatory of Music, from which she graduated in 1879. She subsequently married Alpha C. Summers. Emma Summers and her husband eventually settled in Los Angeles, where she taught piano.  Career  In 1892, soon after taking up residence the city, she took note of the rising oil business in Los Angeles. The following year, in 1893, she used $700 that she had earned in her piano teaching business to invest in half ownership of a well near her Los Angeles home. Soon developing a keen interest in many facets of the oil business, she educated herself about many phases of it. At first, there were mixed results and occasional setbacks. However, she soon acquired more wells and took an active role in managing her growing business. As a Sunset magazine article from 1912 later reported, \\"She was an expert in testing oil, hired all the men\\" and was involved in every part of the business. By the early 1900s, Emma Summers had built an oil empire and was perhaps the most important oil tycoon in the area. Her success was widely noted, and she became known as California's \\"Oil Queen\\" (or variations of that appellation, such as ‚ÄúCalifornia's Petroleum Queen\\"). The San Francisco Call said she was \\"A woman with a genius for affairs,\\" adding that \\"it may sound paradoxical, but the fact exists. If Mrs. Emma A. Summers were less than a genius she could not, as she does today, control the Los Angeles oil markets.‚Äù As the oil boom subsided, Summers's fortunes declined. By 1915, the peak years of her oil business were over and she largely stepped away from her previously high-profile business life.

As described by the anthropologist Ronald Berndt in 1951, a dzamalag ritual would include dancing, singing, and the exchange of sexual favors and goods (especially tobacco) between the trading groups. In David Graeber's Debt: The First 5,000 Years, Graeber connects this phenomena with \\"the myth of barter\\", or the argument that bartering was not the predominant method of exchange in ancient societies. Barter was really only used when dealing with strangers, or with those you could not trust to establish long-term (often credit) relations with. The Gunwinggu people practiced Dzamalag when they wished to exchange items with another moiety, or party. An example of dzamalag held in the 1940s shows the main exchange being serrated spears and European cloth.
