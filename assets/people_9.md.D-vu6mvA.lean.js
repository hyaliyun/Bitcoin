Development In 1934 the airline Ala Littoria issued a specification for the supply of a new scheduled seaplane to be used on its commercial routes by sea. The CRDA took part in the competition with a project entrusted to the engineer Filippo Zappata who designed a low-wing monoplane, a three-engine with boot configuration, moving away from the central hull configuration typical of the CNT/CANT production until then. The first flight took place on 10 July 1935. Tests of the aircraft revealed insufficient engine power, unable to provide design characteristics. The aircraft was also paid attention to by assigning the registration number MM.268 to it. Not having achieved good performance from the seaplane, the company decided to test the Z.505 on a conventional wheeled chassis. Held in parallel with the CANT Z.1011, tests showed that in this form the aircraft would clearly not cause any interest among customers. The Z.505 was eventually used as a mail-plane from 1936, having receiving the registration number I-ZAPP (in honor of its designer). In 1938, it was transferred to Comando Aeronautica dell Egeo where it was used as the personal aircraft of the governor Cesare Maria de Vecchi (changing the registration number to I-VACI), where the aircraft was operated until the summer of 1941.

In 2008 OLCA was renamed as the Independent Lutheran Diocese. The ILD currently consists of four churches. As of 2015, there were 22 pastors serving in the United States along with three international pastors in Europe and Australia, with three church bodies in altar and pulpit fellowship in India and Myanmar.

The historic One-Year Lectionary is used in the ILD instead of the post-Vatican II Three-Year Lectionary or Revised Common Lectionary used by most liturgical Protestants in the United States.

History Mermaids was founded in 1995 by a group of parents of gender nonconforming children. The 2018 ITV drama series Butterfly, about a young transgender girl, was substantially informed by Mermaids and its CEO, Susie Green, a consultant on the series who worked with creator Tony Marchant. Marchant and cast members Emmett J. Scanlan and Anna Friel also met families involved with Mermaids to inform their creative processes. In December 2018, the charity was designated ¬£500,000 in funding by the National Lottery. However, the funding was put under review after criticism of the charity, including by Irish comedy writer Graham Linehan, who created a post on Mumsnet calling for members of the forum to email their concerns the National Lottery. In response to this, on 18 January 2019, YouTuber Hbomberguy began a livestream attempting to 101% complete Donkey Kong 64, with a goal of $500. The stream became popular and raised over $350,000 USD for Mermaids. Among other guests, the stream featured an appearance by American politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. On 19 February 2019, the National Lottery announced that it would follow through with the promised donation. Starting from 2017, Mermaids reported that it and its volunteers had been the subjects of online harassment, leading to concerns by parents whose children are supported by the organisation. CEO Green stated that she had been accused of forcibly castrating her transgender daughter, Jackie, who had been the youngest person in the world to undergo sex reassignment surgery after Green took her to Thailand for the procedure when she was sixteen. Jackie maintained that \\"If my mum had not helped me, I would not be here today\\" and transgender journalist Paris Lees wrote: \\"Susie Green is saving lives and I wish my parents had known about Mermaids when I was growing up\\". In June 2019, The Times revealed that they had discovered a data breach by Mermaids in which confidential emails had been made readily available through their website. The Times stated that these included names of transgender children and their parents, together with contact details and intimate medical information. The newspaper reported that there were internal e-mails from the trustees that criticised the leadership by Susie Green, as well as criticism from parents. Mermaids issued a press release on the same day, which acknowledged that a data breach had occurred, and that they had informed the Information Commissioner's Office and had corrected the breach. The press release stated that the breach was limited to internal emails and that no emails to and from families were part of the information leaked; The Times disputed this. In July 2020, the charity complained that the BBC had no longer included links to themselves on BBC LGBT advice pages, alongside two other organisations. The BBC said that Mermaids was removed after complaints were made about the information it provided, and for impartiality reasons.

Early life Anderson was born to a farming family in a rural area of Batesville, Mississippi. He began his education in a small school that convened first grade only every other year, so he started at age 5 and was more or less moved along as teachers recognized comprehension, so he left high school at 15 and graduated from Mississippi State University with a Bachelor of Science at 19. He undertook postgraduate studies in botany at Duke University and received a master's degree in 1933. It was here where Anderson became interested in mosses while studying under Hugo Leander Blomquist. At age 22, he earned his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. Career In 1936, Anderson was added to the botany faculty at Duke University to specialize cytology, and he was given the responsibility of curating the moss herbarium. Anderson's research then began to shift from cellular cytology to the ecology and classification of mosses. He, with the help of his colleague Ruth Margery Addoms, built the institution's first general botany course.Pearse, A. (1949). A History of Biology at Duke University. Bios, 20(1), 6-17. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/4605167 Throughout his career, Anderson was assisted by his wife, Pat, whom he met while she was a nursing student at Duke. They married in 1941 and after having 5 children between 1942 and 1947, she accompanied him on field trips, marking topography maps with collection sites and managing specimen packets. She also helped prepare and distribute \\"The Bryologist\\", journal of The American Bryological Society. During World War II, Anderson took leave from Duke to serve in the Navy and was intelligence officer from February through September, 1945 on the , an aircraft carrier in the Pacific. He was awarded a Bronze Star and was discharged as a lieutenant commander. Anderson frequently collaborated with Howard A. Crum, and in 1981, the two published a two-volume flora on the mosses of eastern North America. Anderson continued to expand the bryophyte herbarium at Duke, and he helped to develop a graduate program in bryology. He retired from Duke in 1982. Legacy The moss genus Bryoandersonia was named after him by Harold E. Robinson. Some species, including Bryocrumia andersonii, also bear his name. In 1998, the bryophyte herbarium at Duke University was officially named the L.E. Anderson Bryophyte Herbarium. It holds approximately 260,000 specimens.

Its first use came on 26 January 2019, when it hosted the 2019 Santiago ePrix, and replaced the previous Santiago Street Circuit as the venue of the race.  History  Santiago had always been expected to host the third round of the 2018/19 championship, but the race remained without an assigned location while FE and city officials negotiated terms for the electric championship to return and hold a second event, following the success of the inaugural race. However, a new layout was made necessary, after logistical challenges were encountered at the inaugural race, which faced intense opposition from local residents due to its use of roads through Santiago's Forestal Park. As such, plans were made to relocate the race to the O'Higgins Park, in a bid to reduce the disruption to local residents during the race.  Layout  The original layout of the circuit was a 14 turn, 2.4-km-long track, and consisted of the roads inside of the O‚ÄôHiggins Park, running around the Movistar Arena. The old 2019 Layout, with a chicane on the curving backstraight During the second running of the race at the Circuit, the 2020 Santiago ePrix, numerous changes to the track layout were made, most notably at the curving back straight, where the tight chicane was removed, while the pit lane was moved to the other side of the track, to the inside of the circuit. In addition, the sweeping right hander which was the former Turn 1 was modified, with a new left hander being added ahead of the former 1st turn. The final sector of the lap was also removed, with the zig-zag section of the track being reversed compared to the previous year. The removal of the chicane came as Formula E looked to reduce the number of chicanes on the tracks in the championship.

The third film to be produced by Camera Oscura (after Marc Bisaillon's well-received La v√©rit√© and La l√¢chet√©), producer Christine Falco described it as a work of hyperlink cinema (film choral). Lanouette Turgeon's debut feature is the story of three men‚ÄîBoucane (Samian), Lorenzo (Remo Girone), and Vincent (Roy Dupuis)‚Äîwhose lives are brought together through a strange sequence of events. The film features music by composer and performer Ramachandra Borcar (also known as Ramasutra or DJ Ram). Plot A young Aboriginal, Boucane, whose home life is mostly broken, leaves his reserve one summer night: freedom and a better life await him in Montr√©al. With only a bag containing clothes and a few possessions he heads south. He hooks up for a lift with Normand, a quirky old gangster whose truck contains suspicious cargo. Lorenzo is an old Italian immigrant on his last dime, walking the streets in search of scrap metal that he then tries to sell in order to survive. His wife Rosa Maria suffers from Alzheimer's and Lorenzo's goal is to fulfill the promise he made to Rosa Maria‚Äîto return her body for burial in Italy. His efforts at raising money for the trip are not enough. Vincent, a doctor stripped of his medical license, works for the Chinese mafia, treating a clientele of thugs he secretly despises, while managing the organization's pharmaceutical needs. He is married and a few months away from becoming a father; the double life eats away at him. He is desperately seeking a way out. Originally from France, Shaw Mue-Fan, known as \\"Muffin\\", is the common strand bringing these three men together. Well placed within the criminal organization, he is an enforcer with a knack for building alliances which has made him the youngest right arm in the history of the Montr√©al Triads. Their fates collide on the night of a lunar eclipse beginning with a new kind of Russian roulette. Fr√©d√©ric Chau in 2014 Cast Genres, style, and influences Lanouette Turgeon and Gulluni had a hard time categorizing the film's genre themselves, the director saying the phrase \\"dark fairy-tale\\" (fable noire) came up at one point, because it corresponds well to the conventions of the thriller, and because while their past short film collaborations have also been quite dark, Rock Paper Scissors has a lighter side to it due to the presence of the element of random chance (le hasard). Several different genres have been used by critics to describe the film, from simple drama to black comedy and film polar, a francophone subgenre of mystery or detective film (drame policier). Charles-Henri Ramond suggests the film is reminiscent of the Qu√©bec B-movie films polars of the 1970s, particularly Denys Arcand's La maudite galette and Jacques Godbout's La gammick. The film's title refers not only to the game Rock‚Äìpaper‚Äìscissors but also stands for the three main characters in their respective story or character arcs, each filmed in a different style: Rock is Boucane's story (he wears a good-luck charm made from a stone), filmed in wide-open spaces, with elements of Western movies; Paper is Lorenzo's story (the \\"paper\\" he seeks is the money he desperately needs), filmed in warmer colours, accompanied by classical music and a stable frame; finally, Scissors is Vincent's story, marked by cold colours, chrome in particular, and shot with a hand-held camera. The filmmakers, being great admirers of other films, in particular directors like Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu and the Coen Brothers, included many nods to other films: the drug injection scene is inspired by the Russian roulette scene in Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter, while the scene in which Boucane learns to shoot at bottles is an homage to Francis Mankiewicz's Le Temps d‚Äôune chasse. The overall form of the film was inspired by Gonz√°lez In√°rritu's masterwork Amores perros. A certain amount of the Paper part of the film is influenced by the films of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, while the way the Triads are presented is greatly influenced by Park Chan-wook's Old Boy. Production =Writing and casting= Samian The director and his co-writer began working on Rock Paper Scissors after they had produced a pair of successful short films, Papillons noirs and Le revenant, after which Gulluni approached Lanouette Turgeon with a title and an idea for three different films which would be linked by their supporting characters; they quickly realized they could make a single feature if they worked hard enough on the script. They had to find something which would connect the three main characters, which was \\"easier said than done\\", as the entire process took them eight years with the re-writes. The idea for the Aboriginal story was occurred shortly after Lanouette Turgeon met Algonquin rapper Samian at a film festival in France in 2005. The character was inspired directly from his own life: like Boucane, Samian left the First Nations reserve of Pikogan (near Amos) with a sack on his back to try his luck in Montr√©al, working regular jobs before making his name in music. Samian, who had to lose thirty pounds for the role (and some five years), only found out four years after the meeting that Lanouette Turgeon had effectively written a role based on his life. He agreed that Boucane, which is his first acting role, is a lot like him, and like many young Aboriginals who go to Montr√©al to start a new life, and find it is not easy. Roy Dupuis To find an Italian francophone actor who was also the right age to play Lorenzo, the team went to France and held auditions, there being relatively few such actors in Qu√©bec. When veteran Italian stage and film actor Remo Girone auditioned for the part, Lanouette Turgeon knew immediately he had found the right actor; then, Girone's wife, Victoria Zinny, came in carrying a few DVDs of Girone's previous films, and the director asked if they would mind doing a screen test together. It \\"gave him the shivers\\" (frissons) to see them bringing his characters to life. The rest of his team felt the same. Roy Dupuis was on board as soon as he had read the script. He liked the idea of the film starting with an Aboriginal in the \\"Grand Nord\\" moving slowly towards the cosmopolitan city of Montr√©al where everyone is just trying to get by. Dupuis considers the film daring and genuinely poetic. In writing the story of Boucane and his trip with Normand, Lanouette Turgeon immediately thought of Roger L√©ger to play him. L√©ger called it a great and nuanced character. Despite her long acting career, Rock Paper Scissors marked the first appearance by Marie-H√©l√®ne Thibault in a feature film. Her scenes as Beverley were shot in three days. =Financing= Funding for Rock Paper Scissors was secured in May 2011, in large part due to the involvement of star Roy Dupuis, who said that when he finds a project that strikes him as a piece of auteur cinema, he uses his influence to see to it the film gets made. The film received funding from T√©l√©film Canada, SODEC, the Harold Greenberg Foundation (Bell Media), Soci√©t√© Radio-Canada, Fonds Quebecor, Astral Media, and Super √âcran, as well as the Government of Canada in the form of a tax credit for Canadian film or video. =Filming= Principal photography took place in the city of Montr√©al and the surrounding area, as well as in the James Bay region, between 6 May to 2 June 2012, (26 days). In Montr√©al, scenes were shot in Chinatown, in the former Chinese Hospital in Villeray, and the area east of the Island. The film was shot with a projection ratio of 1:2.35, with the support of DCP and HDCAM SR. =Music= Ramachandra Borcar's score features music ranging from orchestral pieces for strings and brass instruments, to guitars and female vocals reminiscent of spaghetti Westerns, Chinese musical instruments, flamenco guitar, and electronic music, performed by thirty musicians including Richard White, Jonathan Cummins, Mikey Heppner, Lowell Campbell, Liu Fang, Phil Hornsey, and Borcar himself playing an array of rare electronic instruments like the swarmatron, modified omnichords and VCS3. The score was written in three different musical genres, each developed to flow with the script's three different stories. The main styles are: music inspired by spaghetti Westerns for Boucane's story, a more operatic sound with a large string orchestra for Lorenzo, and electro-acoustic music for Vincent. In an interview, Borcar admits he was not always sure it was working; his intention was for the styles to blend together as the stories came together: the spaghetti Western music transforms into a waltz. In addition to the score, the film features several other instrumental pieces, including three by the Budos Band and two composed by Gabriel Faur√©. Of particular significance is a selection from his Pavane, which plays during a key emotional moment: it is a piece which haunted Lanouette Turgeon during the eight years of work on the project, and for him, is inseparable from the character of Lorenzo. Release The film's world premiere was as the opening feature at the 31st Rendez-vous du cin√©ma qu√©b√©cois, which is held in Montr√©al and Qu√©bec City, on 21 February 2013, at the Imperial Cinema in Montr√©al; it was released in theatres the next day, 22 February 2013. =Home media= A DVD was released in Qu√©bec on 11 June 2013, in the original French with English subtitles. =Soundtrack= A soundtrack album was released on 22 February 2013 from Semprini Records. It is also currently available on Spotify and iTunes. Track listing Reception =Commercial performance= Rock Paper Scissors was the fifth-highest-grossing film of the year in the Province of Quebec by mid August 2013, collecting $107,000 in box office receipts. =Critical response= Shirley Noel calls the film daring and finds the script and its actors believable, and wishes that Samian and L√©ger's characters could have had a road movie feature on their own. Philippe Michaud gives the film 4.5 stars, saying the film captivates from beginning to end, impressed by the fact that often not a word is spoken, the camera resting on the face of an actor whose expression says everything, like in a spaghetti Western. Maxime Labreque says Lanouette Turgeon is a master filmmaker for managing the three interwoven stories, with different styles and film genres, the key to such a film being in its alternating scenes, timed, not systematically, but for the sake of better developing the stories. Annie Tanguay gives the film a 7.5/10, saying that despite being \\"Hollywood\\" kind of genre film, it is not very predictable. Malcolm Fraser, writing for Cult MTL, says the director has a good command of suspense and atmosphere, opining that the film is at its best \\"in its quiet moments; the plot with Samian and L√©ger is the strongest, with the relationship between the two men building slowly and subtly\\". He is also impressed by the realitic portrayal of the criminal world, where characters regret their decisions yet feel they have no choice but to continue a life of crime. The film's main flaw is a common one, the interweaving of too many storylines. Reviewing the film for Le Devoir, Odile Tremblay found the film well put together, despite a few unrealistic elements and missing linkages. The acting is exceptional, the camera work imaginative, and the sets alternately wonderfully kitsch or blood-curdling, while Ramachandra Borcar's score, here classical, there exotically themed, keeps the action going without overwhelming it. Brendan Kelly, writing for the Montreal Gazette, assigns the film 3.5 stars, stating at the start that while it is \\"by no means a perfect film\\", he admires its ambition and found many brilliant moments reminiscent of Quentin Tarrantino at his best, while the \\"many fine actors\\" are \\"at the top of their game\\"; \\"things go a little bit off the rails in the late going, but up until then Lanouette Turgeon does a bang-up job of juggling these various narrative threads, and the drama has real emotional force.\\" Francine Gaulin also gives the film 3.5 stars, noting the director's surpising mastery, stating the film's one weakness is a tendency to unnatural, expository dialogue. Assigning the film 3 stars, Charles-Henri Ramond calls it an enjoyable B-movie which reflects the social and ethnic reality of modern Qu√©bec, at times vascilating between a horror film and a psychological thriller which loses its way during the Russian roulette sequence somewhat, faulting it for having a fairly predictable ending. Jonathan Quesnel says the debut feature is done with panache, style and talent, borrowing here and there from, say, Wong Kar-wai or the Cohen Brothers, depicting a tableau of dark human despair with stunning aplomb; but the multiplicity of genres is also the film's weakness, undermining its coherence and integrity with so many stylistic nods to so many of the director's beloved films, rendering the tone uneven and less hard-hitting than it could be in the end. Yet, he thinks there is no doubt this is a promising filmmaker. Boris Nonveiller feels the film is neither really bad nor really good, the script being its weakest point, but still a good effort for a first film. =Accolades= *Jutra Award for Best Original Score (16th Jutra Awards, 2014) (Ramachandra Borcar) The film was also nominated for Canadian Screen Award for Best Original Score at the 2nd Canadian Screen Awards, but lost to Enemy.

ARD-1 was built by the Pacific Bridge Company and completed in September 1934. ARD-1 was commissioned at Alameda, California on 19 December 1935 then towed to San Diego, California. ARD-1 was the first in her class of self-sustaining, ship hull shape ship repair docks. ARD-1 was able to repair ships in a Naval fleet in remote locations. Lieutenant commander Charles M. Johnson was the first in command of ARD-1. Background and design USS ARD-1 was the third steel floating drydock built for the US Navy. The first two were the YFD-2 built in 1901 and the USS Dewey built in 1905. While these two floating drydock worked very well, they proved to be not very mobile. Both proved to be difficult to tow, as both lacked bows to cut though waves. A new design was needed, or as it turned out an older design made new. In the past wood ships hulls with no interior were used to drydock smaller ship that could fit into the drydock ship. This design, but with a steel ship hull was needed. The repair dock would have new modern steel ballast pontoons tanks that could be flooded with water to submerge the dock or pumped dry to raise a ship in need of repair. Between 1920 and 1930, the US Navy Bureau of Yards and Docks made numerous studies of various types of mobile docks of both signal unit and sectional types. The best was a one-piece dock, ship-shaped in form, with a molded closed bow and a stern that could be opened or closed. The stern could be closed with bottom-hinged flap gate, that was operated by hydraulic rams. This stern gate could lowered for ship entrance into the submerged dock and then closed to keep out wave. ARD-1 did not need a completely calm bay to operate. The new ARD-1 would be self-sustaining and have a rudder to help in tow moving, making ARD-1 very mobile. The ARD was raised by pumping water out of the ballast compartments and the main ship basin. ARDs would be equipped with a diesel-electric power plant, a pumping plant, repair shops, and crew's accommodations. ARD-1 was the first drydock that was self-sustaining enough to join a fleet into remote waters. ARD-1 could lift ships of up to 2200 tons, thus repair small crafts, tugs, small destroyers and small submarines. The design was so good that 30 ARDs docks were built most completed between 1942 and 1944. The need to repair large ship and subs meant the following ARDs were designed somewhat larger. Other improvements also were made from what was learned from ARD-1. ARDs were deployed throughout the world during the World War 2.

ARD-1 was taken to a forward Naval base at Kerama Retto, Okinawa Island to repair the many ships damaged by kamikaze attacks. ARD-1 made many temporarily repairs to get ships back into action. Many other ARDs joined ARD-1 in this important task. This minimized the time ships were out of action for repairs.USN, USS Spectacle (AM-305)Bureau of Ships Journal, Volume 1, May 1953, page 4.rootsweb.com, Wayne Loyd Chutenavsource, USS ARD-1 Post War On 21 October 1946 ARD-1 was decommissioned and moved back to the United States.

Opposition to the partition of India was widespread in British India in the 20th century and it continues to remain a talking point in South Asian politics. Those who opposed it often adhered to the doctrine of composite nationalism. The Hindu, Christian, Anglo-Indian, Parsi and Sikh communities were largely opposed to the partition of India (and its underlying two-nation theory), as were many Muslims (these were represented by the All India Azad Muslim Conference). Pashtun politician and Indian independence activist Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan of the Khudai Khidmatgar viewed the proposal to partition India as un-Islamic and contradicting a common history in which Muslims considered India as their homeland for over a millennium. Mahatma Gandhi opined that \\"Hindus and Muslims were sons of the same soil of India; they were brothers who therefore must strive to keep India free and united.\\" Muslims of the Deobandi school of thought \\"criticized the idea of Pakistan as being the conspiracy of the colonial government to prevent the emergence of a strong united India\\" and helped to organize the Azad Muslim Conference to condemn the partition of India. They also argued that the economic development of Muslims would be hurt if India was partitioned, seeing the idea of partition as one that was designed to keep Muslims backward. They also expected \\"Muslim- majority provinces in united India to be more effective than the rulers of independent Pakistan in helping the Muslim minorities living in Hindu-majority areas.\\" Deobandis pointed to the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, which was made between the Muslims and Qureysh of Mecca, that \\"promoted mutual interaction between the two communities thus allowing more opportunities for Muslims to preach their religion to Qureysh through peaceful tabligh.\\" Deobandi scholar Sayyid Husain Ahmad Madani argued for a united India in his book Muttahida Qaumiyat Aur Islam (Composite Nationalism and Islam), promulgating the idea that different religions do not constitute different nationalities and that the proposition for a partition of India was not justifiable, religiously. Khaksar Movement leader Allama Mashriqi opposed the partition of India because he felt that if Muslims and Hindus had largely lived peacefully together in India for centuries, they could also do so in a free and united India. Mashriqi saw the two-nation theory as a plot of the British to maintain control of the region more easily, if India was divided into two countries that were pitted against one another. He reasoned that a division of India along religious lines would breed fundamentalism and extremism on both sides of the border. Mashriqi thought that \\"Muslim majority areas were already under Muslim rule, so if any Muslims wanted to move to these areas, they were free to do so without having to divide the country.\\" To him, separatist leaders \\"were power hungry and misleading Muslims in order to bolster their own power by serving the British agenda.\\" In the 1946 Indian provincial elections, only 16% of Indian Muslims, mainly those from upper class, were able to vote. The common Indian Muslims, however, opposed the partition of India, believing that \\"that a Muslim state would benefit only upper-class Muslims.\\" The All India Conference of Indian Christians, representing the Christians of colonial India, along with Sikh political parties such as the Chief Khalsa Diwan and Shiromani Akali Dal led by Master Tara Singh condemned the call by separatists to create Pakistan, viewing it as a movement that would possibly persecute them. Pakistan was created through the partition of India on the basis of religious segregation; the very concept of dividing the country of India along religious lines has been criticized as being a backward idea for the modern era. After it occurred, critics of the partition of India point to the displacement of fifteen million people, the murder of more than one million people, and the rape of 75,000 women to demonstrate the view that it was a mistake.  Organisations and prominent individuals opposing the partition of India  = Political parties = First Session of All-India Jamhur Muslim League, which was established by Maghfoor Ahmad Ajazi to support a united India (1940). *All India Anglo-Indian Association led by its president Frank Anthony \\"vociferously opposed Partition\\". *All India Azad Muslim Conference was an organisation headed by the Premier of Sind Allah Bakhsh Soomro, which represented the religiously observant Muslim working class; in one of the largest gatherings of Muslims in colonial India, it rallied in Delhi to oppose the partition of India. *All India Conference of Indian Christians opposed the partition of India, as well as the creation of separate electorates based on religion; it supported swaraj and helped to secure to rights of minorities in the Constitution of India. *All-India Jamhur Muslim League was erected \\"in 1940, to oppose Jinnah's scheme of Pakistan\\". *All India Momin Conference saw itself as articulating the interests of common, rather than upper-class Muslims and passed a resolution against the partition of India in 1940. It said: ‚Äúthe Partition scheme was not only impracticable and unpatriotic but altogether un-Islamic and unnatural, because the geographical position of the different provinces of India and the intermingled population of the Hindus and Muslims are against the proposal and because the two communities have been living together for centuries, and they have many things in common between them.‚Äù *All India Muslim Majlis opposed the partition of India \\"as impracticable\\". *All India Shia Political Conference protested the idea of creating a Pakistan, being against the partition of colonial India. It also supported common electorates. *Anjuman-i-Watan Baluchistan allied itself with the Indian National Congress and opposed the partition of India. *Central Khalsa Young Men Union declared its \\"unequivocal opposition\\" to the creation of a separate Muslim state in northwestern India, as with other Sikh organisations. *Chief Khalsa Diwan declared its \\"unequivocal opposition\\" to the creation of a separate Muslim state in northwestern India, as with other Sikh organisations. *Communist Party of India opposed the partition of India and did not participate in the Independence Day celebrations of 15 August 1947 in protest of the division of the country. *Indian National Congress firmly opposed the partition of India, though it later reluctantly accepted it after the failure of the Cabinet Mission Plan. *Jamiat Ahl-i-Hadis was a member party of the All India Azad Muslim Conference, which opposed the partition of India. *Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind was \\"uncompromisingly against the formation of Pakistan\\", rejecting the idea of the partition and instead advocating for composite nationalism in a united India (cf.

To me it seems a sure sign of cowardice to give up what is my patrimony and content myself with a mere fragment of it.\\" He argued that if India were divided into two states, \\"there would remain three and half crores of Muslims scattered in small minorities all over the land. With 17 per cent in UP, 12 per cent in Bihar and 9 per cent in Madras, they will be weaker than they are today in the Hindu majority provinces. They have had their homelands in these regions for almost a thousand years and built up well known centres of Muslim culture and civilisation there.\\" Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana, the Premier of Punjab and leader of the Unionist Party, opposed the partition of India, referencing the pain that it would cause if the Punjab Province were divided. He felt that Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus of the Punjab all had a common culture and was against dividing India to create a religious segregation between the same people. Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana, himself a Muslim, remarked to the separatist leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah: \\"There are Hindu and Sikh Tiwanas who are my relatives. I go to their weddings and other ceremonies. How can I possibly regard them as coming from another nation?\\" Tiwana advocated for amity between the religious communities of undivided India, proclaiming March 1st as Communal Harmony Day and aiding in the establishment of a Communal Harmony Committee in Lahore presided over by Raja Narendra Nath with its secretary being Maulvi Mahomed Ilyas of Bahawalpur. *Abul Kalam Azad stated that the creation of a Pakistan would only benefit upper class Muslims who would come to monopolize the economy of the separate state; he warned that if it would be created, it would be controlled by international powers, \\"and with the passage of time this control will become tight\\". *Abdul Matlib Mazumdar supported Hindu-Muslim unity and opposed the partition of India, being a prominent Muslim leader in eastern Hindustan. *Abdul Qayyum Khan, a barrister from the North-West Frontier Province of colonial India, declared that he would resist the partition of India with his own blood; he reversed his position in 1945 and joined the All India Muslim League *Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai argued against the two-nation theory, favouring a united India. *Allah Bakhsh Soomro, the Chief Minister of Sind, was vehemently opposed to partitioning India on the basis of religious lines; he chaired the All India Azad Muslim Conference to advocate for a united and independent India. Allah Bakhsh Soomro proclaimed that the very concept of \\"The Muslims as a separate nation in India on the basis of their religion, is un-Islamic.\\" *Ansar Harvani, a nationalist Muslim, voted against the resolution to partition India. *Altaf Hussain, a Pakistani politician and founder of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement political party, called the partition of India the \\"greatest blunder\\" that resulted in \\"the division of blood, culture, brotherhood, relationships\\". *Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed supported Mahatma Gandhi's vision of a united India. *Fazl-i-Hussain was opposed to the separatist campaign to create a Muslim state through the division of India. *Frank Anthony, president of the All India Anglo-Indian Association, \\"vociferously opposed Partition\\". *Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah, who was elected as the Chief Minister of Sind from 1937‚Äì1938 and also 1942‚Äì1947, rejected the idea to partition India. *Inayatullah Khan Mashriqi advocated a joint Hindu-Muslim revolution and called everyone to \\"all rise against\\" the \\"conspiracy\\" of a partition plan. *Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi saw the idea of the partition of India as one that catered to the imperialist policy of divide and rule and he thus strongly opposed it, calling for an Akhand Hindustan (Hindi-Urdu for \\"united India\\"). *Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan opposed the partition of India and campaigned against British rule in the country through nonviolence. *Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan favoured a united India and was an ally of the Indian National Congress. He stood against communalism and battled the Muslim League after it became apparent that a Pakistan would be created out of the provinces of northwest colonial India. *Khwaja Abdul Majid was a social reformer and lawyer \\"who supported Gandhi in his opposition to the partition of India.\\" *Khwaja Atiqullah, the brother of the Nawab of Dhaka, \\"collected 25,000 signatures and submitted a memorandum opposing the partition\\". *Lal Khan, a Pakistani politician and founder of The Struggle Pakistan, criticized the partition of India and advocated for Indian reunification, which he stated would heal continuing wounds and solve the Kashmir conflict. Advocating for a common revolution, Khan declared that \\"Five thousand years of common history, culture and society is too strong to be cleavaged by this partition.\\" *Maghfoor Ahmad Ajazi opposed the partition of India and founded the All-India Jamhur Muslim League to advocate for a united India. *Mahatma Gandhi opposed the partition of India, seeing it as contradicting his vision of unity among Indians of all religions. *Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana, the Premier of Punjab, opposed the partition of India, seeing it as a ploy to divide the Punjab Province and Punjabi people. He felt that Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus of the Punjab all had a common culture and was against dividing India on the basis of religious segregation. Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana, himself a Muslim, remarked to the separatist leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah: \\"There are Hindu and Sikh Tiwanas who are my relatives. I go to their weddings and other ceremonies.

He said that the British orchestrated the partition of India in order to prevent a united India from emerging as an industrial power that would rival the economy of any western state. *Master Tara Singh declared that his party, the Shiromani Akali Dal would fight \\"tooth and nail\\" against the partition of India and creation of Pakistan. *Maulana Mazhar Ali Azhar referred to Jinnah as Kafir-e-Azam (\\"The Great Kafir\\").

Muttahida Qaumiyat aur Islam).

The admission of the Working Committee was an admission of weakness and the result of a sense of despair. The Partition would not benefit either community ‚Äì the Hindus in Pakistan and the Muslims in India would both live in fear.\\" *Rafi Ahmed Kidwai supported Mahatma Gandhi's vision of a united India. *Saifuddin Kitchlew, a Kashmiri Muslim leader and President of the Punjab Provincial Congress Committee, was strongly opposed to the partition of India, calling it \\"a surrender of nationalism in favour of communalism\\".

Singh said that the armed forces of undivided India were not affected by the \\"virus of communalism\\" and \\"were capable of holding the country together and thereby avoiding Partition.\\" Singh was unable to forgive the politicians for failing to consult with the Indian Army before accepting the partition of India. = Historians = thumb300px\\"To welcome Partition is to imply that people with different backgrounds and different blood-lines cannot live together in one nation, a regressive suggestion.\\" ‚ÄîRajmohan Gandhi, Professor at the Center for South Asian and Middle Eastern Studies of the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign *Alain Dani√©lou, a French historian, saw the partition of India as a \\"great mistake\\" both \\"on the human level as well as on the political one\\". Dani√©lou stated that it \\"burdened India\\" and added to the region Pakistan, which he called an \\"unstable state\\". He said that as a result of the division of India, \\"India whose ancient borders stretched until Afghanistan, lost with the country of seven rivers (the Indus Valley), the historical centre of her civilisation.\\" *Rajmohan Gandhi, at the Oxford Union, stated in 2018 that ‚ÄúTo welcome Partition is to imply that people with different backgrounds and different blood-lines cannot live together in one nation. A regressive suggestion.‚Äù Gandhi opined that \\"The corollary that those possessing a common religion or common race enjoy blissful companionship in their homes, nations or regions is, well, hilarious.\\" He holds that \\"tyranny was multiplied by partition\\". = Scientists = *Pervez Hoodbhoy criticized the partition of India, calling it an \\"unspeakable tragedy\\" that \\"separated people who at one time could live together in peace\\". = Writers = *Ashis Ray, president of the Indian Journalists' Association, criticized the partition of India at a debate organized by the Oxford Union in 2018, holding that Hindus and Muslims could have lived together peacefully in a united India. *Hasrat Mohani, an Urdu poet who coined the Hindustani language phrase Inquilab Zindabad (translation: \\"Long live the revolution!\\") was against the two-nation theory and chose to remain in independent India after the partition occurred. *Jaun Elia opposed the partition of India due to his Communist ideology, remembering his birth city Amroha with nostalgia after he moved to Karachi. *M. Alexeyev, writing in the Bolshevik less than one year after the partition of India occurred, stated: *Saadat Hasan Manto strongly opposed the partition of India, which he saw as an \\"overwhelming tragedy\\" and \\"maddeningly senseless\\". The literature he is remembered for is largely about the partition of India. *Sri Aurobindo, a poet, saw the partition of India as a \\"monstrosity\\" and on 15 August 1947, stated that he hoped \\"the Nation will not accept the settled fact as for ever settled, or as anything more than a temporary expedient.\\" He further said that \\"if it lasts, India may be seriously weakened, even crippled; civil strife may remain always possible, possible even a new invasion and foreign conquest. The partition of the country must go...For without it the destiny of India might be seriously impaired and frustrated. That must not be.\\" Aurobindo saw the two-nation theory as \\"new-fanged\\", \\"contrary to the facts\\" and being \\"invented by Jinnah for his purposes\\"; Aurobindo wrote that \\"More than 90% of the Indian Muslims are descendants of converted Hindus and belong as much to the Indian nation as the Hindu themselves. Jinnah is himself a descendant of a Hindu named Jinnahbhai\\" (cf. Jinnah family. *Tarek Fatah, a Pakistani Canadian author and journalist, has criticized the partition of India, calling the division of the country \\"tragic\\" and lamenting that his homeland of Punjab \\"was sliced in two by the departing British to create the new state of Pakistan.\\" He states that the British partitioned India so that they would be able to combat Soviet influence through the establishment of British military installations in what was then northwestern colonial India (now Pakistan). = Religious leaders and organizations = *All India Conference of Indian Christians opposed the partition of India, as well as the creation of separate electorates based on religion; it supported swaraj and helped to secure to rights of minorities in the Constitution of India. *Darul Uloom Deoband continues to oppose the two-nation theory, instead advocating for composite nationalism and a united India. *Jamaat-e-Islami actively worked to prevent the partition of India, with its leader Maulana Abul A'la Maududi arguing that concept violated the Islamic doctrine of the ummah. The Jamaat-e-Islami saw the partition as creating a temporal border that would divide Muslims from one another. *Zakir Naik criticized the partition of India and creation of Pakistan, calling it a tragedy. Naik holds that those who advocated the creation of Pakistan out of the northwestern provinces of colonial India were \\"not even practising Muslims\\".  Indian Reunification proposals  The subject of undoing the partition and reunifying India has been discussed by both Indians and Pakistanis. In The Nation, Kashmiri Indian politician Markandey Katju has advocated the reunification of India with Pakistan under a secular government. He stated that the cause of the partition was the divide and rule policy of Britain, which was implemented to spread communal hatred after Britain saw that Hindus and Muslims worked together to agitate against their colonial rule in India. Katju serves as the chairman of the Indian Reunification Association (IRA), which seeks to campaign for this cause. Pakistani historian Nasim Yousaf, the grandson of Allama Mashriqi, has also championed Indian Reunification and presented the idea at the New York Conference on Asian Studies on 9 October 2009 at Cornell University; Yousaf stated that the partition of India itself was a result of the British interests and their divide and rule policy that sought to create another buffer state between the Soviet Union and India to prevent the spread of Communism, as well the fact that a \\"division of the people and territory would prevent a united India from emerging as a world power and keep the two nations dependent on pivotal powers.\\" Yousaf cited former Indian National Congress president Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, who wrote in the same vein: Yousaf holds that \\"Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the President of the All-India Muslim League and later founder of Pakistan, had been misleading the Muslim community in order to go down in history as the saviour of the Muslim cause and to become founder and first Governor General of Pakistan.\\" Allama Mashriqi, a nationalist Muslim, thus saw Jinnah as \\"becoming a tool in British hands for his political career.\\" Besides the pro-separatist Muslim League, Islamic leadership in British India rejected the notion of partitioning the country, exemplified by the fact that most Muslims in the heartland of the subcontinent remained where they were, rather than migrating to newly created state of Pakistan. India and Pakistan are currently allocating a significant amount of their budget into military spending‚Äîmoney that could be spent in economic and social development. Poverty, homelessness, illiteracy, terrorism and a lack of medical facilities, in Yousaf's eyes, would not be plaguing an undivided India as it would be more advantaged \\"economically, politically, and socially.\\" Yousaf has stated that Indians and Pakistanis speak a common lingua franca, Hindustani, \\"wear the same dress, eat the same food, enjoy the same music and movies, and communicate in the same style and on a similar wavelength\\". He argues that uniting would be a challenge, though not impossible, citing the fall of the Berlin Wall and the consequent German Reunification as an example. French journalist Fran√ßois Gautier and Pakistani politician Lal Khan have expressed the view that Indian reunification would solve the conflict in the region of Jammu & Kashmir.

It is an erect shrub with hairy stems, wrinkled, egg-shaped leaves and pink, bell-like flowers with purple streaks inside. Description Pityrodia obliqua is an erect shrub which grows to a height of about , its branches covered with greenish grey hairs. The leaves are egg-shaped with a blunt tip, mostly long and wide with a petiole long. The leaves are hairy on both surfaces, wrinkled on the top and with conspicuous veins on the lower side. The flowers are arranged in groups of between three and seven in the upper leaf axils, the groups usually shorter than the leaves. The stalks of the flowers and the outside of the sepals and petals are densely covered with woolly hairs. The five sepals are joined only near their bases and are glabrous inside. The petals are pink with purple streaks inside, mostly long and mostly glabrous inside except for a hairy ring just above the ovary and a few long hairs on the lower petal. The petals are joined to form a tube about as long as the speals, with five unequal lobes. The lower middle lobe is more or less round, long, wide and the other four lobes are egg-shaped and smaller. The four stamens extend slightly beyond the end of the tube, one pair slightly shorter than the other. Flowering occurs from May to July and is followed by a black, almost spherical fruit in diameter. Taxonomy and naming Pityrodia obliqua was first formally described in 1918 by William Vincent Fitzgerald and description was published in Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Western Australia. The specific epithet (obliqua) is a Latin word meaning \\"slanting\\", \\"sideways\\" or \\"indirect\\". Distribution This pityrodia occurs in the Kimberley region of Western Australian, where it grows on rocky places in mountain ranges. Conservation Pityrodia byrnesii is classified as \\"Priority One\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.

Biography  He studied at the Carolino College of Puebla, where he obtained a bachelor's and a doctorate. He was priest of Santa Ana Acatl√°n and Huamuxtitl√°n. He served as chaplain of the royalist army commanded by Mateo Musitu in Chiautla de la Sal. At the end of 1811, when Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos took the place, he was apprehended along with the rest of the royalist soldiers. However, he decided to go over to the insurgent side, being appointed military vicar. After the capture of Oaxaca in 1812, he gave a solemn mass in the Oaxaca Cathedral to celebrate the occasion. Two months later, Morelos commissioned him to found and direct the Correo Americano del Sur newspaper, in this publication he collaborated with Carlos Mar√≠a de Bustamante. In September 1813, he was a deputy of the Chilpancingo Congress representing the Tecpan province. He collaborated in the drafting of the Constitutional Decree for the Liberty of Mexican America, he was a signatory to it, as well as the Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of North America. In 1815, Morelos appointed him plenipotentiary to negotiate with the United States government in Washington D.C. the supply of arms and ammunition. For this trip, Morelos entrusted him with the custody of his son Juan Nepomuceno Almonte, however they only managed to reach New Orleans. After the death of Morelos, Herrera returned to Puebla, where he accepted the pardon offered by the viceroy Juan Ruiz de Apodaca. At the instructions of Bishop Antonio Joaqu√≠n P√©rez, he taught a Chair in Philosophy at his alma mater. In 1821, after the independence of Mexico had been consummated, Agust√≠n de Iturbide appointed him Minister of Foreign and Internal Relations of the First Mexican Empire. During Vicente Guerrero's government, he was appointed Minister of Justice and Ecclesiastical Business. He was the President of the Chamber of Deputies in 1828 and 1829.

The scientific director of the Omega program was A. M. Prokhorov. Practical work was carried out by Strela Design Bureau, (later - Almaz).  History  Boris Vasilyevich Bunkin (Raspletin's deputy) and his brother Fedor Vasilievich Bunkin (employee of Prokhorov) showed that low-flying targets could be destroyed with a neodymium-emitting glass laser with an active medium volume of approximately . General Designer of the KB-1 Academician Alexander Andreevich Raspletina and Prokhorov raised the idea before the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers. The proposal received support in the defense department of CPSU-CC and in the Military-Industrial Commission (MIC) of the USSR Council of Ministers. On February 23, 1967, a Decree was issued, and on June 26 the MIC signed on. These documents determined the direction of work, the composition of the researchers and the creation of a laser complex, which received the code name \\"Omega\\". The laser energy required to hit an air target was determined the same as the total kinetic energy of a surface-to-air missile warhead, some 10 megajoules. The laser was based at Sary Shagan testing range.  Omega Complex  In 1972, Omega-2 elements began to be delivered to facility 2506. The laser locator (based on ruby lasers) was put together with a high-power simulator based on neodymium glass lasers. The chief designer was Sukharev Ye. M. at Almaz Central Design Bureau. For the first time, the laser location of the aerodynamic target was carried out, its image was constructed, a target spot was evaluated, the precision of the simulator was estimated, and the effect of the atmosphere on the propagation of laser radiation was investigated. The studies indicated that the project was infeasible. A new experimental Omega-2M 73T6 complex began, in which a high-power carbon dioxide open type generator with high-power pumping (BGRF) was evaluated. The locator was built on the basis of the television system TOV Karat-2. The chief designer was L.N. Zakharyev, his deputy and Yu. A. Konyaev, the responsible manager of all the works. On September 22, 1982, for the first time in the USSR, a radio-controlled target RUM-2 B was hit by laser radiation. Further tests confirmed the result. A mobile version of the 74T6 laser complex was developed. However, the device could not surpass the existing ZRK.

She is co-author of a book on the successful efforts to attract and retain women in computing at Carnegie Mellon, where women represented 50% of the incoming class to the computer science major in fall 2018. She has been recognized by the A. Nico Habermann Award of the Computing Research Association and the AccessComputing Capacity Building Award. Education and career Frieze studied English literature for a while at the University of London before moving into cultural studies at Carnegie Mellon, eventually earning her Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University in Cultural Studies in Computer Science. Her 2007 dissertation, The critical role of culture and environment as determinants of women's participation in computer science, was supervised by Lenore Blum. She has taught at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital School in England and in the English department at Carnegie Mellon before coming to work for the School of Computer Science. Women@SCS, one of the organizations Frieze directs at Carnegie Mellon, is based on the guiding premise of leveling the playing field, working to ensure that women receive the same social, networking, mentoring, and professional opportunities, that are more readily available to the majority male peers. She also works on diversity and inclusion through BiasBusters@CMU, an academic interactive program aiming to raise awareness of bias and mitigate the harmful effects of unconscious bias on campus. Books With Jeria Quesenberry, Frieze is a co- author of the book Kicking Butt in Computer Science: Women in Computing at Carnegie Mellon University (Dog Ear Publishing, 2015). The book describes Carnegie Mellon's successful work to attract and retain female students in Carnegie Mellon's computer science major by focusing on the culture of computing rather than by making changes to the computer science curriculum. Frieze and Quesenberry are co-editors of the book Cracking the Digital Ceiling: Women in Computing Around the World, Cambridge University Press, 2020. This collection of global perspectives challenges the view that men are more suited to computing fields than women, a belief often perpetuated as an explanation for women‚Äôs low participation in computing in the USA. By providing an insider look at how different cultures from all continents around the world impact the experiences of women in computing, the book introduces readers to theories and evidence that support the need to turn to cultural and environmental factors, rather than innate potential, to understand what determines women‚Äôs participation in computing. The book is a wakeup call to examine the obstacles and catalysts within various cultures and environments that help determine women's participation in this rapidly growing field. Recognition Frieze won the A. Nico Habermann Award of the Computing Research Association in 2017. The award citation commended her for \\"devoting nearly two decades to promoting diversity and inclusiveness in computing\\", for publishing \\"valuable research towards understanding the challenges diverse populations face\\", and for helping to bring the number of women majoring in computer science at Carnegie Mellon close to 50%, \\"far above the national average\\". Personal life Frieze grew up in a coal mining village in Nottinghamshire, England, and was the first in her family to go to college. Frieze is married to mathematician Alan M. Frieze. They have two adult children and four grandchildren.

History The system was revealed for the first time by Russian President Vladimir Putin during his message to the Federal Assembly on 1 March 2018. The equipment of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation with the complexes began in 2017. On 1 December 2018, the Peresvet laser complex took over experimental combat duty. According to Valery Gerasimov, the Peresvet laser complexes have been on the combat duty since the beginning of December 2019. The complexes have been deployed with the road-mobile ICBM launchers with the task of covering their maneuvers. According to Sergei Shoigu, as of 1 December 2019, Peresvet was deployed with five RVSN rocket divisions. Design According to the military expert Igor Korotchenko, director of the Center for Analysis of the World Trade in Arms, the Peresvet combat laser can be successfully used against unmanned aerial vehicles. At the same time, its effectiveness directly depends on environmental conditions; in good weather, it works perfectly, but fog, rain, snow and other adverse weather events can interfere with the passage of the laser beam. The expert also added that such installations consume a lot of electricity, so using them as a portable tool is unlikely to succeed; but in the future they will be able to protect military bases and other locations from penetrations of UAVs into their territory.

They were signed to Epic Records from 1997 to 1998, and released one self-titled album through the label, before breaking up shortly after. History =Early years (1991‚Äì1996)= Formed in 1991 in the Central Californian city of San Luis Obispo, The Din Pedals were initially a power trio in search of a lead vocalist and a drummer. After settling on James Grundler to perform both duties, they released two independent records during the mid-1990s. These releases were successes locally. In 1996, classically trained drummer Alex Wong replaced Grundler on percussion. =Major label years and break up (1997‚Äì1998)= By the beginning of 1997, the band garnered enough buzz to sign with the major label Epic Records. They immediately began recording their self-titled major label debut in Los Angeles, with it being completed in June 1997. It was helmed by British producer Stephen Short. While the record was being prepared for release, the song \\"Waterfall\\" appeared in the popular 1997 slasher film I Know What You Did Last Summer. It was also included on the film's soundtrack album, released on October 7, 1997 by Columbia Records. On February 10, 1998, their self-titled album was finally released. It failed to attract mainstream attention, and vocalist James Grundler subsequently quit the band, with plans of launching a solo career. He would eventually instead form another Californian alternative rock band called Paloalto, who released two albums through Rick Rubin's American Recordings in the early 2000s. Musical style The Din Pedals sound has been heavily compared to the British band Radiohead. AllMusic critic Tom Demalon remarked \\"They are one of the first, and best, examples of the influence of Radiohead on late-'90s alternative rock.\\" The band's guitarist, simply known as \\"Harrison\\", described their sound in a 1996 interview with Billboard as \\"U2 times Radiohead.\\" Members *James Grundler - Vocals (1991 - 1998), Drums (1991 - 1996) *Harrison - Guitar (1991 - 1998) *Ben DeJong - Bass (1991 - 1998) *Alex Wong - Drums (1996 - 1998) Discography *Candide (1995) [Recorded in 1994] *Plastic and Chrome (1996) [Recorded in 1995] *The Din Pedals (1998) [Recorded in 1997] References Category:Alternative rock groups from California Category:Musical groups established in 1991 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1998 ","title":"The Din Pedals"},{"id":"59727305","text":"The Elroy Air Cargo is an unmanned cargo aircraft developed by American startup company Elroy Air, intended to replace land delivery trucks on inefficient routes with unmanned aircraft.  Development  The San Francisco-based company was founded in November 2016 by David Merrill, CEO and Clint Cope, VP engineering. Elroy Air initially pursued the electric aircraft VTOL air taxi market, but turned to autonomous cargo aircraft to avoid starting out dealing with the complications of passenger-carrying certification. In December 2017, the company secured US$4.6 million of seed funding, led by aerial mobility investor Levitate Capital. The company is targeting the US government as a customer first, with a start date of 2021. This will be followed by overseas governments, then the US domestic commercial cargo market. By early 2018, a full-scale prototype had been tested at Half Moon Bay Airport, south of San Francisco. Its lift system‚Äîrotors, motors and controllers‚Äîwas rigged on a truck-based testbed to verify the aerodynamic lift produced and the aircraft noise levels for urban areas operations. In early 2018 a subscale prototype was under construction to validate the aerodynamics and controls, with ground testing planned in early March 2018 and first flight by late March. The full-scale aircraft is forecast to be flown by late summer 2018. In early 2019, Elroy Air raised another $4.6 million, giving it a total of $9.2 million to bring it to market in 2020. On August 14, The Chaparral large unmanned cargo aircraft made its first flight at Camp Roberts, California, a 64 s hover. The hybrid-electric propulsion system for beyond visual line of sight testing should fly in the second half of 2020 on a second prototype. A further Series A funding round is required for serial production towards 2021 deliveries.  Design  The tandem-wing design to be employed in the air cargo role has a pusher propeller for forward flight, six propellers under twin booms for vertical lift and a pod to carry 150 lb (68 kg) of cargo under the central fuselage. The hybrid electric powertrain has variable-pitch rotors with a large diameter to turn more slowly, for redundancy and to reduce noise. Its 150 mi (240 km) operational radius is optimized for express delivery. Ground robots are planned to be employed for ground handling and one pilot would be responsible for an entire aircraft fleet.

Career Working at the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, Cormier and Matt Doug exposed how Florida police officers with multiple complaints and crimes were able to keep their jobs. Their series of reports, \\"Unfit for Duty\\", earned them the 2011 \\"Print/Online ‚Äì Small\\" award from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE), and the Herald-Tribune the 2012 EPPY award for Best Investigative/Enterprise Feature on a Website with under 1 million unique monthly visitors. His investigative work with Michael Braga led to a series of reports on how Florida bankers illegally looted their banks during the real estate boom. The series, \\"Breaking the Banks\\", led to lawsuits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and indictments against three bankers.

The report attracted attention because such an action by Trump would constitute a felony. Democratic congressmen publicly mused impeachment. The report came under scrutiny, however, after Mueller broke precedent by issuing a denial and other news organisations were unable to corroborate the findings with reports of their own. On April 5, 2019, Cormier co-authored a story that was presented as an update to the January 2019 story. The April story referenced a 12-page memo submitted by Cohen's legal counsel to Congress that said President Trump \\"encouraged Cohen to lie and say all Moscow Tower project contacts ended as of January 31, 2016 using 'code' language.\\" Subsequently, on April 18, 2019, the original Cohen report was updated to state that the \\"Mueller report found that Trump did not direct Michael Cohen to lie.\\" References External links * \\"Breaking the Banks\\", winner of the 2013 Investigative Reporters and Editors award for Print/Online ‚Äì Small * \\"Insane.

The Helderberg MPA is in the warm temperate Agulhas bioregion. The shoreline is sandy beach with mobile dunes, and the seabed is low sandstone reef with kelp beds and sand sediments. The areas nearest to the river mouths are in relatively poor condition due to pollution of the river water. The beach inside the MPA is the most pristine part of the north shore of False Bay. History The area was established as a reserve in 1991. The MPA was proclaimed by the Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, Mohammed Valli Moosa, in Government Gazette No. 21948 of 29 December 2000 in terms section 43 of the Marine Natural Resources Act, 18 of 1998. Purpose A marine protected area is defined by the IUCN as \\"A clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values\\". Extent The length of the protected shoreline is 4 km, and the area of protected ocean is 24.6 km2. =Zonation= The whole MPA is a no-take reserve. =Boundaries= * Northern boundary is the high-water mark, * Southern boundary is a line 500 m seawards of the high-water mark. * Western boundary is a line at 180¬∞ true from the mouth of the Eerste River, * Eastern boundary is a line at 180¬∞ true from the mouth of the Lourens River, in False Bay. Management . The marine protected areas of South Africa are the responsibility of the national government, which has management agreements with a variety of MPA management authorities, in this case, the MPA is managed by the City of Cape Town with funding from the SA Government through the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA). The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is responsible for issuing permits, quotas and law enforcement. Management of the Helderberg MPA has objectives compliant with the general objectives of the Marine Living Resources Act, which are to protect the indigenous fauna and flora and the environment on which they depend, protect breeding stock, facilitate stock recovery, improve stock in surrounding areas and maintain pristine communities for research, and to minimise conflict between competing uses of the area. Specific biophysical goals of the MPA management plan are protection of the environment and maintenance of biodiversity and functioning of the ecosystems, to protect depleted and endemic species and their required habitats, and enhance sustainability of marine fisheries. Socioeconomic goals are to develop non-consumptive ecotourism, provide for research and monitoring effects of human activities, and promotion of conservation among tourists and scholars. The governance goals are to develop legal structures to protect the biodiversity of the MPA. Use =Activities requiring a permit= Fishing Marine species for aquarium usage may only be collected under the authority of a valid permit issued under section 13 of the MLRA. Living organisms may be collected for scientific purposes, but only in terms of a permit. Boating There is no boat launching site within the Helderberg MPA. Boats may pass through and anchor in the waters, but all fishing gear must be stowed during passage. =Prohibited activities= The MPA is a no- take zone, so no fishing, harvesting of invertebrates or seaweeds, or bait collection of any kind is allowed. Geography The main habitats in the Helderberg MPA are: *Sandy beaches, which include the typical three zones: **the surf zone, **the beach, with intertidal and backshore zones, and **the sand dunes. Sandy beaches are dynamic habitats, with change mostly driven by wave action. These habitats provide a home to hardy and well adapted organisms. The local dunes are part of a mobile dune system in which sand is transported in the littoral and longshore zones and is trapped by vegetation, causing fore-dune development. =General topography= The coastline is sandy beaches with mobile dune systems, offshore habitats include rocky reefs and soft sandy sediments. =Geology= Low sandstone reefs with sand deposits. Very fine, low density silt may settle during calm periods, but readily becomes suspended again when disturbed. =Bathymetry= The nautical charts of this area indicate a depth not exceeding 10 m. =Climate of the South- western Cape= The climate of the South-western Cape is markedly different from the rest of South Africa, which is a summer rainfall region, receiving most of its rainfall during the summer months of December to February. The South-western Cape has a Mediterranean type climate, with most of its rainfall during the winter months from June to September. During the summer the dominant factor determining the weather in the region is a high pressure zone, known as the South Atlantic High, located over the South Atlantic ocean to the west of the Cape coast. Winds circulating in an anticlockwise direction from such a system reach the Cape from the south-east, producing periods of up to several days of high winds and mostly clear skies. These winds keep the region relatively cool. Because of its south facing aspect Helderberg MPA is exposed to these winds. Winter in the South-western Cape is characterised by disturbances in the circumpolar westerly winds, resulting in a series of eastward moving depressions. These bring cool cloudy weather and rain from the north west. The south westerly winds over the South Atlantic produce the prevailing south-westerly swell typical of the winter months, which beat on the exposed coastline. Temperatures are moderate and range from -5 ¬∞C minimum in winter and 35 ¬∞C maximum in summer. The annual average minimum and maximum temperatures are 11 ¬∞C and 24 ¬∞C respectively. =Seasonal variations in sea conditions= There are often summer upwelling events, during which water temperatures may drop to 11 ¬∞C. Although this area is included in the warm temperate Agulhas bioregion, it is part of the transition between warm and cool temperate regions. Ecology Marine ecoregions of the South African Exclusive Economic Zone: Helderberg Marine Proteted Area i in the Agulhas ecoregion. This is a productive biologically-diverse area, and has the only population of the giant isopod Tylos granulatus south of Ysterfontein. The MPA is in the warm temperate Agulhas ecoregion to the east of Cape Point which extends eastwards to the Mbashe River. There are a large proportion of species endemic to South Africa along this coastline. Four major habitats exist in the sea in this region, distinguished by the nature of the substrate. The substrate, or base material, is important in that it provides a base to which an organism can anchor itself, which is vitally important for those organisms which need to stay in one particular kind of place. Rocky shores and reefs provide a firm fixed substrate for the attachment of plants and animals. Some of these may have Kelp forests, which reduce the effect of waves and provide food and shelter for an extended range of organisms. Sandy beaches and bottoms are a relatively unstable substrate and cannot anchor kelp or many of the other benthic organisms. Finally there is open water, above the substrate and clear of the kelp forest, where the organisms must drift or swim. Mixed habitats are also frequently found, which are a combination of those mentioned above. There are two small degraded estuarine habitats at the borders of the MPA. Rocky shores and reefs There are rocky reefs and mixed rocky and sandy bottoms. For many marine organisms the substrate is another type of marine organism, and it is common for several layers to co-exist. Examples of this are red bait pods, which are usually encrusted with sponges, ascidians, bryozoans, anemones, and gastropods, and abalone, which are usually covered by similar seaweeds to those found on the surrounding rocks, usually with a variety of other organisms living on the seaweeds. The type of rock of the reef is of some importance, as it influences the range of possibilities for the local topography, which in turn influences the range of habitats provided, and therefore the diversity of inhabitants. Sandstone and other sedimentary rocks erode and weather very differently, and depending on the direction of dip and strike, and steepness of the dip, may produce reefs which are relatively flat to very high profile and full of small crevices. These features may be at varying angles to the shoreline and wave fronts. There are fewer large holes, tunnels and crevices in sandstone reefs, but often many deep but low near-horizontal crevices. Sandy beaches and bottoms (including shelly, pebble and gravel bottoms) Sandy bottoms at first glance appear to be fairly barren areas, as they lack the stability to support many of the spectacular reef based species, and the variety of large organisms is relatively low. The sand is continually being moved around by wave action, to a greater or lesser degree depending on weather conditions and exposure of the area. This means that sessile organisms must be specifically adapted to areas of relatively loose substrate to thrive in them, and the variety of species found on a sandy or gravel bottom will depend on all these factors. Sandy bottoms have one important compensation for their instability, animals can burrow into the sand and move up and down within its layers, which can provide feeding opportunities and protection from predation. Other species can dig themselves holes in which to shelter, or may feed by filtering water drawn through the tunnel, or by extending body parts adapted to this function into the water above the sand. Kelp forests The open sea =Marine species diversity= Animals The most abundant fauna found on sandy beaches are meiofauna. Their small size lets them live between the sand grains. They include nematodes, copepods and ostracods, which help break down organic matter, which then decomposes. Meiofauna are sensitive to pollution and other disturbances, and can be used to monitor pollution on sandy beaches. The intertidal zone supports sandhoppers, mole and ghost crabs, plough snails, sand mussels and the African oystercatchers, Kelp gulls, Sanderlings and White-fronted plovers that feed on them. Offshore, zooplankton and a variety of fish can be found. =Key marine fauna for protection= Linefish: * Argyrosomus inodorus (silver kob) * Argyrozona argyrozona (carpenter) * Atractoscion aequidens (geelbek) * Chrysoblephus gibbiceps (red stumpnose) * Chrysoblephus laticeps (roman) * Dichistius capensis (galjoen) * Diplodus sargus (blacktail) * Lithognathus lithognathus (white steenbras) * Pachymetopon blochii (hottentot) * Petrus rupestris (red steenbras) * Polysteganus undulosus (seventy four) * Scomber japonicus (chub mackerel) * Seriola lalandi (yellowtail) * Thyrsites atun (snoek) * Umbrina canariensis (belman/baardman) Elasmobranchs: * Mustelus mustelus (smoothhound shark) * Notorynchus cepedianus (spotted sevengill shark) * Triakis megalopterus (spotted gulley shark) Birds: * Haematopus moquini (African oystercatcher) * Phalacrocorax capensis (Cape cormorant) * Phalacrocorax neglectus (bank cormorant) Invertebrates: * Haliotis midae (perlemoen) * Jasus lalandii (West coast rock lobster) * Parechinus angulosus (Cape sea urchin) Seaweeds Endemism The MPA is in the warm temperate Agulhas ecoregion to the east of Cape Point which extends eastwards to the Mbashe River. There are a large proportion of species endemic to South Africa along this coastline. Alien invasive species Threats Urban development in the fore-dune zone tends to be inundated by windblown sand. Artificial dune stabilisation and removal of fore-dunes for development can deplete the sand available for beach functioning. Pollution in by plastic and oil spills is a permanent threat if left unchecked. No specific research has been done on the threats to invertebrates in the MPA.

Debris is scattered over a square mile of the mountainside above the timberline, however, and some of it is buried under 9 feet of rock which has fallen from the cliffs rising approximately 1,000 feet above the site. Early rumors that the ill-fated C-49, which crashed Feb. 5, 1943, ... carried nearly half a million dollars in gold and currency, previously were denied by the air force in Washington. However, the searchers found moldy war department documents in United States mail sacks which also contained envelopes addressed to the United States treasury and hundreds of letters from servicemen in Alaska and the Aleutians to their relatives and friends at home. A rubber oxygen mask that had survived the elements still was on the pilot's skull. The investigators said that some scraps of metal from the plane were fused, indicating part of the wreckage had burned.

Despite a large-scale search by army aircraft along the route from Greenville to Meridian, the wreckage was finally found 21 March 1943 by a 15-year-old mountain boy, Seab Crane, who was riding a horse along a remote path known as the Moody trail. The bomber had clipped off treetops at the peak of a mountain, just off Turnpike road about 2 1/2 miles from the Walhalla State Fish Hatchery, and plunged into a ravine. The altitude where the plane first struck is more than 2,000 feet. Heavy recent rains kept the crash fire isolated to the actual wreckage.

The boy and his mount galloped 2 1/2 miles to the nearest cabin, the club house, where he recruited the caretaker Ben Rogers, and they returned to the site where the mystery object turned out to be one of the Wright R-2600-13 radial engines that had been thrown a hundred yards beyond the main wreckage, the bulk of which had ploughed into an embankment in a ravine after it had sheared through tree tops for a quarter mile. \\"Three of the airmen were thrown from the plane and they lay as they fell ‚Äì twisted and gesticulating.

They were A9-27 and A9-268 of Base Torpedo Unit, HMAS Albatros, Nowra, Australia, carrying out a series of dummy runs and torpedo attacks on HMAS Burra Bra for a group of accredited War Correspondents on board the ship when the centre aircraft of the vic, A9-27, coded 'B', pulled up, causing the port wing of the right-hand bomber, A9-268, coded 'I', to clip off its tail with both aircraft crashing. The flight was attempting a \\"Prince of Wales\\" break-up formation. KWF aboard A9-27 were F/O Raymond Sydney Green (408110), 23, pilot; Sgt. Albert John Bailey (409976), 22; F/O Maurice Francis Hoban (409118), 30; and P/O Eric William Sweetnam (408077), 20. Fatalities aboard A9-268 were Flt. Lt. David George Dey (280627), 27, pilot; F/O Rex Lindsay Solomon (408149), 21; F/O Jack Norman (407561); and Sgt. Hugh Sydney George Richardson (410093), 23. The accident was filmed by Fox Movietone News cameraman Eric Bieve, and footage is available on the web. \\"Green, Hoban and Bailey were buried in the Air Force section of the War Cemetery at Nowra on 15 Apr 43 at 1500 hours. The funeral was attended by Wing Commander Dibbs, Base Torpedo Unit (BTU) staff officers, Instructional crews and personnel of No 7 Beaufort course. On 17 April 1943, the body of Sweetnam was recovered and buried at 1600 hours with Air Force honours at Nowra. Late on the same day a diving party reported that they had not located the bodies of Dey, Norman, Solomon and Richardson. A Funeral held on 18 April 1943 on board the \\"Burra-Bra\\" at 1030 hours attended by the same people as listed for the 15 April Funeral.\\" ;18 April: Messerschmitt Me 262 V2, WrkNr. 262 000 002, PC+UB, is completely destroyed on a test flight out of Lechfeld, its 48th flight, this date, killing pilot Ofw. Wilhelm Ostertag, after being airborne only seven minutes. \\"It was thought that the cause was in part due to a disturbance in the tail plane adjustment, but a later investigation found that a section of a rear part of one of the engines had detached and blocked the engine, forcing the aircraft into an uncontrollable downward spiral.\\" Airframe flight time was 18 hours 17 minutes.O'Connell, Dan, \\"Messerschmitt Me 262 - The Production Log 1941-1945\\", Classic Publication, an imprint of Ian Allan Publishing Ltd., Hersham, Surrey, UK, 2005, , pages 15-16. ;29 April :Republic P-43 Lancer, 41-6718, converted to P-43D.

Lockheed Hudson IIIA, FH168, a lend-lease A-29-LO, 41-36969, c/n 414-6458, operated by No. 38 Wing RAF, based at RAF Netheravon, crashed and burned south of St. Eval. The aircraft was unable to maintain height due to one engine failing, and the load it was carrying. Air Commodore Sir Nigel Norman, en route to the Middle East for an Airborne Forces Planning Conference, died in this accident. ;19 May :Northrop N-9M-1, one-third scale flying testbed for the Northrop XB-35 flying wing design, crashes approximately 12 mi (19 km) W of Muroc Army Air Base, California, killing pilot Max Constant. First flown 27 December 1942, airframe had only logged 22.5 hours, and little data was accumulated before the loss. Post-crash investigation suggested that: \\"...while Constant was conducting stalls and aft centre of gravity stability tests, aerodynamic forces developed full aft, which were too strong for Constant to overcome, trapping him in the cockpit. To prevent this happening on future flights, a one-shot hydraulic boost device was installed to push the controls forward in an emergency.\\"Allen, Francis, \\"Before The B-2: Northrop's Flying Wings, The XB-35 And XB-49\\", Air Enthusiast, Stamford, Lincs, UK, Number 106, July‚ÄìAugust 2003, p. 4. ;20 May: Consolidated B-24E-5-FO Liberator, 42-7053, c/n 77, of the 1014th Pilot Transition Training Squadron, Tarrant Army Airfield, Texas, departing there at 0650 hrs.

Approaching the airport from the southwest in light rain, light fog and light smoke, with a 500 foot ceiling and ~.75 miles visibility, the bomber circled the field to the north and east before striking the ~500 foot tall tank at the ~125 foot level whilst on a southern heading, initially with the port wingtip, according to witness Lawrence Kinsella, an employee of People's Gas Light and Coke Company. Much of forward fuselage fell inside the tank structure which exploded, throwing steel plate over 100 yards with heat felt over a mile away. Nine employees were on the grounds but none were injured.

Fire in the port wing caused structural failure, the wing coming down a half mile from the main wreckage. \\"At the request of the investigating officer the port engine was excavated from the crash site and sent to Rolls Royce who examined it. They said that there been a failure of one of the pistons with hot gases passing beyond the piston rings of that piston which caused the gudgeon pin to fail and the connecting rod to break away which then broke through the crank case. This allowed a fuel/air mixture as well as engine oil to escape under pressure into the nacelle where it ignited and in less than one minute caused the failure of the forward wing spar and lower skin of the port wing.\\" Five crew killed.

The flight departed at 2307 hrs., coming down in the sea after only 16 seconds of flight. Only the pilot, Eduard Prchal (1911‚Äì1984), survives. \\"This crash is shrouded in mystery and intrigue. Throughout World War II Sikorski tried to organize the Polish Army and constantly negotiated with Churchill and Roosevelt to circumvent any appeasement deals between the Allies, Russia, and Germany which would come at Poland's expense. By this time, the Free Poles had found out about the Katyn Massacre, and thus terminated relations with the Soviet Union on 26 April 1943. As Sikorski was the most prestigious leader of the Polish exiles, his death was a severe setback to the Polish cause, and was certainly highly convenient for Stalin. It was in some ways also convenient for the western Allies, who were finding the Polish issue a stumbling-block in their efforts to preserve good relations with Stalin. This has given rise to persistent suggestions that Sikorski's death was not accidental. This has never been proved.\\" ;4 July :The prototype Platt-LePage XR-1 helicopter, 41-001, tested at Wright Field, Ohio, by the Rotary Branch of the Air Technical Service Command from May 1943, is damaged this date by the failure of a rotor blade spinner.

Seven of the occupants on board the aircraft were killed, and two survived with serious injuries. On the night of 21 November 1943, three Douglas C-47A aircraft took off from Lawson Field in Fort Benning, Georgia. They were heading to Naval Air Station Willow Grove in Horsham Township, Pennsylvania, to pick up CG-4A gliders and tow them to Maxton AAF. At the time, Maxton was the site of the largest CG-4A glider pilot training base in the world. In the airspace around Washington, DC the three aircraft entered a large storm front and lost visual contact with one another. Captain Bernard Cederholm, the pilot of 42-32929, decided to divert to the now-abandoned Barnsville Auxiliary Airfield near Allentown, Pennsylvania. Due to weather circumstances and low visibility, Cederholm failed to locate the airfield. He was following a holding circuit when the aircraft hit trees on Locust Mountain, located approximately an eighth of a mile west of Tamaqua, Pennsylvania at 2110 EST, and broke up. A fire broke out on impact, and seven of the nine aboard were killed. The two survivors left were Corporal Joseph W. Enloe and Private Charles H. Davis, who were found wandering around the site of the crash a half hour afterwards. The force of the crash was so powerful that it is reported that the tail was thrown approximately 1,500 feet away from the impact site. The aircraft, a Douglas C-47A with the tail number 42-32929 was first flown in 1943. In total, seven of the nine occupants onboard 42-32929 were killed in the resulting crash: The cause of the crash was never fully determined, although it is believed to be a case of CFIT (controlled flight into terrain). ;Night of 23‚Äì24 November :The Deutsche Luftfahrt Sammlung (Berlin Air Museum), at Lehrter Bahnhof, is destroyed in an RAF bombing raid by 383 aircraft:365 Avro Lancaster, 10 Handley Page Halifax, and 8 de Havilland Mosquito bombers.

Joschi P√∂hs is killed when, upon takeoff in a Messerschmitt Me 163A of training unit EK 16 from Bad Zwischenahn, near Oldenburg, he releases the takeoff dolly too soon. The bouncing dolly strikes the airframe, apparently damaging a T-Stoff line, and the engine loses power. The pilot banks the Komet round for an attempted landing but just prior to lining up for touchdown a wingtip grazes a flak tower, all control is lost, and the rocket fighter crashes just outside the airfield perimeter. It was felt that if P≈çhs had begun his turn back to the airfield immediately after the power loss he would have made a safe return; however, he lowered the landing skid and dropped flaps before beginning the turn and ate up precious altitude.Ethell, Jeffrey L., \\"Rocket Fighter:Part I\\", Wings, Granada Hills, California, April 1977, Volume 7, Number 2, p. 66. ;Post-December :Sole prototype of the Kawasaki Ki-64 (Allied code name: Rob), an experimental heavy, single-seat fighter with two Ha-40 engines in tandem; one in the aircraft nose, the other behind the cockpit, both being connected by a drive shaft, driving two 3-bladed, contra-rotating propellors, first flown in December 1943.

In total twenty-three airmen were on board, including twenty members of the Glider Pilot Regiment. Only six airmen survived the incident; sixteen died in the crash, another died within hours from his injuries. In spite of serious wounds, two of the survivors managed to reach the village of Mijan√®s to get help for the other survivors. :The bodies of eleven men were recovered from the crash site between 10 and 19 December, and buried in Mijan√®s. The search was suspended due to adverse weather conditions, but in the spring of 1945 a further six bodies were brought down from the crash site after the snow had melted. All of the airmen who died in the crash were later reburied in the Mazargues War Cemetery, Marseilles.

Nonetheless, flight testing is not delayed for a thorough inspection, and on another flight in front of German high brass by Peter on 10 December, V1 starboard wing comes apart in high-speed, low-level pass, killing pilot.Bowers, Peter M., \\"Ernst Heinkel-Aviation Pioneer:Fighters of the Hitler Years 1933‚Äì1945, Pt II\\", Airpower, Granada Hills, California, September 1984, Volume 14, Number 5, p. 55.

Glenn Miller, pilot John Morgan and Lt. Col. Norman Baessell on board after departing RAF Twinwood Farm, Clapham, Bedfordshire, England. Missing Air Crew Report (MACR) 10770. It is believed that the plane was lost by straying into a forbidden zone in mid-channel which was designated for the jettisoning of surplus ordnance. On that day, a squadron of RAF Lancasters had aborted a mission and were salvoing their bombloads in this zone. One crewman, a navigator, claims to have looked down and seen a Norseman flying low over the water. Before he could draw any attention to this, the Norseman was apparently overwhelmed by bomb splashes and disappeared. Other conspiracy theories about the disappearance have also been advanced. ;15 December :Douglas A-26 Invader 43-22424 disappeared without a trace during a routine transfer flight. The plane was slated to be assigned to the 47th Bomb Group and was en route to Grosseto, Italy. US planes set to Italy left from Florida to Belem, Brazil, then from Belem to Natal, Brazil. After Natal, the planes would fly across the Atlantic to North Africa, and then on to Italy. This plane departed Belem on 15 December at 15:34 Greenwich mean time and was never heard from again. According to the Missing Air Crew Report (MACR), the plane did not reach the first check-in post at Sao Luis, Brazil, which gives rise to the idea that whatever happened to this plane occurred within the first hour of flight. The MACR file was generated by a letter to the Commanding Officer of the 6th Ferry Group dated 7 March 1945 inquiring about the status of the plane and the three crewmembers aboard, in particular, Sgt. Norman Robert \\"Bob\\" Smith, who was the engineer-gunner. Also aboard were pilot 1st Lt. Charles A. Grimes, and navigator 1st Lt. Laverne Gaylord Dingwell. The official response detailed in MACR 14085 states the Accident Review Board at Belem Air Station had no idea what happened to the plane and believe that it may have crashed in the \\"impenetrable jungle\\" near the base. To this date, no wreckage or bodies have ever been recovered. The Invader Historical Foundation hypothesizes that the two most likely causes for the disappearance are an engine failure or a mid- air explosion caused by the long-range fuel tank aboard the plane. ;17-18 December: While U.S. Navy Task Force 38 attempts to refuel in the eastern half of the Philippine Sea between operations against Japanese airfields on Luzon, Third Fleet encounters a newly-formed, deceptively small, but extremely violent typhoon, of which it has virtually no warning. TF 38 is operating with seven Essex-class carriers and six light carriers, while the refueling group has five escort carriers with replacement planes. By 1500 on 17 December it becomes too rough for the escort carriers to recover CAP and in two fighters, waved off from their respective decks, the pilots are directed to bail out with rescue by a destroyer. In the storm the fleet carriers lose no planes, although seas are so heavy that Hancock's flight deck, 57 feet above waterline, scoops up green water. On the light carriers, plane lashings part on hangar decks and padeyes are pulled out of flight decks. ::\\"Planes went adrift, collided and burst into flames. Monterey caught fire at 0911 (18 December) and lost steerageway a few minutes later. The fire, miraculously, was brought under control at 0945, and the C.O., Captain Stuart H. Ingersoll, wisely decided to let his ship lie dead in the water until temporary repairs could be effected. She lost 18 aircraft burned in the hangar deck or blown overboard and 16 seriously damaged, together with three 20-mm guns, and suffered extensive rupturing of her ventilation system. Cowpens lost 7 planes overboard and caught fire from one that broke loose at 1051, but the fire was brought under control promptly; Langley rolled through 70 degrees; San Jacinto reported a fighter plane adrift on the hangar deck which wrecked seven other aircraft. She also suffered damage from salt water that entered through punctures in the ventilating ducts.\\" USS Langley (CVL-27) rolling heavily during Typhoon Cobra, 18 December 1944. : ::\\"Captain [Jasper T.] Acuff's replenishment escort carriers did pretty well. Flames broke out on the flight deck of Cape Esperance at 1228 but were overcome; Kwajalein made a maximum roll of 39 degrees to port when hove-to with wind abeam. Her port catwalks scooped up green water, but she lost only three planes which were jettisoned from the flight deck; it took one hour to get them over the side. Three other escort carriers lost in all 86 aircraft but came through without much material damage.\\"Morison, Samuel Eliot, \\"History of United States Naval Operations in World War II - Volume XIII: The Liberation of the Philippines - Luzon, Mindanao, the Visayas 1944-1945\\", Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1959, 1989, Library of Congress card number 47-1571, pages 70-71. :Total aircraft losses in the Fleet, including those blown overboard or jettisoned from the battleships and cruisers, amounted to 146.

It holds the largest collection of the Aslamazyan sisters' paintings, prints, drawings, and ceramic works of any museum in the world. It is the only museum named after female artists and devoted to female artists in Armenia.  History and location  The 19th century style balcony of the Gallery. The Gallery was established in 1987 by the sisters themselves, and by the time of their deaths, they had donated about 620 of their original paintings, ceramics and graphic works, which are now proudly displayed there. The Gallery is located off the central square of Gyumri. The building was constructed as a private residence in 1880 by the Qeshishovs family, who were known to be wealthy merchants. After the ruinous earthquake of 1988 the building of the gallery was given to the homeless people and was reopened in 2004. This building has been protected by the Government since 1980 as a historical and cultural heritage site. The Gallery has two floors: the first floor displays the works of Eranuhi, whereas the second floor displays works by Mariam. The Gallery has an inner courtyard and a wooden balcony and its style is typical of the 19th century urban architecture in Alexandrapol, which is a fusion of European and traditional Armenian architectural elements of that time.  Collections  Exhibition of Mariam and Eranuhi Aslamazyan Sisters' works at the Gallery. Mariam and Eranuhi Aslamazyan were born in Bash-Shirak (present-day Yerazgavors village/Shirak marz) of Kars province in 1907 and 1910 respectively. They received their first painting education at the Alexandrapol Painting School ‚Äì the first painting school in Transcaucasia, founded in 1905 ‚Äì which played a very important role in securing painters' profession. Later, the sisters continued their painting education at the Yerevan Fine Arts College, Moscow‚Äôs and Leningrad‚Äôs High Schools of Art (nowadays Saint Petersburg Academy of Fine Arts). = Mariam Aslamazyan = Mariam Aslamazyan Portrait. Mariam Aslamazyan, as a female artist, has her own role and place in Armenian art. She dedicated her life to art and used her creativity to develop Armenian and international art. Mariam, through her cultural activities, succeeded in successfully overcoming one of the greatest challenges of her time: promoting the role of female artists in Soviet- Armenian society. In Mariam's art, we can see the artist developed a style that captured the spirit and essence of objects; she found beauty even in everyday household items. In her art, she tried to reconsider the Soviet and post-war years from her own point of view, expressing her attitude towards the consequences of those years. She created a flat decorative style in her portraits, still lives and nature scenes. Mariam‚Äôs own life is presented in her work, which bears witness to her inner thoughts and feelings. The works of Mariam Aslamazyan are conserved in numerous museums: Sofia, Berlin, Leningrad, Venice, Tokyo, Delhi, etc. The works devoted to India have been entitled to the laureate after G.Neru prize in 1970-1971, the prize of Hamal Abdenaser in 1976. Mariam Aslamazyan died in 2006. Her body has been moved and buried in Yerevan. = Eranuhi Aslamazyan = The art of Eranuhi Aslamazyan, a talented artist and visionary creator who has left an impressive imprint on Armenian painting of the 20th century, is full of high taste: restrained, delicate color passages and rich aesthetic and ideological layers. Eranuhi Aslamazyan paid great attention to the human spirit and human values, and she believed in the importance of human creativity. She worked mainly in a realistic style in her portraits, paintings, and still-life genre scenes. Even though she repeated subjects, we see new creative issues continued to emerge in her art, the goal of which was not to provide conclusions for viewers, but rather to let them think. The works of E.Aslamazyan are conserved in numerous museums: London, Sofia, Berlin, Leningrad, Venice, Tokyo, Delhi, etc. Eranuhi Aslamazyan died in 1988 and was buried in Moscow. leftalt=center  Notes and References   External links  * Official website of the Gallery of Mariam and Eranuhi Aslamazyan Sisters Category:Museums established in 1987 Category:Buildings and structures in Gyumri Category:Museums in Armenia Category:Armenian building and structure stubs Category:European museum stubs ","title":"Gallery of Mariam and Eranuhi Aslamazyan Sisters"},{"id":"59727854","title":"Tyler Smith (footballer)"},{"id":"59727857","text":"Space Wing or variation, may refer to: Military * a military unit involved in outer space, which is a type of Wing (military aviation unit) =United States military= Several units of the United States Air Force involved in outer space duties are designated as Space Wings: * 91st Space Wing (1997-2008) an ICBM unit * 50th Space Wing (activated 1992) a unit of the USAF Space Command * 45th Space Wing (activated 1951) a unit involved in U.S. DOD space launches from Cape Canaveral AFS * 30th Space Wing (activated 1964) a unit involved in U.S. DOD space launches from Vandenberg AFB * 21st Space Wing (re-activated 1992) a unit of the USAF Space Command * 3d Space Wing (1986-1992) a unit of the USAF Space Command * 2d Space Wing (1985-1992) a unit of the USAF Space Command * 1st Space Wing (1982-1992) a unit of the USAF Space Command * 310th Space Wing (re-activated 1997) a unit of the USAF Reserve for Space Command * 341st Space Wing (1997-2008) * 460th Space Wing (re-activated 2001) a unit of the USAF Space Command Other uses * Nissan Diesel Space Wing, a motorcoach * Astronaut wings, colloquially See also Space (disambiguation) * Space Development and Test Wing (activated 2006) a unit of the USAF Space Command * Starwing (disambiguation) * Wing (disambiguation) ","title":"Space Wing"},{"id":"59727861","text":"A Man's Mate is a 1924 American drama film directed by Edmund Mortimer and written by Charles Kenyon.

In the story, a being on a planet colonized by people from Earth is reformed as a female human, and has a relationship with a colonist which is more intense that expected. Background Sonya Dorman was a breeder of akitas,\\"Sonya Dorman\\". Brian Ash, Who's Who in Science Fiction. Elm Tree Books, 1976. which may relate to the element in the story about dog breeding. Story summary The story is written in the present tense. The narrator is one of the indigenous people of a planet recently colonized by humans from Earth; they have one sex, one brain lobe, and they can change their form. The Warden and the narrator's uncle (\\"by the Warden's fourth conjunction\\"), believing they should get on with the colonists, and that the narrator should bring back credits and sulfas, advise him/her to change form. After \\"four days in the tank absorbing the female Terran pattern\\", and with a second brain lobe, he/she becomes Martha Dow, a botanist, and assistant to Dr. Arnold Proctor, the colony's head biologist. He is studying kootas, dogs of this planet bred for racing. Some have a genetic defect which makes them become lame. The narrator's koota is X-rayed by Proctor, and he finds evidence of the defect. Proctor, seeming to take advantage of Martha's anxiety about the dog, starts to seduce her, and they begin a relationship. He assumes the narrator is a Terran; she realizes that the Warden registered her with the colony as such. The Warden is angry about the narrator's liaison with only one man. \\"You were supposed to start with the Doctor, and go on from there.\\" The Warden and the narrator's uncle are addicted to sulfadiazole and expected her to bring back credits additional to her pay. She finds that friends who have borrowed female patterns have not received a second brain lobe; she was given it, says the Warden, to make her more efficient. The narrator enjoys being Martha. The Doctor dies suddenly one day, while the narrator is with him. She brings the body home and asks the Warden to put him in one of the cell banks; but he says a Terran cannot be recreated, so she returns him to his quarters, taking home a memento, Proctor's wooden carving of a murger bird. The Warden thinks it might be too late to return the narrator to his/her own pattern, but he/she is able to revert.

She was found murdered at Melbourne's Princes Park on 13 June 2018; her death was the subject of much media attention. Education and career Dixon studied drama at Deakin University. During her time there, she appeared in the role of Justine in Burwood Student Theatre Company's production of Cosi in 2014. She belonged to and often performed with the Moreland Theatre Company; an amateur theatre company in the northern suburbs of Melbourne where she lived; and performed in RMIT's yearly \\"Snatches\\" run of short plays.

She had been walking home from a performance at Highlander Bar the night before when she was attacked and murdered by 19-year- old Broadmeadows man, Jaymes Todd, who handed himself into police after CCTV footage of him was released. Todd pleaded guilty to her rape and murder on 8 November 2018. On 2 September 2019, Todd was sentenced to life in prison. Todd will serve a minimum of 35 years in prison before being eligible to apply for parole. Todd appealed his sentence on the grounds that it was excessive, considering his guilty plea and diagnosis of Asperger syndrome; the appeal was denied. Dixon's death attracted mass media coverage and she became the subject of many tributes on social media, notably from fellow comedians Julia Morris, Paula Ferrari, Alex Lee and Jane Kennedy among many others. A vigil was held at the soccer pitch at Princes Park where her body was found on 18 June; it was attended by about ten thousand people, including Victorian state Premier Daniel Andrews.

Early life  MacLean, who was born in Glasgow, Scotland, grew up under poor conditions with a single mother who often left her daughter with relatives.  Career  In the early 1960s, MacLean moved to the United States where she lived an immersive life with the boxer Sugar Ray Robinson. After one year, she returned to the UK and London, working as call girl after getting involved in a prostitution-ring scandal, and then joining the Church of Scientology. Among Scientologists, she met Robert Moor, later renamed by MacLean as Robert de Grimston. They married in 1964, created their version of Scientology auditing called Compulsions Analysis. The next year they introduced the cult, The Process Church of The Final Judgment, to a small group of friends and like-minded people. De Grimston named himself \\"The Teacher\\" and MacLean \\"The Oracle\\" in the cult that slowly grew in the numbers. MacLean took care of the ideology as well as the strategy, while de Grimston's face became the trademark of the business activity. In 1974, MacLean overpowered her husband by excluding him from his own church. Robert de Grimston disappeared into the United States while Mary Ann MacLean tried to further develop a cult organisation, relocating the group to Arizona and renaming it The Foundation - Church of the Millennium. The church group relocated in 1984, with animals they had at their Arizona ranch, to property it purchased in Kanab, Utah. Then, in 1991, The Process Church of The Final Judgment was dissolved and the church renamed Best Friends Animal Society, on the group's Kanab, Utah, property. MacLean continued to engage, with a low profile, in spiritual and political life in Utah. In 2005, MacLean died, and the management of her charity was left to her second husband, Gabriel De Peyer, a former Foundation Faith of God Church member and co- founder of Best Friends Animal Society.

After obtaining his diploma, he became technical training manager for the Catalan Handball Federation until 2004. At the same time, at FC Barcelona, Gerona took care of the Blaugrana youth teams from 1999 to 2004 and then, for three years, was Xesco Espar's assistant to the first team (2004-2008). In this role, Toni Gerona won the Champions League 2005 as well as the La Liga 2006. At the same time as the position of technical director of training (2008-2015), Gerona took over the management of the Barcelona reserve team (2009-2015). Gerona then coached the Qatari club of El Jaish from 2015 to 2017.

Gonz√°lez-Barros studied in school in Madrid and in her childhood received a papal blessing from Pope John Paul II during her trip to Rome. But in late 1984 she began feeling pains in her arm and back that led to a diagnosis two months later as being a malignant tumor in the vertebral column transforming into spinal cancer. Her siblings and friends remembered her for her piousness and her dedication to practicing holiness in all aspects of life. In 2008 a controversial film was released depicting her life and death; the director maintains that it was a fictional tale that did not depict Gonz√°lez-Barros even though it was dedicated to her and drew on some aspects of her life. Her siblings and Opus Dei railed against the film for its perceived slander and inaccuracies that were \\"unjust\\". Her beatification process launched in 1991 and she became titled as a Servant of God. Pope Francis later declared her to be Venerable in mid-2017 after confirming that the child had lived a life of heroic virtue to a favorable degree. Life Alexia Gonz√°lez-Barros Gonz√°lez was born in Madrid on 7 March 1971 as the last of seven children born to the Opus Dei supernumeraries Francisco (d. 30.12.2001) and Moncha (d. 3.2.2006); two of those children died as infants. Francisco and Alfredo were two of her older brothers. On 15 October 1975 she began her schooling in Madrid while her mother would instruct her in catechism. Gonz√°lez-Barros made her First Communion in Rome in the Santa Maria della Pace church (where the Opus Dei founder Josemar√≠a Escriv√° is buried) on 8 May 1979 and on the following morning attended a papal general audience in Saint Peter's Square. Pope John Paul II was passing to extend his greetings to the pilgrims and she ran up to him from the crowd to hug him; the pope blessed her and kissed her forehead. In December 1984 she felt a dull pain in her right shoulder that doctors defined as being muscular contractions. But two months later she noticed her left arm felt weak and she was suffering from back pains which prompted a return to doctors for assessment. The doctors diagnosed Gonz√°lez-Barros on 4 February 1985 as having a malignant spinal tumor in the vertebral column which led to four operations to manage her condition that evolved into spinal cancer. The doctors discovered the lesion of the spinal column was due to Ewing's sarcoma with widespread metastases. Her first operation was held on 9 February and the second on 28 March both in Madrid. But she was taken to a hospital in Pamplona where she was operated on 27 June and 8 September (two of these operations saw doctors operate to remove bone from her hip for grafts). Gonz√°lez-Barros made her last confession on 30 November at which point she received her Confirmation and the Anointing of the Sick. Her disease progressed at a rapid pace to the point where she could not move out of confinement in bed. Her battle against spinal cancer lasted around ten months and led to her death in the morning on 5 December 1985 in the Universidad de Navarra clinic in Pamplona; her remains were transported to Madrid on 6 December for burial. Her friend and classmate Bego√±a Hernandez said that at her death she had the firm conviction that her friend had been a saint. Nine biographies about her have been published since her death. Film controversies In 2008 the film Camino was presented in the San Sebasti√°n Film Festival (where it received a tepid reception) before it was released in theatres in mid-October. Both the Gonz√°lez-Barros siblings and Opus Dei officials expressed their outrage over the film, seeing that the director Javier Fesser showed Opus Dei lauding Alexia's death. The film put her in the middle of the group grooming her for a death that turned her into both a potential saint and propaganda tool. Her siblings were outraged that the director dedicated the film to her (without having ever consulted them in the film's production) as having inspired the protagonist called Camino. Fesser asserted that his film did not intend to have the protagonist be Alexia and referred to his film as being \\"pure fiction\\" rather than based on an actual tale. But Alexia's brother Alfredo said in a letter that Fesser's film \\"is both unjust and terrible\\" and that it reopened old wounds for him and his siblings. The film also depicted her beatification cause as having been initiated for fraudulent reasons given Camino's death, which prompted outrage from Opus Dei who said Alexia's beatification cause was the result of her holiness. Beatification process The beatification process took its first step towards launch on 21 November 1991 after Dr. Benito Badrinas Amat was appointed as the cause's postulator (official in charge of the cause). The official request to launch the beatification process was made on 16 July 1992 to the Cardinal Archbishop of Madrid Angel Suqu√≠a Goicoechea who then lodged the official request to officials in Rome. The next step was to transfer the forum for the cause from the Pamplona-Tudela archdiocese to the Madrid archdiocese on 11 January 1991. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 8 February 1993 issued the official edict nihil obstat (no objections to the cause) which launched the cause and titled Gonz√°lez-Barros as a Servant of God. Bishop Luis Gut√≠errez Mart√≠n inaugurated the diocesan process on 14 April 1993 while the cardinal archbishop closed the process later on 1 June 1994. The cause accumulated 4600 pages in eleven volumes of documentation which was sent to the C.C.S. officials in Rome; the C.C.S. validated the diocesan process on 11 November 1994 as having complied with the rules regarding the conduct of causes. Monsignor Flavio Capucci was appointed as the second postulator on 27 June 1994 to oversee the Roman Phase of the process (the investigation held in Rome). The postulation compiled and submitted the official Positio dossier to the C.C.S. on 8 May 2000 for additional assessment. Nine theologians met (in a meeting that Monsignor Carmelo Pellegrini chaired) and approved the cause after having assessed the dossier on 10 December 2017 as did the C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members later on 3 July 2018. Pope Francis titled Gonz√°lez-Barros as Venerable on 5 July 2018 after acknowledging that the child had demonstrated heroic virtue during her lifetime to an adequate degree.

For the first time a modern research icebreaker will operate in the direct vicinity of the North Pole year round, including the nearly half year long polar night during winter. In terms of the logistical challenges involved, the total number of participants, the number of participating countries, and the available budget, MOSAiC represents the largest Arctic expedition in history. During its one-year-long journey, the central expedition ship, the research icebreaker Polarstern from Germany's Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), will be supported and resupplied by the icebreakers and research vessels Akademik Fedorov and Kapitan Dranitsyn (Russia), Sonne and Maria S. Merian (Germany) and Xue Long II (China). In addition, extensive operations involving helicopters and other aircraft are planned. In total, during the various phases of the expedition, more than 600 people will be working in the Central Arctic. The international expedition, which will involve more than 80 institutions from 20 countries, will be conducted by the AWI and is led by the polar and climate researcher Markus Rex. MOSAiC's main goals are to investigate the complex and still only poorly understood climate processes at work in the Central Arctic, to improve the representation of these processes in global climate models, and to contribute to more reliable climate projections. The expedition will cost 140 Million Euros (approximately 154 Million USD); half of the budget is provided by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). U.S. participation is primarily supported by the National Science Foundation, which is contributing roughly $24 million to the project, making among the largest Arctic research initiatives the agency has ever mounted. The Department of Energy is also highly invested in the mission, funding nearly $10 million and providing the largest suite of atmospheric instruments. The MOSAiC expedition Polarstern icebreaker. In the half-year-long Arctic winter, the sea ice is too thick for research icebreakers to penetrate. Consequently, data from the Central Arctic is virtually non-existent, particularly during winter. For reaching the Central Arctic in winter, the MOSAiC expedition will follow in the footstep of Fridtjof Nansen's famous expedition with the wooden sailing ship Fram in the years 1893‚Äì1896, over 125 years ago. His daring voyage showed that it was possible to let a ship drift across the polar cap, from Siberia to the Atlantic, stuck in the thick sea ice and solely driven by the forces of the natural drift of the ice. Though Nansen has demonstrated the fundamental feasibility of such an endeavour, the scientific measurements possible in his days were still quite rudimentary. During MOSAiC, for the first time the Fram‚Äôs drift will be repeated with a research icebreaker, equipped with a veritable arsenal of cutting-edge instruments for exploring and recording the complex climate processes in the Central Arctic. Polar bears at the MOSAiC research camp The heart of MOSAiC will be Polarstern‚Äôs one-year-long drift through the Central Arctic. On 20 September 2019 the ship will depart from the Norwegian port of Troms√∏ together with the Akademik Fedorov, proceed east along the Siberian coast, and at roughly 125¬∞ East, turn north and begin breaking into the sea ice of the Central Arctic, which will still be feasible at that time of year. Once she reaches about 85¬∞ North, Polarstern will put her engines in neutral and allow herself to become trapped in the sea ice. An extensive research camp will then be set up all around the ship on the ice. At the same time, Akademik Fedorov will deploy a network of research stations on the ice, some as far as 50 km from Polarstern‚Äôs position. The network will consist of both autonomous and remote-controlled instruments, which will be checked at regular intervals using helicopter flights from the central Polarstern, which forms the Central Observatory. After delivering one last load of fuel, at the end of October Akademik Fedorov will return to Troms√∏. From this point on, the natural drift will carry Polarstern and its network of research stations across the North Pole region. After a year, the ship will reach the Fram Strait, free herself from the ice, and return to her homeport in Bremerhaven by mid-October. At the beginning of the expedition, and from the summer of 2020, ice conditions will allow the MOSAiC partner icebreakers to reach Polarstern for resupply and personnel exchanges; in the phase from mid-February to mid-June, the ice will be too thick. During the period March/April the German research aircraft Polar 5 and Polar 6, operating out of Svalbard and Greenland, will land and refuel on a runway created on the sea ice near Polarstern, complementing the expedition data with Arctic wide measurements. The sea-ice landing strip will also be used for delivering provisions and supplies, and for exchanging staff. Fuel depots set up on islands off the coast of Siberia specifically for the expedition will support potential emergency operations by long range helicopters, which will be able to reach Polarstern in the event of an emergency at least during the early and late phases of the expedition. Research focus areas The primary goal of MOSAiC is to understanding the coupled climate processes in the Central Arctic, so that they can be more accurately integrated into regional and global climate models. The findings will contribute to more reliable climate projections for the Arctic and globally, to improved weather forecasts and better Arctic sea ice forecasts. In addition, the outcomes of the MOSAiC mission will help to understand the regional and global effects of Arctic climate change and the loss of sea ice. They will improve the preparedness of communities in the Arctic and northern mid-latitudes, provide the scientific basis for the development of policies for a sustainable development of the Arctic and support fact based decision-making in the areas of mitigation of and adaptation to global climate change. = Atmosphere = The comprehensive and complex atmospheric measurements carried out during MOSAiC will provide a physical basis for understanding local and vertical interactions in the atmosphere and the interactions between the atmosphere, the sea ice and the ocean. The characterisation of processes in clouds, in the atmospheric boundary layer, surface layer and surface energy flux will lead to a better understanding of the lower troposphere, which interact with the surface in the Arctic. One of the greatest challenges will be taking carrying out these measurements consistently throughout the sea ice‚Äôs entire annual cycle, especially at the beginning of the freezing period, so as to monitor the transition from open water to a very thin ice layer. Readings taken at higher altitudes will provide insights into the characteristics of the middle and upper troposphere and the interaction with the stratosphere. To improve our understanding of aerosols and aerosol-cloud interactions over the Central Arctic, especially in winter, measurements will be taken on the composition of the particles, their physical properties, their direct and indirect radiation effects, and their interactions with cloud properties. Routine radiosonde observations in combination with tethered balloon measurements will provide high-resolution profiles of the atmospheric conditions in the column of air above the MOSAiC site. In addition, radar measurements will be used to determine the vertical profile of wind speed and direction as well as key cloud properties, including ice and liquid water content. Key thermodynamic parameters, as well as the kinematic structures of the atmosphere, will be investigated with the aid of microwave and infrared radiometers, Raman and Doppler lidar. = Sea-ice = The sea-ice observations will cover the broad range from the physical and mechanical characteristics of Arctic sea ice, to its morphology, optical properties and mass balance. The emphasis will be on characterising snow cover and ice cover, and on arriving at a better understanding of the processes that determine their properties. Snow trenches and ice cores will help the researchers gather this valuable data. Further aspects of the sea ice observation will include determining the mass budget by measuring the depth of snow cover and ice thickness, as well as measuring the diffusion of sunlight in the ice, the ice's spectral albedo, and its transmission. In addition, various types of ice will be monitored throughout the entire annual cycle in order to determine the spatial variability and development of ice cover in the Arctic over time. = Ocean = Ocean processes influence the energy balance in the Arctic, as well as the growth and melting of sea ice due to additional warmth. They also play an important role in the biological activity that binds and potentially exports CO2. Measurements from the water column will shed new light on key mechanisms occurring in the ocean, e.g.: (1) heat exchange between sea ice and ocean, (2) absorption of sunlight and processing of the resulting heat, (3) interaction with deep sea processes, and (4) primary biological productivity and export of organic matter from the euphotic zone. Given that understanding the evolution of sea ice is one of the primary goals of the MOSAiC expedition, ocean processes affecting the ice, like near-surface mixing, are at the heart of the oceanographic investigations. In addition, the dynamics and thermodynamics of the mixing layer will be explored in detail. For this purpose, continuous measurements will be taken of turbulent fluxes directly below the ocean-ice boundary, to help understand the speeds of the ice and ocean, vertical thermal and momentum flows, diffusion of mass and other key processes. Moreover, the deep ocean will be observed in the broader context by creating profiles of the flow speed, temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen in the top hundred metres of the Arctic Ocean on a regular basis, so as to better grasp its effects on the upper ocean-ice boundary layer. = Ecosystem and Biogeochemistry = The observations on biological and biogeochemical transformation and succession will mainly focus on analysing samples from all three major physical regimes, i.e., the ice, snow and water environments. Additionally flow measurements will be conducted at both the ice/water and ice/air boundary layers. These will be repeated throughout the entire Arctic year in order to quantify the biology and biogeochemistry of the sea- ice/atmosphere system at every time of year, especially in the under- researched Arctic winter. For example, the annual mass budget for organic and inorganic carbon will be monitored, and crystallographic readings will be taken on the ikaite in seafloor channels. The latter will offer insights into the biogeochemistry of the net air/ice flow of CO2 produced by sea ice, and into the potential for capturing organic carbon and the respiration of CO2. A second goal is to quantify the methane accumulation, the oxidation below the sea ice, and the air/ocean flows with regard to the potential for major oceanic methane flows into the atmosphere. A third key element: observing the cycles of biogenic gases like N2O, O2, DMS (dimethyl sulphide) and bromoform in the snow, sea ice and water, which will contribute to our grasp of the underlying biogeochemical paths. An additional important aspect is the creation of an annual mass balance and ice/water cycle for macro- and micronutrients; in this regard, vertical nutrient flows between the ocean, euphotic zone, mixed and deep layers of the ocean will be investigated, in part with the aid of molecular tools, to arrive at a better understanding of the recycling chains. = Model implementation = A closely interlinked modelling and observation concept was central to the definition and planning of the MOSAiC expedition. In order to understand and explain the changes at work in the Arctic climate system, new models will be developed, and previous models will be refined, on the basis of the observations and readings taken during the expedition. These observations will also play an important part in improving these models and developing new ones for weather and sea-ice forecasting, and for climate projections. In turn, the models will offer insights into phenomena that are not directly observable. The observations made throughout MOSAiC will provide new framework conditions for models at various scales; e.g. high-resolution models will be used for detailed studies, and these studies can provide the basis for improving regional and global climate models. In addition, regional Arctic models will be used to answer important questions concerning the Arctic‚Äôs role as a global energy sink; how global connection patterns will be shaped by the changing ice volume in the Arctic; and how these changes will affect the circulation and weather in the lower latitudes. The modelling and observations during MOSAiC will be conducted in close cooperation with the international modelling efforts of the World Weather Research Programme and World Climate Research Programme. MOSAiC School 2019 The first phase of the expedition will feature a six- week course for 20 postgraduate students aboard Akademik Fedorov. This is jointly delivered by MOSAiC Partners and the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists.

He is portrayed by Troy Baker through performance capture. In the first game, Joel serves as the main protagonist and is tasked with escorting the young Ellie across a post-apocalyptic United States in an attempt to create a potential cure for an infection to which Ellie is immune. He also appears briefly in the downloadable content campaign, The Last of Us: Left Behind. In The Last of Us Part II, Joel is killed by a woman named Abby, whose father he had killed, prompting Ellie to seek revenge on the latter and those that assisted her. Joel was created by Neil Druckmann, the creative director and writer of The Last of Us. The character's casting was extensive, as his relationship with Ellie was imperative to the game; it was the central focus of the first game's development, with all other elements developed around it. Baker inspired aspects of Joel's personality, making the character more emotional than initially pitched. Druckmann wanted players, especially parents, to relate to Joel through his bonding with Ellie. He considered the character morally complex. For Part II, Druckmann felt that Joel's character arc was complete after the original, and his death was a core part of the game's development. The character has been well-received by critics, with Joel's relationship with Ellie most frequently the subject of praise. The likability and complexity of the character has also been commended. Baker's performance in both games was highly praised and received numerous awards and nominations.  Character design  The development team of The Last of Us spent more time selecting the actor for Joel than Ellie, as the chemistry between the two characters was imperative to the game. After Troy Baker and Ellie actress Ashley Johnson played alongside each other, the team realized that the former perfectly fit the role of Joel, despite the actor's young age. Druckmann attributed Baker's voice and movement to the team's choice of casting him. Baker contributed greatly to the development of the character; for example, he convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness. When designing Joel's physical appearance, the team tried to make him look \\"flexible enough\\" to allow for him to appear as both a \\"ruthless operator in the underground of a quarantined city\\" as well as a \\"caring father figure to Ellie\\". His appearance was aimed to evoke \\"rural Americana\\", referencing values of self-reliance and ingenuity when facing hardship and deprivation. The team experimented with his appearance to determine his age in the game. When writing Joel, Druckmann initially took inspiration from Josh Brolin's portrayal of Llewelyn Moss in No Country for Old Men (2007), which he saw as \\"very quiet, very cool under pressure\\". However, Baker's interpretation of Joel as a more emotional person evolved the character in a different way. Ultimately, the narrative became an exploration of how willing a father is to save a child; initially, Joel is willing to sacrifice himself, before evolving where he is willing to sacrifice his friends, until finally feeling that he would sacrifice all of humanity in order to save Ellie. Druckmann felt that players, specifically parents, would be able to relate to Joel's character and his bonding with Ellie. Baker believes that Joel discovers morality throughout the game's narrative, working out the difference between loss and sacrifice, and his true personality begins to show. Druckmann became intrigued by players who discussed Joel's morality, distinguishing him as a hero or villain; Druckmann felt that Joel was only \\"a complex person who's made good and bad decisions\\", but allowed it to be open to interpretation. When auditioning for the role, Baker read a phrase on the character sheet that stated Joel had \\"few moral lines left to cross\\", which became the \\"anchor point\\" to the character for him. Baker found great difficulty in filming the game's prologue, which features scenes with Joel and his daughter Sarah, portrayed by Hana Hayes. Upon later viewing of the first day of footage from the scene, Druckmann felt that it could still be improved. When filming the scene again, Druckmann explained to Baker how to perform it, and felt that it was the best take upon doing so. Though Baker initially found the take too \\"mechanical\\", he retroactively realized that he had been trying to impress audiences by his acting, and that it was \\"not what the scene needed\\". Druckmann felt that Joel's character arc was complete after the first game. Joel's death was a core part of the narrative structure of The Last of Us Part II from early in development; Druckmann considered it one of the most difficult to write, rehearse, and shoot. Though it initially caused some internal resistance, the team felt compelled when more of the narrative was built out. An early version of Joel's death scene had him utter \\"Sarah\\", his daughter's name, until Baker suggested that he should remain silent. While Sarah's death in the first game intended to evoke sadness, Joel's death aims to elicit anger. Ellie was originally absent during the scene, and was to be informed by Joel's brother Tommy, but Druckmann felt that witnessing the death through Ellie's perspective emphasized the anger of the player. He wanted it to be portrayed as \\"gross, unceremonious, and humiliating\\" instead of heroic; it was originally more gruesome, but later toned down as the gore was not crucial to the scene. He predicted that it might lead to negative reactions, but felt it was necessary to tell the story; he particularly felt that Naughty Dog's notability in the industry gave it the opportunity to take risks that other developers can not.  Attributes  In the prologue of The Last of Us, Joel, as a single parent, is depicted as sensitive and emotionally engaged with his daughter. After her death and the 20 years that follow, in which Joel witnessed more horrific events, he has significantly changed, using violence to solve issues and showing reluctance when asked to escort Ellie. Joel is often described as an antihero. He is a hardened survivor whose obsession with survival is fueled by his desensitization due to his daughter's death. Joel's years of survival have led him to become resourceful, practical, and emotionally impenetrable, though he is still traumatized and vulnerable. He avoids becoming attached to others as he would fear losing them. Each of his movements show his age and experience, carrying the weight of the lives lost. As the game progresses, Joel becomes more sensitive to Ellie, and speaks to her in a manner previously only reserved for his daughter. Joel's act of saving Ellie in the first game's conclusion shows that he has become too sentimental and attached to Ellie to \\"do the 'right thing'\\", a trope often demonstrated in male heroes. His act is seen by some as one of redemption, and by others as one of selfishness.  Appearances  Originally from Texas, Joel was a single father in his late 20s when the initial Cordyceps outbreak occurred. Fleeing with his brother Tommy and his twelve-year-old daughter Sarah, they got involved in a firefight with a soldier, and Sarah was mortally wounded and died in his arms, leaving him traumatized. In the 20 years that follow, Joel did whatever he had to do to survive. In the time spent in the brutal post-apocalyptic world, still bitter from his daughter's death, Joel became a hardened survivor, physically and mentally tough. He has a brutal fighting style and is capable of taking on and defeating much younger men in hand-to-hand combat. Twenty years after Sarah's death, Joel works as a smuggler in the Boston quarantine zone with his friend and partner Tess. While searching for a former accomplice who stole some of their merchandise, Joel and Tess are tasked by Marlene, an acquaintance and leader of a rebel militia called the Fireflies, to smuggle Ellie to a rendezvous point. Making their way there, Joel discovers that Ellie is immune to the infection. Upon their arrival, Tess reveals that she has sustained a bite on the journey, and insists Joel finds Tommy, a former Firefly, in order to continue the mission. Joel is initially surly and short towards Ellie, though he begins to warm up to her as their journey continues. This is compounded when Joel, having initially asked Tommy to carry on in his place after meeting up with him at his settlement, changes his mind and carries on as planned. Their bond deepens when Ellie nearly loses Joel to a severe injury, and when he comes to her aid after she is nearly killed by a band of cannibals. Ultimately, Joel shows his devotion to Ellie when he chooses to rescue her from the doctors who plan to remove and examine her brain, as opposed to allowing her to die. To ensure they are not pursued, Joel kills Marlene. Driving away, Ellie wakes up, and Joel tells her the doctors gave up on discovering a cure. Ellie later confronts him about the events, and Joel swears to her that he was telling the truth. Joel and Ellie build a life in Jackson with Tommy. In the prologue of The Last of Us Part II, Joel confesses his guilt to Tommy. Flashbacks in the game reveal Joel taking Ellie on a birthday trip to a museum, and finally admitting the truth to her after she travels back to the hospital. Four years after the first game, Ellie promises to try and forgive Joel for stopping the Fireflies. While on patrol the following day, Joel and Tommy save Abby Anderson, a stranger, from Infected and they escape a large horde, returning to an outpost run by Abby's group. Joel and Tommy are swiftly attacked by Abby's group, revealed to be ex-Fireflies who are now part of the WLF, a militia group based in Seattle. Ellie finds them but is assaulted and watches helplessly as Abby beats Joel to death with a golf club; it is later revealed that Abby's father was among the Firefly surgeons killed by Joel while saving Ellie, and that Abby sought revenge on him ever since.  Reception  alt=42 year-old man looking to the left of the camera. Joel's character received generally positive feedback. IGNs Colin Moriarty found that he cared about the character and considered him likable. Andy Kelly of Computer and Video Games wrote that Joel \\"has a likeable warmth in his laconic Texan drawl\\". Jim Sterling of Destructoid found Joel likable despite his impatience and harsh tone. Eurogamers Oli Welsh felt that, by the game's end, Joel and Ellie had \\"matured from clich√©s into rounded characters\\". Conversely, Tom Mc Shea of GameSpot found Joel unlikable and unrelatable. Critics praised the relationship between Joel and Ellie. Matt Helgeson of Game Informer wrote that the relationship was \\"poignant\\" and \\"well-drawn\\", Joystiqs Richard Mitchell found it \\"genuine\\" and emotional, and IGNs Moriarty identified it as a highlight of the game. Eurogamers Welsh felt the characters were developed with \\"real patience and skill\\". Philip Kollar of Polygon found the relationship was assisted by the game's optional conversations. Kimberly Wallace of Game Informer named Joel and Ellie one of the \\"best gaming duos of 2013\\", appreciating their interest in protecting each other. Game Informers Kyle Hilliard compared Joel and Ellie's relationship to that of the Prince and Elika from Prince of Persia (2008), writing that both duos care deeply for one another, and praising the \\"emotional crescendo\\" in The Last of Us, which he judged had not been achieved in Prince of Persia. PlayStation Official Magazines David Meikleham named Joel and Ellie the best characters in a PlayStation 3 game. Baker's performance received praise. Edge wrote that, alongside Johnson's Ellie, Baker \\"breathe[s] poignancy into the grace notes of the script\\". Anthony Severino of PlayStation LifeStyle felt that felt that the performance made him care about the character, while Giancarlo Valdes of VentureBeat lauded Baker for adding \\"nuance and complexity\\" to the role. For his role in The Last of Us, Baker won Best Voice Actor at the Spike VGX, and was nominated for Best Performer from The Daily Telegraph, Outstanding Character Performance at the D.I.C.E. Awards and for Performer at the British Academy Video Games Awards. Baker's performance in The Last of Us Part II was similarly praised. GamesRadar+s Alex Avard found that Baker \\"steals some of [the game's] best scenes as Joel\\" by adding complexities that enrich the character and relationships. Evan Lewis of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Baker \\"deserves every accolade possible for his heart-wrenching performance\\". IGNs Dornbush lauded Baker's performance for depicting the weariness of Joel.

The battle resulted in the defeat of Chen Zuyi, who was captured and sent to China for execution. Background Chen Zuyi was a pirate leader who had seized Palembang on Sumatra.. He dominated the maritime route of the Malaccan Strait. The chronicler Ma Huan wrote that Shi Jinqing was the person who had informed Admiral Zheng He about Chen Zuyi's depredations.. The Haiquo Quangji by Shen Moushang states that, when Chen Zuyi was planning to attack Zheng He, Shi Jinqing secretly reported Chen's plans to Zheng He. Course In 1407, while returning homewards during the first Ming treasure voyage, Zheng He and his associates engaged Chen Zuyi and his pirate fleet in battle at Palembang... The Chinese treasure fleet defeated Chen's pirate fleet in this encounter. During the confrontation, 5,000 pirates were killed, ten pirate ships were destroyed, and seven pirate ships were captured.. The Mingshi records that Zheng He was initially sent to Palembang to negotiate the pacification of Chen Zuyi and others, but it also states that Chen and the others plotted to attack the Ming forces... The Taizong Shilu records that Chen Zuyi tried to evade and withdraw from active engagement with the treasure fleet. Dreyer (2007) characterizes the much-later account of Chen Zuyi in the Mingshi as a disparaging attempt to portray him as an evil pirate and thereby contrast him from the Chinese merchants of Palembang who submitted. Aftermath The fleet took three prisoners, including Chen Zuyi, back to the Chinese capital Nanjing for decapitation. On 2 October 1407, Chen Zuyi and his lieutenants were executed.. On 29 October 1407, the Yongle Emperor of Ming issued an order to reward the officers and other crew members who went to battle against Chen Zuyi's pirate fleet at Palembang.. The Ming court appointed Shi Jinqing as the Pacification Superintendent of Palembang, thereby establishing an ally at Palembang and securing access to this important port.

It was not the Surat's first trip to New Zealand; she had previously carried British emigrants several occasions since the mid 1860s. Wreck in The Catlins The majority of the voyage was uneventful, and the ship rounded the southern end of New Zealand's South Island on the last day of the year. At just before 10 p.m., under the command of her second mate,Hutching, G., \\"The Surat beached near the Catlins River,\\" Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, 12 June 2006. Retrieved 22 January 2019. the ship hit a rock, raking her hull before drifting clear. The exact location of this incident is unknown, but it was certainly along the southern part of the Catlins coast, and probably close to Chasland's Mistake. A check at the time found that the hull was sound and there was no leak. During the night, however, a weakened section of hull broke through, and the pumps had to be manned. At daylight, the steamer Wanganui was sighted and offered help, but Captain Johnson ‚Äî according to many accounts in a state of heavy intoxication ‚Äî made it clear in no uncertain terms that help was not needed. Several of the passengers protested and attempted to contact the Wanganui, but Johnson produced a revolver and threatened to shoot anyone defying his command. The captain did respond in part to the passengers' fears, anchoring the ship in Jack's Bay and allowing passengers to land. About half the passengers were landed before it was discovered that the ship was in danger of foundering. At this point, the anchor was raised and the Surat continued north to the mouth of the Catlins River, where she was deliberately beached in the sandy bay now called Surat Bay and formerly known as Forsyth's Bay.Shipwrecks,\\" The Catlins: Te Akau Tai Toka.

Hayward, Aftermath Once news of the wreck reached Dunedin, the harbourmaster at the city's port, Port Chalmers, enlisted the help of a French warship, the Vire, which was anchored at the port. Under the command of its captain, Jacquemart, the ship travelled south to the scene of the wreck. With the help of the steamer Wallabi (or Wallabie), which had arrived from Bluff, the Surat's passengers were safely delivered to Dunedin. All of the emigrants' belongings were left in the watery hulk, as was the ship's other cargo. The ship's wreck ‚Äî including its cargo ‚Äî was later sold at auction, but by that time, the settlers' possessions were damaged beyond repair, and they had to rely on an emergency fund set up by the residents of Dunedin. The ship's carved figurehead later became the property of Dunedin's Toitu Otago Settlers Museum. The inquiry into the wreck held that Captain Johnson and his officers were accountable for the wreck. Both the Captain and second mate had their certificates cancelled, and Johnson was further sentenced to two months' imprisonment.

The hospital first opened in 1907 as The Abbey Sanitorium, centred around a country house known as 'The Abbey'. The house has stood on the site from 1850, and was once the residence of prominent architect Charles Lanyon. The hospital was extended and several buildings added throughout the early 20th century, and it was renamed Whiteabbey Hospital in 1947. The hospital is managed by the Northern Health and Social Care Trust. Many healthcare services have been withdrawn from the hospital, most recently with the closure of the Minor Injuries Unit in 2014.  History  = The Abbey, Whiteabbey = 250x250px The Abbey was designed by the renowned architect Charles Lanyon in 1850 for Richard Davison, the Conservative MP for Belfast at the time. The house is a large two storey mansion with an Italian architectural style. Charles Lanyon bought the house himself in 1862 and lived in the house with his family until his death in 1889. Following Lanyon's death, the house was sold at auction in Belfast, and lay derelict until 1897 when it was purchased by the Granville Hotel Company, who intended to convert the house into a private tuberculosis treatment centre. By the turn of the century, tuberculosis was the most pressing health problem in the UK and Ireland, but the hospitals of the time were unable to cope with the volume of patients suffering from the disease. Most TB patients were nursed in cramped, crowded hospital wards. It was soon realised that Belfast needed a dedicated hospital for the treatment of tuberculosis, and in 1904 The Abbey was purchased by Belfast Union to function as a sanitorium. = Whiteabbey Sanitorium = Plans were drawn up to build 4 pavilions and a two- storey hospital block to accommodate 265 patients, with work commencing in March 1906. The Abbey was converted into an administration block with accommodation for doctors and nurses also provided. The sanitorium opened in 1907 as an auxiliary workhouse for the treatment of tuberculosis. The 1907 annual report for 'The Abbey Sanitorium for pulmonary tuberculosis' stated that 311 patients were treated at the hospital, and 31 of those patients had died over the course of the year. The visiting physician (doctor in charge) at the time was Robert Hall, who had first suggested in 1900 it would be better for tuberculosis patients to be treated in their own specialised hospital. On 1 October 1913, the management of the sanitorium was transferred to Belfast Corporation (Belfast City Council), who decided to rename the hospital 'Belfast Municipal Sanitorium' to reflect its role as the main treatment centre for tuberculosis in Belfast. The numbers of patients treated at Whiteabbey each year grew steadily with 519 patients admitted in 1928, and the average duration of residence lasting 176 days. By the 1930s it had become clear that the pavilions were unsuitable for nursing seriously ill patients, and widespread criticism was made of the standard of care received by some patients. In 1941 a six-month inquiry identified a catalogue of failings at the sanitorium, blaming the Belfast Corporation for its poor management of the facility. In 1943, Brice Clark was appointed chief physician, and in 1946 the newly established Northern Ireland Tuberculosis Authority took over the running of the sanitorium. The sanitorium was renamed Whiteabbey Hospital in 1947.  Whiteabbey Hospital School  An open air school existed within the grounds of the hospital, allowing the children to continue their education and spend time outside in the fresh air, which at the time was one of the main treatments available for tuberculosis. The school was closed in 1949, with the remaining pupils transferred to the school at Crawfordsburn Hospital, a nearby children's hospital. The number of children residing at Whiteabbey hospital increased following the school's closure, and in 1954 the school was re- established until the children's tuberculosis ward was closed in 1968. = Expansion = In the years that followed, in part due to the formation of the NHS in 1948, patients other than those suffering from tuberculosis were treated at the hospital, with a particular focus on respiratory disease. Land adjacent to the existing hospital site was purchased in 1951 to allow future expansion of the existing hospital site to take place. In 1959 control of the hospital was transferred to the Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority. It was decided that the rapidly expanding population of Newtownabbey required a general hospital, so the main hospital building underwent substantial refurbishment and extension to become suitably equipped to provide general medical and surgical care. This modern facility opened in 1964 and was renamed McCaughey House. The operating theatres which had been opened in 1956 were also modernised at this time. By this time 'The Abbey' was being used exclusively as an administration building, and it also underwent repairs in 1967. The number of tuberculosis patients had steadily declined over the years, and in August 1968 the last few TB patients were transferred to Forster Green Hospital in south Belfast. As the hospital increased in size it became apparent that a large, modern nurse's accommodation block would be required to ensure the hospital was adequately staffed. The new nurse's home and a school of nursing were opened in 1969. The nurse's home was named Norah Bain House, after a Sister Tutor who worked at the hospital for many years. An Outpatient's department building was opened in 1972, followed by a Casualty and X-Ray department which although completed in 1974, didn't open until 1975 due to staff shortages. = Recent Years = With the opening of Antrim Area Hospital in 1993, it was inevitable that some services would be centralised and withdrawn from Whiteabbey Hospital. Several wards and services were either closed or relocated to other hospitals, including the inpatient surgical unit, which was relocated to Antrim in 2009. The accident and emergency department was downgraded to a minor injuries unit in May 2010, with this facility ultimately closing in December 2014. The Northern Ireland Hospice temporarily relocated to one of the disused wards in the grounds of the hospital in November 2012 whilst its Somerton House site was rebuilt. Some of the disused buildings at the hospital have been used by production companies, with scenes for TV series The Fall, starring Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan, being filmed here in 2012. It was proposed in August 2017 that two rehabilitation wards consisting of 44 beds were to be closed as part of ¬£70 million budget cuts across the Northern Ireland health service, but these plans were shelved following public consultation. Services  Woodlands Wellness Hub is a facility offering adults with mental health conditions the opportunity to take part in a range of recovery programmes. It aims to support people on leaving hospital and to prevent admission to hospital.

He is best known for his work with Giorgio Fiocco to measure the distance to the Moon using a ruby laser in 1962, shortly after that device was invented. Earlier, he had worked in the microwave radar field at the MIT Radiation Laboratory and was instrumental in creating the Lincoln Laboratory that carried on this work. Later he worked on developing instrumentation for nuclear fusion research and many other projects. He retired in 1986 but worked in the department until 2001. Life and career Smullin was born in Detroit to Isaac M. Smullin (May 15, 1887 - December 12, 1965) and Ida May (born June 11, 1887). His parents were Russian Jewish immigrants.https://news.mit.edu/newsoffice/2009/techtalk53-28.pdf&sa;=U&ved;=2ahUKEwjXkJfbwtHrAhVEx1kKHZtgDGkQFjAAegQIBhAB&usg;=AOvVaw1fl68ifQEYr0dP9OdpNm98 His father was an advocate for the Communist International Labor Defense, was involved with Th. L. Poindexter in Detroit around 1938 in the Roumanian Workers Educational Association of America, and later established the Worker's Camp. In 1957, his parents were called before by the House Un-American Activities Committee. Smullin spent two years at the local Wayne State University and then moved to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he received the BSE in electrical engineering in 1936. After two years of working in the industry, he enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and in 1939 earned his Master of Science with the work in \\"The Acceleration and Focusing of Electrons in Multi-Stage Tubes\\". In June he married Ruth Frankel (died 2011). In 1936, he worked for several months as a draftsman for the Swift Electric Welder Company. At the Ohio Brass Company in Barberton, he spent two years performing high voltage tests on transmission-line insulators and radio interference. After MIT, he joined Farnsworth Television and Radio in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Here he designed and tested photomultiplier tubes. After the outbreak of war, in 1940 he moved to the Scintilla Magneto Division of Bendix Aviation in Sidney, New York, where Smullin designed test instruments for ignition systems. This thesis advisor at MIT then asked him to join the newly-formed MIT Radiation Laboratory (RadLab) in 1941, where he became head of the Radiation Laboratory transmitter/receiver switch and duplexer section. These circuits allow a single antenna to be used for transmission and reception by switching it between the separate transmitter and receiver circuits. The group also developed methods for testing transceiver microwave tubes at over 3 GHz and designed most radar duplexers until the end of the war. After the war, in 1946 he then spent a short time at the Federal Telecommunications Laboratory in Nutley, New Jersey. In 1947 he returned to MIT to organize and lead the Microwave Tube Laboratory of the Laboratory of Electronics. He helped plan and set up the MIT Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Massachusetts, which MIT President James Rhyne Killian had resisted in 1951. In 1952 he became head of the radar and weapons department at the Lincoln Lab. In 1955 he returned to the MIT Cambridge campus as Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and was appointed Professor in 1960. After the invention of the ruby laser, along with atmosphere physicist Giorgio Fiocco, on the evenings of 9th-11th May 1962 Smullin transmitted pulses of laser light to the Moon and used this to determine the distance to the Moon with new accuracy. Fiocco further developed these concepts as LIDAR. From 1966 to February 1974 he was head of the electrical engineering department. One of his inventions enabled the study of controlled thermonuclear fusion. After 1974, he returned to teaching and helped build the MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department (EECS) until the 1980s. After retiring in 1986, he still cycled to the Institute every day to continue his work on fusion research until he suffered a stroke in 2001. He died eight years later at the nursing home Lasell House in Newton. In 1968 he was appointed a Fellow of the American Physical Society. He was also a member of the American Society of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, Eta Kappa Nu and Sigma Xi. Smullin died in Newton, Massachusetts. His grandson is actor, author, and musician Andras Jones.http://www.radio8ball.com/archives/44-andras-jones-three-day- weekend-7-of-wands-valour/ References =Further reading= *Remembering Louis Dijour Smullin 1916-2009 * Smullin, Louis Dijour, MIT Class of 1939 Category:1916 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Scientists from Detroit Category:Wayne State University alumni Category:University of Michigan College of Engineering alumni Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni Category:American electrical engineers ","title":"Louis Smullin"},{"id":"59728821","title":"2019 Judo Grand Prix Tel Aviv"},{"id":"59728838","text":"The rufous-breasted antpitta or leymebamba antpitta (Grallaricula leymebambae) is a species of bird in the family Grallariidae.

The campaign began in 2014, based out of Bangkok, working in partnership with IOM offices in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar, and Bangladesh, to develop outreach activities that protect vulnerable people from exploitation. The campaign does this through applying a Communication for Development framework, which involves creating and tailoring media content around robust first-hand research to inspire positive behaviour change by target audiences. While originally developed to prevent human trafficking and exploitation in ASEAN and Bangladesh, materials developed for the campaign have been translated into 18 languages and used in 40 countries around the world.  Campaign launches  = Indonesia = In 2014, IOM X launched ‚ÄòOpen Doors‚Äô in Indonesia. The 22-minute video aims to raise awareness of the exploitation of domestic workers in Southeast Asia.

Caplin, Classical Form: A Theory of Formal Functions for the Instrumental Music of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, p. 255. . This device is commonly used to extend what would normally be a regular phrase into an irregular and extended phrase. Such expansion by interpolation is achieved by the addition of extra music in the middle of a phrase (commonly through the use of sequence). A clear example exists in the second movement of Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 10, K.330. Formerly, in the sung portions of the Mass, such as the introit or kyrie, it was permissible, especially during the medieval period, to amplify a liturgical formula by interpolating a \\"farse\\" (from Medieval Latin farsa, forcemeat),Farse: Definition with Farse Pictures and Photos.

Polythionates are oxoanions with the formula Sn(SO3)22- (n‚â•0). They occur naturally and are the products of redox reactions of thiosulfate. Polythionates are readily isolable, unlike the parent polythionic acids. Preparation Many members of the polythionates have been characterized: dithionate, trithionate, tetrathionate, pentathionate, etc. These salts are often generated by oxidation of thiosulfate. For example, tetrathionate is obtained by oxidation of thiosulfate ion with iodine (reaction is used in iodometry): : + I2 ‚Üí + 2 I‚àí More specialized routes involve reactions of sulfur chlorides with bisulfite salts: :: SCl2 \\\\+ 2 ‚Üí [O3SSSO3]2‚àí \\\\+ 2 HCl :: S2Cl2 \\\\+ 2 ‚Üí [O3SS2SO3]2‚àí \\\\+ 2 HCl :: SCl2 \\\\+ 2 ‚Üí [O3SS3SO3]2‚àí \\\\+ 2 HCl Potassium pentathionate ion has been obtained from SCl2, sodium thiosulfate, and potassium acetate. Initially prismatic crystals of potassium tetrathionate appear, then lamellar crystals of potassium pentathionate, from which the influence of tartaric acid makes an aqueous solution of pentathionic acid.

History  Longgui Park is located in Guangfu village, Magong City, next to an abandoned power plant. It was completed on July 20, 2001 and cost NTD 880,000. It was named after Deng Long-gui () who contributed to the construction of the park. Longgui Park is one of few community parks in downtown Magong, and it is also a friendly shelter to feral cats.  Road Dispute  = Background = During the period of magistrate Wang Chien-fa's term (2005-2014), county council member Chen Hai-shan () proposed to open a new road from Xincun Road () to Haipu Road (), running through Longgui Park and the nearby abandoned Taiwan Power Company power station. In 2015, Ou Zhi-cheng (), the Penghu power station plant manager, proposed preservation of the power station buildings. Chen Hai-shan rejected this, saying \\"There is not any reason to preserve Magong power station because I cannot tell any kind feature of it.\\" He insisted on demolishing the plant and Longgui Park for construction of the new road. Penghu County Government and Taiwan Power Company negotiated that the company would release the land on November 8, 2016. In early October 2017, county executive Chen Kuang-fu () promised that \\"The project of opening a road from Xincun Road to Haipu Road\\" must begin the next March. However, by June 2018 the project had not started. County council member Chen Hai-shan asked Hsueh Hung-ying (, the director of Penghu county government economic affairs department) to execute the project as soon as possible. \\"If county council could agree to afford the advance payment (NTD 25,820,000), we might start the construction in August.\\" Hsueh replied. Chen Hai-shan promised Hsueh the advance payment would be approved in the session, but if it didn't, construction should still start. \\"We'll see about that!\\" Chen Hai-shan threatened. = Protests = Local politician Sheng Yi-che () and residents from Guangfu village staged a protest of the project on July 31, 2018. They held a press conference and declared their dissatisfaction to the Penghu County Government. They reasoned that Baichen Street () already connects Xinsheng Road () with the Haipu Road (), is wide and is just from Xincun Road (). \\"This project is very ridiculous and unacceptable! It is unnecessary to spend about 2,600 million dollars destroying a community park and an abandoned plant just for expand Xincun Road!\\" Said by Sheng Yi-che. \\"It is nonsense! We won't execute this project on August 15\\" replied Lin Wen-zao (), the vice manager of the county government economic affairs department. On August 7, 2018, Penghu County Government announced Lu Chun-tian () would replace Hsueh Hung-ying as the manager of Penghu county government economic affairs department.

It is a coalition, consisting of two parties: the Social Democrats and the Green Party. The cabinet was installed on 21 January 2019, following the 2018 general election. With only 116 out of 349 seats (33%) in the Riksdag (Swedish parliament), the \\"red-green\\" coalition began as one of the weakest minority governments in Swedish history, and it relies on support from other parties in the Riksdag. The cabinet was installed following a formal government meeting with King Carl XVI Gustaf on 21 January 2019. Stefan L√∂fven had previously announced his cabinet ministers at a parliament session on the same day.  Policy  = January Agreement = Stefan L√∂fven's second cabinet is one of the weakest governments in Swedish history. As such, it currently depends on support from other parties in the Riksdag. The red-green government's retention of power is the result of a joint agreement between the Social Democrats, the Green Party, the Centre Party and the Liberals. The 16-page document, signed in January, which is commonly referred to as Januariavtalet (lit. the January Agreement) dictates what government policy will look like for the foreseeable future. The agreement includes the following main points: * The Centre Party and Liberals agree to abstain from voting against Stefan L√∂fven's re-election. * The Left Party shall not receive any influence over Swedish politics for the following years. * Passing a test in Swedish and in the basics of civics shall be mandatory in order to acquire Swedish citizenship. * The v√§rnskatt tax is to be abolished by 2020. This tax, which was adopted in 1995 by the Social Democrats, is a surtax of five additional percentage points on anyone's annual income that exceeds 703,000 crowns. * The Employment Protection Act (LAS) is to be amended by no later than 2021. The amendments are to include additional exceptions to the rules of seniority regarding redundancy terminations of employees. A government inquiry was started in April 2019. * The government is to refrain from proposing legislation which limits or prevents the private sector from generating profits from their work in the welfare system. * Taxes on environmentally unfriendly goods and services are to be increased while taxes on salaries are to be lowered. This is known as gr√∂n skattev√§xling (lit. \\"green tax shifting\\") in Swedish politics and will amount to 15 billion crowns (circa ‚Ç¨1,38 billion). * The increased tax on retirees is to be abolished by 2020 and general pensions are to be increased by 2021. * A \\"family week\\" is to be introduced. Working parents who have children between the ages of four and sixteen receive three days off each within the framework of parental insurance. These days are intended to be used when children cannot attend school due to school breaks, etc. Single parents receive six days. * The tax reduction on household services (the RUT-avdrag) is to include an additional range of services. * Employers' state fees are to be decreased. * The Public Employment Service will undergo a fundamental reform and will have to compete with private employment agencies. Additionally, the agreement includes investments and policy changes across many areas:  Infrastructure  * Investments are to be made into the countryside, such as increased possibilities for distance education. The government is also to ensure that no more government services locate their headquarters in the capital, Stockholm, during the government term. * The national digital infrastructure is to be drastically improved, a goal has been set to guarantee that 95% of all households and businesses has access to a broadband speed of at least 100 Mbit/s by 2020. * Investments in the railway and road infrastructure across the country will amount to 700 billion crowns (~‚Ç¨65,2 billion) between 2018 and 2029. * The Swedish Transport Administration is to be tasked with maintaining daily over-night trains to several European cities.  Environment  * A proposition regarding fossil fuel-free transports aims to prohibit the sale of new gasoline- and diesel-driven cars. An inquiry into such a prohibition is to be made during 2019 and a prohibition would require approval by the European Commission. * The abolished aviation tax is to be reintroduced.  Social integration  * The punishment for honor-related violent crimes is to be strengthened. * Municipalities shall reserve the right to limit state aid to those asylum seekers who manage to find their own housing in areas with socio-economic difficulties.  Housing  * The ability to set rents on newly built residential developments is to be left to the property manager. * Four separate taxes which are collectively known as the flyttskatt (\\"move tax\\") are to be abolished  Education  * Academic grading is to be allowed as of year 4 (age 10) of elementary school, instead of year 6, but it is to be voluntary for schools to grade students until year 6. * No more privately owned schools with a religious orientation are to be opened. * The possibilities for a state-run education system are to be explored.  Personal assistance  * The right to receive and subsidy for assistance for care revolving around breathing and tube feeding, which was abolished in the Moderate and Christian Democrat budget, is to be restored.  Security  * 10,000 more police employees by 2024. * A principle to prohibit weapon export deals with non-democratic countries which are known to participate militarily in the Yemeni conflict until the conflict ends. The government proposed to reduce employers‚Äô social security contributions to increase young people's employment in 2019. The Swedish fossil-free initiatives proposals amounted to 1,950 million crowns, including investments in biogas and home charging of 750 million kronor, wetland protection at 200 million, and solar cell subsidies of 300 million. Aviation tax of 785 million crowns a year is to be collected. = 2020 state budget = Minister for Finance Magdalena Andersson delivered the 2020 budget proposal to the Riksdag on 18 September 2019. The proposed budget contains points from the January agreement between the Centre Party, Greens, the Liberals and the Social Democrats. The reforms of the budget are expected to cost the state 30 billion crowns. Arguably the most significant reform in the budget proposal is the abolished v√§rnskatt tax. The v√§rnskatt is a surtax which was adopted in 1995 by the Social Democrats. It taxes five additional percentage points on anyone's annual income that exceeds 703,000 crowns. The Liberals have pushed for removing the v√§rnskatt for a long period of time. The reform is expected to cost the state 6.1 billion crowns each year. The largest reform in terms of increasing revenue in the budget is the three-crown tax on plastic bags which is expected to generate 2 billion crowns in tax revenue. Other tax-political reforms include the lowering of taxes for the elderly with a pension of at least 17 000 crowns per month, as well as a tax break for people living in certain rural municipalities. The eligible municipalities cover most of Norrland and Dalarna and parts of V√§rmland and Dalsland. The regions and municipalities of Sweden will receive a general contribution of five billion crowns. The municipalities will receive 3.5 billion crowns and the regions will receive 1.5 billion. All of which will be distributed equally according to each subdivision's population. An additional 410 million crowns will be going toward efforts to combat and prevent segregation on the local and regional levels, with a reserve fund of 85 million being made available for the same purpose. According to Dagens Nyheter, 110 of Sweden's municipalities will be operating at a deficit during the remainder of 2019. The government claims that the reforms are going to increase the gap between the poor and the rich, as well as between men and women. = Measures against gang crime = In September 2019, talks were held between the government parties and the centre-right Moderates, Christian Democrats, Centre Party and Liberals regarding an agreement concerning measures for combating gang violence and organized crime. Negotiations broke down on 21 September 2019, with three of the centre-right parties (M, L and KD) leaving the talks. The Moderate spokesman for justice affairs stated that \\"We can agree to a lot of the crime prevention work [proposals]. Regarding the strengthening of justice policy, I can affirm that we are still very far from each other\\". The Moderates demanded additional police officers, the doubling of prison time for gang-related offences, the ability to turn state's evidence and the abolishing of mandatory lenient sentencing for young offenders. The Christian Democrats, Centre Party and Liberals have all pushed for the ability of witnesses to testify on the condition of anonymity. On the same day, following the breakdown of the negotiations, the government announced their own package of measures to combat gang crime. The package consists of 34 proposals which include giving the police the ability to read and listen to encrypted communications, transferring certain police responsibilities to community service officers and increasing the mandatory minimum sentences for several crimes such as weapons and explosives offences, recruiting youth for criminal activities and for conveying narcotics to others. Moderate leader Ulf Kristersson announced on 22 September that they would support the government package, provided that the proposals lead to concrete reforms. The Christian Democrats stated that they would be supporting certain parts of the package. Following the shooting of a 15-year-old boy in Malm√∂ on the night of 9 November, the opposition parties called for a vote of no-confidence against Minister of Justice Morgan Johansson, deeming him at least partly responsible for the recent wave of violent crime. Two days later, on 11 November, the police launched Operation Rimfrost with the mission of curbing gang violence, with police officials claiming that a \\"difference would be noticed\\" within roughly six months. = Response to Covid-19 outbreak = On 24 February, the government announced that they would be spending 40 million SEK (roughly ‚Ç¨4 million) towards the World Health Organization's efforts in containing the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak. Public gatherings of more than 500 people were banned on 11 March. A set of emergency reforms were announced on 16 March in order to curb the economic effects of the coronavirus. The state will provide all employees with paid sickness leave and will also give companies more time to pay taxes. The reform package has a capped budget of 300 billion crowns. On 17 March, schools providing secondary and higher education (gymnasium and universities) were advised to close and to teach classes remotely. In conjunction with the European Union announcing a 30-day travel ban for people entering the Union, the government instituted a ban on non-essential travel from non-EU nations to Sweden in the evening of 17 March. = Employment Protection Act (LAS) reform = Negotiations between the Swedish Trade Union Confederation and the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise regarding the reform of the Employment Protection Act (LAS) failed on 1 October 2020. As the reform of LAS is stipulated to occur by no later than 2022, unless negotiations are resumed, the government is expected to step in and execute the reforms put forward in their 2019 inquiry. The Left Party is firmly against the suggested reforms and has vowed to launch a vote of no confidence against the government if they were to go through with the reforms. The right-wing opposition parties have indicated that they would support the Left during such a vote, which would be enough for a majority. Trade union and enterprise leaders stated that they were willing to resume talks on 14 October. The government's proposed reforms include the following points: * Employers are to be legally required to develop their employees' skills and levels of competence. * Dismissing employees on personal grounds will be made less costly and easier. * The number of employees who may be exempt from the rules of seniority regarding terminations will be increased from two to five. * Employers are to have total freedom of choice of who to dismiss when there is a lack of work. * Interns are to be entitled to priority during the hiring process after nine months with a company instead of the current twelve-month requirement.  Controversies  Annika Strandh√§ll = Begler Affair = In 2018, the government fired Director-General Ann-Marie Begler of the Social Insurance Agency. The Minister for Social Security, Annika Strandh√§ll, stated that the government had been dissatisfied with Begler's performance for a long time and that she had voluntarily resigned, something that Begler denied. Additionally, e-mails were sent to the Riksdag Constitution Committee by senior managers at the Social Insurance Agency. The senior managers accused Minister Strandh√§ll of lying and demanded that Begler be reinstated. Criticism from major political parties started with the Moderates, with Ulf Kristersson accusing the government of firing the Director-General for the purposes of electioneering. The liberal-conservative party spearheaded an effort to sack the Minister for Social Security through a motion of no-confidence, an effort which had the support of the Moderates, the Christian Democrats and the Sweden Democrats. On the evening of May 27, the Centre Party announced that it would not be supporting the vote of no-confidence against Strandh√§ll. The vote was held on May 28 and failed, with 172 MPs supporting the motion, 113 voting against and 59 abstaining. Support is required from at least 175 MPs. Strandh√§ll received a formal warning by the Riksdag Constitution Committee in June 2019. Stefan L√∂fven = Reform of the Public Employment Service = In accordance with the January agreement, the government initiated a reform of the Public Employment Service in order to open the market for competition from employment agencies in the private sector. This, in combination with the adoption of the conservative-authored 2019 state budget, resulted in a major budget cut for the agency. In early 2019, the Service announced that they would be sacking 4,500 employees and closing 132 offices around the country. The cuts drew severe criticism from opposition parties, with the Left Party threatening a vote of no-confidence against Minister for Employment Eva Nordmark on 21 November, a move which by December was backed by the three conservative opposition parties. As a result, the government was forced to put the reform on hold for a year. In a memo, the government authorized the Public Employment Service to ensure adequate service in areas where the closures of local offices had been ordered. As of February 2020, service had been restored in 99 of the 132 areas where the agency had previously decided to close their offices.

The AI computer controls the players in the field but the player can dictate where the ball is thrown. Commentary is provided by former players Richie Benaud and David Gower. Development Based on the 1999 Cricket World Cup, and officially licensed by the world governing body of cricket, the International Cricket Council, development of Cricket 2000 began in November 1998 by Krisalis Software in the South Yorkshire town of Rotherham who assembled a team of 12 people to work on it. Krisalis developed motion capture footage by analysing more than 500 individual movements of the English cricket players and brothers Adam Hollioake and Ben Hollioake. Benaud was selected as the lead commentator because the developers felt he was the ideal choice for the job and Benaud suggested to them that Gower be approached for his experience and reputation in the cricket world. Cricket 2000 was released by EA Sports for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation in 2000. Reception In April 2000, the game was listed fourth in the top ten selling console games by retail company Electronics Boutique. Cricket 2000 received mixed reviews from critics. Aggregate review website GameRankings gave the PlayStation version received 69.00% based on a single review and the PC version 57.00% based upon five reviewers. Jack Scofield of The Guardian criticised the graphics, calling them \\"crude\\" and \\"wooden\\", and the overall gameplay as \\"somewhat hit and miss\\". Birmingham Post's Simon Griffiths however was complimentary of its batting and bowling mechanisms but he was also critical of the batsmen's movements, which he felt were \\"unrealistic\\". Writing for PC Magazine, Daniel S. Evans recommended the game solely for cricket fans, while PC PowerPlay's Christian Read had similar feelings towards it, saying the gameplay remained challenging to arouse interest for a short amount of time. In PC Gaming World, John Houlihan called the game \\"probably the premier playable cricket game on the PC today\\".

This took up on the north section (now Bonnie View Court) and the south section was developed as \\"Waterworks park\\", not to be confused with the current Waterworks Park located on the north side of town. 1934 map of north side of Mutton Park showing location of water tower. William Mutton was a well known local farmer, a lumber yard operator and auctioneer. He loved to travel, visiting places in this and other countries. His residence was the cement block home at the north west corner of Main and Boman Streets. In 1927, following one of his trips, he received permission from the council to plant a grove of trees in the south section in honor of his wife. He outlined the plan for the grove from and inscription he had seen on a stone marker in England. \\"I am constrained to plant a grove, to please the lady of my love. This ample grove is to compose 25 trees in 12 straight rows. Five trees in each tow must I place, or I shall have never see her face\\". Mutton gained the services of Gordon Bedford, a graduate civil engineer to work out the mathematics of the design. Bedford also went to the site and staked out the location of each tree. Eighteen maples were secured from the farm of F. M. Confer and seven elms from the farm of Judd Lee. Village employees gave Mutton a hand in digging and planting the trees. Mutton carefully guarded the young grove, carrying water from a well near the water tower. He kept them well pruned and growing straight up.

Labour described it as an event 'to bring our incredible movement together'.  Acts  With regards to music, Clean Bandit headlined the festival, and other acts included Glen Matlock, Declan McKenna, DVTN, Feminist Jukebox, Hookworms, Jermain Jackman, Rae Morris, Potent Whisper, Nia Wyn, Reverend and The Makers, Sam Fender, She Drew The Gun, and The Magic Numbers. Politicians speaking included Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn, the then-Shadow Secretary of State for International Development Kate Osamor, and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell. Other speakers included The Guardian columnist and author Owen Jones, journalist and author Alex Nunns, journalist and author Rachel Shabi, and journalist and author Maya Goodfellow.  Attendance and finances  The festival was reported to cost approximately ¬£1 million. Tickets to the event were originally priced at ¬£35 for adults, ¬£30 for concessions and ¬£10 for children. Before the event, however, the price was reduced to ¬£10, with under-14s attending free of charge. The festival was criticised for its low attendance, with only 3,000 tickets of the 20,000 capacity being sold according to 'insiders' while other estimates put the figure at 4,000. A month before the festival, the Huffington Post reported that only 15% of available tickets had been sold. Trade unions and constituency parties gave away free tickets with complimentary travel. Tickets were given away in the name of ‚ÄúTony Blair, care of HMP Belmarsh‚Äù, as well as in the names of Kim Il-sung and Leon Trotsky. The Labour Party have not confirmed attendance figures. It was reported in 2019 that the festival was one of the causes that the Labour Party is 'skint'. When questioned by former National Executive Committee member Johanna Baxter in 2018 at Labour conference, party treasurer Diana Holland confirmed that the event did not make a profit, stating that she didn't 'think that was why it was organised', and also stating that the party's reserve funds paid for the shortfall in costs, with general election funds not touched.

Plot  College student Sarah Foster is found by the police, as she is sleepwalking in her nightgown on the road. Since the suicide of her husband Jonathon, who worked as a novelist, she is suffering from sleep disorder. A few days later, she talks to Dr Cooper, whose student she was, about the sleepwalking and a recurring nightmare, in which she is attacked by an unknown man. Cooper sends her to a therapy in a sleep laboratory. During a walk on a cemetery, Sarah talks about it with her roommate Dawn, who shows a personal interest in her professor Owen. Then an attractive man gets out of a black car and Sarah imagines him being single. At the evening in the sleep laboratory, Dr. Koslov explains to her that her neuronal activity will be observed during the night. He also introduces her to Dr. Scott White, the director of the lab. It is the man whom Sarah has seen at the cemetery. He tells her, that a student was buried and he was there with a colleague. Sarah confides to him that she loved her husband, but not his work as a novelist. The next morning she wakes up in a different room after a silent, dreamless night. White takes her case. He reports about irregularities in the theta waves and asks her to spend some more nights in the lab. Sarah recognizes that something is wrong. In the lecture hall she questions the statement of her teacher, who thinks that love stories are just a dopamine kick or a bipolar disorder. But she is even more irritated when he addresses her as Miss Wells and a student repeats this name. Also Dawn, her driver's license, her diary and a dedication in her husband's book affirm this surname. Sarah is rejected by Cooper's assistant. In the sleep laboratory Dr Koslov shows her a protocol about her dream in which she is pursued. She denies having dreamed anything, but sees her signature on the form. After one more night under surveillance Sarah briefly mentions some kind of fear to White, but neither she nor the machines have recognized a dream during the night. In the library she looks for books about psychology. She talks to an employee about forgetting things and he mentions partial retrograde amnesia as a cause for this; it may be cured by returning into everyday routine. But if there are also hallucinations, it might be a psychosis. In her apartment, Sarah does not meet Dawn, but a different young woman named Nicole, who does not know Dawn, but something about Sarahs sleepwalking. As Nicole leaves, Sarah gets a phone call from an unknown, scary voice, which introduces himself as her stalker in the dark. She goes to Cooper again, but the doctor does not remember her or the talk. At home she locks herself into her bedroom and says to herself that she is Sarah Foster. She has again a nightmare, in which she is attacked from behind and suffocated with a plastic bag. She wakes up in an unknown house, in whose letterbox she finds a letter addressed to the \\"current resident\\". In her nightgown she goes to her apartment, in which she sees Nicole and a second woman, but she cannot get in. She spends the rest of the night in a room next to the pool of the apartment complex. At daylight she sees the two women leaving the apartment. Then she smashes a window with a brick. In the apartment, she puts on a blouse and a skirt, which are too big for her size. The stalker calls her again on the phone and tells her, that he is going to watch her and wants to feel her. Sarah grabs some pills and alcohol and locks herself into a closet next to the washing machines. Water flows in under the door. After waking up, Sarah returns to her apartment, whose window is no more smashed. Dawn just comes out and in reaction to her question, Sarah states having spent the night at the sleep laboratory. She looks up Whites private address and drives there on her bike. On the way, she passes the unknown house, in which she woke up some time ago. White is renovating his house and welcomes her friendly. He listens to Sarah's report about the irritating events, and then calls Dr Cooper, who remembers Sarah. White tells Sarah, that she has unusual sleep patterns that might affect her perception. She asks whether the world might change dramatically, and runs away. Near her apartment she thinks that the stalker is behind her, but White is there again. He takes her to his home. She mentions that she has panic to fall asleep because everything could change again. White responds with the explanation, that chemical triggers in the brain cause emotions during dreams, which the rational part of the brain uses to construct a story. She insists, that the unknown house was real, but does not want to get in trouble with the resident. Watching a thunderstorm she asks herself, whether she can be rescued and why White helps her. He answers that they are going to stand this together and everything will make sense. Sarah spends the night in his house. In her nightmare she is covered up in plastic and then sees an unknown woman in bed, by whom she is rejected. In her nightgown Sarah leaves the mysterious house of her former dream and reenters White's house in the dawn, without meeting him there. She puts on yesterday's clothes, which are too big for her. In her own apartment she has a look at the window, which is now covered with cardboard. In the sleep laboratory, she asks for Dr White, but is not recognized. A completely different man introduces himself as White. He knows a woman called Sarah Wells, but it is not the Sarah he is talking to. In the lecture hall, Sarah sees a quote which says that you do not need to know who you are, because the purpose of life is to become something different than at the beginning. In the group of students she also sees the unknown woman and panics even more. As cops are in front of her apartment, she hides in the closet and there is water on the floor again. Sarah wakes up in the sleep laboratory. The well known White tells her, that she has sleepwalked again, until the police brought her to his house. She cannot remember anything, but the data show that she has dreamt during the whole night. She talks about her last experiences in the other world. White thinks that the stalker might be an anchor connecting the two worlds. When he asks Sarah for the reason for her husband's suicide, she says, that she wrote about it in her diary, but cannot remember the event after her therapy. In front of her apartment, she reads her diary and is not irritated by Nicole arriving at the flat. On a public computer she looks at an old news article saying that the author Jonathan Gray was shot by a crazy fan. She shows the article to White. He says that he has all information about her husband's death from her and she herself learned everything about it from Dr Cooper, she says. After returning to her apartment she is attacked by the stalker, but she can free herself causing the attacker to go mad. When White arrives after being alarmed by her, the flat is undamaged and there is no trace of the attacker. Cooper joins the two and Sarah is confronted with another dream protocol. Although White tries to calm his patient, Sarah is put into a hospital and bound to the bed in spite of her resistance. At the same evening White meets Cooper who suddenly does not know Sarah and denies having seen White that afternoon. He drives back to the hospital to take Sarah, who is winding in her bed in spite of a strong sedation. White frees her and takes her to his house. There she again shows panic about falling asleep and he tells her about Coopers awkward reaction. Then he lies next to her to help her get into sleep. Sarah awakes with her head on his breast, still in the hospital clothes. In the following talk she states that she now remembers several things. Her stalker is called Warren Lambert and was obsessed with Jonathan, she says. The attack in her flat was not real; White explains it as a memory breaking through. Jonathon, she continues, had a sexual affaire with a fan and Sarah witnessed it when she visited him in his office. She broke up with him, but the fan shot him, she says. In Whites dark house, Sarah is attacked by the stalker who tries to suffocate her with a plastic bag from behind. But White comes to help her and knocks the aggressor down. The policeman describes the attacker as a well known criminal and addresses Sarah as Foster. After that, Sarah and White have sex. In the night, Sarah sleepwalks again in her white nightgown. She sees the unknown woman first in the sleep laboratory and then in the house of the dream, where she asks for her name in vain. Through the rain she walks to the lab again. There the unknown woman wakes up seeing Sarah. The other White addresses the woman as \\"Sarah\\", but does not see Sarah in the nightgown. The normal White comes to Sarah and looks for an explanation. He finds a video statement of the unknown woman, who talks about feeling pursued and a woman standing next to her bed at night. In another flashback Sarah herself shoots Jonathon, who now talks with White's voice. In the lab Sarah says, that she is the other woman's nightmare. White's real version treats this woman, she thinks. But White insists that there must be an explanation. Sarah tells him, that Jonathon was her big love. But she is not his wife, but the other woman and she is called Anna. She shot herself. After this statement she talks to him about love and identity and he thinks they are in an in-between world. She nevertheless is sure that she created him to find out the truth. Then a woman wakes up in the ward for long-term coma of the Los Angeles university hospital. She is wearing an oxygen mask and is bound to the bed. A male nurse who looks like the stalker in the story comes to her. He addresses her as Anna and caresses her face. Water drops are falling on the woman's feet. Afterwards, the sleepwalker can be seen on the street again and she calls herself Sarah Foster.  Production  Filming took place in Los Angeles in 2014.

Between 1919 and 1937, he murdered two of his wives, his aunt and her husband, also attempting to murder his 3rd wife. He was hanged for his crimes on April 14, 1937. Biography =Early life= Sokrat Albert Kirshveng was born circa 1882 in the village of Alino, to a Romani Bulgarian mother and father of Greek descent. He was born with a slight defect in one of his shoulders. His parents died when he was very young, and the young orphan was sent to Samokov, where he began work as an apprentice and later a journeyman for a local lumberjack, before becoming a master in the trade himself. Kirshveng was considered a dapper man among his colleagues, wearing costumes from the latest Parisian fashion and Viennese bowties, as well as having varnish shoes imported from Argentina. In 1908, he married to Elena Manova in Samokov, who later gave birth to two children - Alexander and Raina. However, Kirshveng disliked the small-town life and his job, so he abandoned his family and travelled to Sofia, promising to come back with lots of money. There he met Vangelia Yurdanova, a tailor who occasionally worked for the hospital. She immediately fell for the man, and she allowed him to live with her in her small house in the Modern Suburbs behind the Sugar Factory, unaware that Sokrat had a family back in Samokov. In 1917, he was hired as a security guard at the 10th Military Hospital, and thus given a service weapon. While working there, he fell in love with one of the hospital orderly - Tinka Nikolova. She was a young and beautiful woman, but also highly religious, and refused Kirshveng's offers for marriage as she knew he was \\"married\\" to Yurdanova. In response to this, the cunning man devised a plan to get rid of his cohort. =Murder of Vangelia Yurdanova= One day, Kirshveng returned home from work, seemingly panicked. He explained to his lover that he had stolen a large sum of money from the hospital, and that his scheme would soon be discovered. Vangelia then offered that both of them flee from the country, and, taking the chance offered, Sokrat accepted. He instructed the woman to write two letters, one to her mother, and one to him. In the former, she explained to her mother that she had stolen 15,000 leva from her lover and had fled to Serbia, while in the latter, Kirshveng had to show it to the authorities and claim that the woman had robbed him. In the meantime, she would actually have to go to Serbia, where she would wait for Sokrat. He had promised her that they would flee together to Dalmatia, where they would live happily, but they first had to retrieve the money, which he said was buried at the cemetery in Malashevtsi. On the night of July 12, 1919, the duo took a shovel and spade and went to the burial spot to dig up the loot. Kirshveng then explained that he was tired from working all day, and asked Vangelia to dig instead. The woman, completely unaware that she was digging her own grave, dug for about an hour before Sokrat, when he decided that the hole was deep enough, took out his service weapon and shot her in the back of the head, burying her body afterwards. The following day, the \\"widower\\" appeared in the hospital with watery eyes, explaining to Nikolova that Vangelia had scammed him and fled with a lover to Serbia. Over the next few days, Kirshveng walked around like an apparition in the facility, constantly repeating \\"Vangelia fled with a lover.\\" This way, he won over Tinka's love, and she agreed to marry him. However, he confessed to her that he had a wife back in Samokov, with whom he hasn't been divorced yet. Instead, he convinced her that his mother was a Muslim, and offered that they both get married by the Turkish mufti in town. Nikolova agreed, and then both of them married, accepting the Islamic faith and renaming themselves Shakir and Aishe. =Murder of Elena Manova= Despite his newfound love, the thought of the wife and children back in Samokov troubled Kirshveng's mind, deciding that he would get rid of her as well. Later that same year, he hired a cart driver named Dimitar Tsvetkov to drive him to Samokov, where he told his family that they were gonna go live with him in the capital. On the way back, near the village of Pancharevo, Sokrat told the driver that he and the wife would go on a walk to a nearby path, and Tsvetkov then took off with the children to the capital. Under the guise of showing her his newly bought cherry garden, he tricked Elena into going towards the bushes, where he killed her using his adze. After a short while, the driver returned, but noticed that Kirshveng was alone. The man then explained that his wife had decided to spontaneously visit some relatives in a nearby village for one or two days. Unsuspecting, the driver believed his story and drove him home, with Sokrat managing to put the bloodied adze in the backside of the cart. When they arrived at their destination, Kirshveng immediately went to the police and blamed Tsvetkov for killing his wife. After the authorities found the bloodied weapon, the court sentenced the innocent cart driver to death and later hanged him. =Attempted murder, arrest and imprisonment= Sokrat then continued to live with Aishe, but soon he got tired of her, and decided to kill her as well. He then took her out on a walk towards a path in Gorna Banya, and when they reached a suitable, isolated place, he began strangling the woman. However, she managed to scream loud enough for people to hear her, and thus, police were summoned, Kirshveng was captured and sentenced to death. However, the judge considered the fact that if the man was executed, his children would become orphans without a dime, and so, his sentence was commuted to 17 years imprisonment. During this time, Sokrat was employed as the prison's lumberjack, and managed to financially support his children this way. =Double murder and second arrest= Kirshveng was released in 1937, but was left penniless. He then visited his aunt Evtimiya, sister of his father, who held a small shop in Sofia's Poduyane district, claiming that he had borrowed 2 leva from her which he wanted to return. The woman took the money, and when she turned to take out some sweets with raspberry flavor to give to Kirshveng's children, he killed her using an axe he had on him. Sokrat then scoured the shop, finding only 20 leva, which didn't satisfy him. Because of this, he went upstairs to his aunt's apartment, but also didn't find any money there. In one of the rooms, Evtimiya's 85-year-old husband, Ivan Zdravkov, was sleeping. Sokrat burst into the room, threatening the old man to give him money or else he would kill him. Zdravkov then took out his wallet and showed that he only 2 leva left. However, Kirshveng noticed that he had a golden pocket watch, an honorary gift from Zdravkov's service as a volunteer during the Battle of Shipka Pass. When the man fought back, he was killed with the axe. The bloodied Sokrat then took the watch and a few other items he thought he could sell, put up a sign saying that the shop wouldn't work for 10 days, and promptly left. One of the regular customers, however, became suspicious, as the shop worked without days off. She contacted the police, who inspected the home and found the two bodies, with no clues to whom the killer might've been. One of the investigators noticed that Zdravkov's pocket watch was missing, and began asking the local watchmakers if there has been anybody who has sold one recently. Eventually, he came across a pawn shop owner who claimed that he had been sold exactly the same type of watch two days ago, \\"probably stolen\\", and gave a description of the man. Kirshveng already had a dossier with pictures of him, and when the investigators showed them to the man, he instantly recognized them. The killer was soon arrested. Trial, sentence and death The trial against the \\"Killer with the Adze\\" began on February 22, 1937. The case brought in a huge crowd of people, eager to see the face of the horrible monster. Kirshveng's attorney was the jurist Milyo \\"The Balm\\" Balsamov, who was famous with going to extreme lengths to pardon every recidivistic criminal. The murderer's confession to the magistrates lasted 3 hours, in which he admitted to being a sadist and requested the harshest penalty for murdering his aunt and his uncle-in-law, saying: Sokrat Kirshveng was sentenced to death by hanging the following day. His attorney, however, hated losing, and appealed the sentence to the Supreme Court of Cassation of Bulgaria. Both the appeal and the request for pardon were subsequently denied. Kirshveng was executed on the night between April 13 to 14, 1937, with his only requests prior being that he was buried a Christian and that his children never learn that he had murdered their mother. After his execution, the guards found a note in his cell, which read: References Category:1882 births Category:1937 deaths Category:Male serial killers Category:Bulgarian serial killers Category:Bulgarian criminals Category:Bulgarian people convicted of murder Category:Executed serial killers Category:People executed by Bulgaria by hanging Category:Executed Bulgarian people Category:20th-century executions by Bulgaria Category:People from Sofia Province Category:Bulgarian people of Romani descent Category:Bulgarian people of Greek descent ","title":"Sokrat Kirshveng"},{"id":"59730095","text":"Vicious Circle is a single British television crime drama film, written by former Tomorrow's World presenter Kieran Prendiville, that first broadcast on BBC1 on 9 February 1999. Based loosely on The General by Irish journalist Paul Williams, and the 1998 film of the same name, Vicious Circle follows notorious Irish criminal Martin Cahill as he undertakes a high stakes jewellery robbery, stealing loot worth more than a million pounds. The film was directed by David Blair. The film was released on DVD via Just Entertainment in the Netherlands in 2004, but this remains the only home video release to date. Production When questioned about the film's similarities to The General and Ordinary Decent Criminal, producer Sue Austen emphasised; \\"Ours isn't just the Martin Cahill story. It's a story about a Dublin gangster coming up against an IRA operative and a policeman, both of whom we've invented, and the three of them constantly circling each other. It doesn't deal with any of the events of his earlier life. We start at the time of the O'Connor's raid, and go straight down the line with an exciting piece of drama. We've compressed the events, going through the whole Kilakee episode, up to his death and our other characters' reaction to it.\\" Reception James Rampton from The Independent gave the film a positive review, writing; \\"Ken Stott has just the right screen presence for the role of Cahill. He brings a sense of wordless menace to the character without making him a cardboard cut-out baddie. He makes Cahill a man who cares deeply for his pigeons and at the same time is capable of cold- bloodedly nailing a traitor's hands to the floor.\\" Cast * Ken Stott as Martin Cahill * Gerard McSorley as Crowley * Andrew Connolly as Detective Declan Finney * John Kavanagh as IRA Chief Charlie Rice * Art Malik as Harrison * Michelle Fairley as Frances * Michael Liebmann as Barry * Norman Rodway as Hagarty * Luke Griffin as Molloy * Cathy White as Tina * Tommy O'Neill as Gene * Pat Ainscough as Arthur * Stuart Dunne as Niall * Owen O'Gorman as Austin * Breffni McKenna as Clive * Pat Kinevane as Pat References External links * Category:BBC television dramas Category:1999 films Category:1999 television films Category:1999 crime drama films Category:British films Category:British television films Category:Television shows set in Ireland Category:English-language television shows Category:1999 drama films Category:British crime drama films ","title":"Vicious Circle (1999 film)"},{"id":"59730102","title":"Mutula Kilonzo Jnr"},{"id":"59730107","text":"Ravija Sandaruwan (born 22 June 1992) is a Kuwaiti cricketer.

It is found only in South Africa where it grows on limestone hills close to the sea on the southern coast. Felicia nordenstamii is a many-branched shrub growing up to tall. The lower parts of the stems are covered in grayish brown bark and the upper stem has many crowded, upwardly angled, alternate leaves with long hairs on the lower surfaces. Large flower heads form at the tips of the branches, each about 4 cm (1 in) across, with about thirty purplish blue ray florets surrounding many yellow disc florets. Description Felicia nordenstamii is a branched shrub of up to high, that is relatively strongly woody at its base. Where it has lost its leaves in lower part of the stem, it is covered with grayish brown bark. In the leaf-covered younger parts, the stem carries long hairs. The leaves are set alternately along the stem, densely crowded, at an upward angle, without a stalk, narrowly inverted egg- shaped, about long and wide, with an entire margin that is somewhat curved upwards, the lower surface with long hairs, and the upper surface hairless. The large flower heads are set individually at the end of flower stalks of up to 1 cm (0.4 in) long, covered in dense long woolly hair. Surrounding each flower head are three to four rows of unruly arranged bracts (or phyllaries) that together form the so-called involucre, which is up to in diameter. These bracts are lance-shaped, about wide, and of varying length. The outer bracts are long-haired, about long, the inner eventually hairless, about long. Approximately thirty female ray florets, have purplish blue straps of about 15 mm (0.6 in) long and 2 mm (0.08 in) wide, and are hairy in the upper part of the tubular section at its base. These surround numerous bisexual disc florets with a yellow corolla of about long, hairy in the middle part. In the center of each corolla are five anthers merged into a tube, through which the style grows when the floret opens, hoovering up the pollen on its shaft. At the tip of both style branches is a narrowly triangular appendage. Surrounding the base of the corolla are many, yellowish white, serrated, more or less deciduous pappus bristles, all about equal in length at . The eventually yellowish brown to reddish, dry, one-seeded, indehiscent fruits called cypsellae are elliptic in outline, about long and wide, with a ridge along the margin. The cypselae of the ray florets are hairless, those of the disc florets short-haired. Flowering occurs from September to October. =Differences with related species= Like Felicia echinata and F. westae, together with which F. nordenstamii constitutes the section Anhebecarpaea, it has firm, very regularly and densely set leaves on the younger parts of the stems, distinguishing them from all other Felicia species. The dense, long and woolly hairs, the long inner involucral bracts, and the narrowly obovate leaves set at an upward angle, set it apart from F. echinata (recurved narrowly ovate leaves) and F. westae (line- to lance-shaped leaves, pressed against the stem, hairless except for a fringe). It also has a likeness to Polyarrhena imbricata, which lacks the woolly hairs, large involucral bracts, and has white ray florets, tinged purple on the underside. Taxonomy As far as known, Felicia nordenstamii was first collected just east of Cape Agulhas by Terence Macleane Salter in 1934. It was recognized as a distinct species by in his 1973 Revision of the genus Felicia (Asteraceae). The species is considered to be part of the section Anhebecarpaea. The species was named in honor of Rune Bertil Nordenstam, a Swedish botanist that collected two specimens of this plant in 1962.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  Felicia nordenstamii is only known from limestone ridges just east of Cape Agulhas and near the Potberg.  Conservation  Felicia nordenstamii is considered near threatened. It grows only at about fifteen locations spread over and area of about . A substantial part of its habitat was lost over due to urban expansion around Struisbaai. It grows on several limestone ridges that have been identified for development. Its habitat is also degraded over its entire range because of invasive Acacia species.

It set several national records, using ridge lift rather than thermal soaring. Design and development thumb The Gy√∂ngy√∂s 33 was the first Hungarian designed sailplane and was named after its place and year of manufacture. It was designed by Zolt√°n Janka and built in the MOVERO (Aviation Section of Hungarian National Defence Association) workshops at Gy√∂ngy√∂s. His design target was to produce an aircraft that would out-perform the 1928 RRG Professor. It was an all wood monoplane with a two-part wing built around a forward main spar and a rear false spar. The inner area of each part was rectangular in plan, tapering strongly outboard. The leading edges ahead of the main spar were plywood-covered, as was the whole wing at the inner-outer junction; the rest was fabric-covered. An aileron filled the whole trailing edge of each outer section. The two parts joined at a narrow centre- section on a raised fuselage pylon and were braced on each side with a V-strut from the fuselage bottom to the wing spars at the inner-outer junctions. The Gy√∂ngy√∂s 33's six-sided fuselage was formed by a wooden frame and was plywood- covered. The pilot had an open cockpit ahead of the wing leading edge with the wing pylon immediately behind him. A rubber-sprung landing skid below him ran from the nose almost to the trailing edge. The fuselage tapered rearwards to a cantilever empennage. The fin was small and ply-covered with a tall rudder which, like the all-moving tailplane apart from its leading edge, was fabric covered. Operational history The first flight took place on 11 June 1933. A fortnight later the Gy√∂ngy√∂s 33 slope-soared for 5 h 43 m, gaining of altitude, a Hungarian record. On 27 June it set a national duration record of 10 h 7 m. In 1934 it made a flight. The Gy√∂ngy√∂s 33 is now on display in the Hungarian Technical and Transportation Museum, Budapest.

The church was designed by the prominent Piedmontese architect Bernardo Vittone, and completed in 1749. History and Description Main altar of church The church was commissioned from the architect Vittone by the Conte Carlo Giacinto della Rovere. It was built at the site of a chapel built in 1442 by an order of Dominican nuns attached to the Blessed Margaret of Savoy. The brick facade remains unfinished, but the pattern of concave and convex strips is characteristic of late-baroque architecture. On the portal are three carved arrows, a symbol of Margherita. The plain exterior does not resemble the refined and colorful interior. The portal are immediately leads to a generally-rectangular nave area, surrounded by elegant corinthian columns, with an oval dome. The dome frescoes depict the Exaltation of the Blessed Margherita of Savoy, painted 1747-1750 by Michele Antonio Milocco. The polychrome marble altar on the left holds a silver and gilded coffin (1840) with the relics of the blessed nun. On the right is the altar dedicated to St Rose of Lima, also a Dominican nun. The main altar has an altarpiece depicting St Mary Magdalen (1825) by Giovanni Battista Biscarra. Atop two Solomonic columns are heraldic shields of the House of Savoy; these were sculpted in 1689 and 1691 for the altar present in the church located here prior to the present Vittone church. Behind the presbytery is an oak wood-paneled choir area, once reserved for the nuns. It is roofed with a barrel vault, frescoed with tromp l'oeil quadratura (1734) by Giacomo Rapa. Among the other decorations in the church is a 16th-century crucifix and a bust of Christ sculpted by Pietro Canonica.Citta e Cattedrali Piemonte e Valle D'Aosta website.Association of Cultural Promotion associated with guides to Museo Federico Eusebio di Alba References  External links  Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1793 Category:18th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:Churches in the province of Cuneo Category:Bernardo Antonio Vittone buildings Category:Baroque architecture in Piedmont Category:Church buildings with domes ","title":"Santa Maria Maddalena, Alba"},{"id":"59730228","text":"On 21 January 2019, in central Afghanistan, the Taliban attacked a military compound in Maidan Shar, killing officers of the Afghan National Directorate of Security. The Taliban attacked while engaging in the process of negotiating a truce with the United States. The attack began when an explosives-laden car rammed through a military checkpoint and onto the grounds of the compound, where the vehicle detonated. After the explosion, two gunmen entered the base and opened fire on Afghan soldiers, before the two were shot down. A senior official in the Afghan defense ministry said that 126 people were killed in the explosion. The Taliban claimed responsibility and stated that over 190 people were killed in the attack. The Afghan National Directorate of Security (NDS) reported that 36 military personnel were killed in the attack. Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack and said that the 'Afghan intelligence agency personnel were target of the attack'. Attack The attackers rammed a vehicle filled with explosives through a military checkpoint and detonated it in the camp of the National Directorate of Security (NDS) forces training center in Maidan Shar, the capital of Maidan Wardak Province. Following the explosion, two to five Taliban gunmen entered the campus and shot at Afghan soldiers before being fatally shot during the clashes. According to the Defence ministry officials, the Taliban used a Humvee vehicle which they had taken from government forces to house the bomb. Wardak provincial council member, Abdul Wahid Akbarzai, claimed that the attackers had dressed in Afghan special forces uniform. The attack took place on the same day when Taliban representatives met Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. special envoy for Afghan peace talks, in Qatar. Sharif Hotak, a member of the provincial council in Maidan Wardak, said, \\"the explosion was very powerful. The whole building has collapsed.\\" Casualties Local officials said that no official confirmation regarding the casualty toll of troops and NDS personnel had been made, adding that officials said not to discuss the figure with the media due to the fear of damaging morale. NDS reports showed 36 killed and 58 injured. Mohammad Sardar Bakhyari, deputy head of the provincial council stated at least 65 were killed in the military base. Another source in Maidan Wardak Province reported that more than 100 members of NDS were killed in the attack. Sharif Hotak said \\"many more were killed\\" and he saw bodies of 35 Afghan soldiers in the hospital. Hotak asserted that the government was hiding the casualty figures. Khawanin Sultani, a provincial council member, said the attack left over 70 wounded. Zabiullah Mujahid, spokesman of Taliban insurgents, claimed 190 people were killed in the attack. Reactions President Ashraf Ghani's office called the attackers \\"enemies of the country\\" and said that \\"they killed and wounded a number of our beloved and honest sons\\". Bahram Ghasemi, a representative of Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, condemned the attack and expressed sympathy for the victims' families. The Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, expressed condolences to the families affected by the attack. Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, President of Turkey, condemned the attack and expressed his condolences to Ghani. The U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan condemned the attack and said \\"the United States stands with the people of Afghanistan, who seek a peaceful future and an end to the violence\\". Public uprising force Afghan security officials claimed that the base, where the attack took place, was run by Afghan National Directorate of Security (NDS) to train 'public uprising forces', a pro-government militia. They claimed that the many men who were killed in the attack were members of the militia who they had been training. In the past, Afghan security officials have denied any relation with such militia and claimed that those militia are organic movements of locals who are staging 'uprising' against the Taliban. So for the first time, Afghan security officials acknowledged that they are supporting public uprising forces. Sharifullah Hotak, a member of Wardak provincial council, claimed that the base was used by NDS to train and equip members of public uprising forces. However, Afghan security officials claims were contradicted by Ghani, who claimed that only National Directorate of Security personnel were the target of the attack. Aftermath On January 23, NDS said they killed the attack organiser along with seven militants in an airstrike. The Taliban rejected the NDS statement, describing it as \\"propaganda\\". Similarly, residents and local officials in the areas also contradicted Afghan security officials claims. Sharifullah Hotak, member of Wardak provincial council, claim that 6 civilians were killed in the airstrike.

The settlement was then called Slavo-Serbia. Slavo-Serbia was directly governed by Russia's Governing Senate and College of War. The settlers eventually formed the Bakhmut hussar regiment in 1764. Also in 1764, Slavo-Serbia was transformed into the Donets uyezd of Yekaterinoslav Governorate (now in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Ukraine). Commandants of Slavo-Serbia were Colonels Rajko Preradoviƒá and Jovan ≈†eviƒá. These Serbian colonels led their soldiers in various Russian military campaigns; in peacetime, they kept the borderlands, along with the Cossacks, free from incursions by other states. Biography Rajko Preradoviƒá's ancestors first settled in an area around Grubi≈°no Polje, some 30 kilometers south-east of Bjelovar in Habsburg Military Frontier. Son of Grenz infantry officer Stepan Depreradoviƒá, Rajko followed his family's military tradition and joined the Military Frontier as a young man. His family were given Habsburg nobility in the seventeenth century for their military service to the crown and began using the Nobiliary particle. He became a Pomori≈°je border lieutenant colonel before heading one of two convoys of colonists in Imperial Russia in 1752. The other convoy was headed by Jovan ≈†eviƒá. Rajko (Rodion) Stepanovich Depreradoviƒá arrived with his family and began to build and develop the homesteads in their new homeland. Three of his sons and their children and relatives, all achieved prominence in the Russian military. Family History The Preradoviƒái hail from Old Serbia, from where they settled the Kingdom of Hungary. Jovan Preradoviƒá from Baƒçka received Hungarian noble status in 1626. The nobility status was confirmed in 1667 for Jovan's son, Ivan. A Preradoviƒá family moved from Poƒçitelj, ƒåapljina in Bosnia and Herzegovina to Donja Krajina (modern Bjelovar-Kri≈æevci County) in 1750. Lieutenant Colonel Rajko Preradoviƒá from Baƒçka brought the first group of Serbs from Potisje to Russia in 1751. The Preradoviƒá family was one of several families that had settled Slavo-Serbia. The Preradoviƒá family in Hungary were kin to the Preradoviƒá family in the Military Frontier. The Preradoviƒá family in the Tisa Military Frontier received nobility status in 1704. General and poet Petar Preradoviƒá belonged to this family.

By 2010, he was assigned as the assistant deputy for national borders, and in 2015, he was selected as the director-general for regional autonomy. As director-general, Sumarsono was appointed as acting governor of North Sulawesi on 22 September 2015. As he was approaching his retirement, he was discharged from his post as director general in March 2019. =Jakarta= Due to both the sitting governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (Ahok) and his deputy Djarot Saiful Hidayat taking a campaign leave for the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election, Sumarsono was sworn in as acting governor on 26 October 2016. During his time as governor, Sumarsono restored several former high-ranking city officials who were demoted under Ahok, to the latter's criticism. Sumarsono also stopped benefits to the RT/RW of the city and soldiers and police officers stationed there, though Sumarsono reintroduced funding for Betawi groups. Ahok returned to office on 11 February 2017. Due to a runoff phase in the gubernatorial election, Sumarsono once again became acting governor on 6 March 2017. Ahok once more returned to office on 15 April 2017. =South Sulawesi= Sumarsono was assigned to another acting governor post due to the expiry of South Sulawesi governor Syahrul Yasin Limpo's term, serving until the elected governor from the 2018 South Sulawesi gubernatorial election could be sworn in. He criticized Makassar mayor Mohammad Ramdhan Pomanto's celebration of a blank box win at the 2018 Makassar mayoral election, noting that a public official should refrain from such actions. He was replaced by elected governor Nurdin Abdullah on 7 September 2018.

Biography  =Early life= He was born in Grossverdein to Rabbi Chaim Meir Hager (1888‚Äî1972), later the Vizhnitz Rebbe, and Margalia, the daughter of Rabbi Ze'ev Twersky, the Admor of Rachmastrivka. From his childhood, he followed his grandfather, the Admor Rabbi Yisroel Hager (Ahavat Yisrael). At the age of 18 he went to study for a short period with Rebbe Yoel of Satmar. Reb Mottele also learned in Pupa under the late Pupa Rebbe. He married Figa Malka, the daughter of Rabbi Yaakov Yosef Twersky, Zt\\"l (1899‚Äî1968), late Skverer Rebbe. After she died without children, he married her younger sister Sima Mirel and together they had 14 children, 8 sons and 6 daughters. =After World War II= After the Holocaust, on the 29th of Adar 5708 (1948), he arrived in the United States with his father-in-law and began serving as a rabbi of Vizhnitz Hassidim in the United States, first in Boro Park and later in Williamsburg. =Monsey= After a short while, he announced that he did not want to live in the crowded city and moved to Monsey. After his father's death in 1972, his two sons were appointed as Admors of Vizhnitz as well, Rabbi Moshe Yehoshua Hager as Rebbe in Israel, and Rabbi Mordechai as Rebbe in the United States. He established the Kaser village in Monsey in 1990 so it could build denser housing.Berger, Joseph. \\"Growing Pains for a Rural Hasidic Enclave.\\" The New York Times. January 13, 1997. He met with US President Jimmy Carter together with Rabbis Shlomo of Bobov and Moshe of Satmar. At the time of his death, he was the oldest Hasidic rabbi in the world. He was known for his devotion to learning Torah: he studied 18 hours a day and asked his Chasidim to study at least two hours every day. He had about 30,000 followers internationally. During the last months of his life he was hospitalized at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, where he died on March 16, 2018 (29 Adar 5778).http://hamodia.com/2018/03/16/vizhnitzer-rebbe-harav-mordechai-hager/ His funeral left the central Beit Midrash of his Hasidic sect in Monsey, \\"Levush Mordechai,\\" on the eve of the Sabbath, and tens of thousands participated. During the funeral 72 US Dollars was distributed, according to his will to every Torah student who studied in the kollel, and his followers were asked to learn a Gemara page every day during the year (and the children a Mishnah).

During Seudah shlishit he used to protest against loopholes in religion. He had forbidden his followers to carry on Shabbos in Boro Park and Williamsburg, despite the Hechsher given to the local Eiruv by some of the city's rabbis. He would object to eating ice cream at the end of the meal, due to halakhic doubts regarding the laws of the brokhoys before enjoyment, and also for the purpose of celibacy of the pleasures of this world which is worthy of the servant of God, as he has clarified several times. He would object to being photographed, and even appealed to the editorial offices of the Haredi newspapers not to publish his pictures. In addition to keeping a very strictly kosher diet, he was personally a pescatarian ovo-lacto-vegetarian, although he never expressed the main reason for this practice, and did not encourage others to follow his example. Family His wife died about a decade before him. After his death, his seven sons and one grandson (eldest son of his eldest son who had died before him) were appointed to succeed him as rabbis in their respective communities. * Rabbi Pinchas Shalom (died 17 Sivan 5775 (2015) at age 67), rabbi of Torat Chaim Vizhnitz in Boro Park, was married to Zisel Reizel, daughter of Rebbe Shmuel Zvi Horowitz of Spinka. ** Rabbi Yaakov Yosef Hager, eldest son of Rabbi Pinchas Shalom, succeeded Rabbi Pinchas Shalom as Rabbi of Vizhnitz in Boro Park, and after Rabbi Mordechai's death, was appointed Rebbe of Vizhnitz in Boro Park.

Some of these have been charitable groups, or regular and annual events, and the scope of these efforts have continued to grow, with more than having been raised by video game-related charity efforts in the first half of 2018 alone.  Organizations and events  = Child's Play = The creators of the Penny Arcade webcomic, Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik, established the Child's Play charity in 2003 following a string of mass media stories that attempted to portray video games in a negative light. The charity was designed to provide toys and video game systems and games to various children's hospitals in the United States, though both monetary and physical donations. By 2017, Child's Play had raised over through both cash donations and donated items. = Extra Life = Extra Life is an annual charity fund-raising event to support the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. The event was started in 2008 to honor Victoria , a teenager who died of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. While gamers accept funds for Extra Life throughout the year, the event encourages streamers to play video games for twenty-four hours straight via Twitch or other streaming services over a specific weekend in November, and collect additional donations from their viewers. In 2017, over 50,000 streamers helped to raise over for the hospitals. = Desert Bus For Hope = The comedy group LoadingReadyRun ran a Child's Play event in 2007 by marathon-playing the game Desert Bus, a game created by Penn & Teller, in which the player must drive a bus on a desolate stretch of highway from Tucson to Las Vegas, roughly eight hours of continuous gameplay, with little challenge outside of player fatigue. The event was successful, in part due to recognition from Penn & Teller, and eventually spun out into its own annual \\"Desert Bus for Hope\\" event. During the stream, broadcast over Twitch and other streaming sites, viewers can donate to get virtual time behind the bus's wheel, as well as participate in various auctions. The 2018 event raised over for Child's Play, with total accumulated donations exceeding . = Games Done Quick = Games Done Quick was launched in 2010, inspired by the Desert Bus for Hope, with the idea that invited participants speedrun numerous games over the course of the event, typically five to six days, usually with commentary over the course of the games. During semi-annual event, the speedruns are performed live in front of an audience and broadcast to Twitch and other services, with viewers able to donate during the length of the event. There has also been shorter one-off special Games Done Quick events for specific occasions, such as one to support the victims of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. As of January 21, 2019, Games Done Quick has raised over to various charities, including Prevent Cancer Foundation in its winter events and Doctors Without Borders in its summer events. = Humble Bundle = Humble Bundle was initially launched by Wolfire Games in 2010 as a series of game bundles, most frequently indie games, offered at a pay-what-you-want price, with all but a few dollars of each sale going to a designated charity. As the bundles became more successful, Humble Bundle's approach expanded to include other bundles, such as mobile games, console games, and digital books, as well as establishing its own company, created publishing support for indie games and establishing a dedicated storefront, where a portion of each purchase goes to a selected charity. By 2017, the various activities of Humble Bundle have raised over across 50 different charities, including Action Against Hunger, Child's Play, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, charity: water, the American Red Cross, WaterAid and the Wikimedia Foundation.  Notable one-off efforts  = Pink Overwatch Mercy skin = During May 2018, to support the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, Blizzard Entertainment offered a limited time character customization skin for the Overwatch character Mercy that reflected the pink colors of breast cancer awareness, with all revenue from the sale of the skin going to the Foundation. By the end of the sale, Blizzard had raised over , which at the time, was the largest single donation that the Foundation had seen. = 2018 E3 Fortnite Pro-Am = Epic Games ran a celebrity Fortnite Battle Royale pro-am during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018 in June 2018, which paired 50 popular streams with 50 celebrities, with an overall prize pool to be given to the winners in the names of their desired charities. = H.Bomberguy's stream for Mermaids = In January 2019, streamer Harry Brewis aka \\"hbomberguy\\" ran a marathon stream to beat Donkey Kong 64 and raise money for Mermaids, a British charity for transgender youth. The stream began following comments made by Graham Linehan which Brewis considered transphobic, and whilst potential funding of Mermaids by the British National Lottery was under review. Word of mouth about the stream quickly spread and several notable pro-trans supporters briefly joined his stream, including John Romero, Chelsea Manning, and U.S. congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Brewis finished the marathon after 57 hours, having raised over (¬£265,000) for Mermaids, with 659,000 viewers having watched the stream.

They are a class of protein with a single protein domain that are related to multidomain proteins. Microproteins regulate larger multidomain proteins at the post-translational level. Microproteins are analogous to microRNAs (miRNAs) and heterodimerize with their targets causing dominant and negative effects. In animals and plants, microproteins have been found to greatly influence biological processes. Because of microproteins' dominant effects on their targets, microproteins are currently being studied for potential applications in biotechnology.  History  The first microprotein (miP) discovered was during a research in the early 1990s on genes for basic helix‚Äìloop‚Äìhelix (bHLH) transcription factors from a murine erythroleukaemia cell cDNA library. The protein was found to be an inhibitor of DNA binding (Id), and it negatively regulate transcription factor complex. The Id protein was 16 kDa and consisted of a helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain. The microprotein formed bHLH/HLH heterodimers which disrupted the functional basic helix‚Äìloop‚Äìhelix (bHLH) homodimers. The first microprotein discovered in plants was the LITTLE ZIPPER (ZPR) protein. The LTTLE ZIPPPER protein contains a leucine zipper domain but does not have the domains required for DNA binding and transcription activation. Thus, LITTLE ZIPPER protein is analogous to the Id protein. Despite not all proteins being small, in 2011, this class of protein was given the named microproteins because their negative regulatory actions are similar to those of miRNAs. Evolutionary, the Id protein or proteins similar to Id are found in all animals. In plants, microproteins are only found in higher order. However, the homeodomain transcription factors that belong to the three-amino-acid loop-extension (TALE) family are targets of microproteins, and this homeodomain proteins are conserved in animals, plants, and fungi.  Structure  Microproteins are generally small proteins with a single protein domain. The active form of microproteins are translated from smORF. The smORF codons which microproteins are translated from can be less than 100 codons. However, not all microproteins are small, and the name was given because their actions are analogous to miRNAs.  Function  The function of microproteins is post-translational regulators. Microproteins disrupt the formation of heterodimeric, homodimeric, or multimeric complexes. Furthermore, microproteins can interact with any protein that require functional dimers to function normally. The primary targets of microproteins are transcription factors that bind to DNA as dimers. Microproteins regulate these complexes by creating homotypic dimers with the targets and inhibit protein complex function. There are two types of miP inhibitions: homotypic miP inhibition and heterotypic miP inhibition. In homotypic miP inhibition, microproteins interact with proteins with similar protein-protein interaction (PPI) domain.

Retrieved January 21st, 2019. = Research on productivity growth, technology and innovation= In early work on productivity growth, Amable argues that countries require \\"social capabilities\\" to leverage their technological backwardness into catch-up growth, finding - contrary to most growth models - divergence between countries' productivity levels over 1960-85.Amable, B. (1993). Catch-up and convergence: a model of cumulative growth. International Review of Applied Economics, 7(1), pp. 1-25. In later research, Amable further finds productivity growth to increase in inter- industry specialization and specialization in electronics.Amable, B. (2000). International specialisation and growth. Structural Change and Dynamics, 11(4), pp. 413-431. In further research on the role of technology for economic development, Amable and Bart Verspagen find that technological advantage, as measured by patent counts and investment, significantly affects long-run price competitiveness.Amable, B., Verspagen, B. (1995). The role of technology in market shares dynamics. Applied Economics, 27(2), pp. 197-204. With regard to innovation, in work co-authored with R√©mi Barr√© and Robert Bayer, Amable makes the case for a richer perspective on innovation systems than the one provided by Keynesian, monetarist or Schumpeterian theories of innovation, as these fail to adequately account for the key roles of organization types, institutions, labour supply and attitudes and their mediation by globalization, claiming that mixed economies outperform both command and free market ones in terms of innovation and competitiveness.[Amable, B., Barr√©, R., Boyer, R. (1997). Les syst√®mes d'innovation √† l'√®re de la globalisation. Paris: Economica.] Relatedly, he has also highlighted the role played by institutional complementarity and hierarchy for the co-existence of diverse social systems of innovation and production.Amable, B. (2000). Institutional complementarity and diversity of social systems of innovation and production. Review of International Political Economy, 7(4), pp. 645-687.Crouch, C. et al. (2005). Dialogue on 'Institutional complementarity and political economy'. Socio-Economic Review, 3(2), pp. 359-382. = Research on capitalism and neoliberalism= This perspective - that economies may grow substantially and sustainably despite large differences in institutions - is also present in Amable's research on capitalism. Notably, in The Diversity of Capitalism, Amable explains how institutions - far from being irrelevant for economic development - may keep economies from converging towards a unique economic model.Amable, B. (2003). The Diversity of Modern Capitalism. Oxford: Oxford University Press. He further offers a typology of capitalisms, distinguishing between (i) the neoliberal model, (ii) the continental European model, (iii) the social democrat model, (iv) the \\"Mediterranean\\" model\\" and (v) the Asian model of capitalism. Amable has been critical of political efforts to force countries to converge towards a single economic model (typically the neoliberal one), arguing that ongoing differences between developed countries in terms of financial systems, social protection, industrial relations, labour markets and education systems strongly suggest that a common economic system would be both inadequate and undesirable in the face of such diversity, and is bound to be opposed by populations.Amable, B. (2005). Les cinq capitalismes. Diversit√© des syst√®mes √©conomiques et sociaux dans la mondialisation. Paris: √âditions Seuil. In another study of capitalism, Amable argues that neo-liberal politics is driven by a moral imperative of competition, leading to a replacement of the \\"old\\" social contract of collective rights to social protection and redistribution by a new one based on reciprocity between the individual and society, with important implications for e.g. the emergence of the \\"modern\\" left.Amable, B. (2011). Morals and politics in the ideology of neo-liberalism. Socio-Economic Review, 9(1), pp. 3-30. More recently, taking a neorealist approach, Amable (with Stefano Palombarini) has theorized how types of institutional change and their timing may depend on the interplay between political strategies and demands for institutional change.Amable, B., Palombarini, S. (2009). A neorealist approach to institutional change and the diversity of capitalism. Socio-Economic Review, 7(1), pp. 123-143.  Bibliography * Amable, B., Barr√©, R., Boyer, R. (1997).

Genesis and history  The Cafe Table is founded in 2016 by Avishek Aich and Arijit Bhadra. It all began in January 2016 when the idea of turning hidden thoughts into tangible treasures like books sparked in The Cafe Table team. Their journey has started in July 2016 by publishing Nunete Vatete (Bengali: ‡¶®‡ßÅ‡¶®‡ßá‡¶§‡ßá ‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶§‡ßá‡¶§‡ßá ), a book about the food heritage and culture of the Indian subcontinent, edited by Ramkrishna Bhattacharya Sannyal and Anarja Tapas. Since then, The Cafe Table has become a platform that has witnessed several known and unknown authors get their scripts published. Followed by Shanto, Market Visit, Ekenbabu Somogro 1, at the end of 2018, only in the time span of two and half year The Cafe Table have 100 titles in their credit, which makes it one of the leading New Publishers in College Street.  Logo, mascot and official song  The Cafe Table is regarded to be the 1st publishers in Bengali book publishing industry to have a mascot. Coco, the official mascot of cafe table is created by Sourav Bera. Not only that, they are also the 1st one publishers to have an official song. The song \\"Jite Nebe Dil\\" is written and composed by Hridoybari band. An official music video of the song was launched on YouTube on 30 January 2018. The logo of The cafe table is designed by Avishek Aich.  Vision  According to the team Cafe Table:  Publishing career  In their 1st year of publishing, The Cafe Table mainly focused in bringing the good quality social media (Mostly Facebook) Bengali literary content to mainstream publication. To fulfill this goal, they worked in four major books; Shanto (Written by Raja Bhattacharya), Market Visit (Written by Avik Sarkar), Alpote Golpo (written by Ramkrishna Bhattacharya Sannyal), Sierra Leone Shihoron (written by Bivas Raychaudhuri). Shanto and Market visit became best sellers in 2017 Kolkata International book fair. But they change their vision in after the book-fair. Alongside with social media content, they have worked with several renowned author of contemporary Bengali literature, resulted in the publication of Gol Golpo Chouko Golpo (The 1st published collection of stories of renowned Author Sourav Mukhopadhyay), Kissawala (Collection of 40 stories written by Saikat Mukhopadhyay), Dhorshoner Athero Din Por (18 days after the rape; written by Debotosh Dash), Rupkothar Jonmodin, EK Bishwasghatoker Kahini and many others. They tied up with Ghoraddim magazine as publishers, which produced two issues. Although the tie-up broke and in 2018, The Cafe Table published their own magazine \\"Hattimatim\\" (Sharodiya). They have re-published Ekjon Sub Editorer kotipoy Chenrakhora din (Written by Rubayt Ahamed) and Das Partyr Khonje (Written by Hasan Murshed) as a tie up project with Bangladesh. The cafe Table has tied up with internationally famous publishing house like Penguin Random House and Scholastic Inc for their new upcoming project Eke Chandra Duie Rokto (The Bengali translation of Rahul Pandita's national bestseller Our moon has blood clots) and Nagrajer Guptokotha (The Bengali translation of Sayntani Dasgupta's Kiranmala and the Kingdom Beyond #1: The Serpent's Secret).

While in orbit, the system separates onboard water into hydrogen and oxygen propellants by applying an electric current through the water. PTD-1 is scheduled for launch in December 2020 as part of the ride-share ELaNa mission 35 on board a Falcon 9 rocket. = Propulsion = Diagram showing the overall chemical equation. HYDROS is a hybrid chemical/electrical technology to provide propulsion using water. It uses an electrolysis cell to split water propellant into gaseous hydrogen and oxygen that are stored under pressure in separate tanks. The system then burns the hydrogen and oxygen mix in a simple thruster nozzle to provide up to 1 Newton and a specific impulse of 258 seconds. This propulsion system is being developed by Tethers Unlimited, Inc. In pure water, at the negatively charged cathode, a reduction reaction takes place, with electrons (e‚àí) from the cathode being given to hydrogen cations to form hydrogen gas. The half reaction, balanced with acid, is: :Reduction at cathode: 2 H+ (Aqueous solution) + 2e‚àí ‚Üí H2 (gas) At the positively charged anode, an oxidation reaction occurs, generating oxygen gas and giving electrons to the anode to complete the circuit: :Oxidation at anode: 2 H2O (liquid) ‚Üí O2 (gas) + 4 H+ (aqueous solution) + 4e‚àí :Overall reaction: 2 H2O (liquid) ‚Üí 2 H2 (gas) + O2 (gas) The propulsion system uses the electricity generated by the solar arrays to power the miniature water electrolysis.

Women in medieval pharmacy Apothecary is one term for a medical professional who formulates and dispenses materia medica to physicians, surgeons, and patients; the modern pharmacist has taken over this role. Throughout medieval times, apothecaries were not trained in universities as physicians were. More often, they were trained through guilds, and apprenticeship. Apothecary businesses were typically family-run, and wives or other women of the family worked alongside their husbands in the shops, learning the trade themselves. Women were still not allowed to train and be educated in universities so this allowed them a chance to be trained in medical knowledge and healing. Previously, women had some influence in other women's healthcare, such as serving as midwives and other feminine care in a setting that was not considered appropriate for males. Though physicians gave medical advice, they did not make medicine, so they typically sent their patients to particular independent apothecaries, who did also provide some medical advice in particular remedies and healing. Women in modern pharmacy The National Association of Women Pharmacists was founded in London on 15 June 1905, following discussions between Margaret Elizabeth Buchanan and Isabella Skinner Clarke. Early meetings were held at Clarke's home. Membership was restricted to those who had passed the major or minor examination and 50 women joined immediately. By 1912 Buchanan claimed that practically all women practicing pharmacy were members.

JMEV is focused on the development and production of electric cars and was established in 2015 as a subsidiary of JMCG. It was reorganised as a joint venture in July 2019, after Renault acquired a majority stake. History In 2014, Jiangling Motors announced the creation of a branch centred on electric cars. On 15 January 2015, Jiangling Motors Corporation Group established a new subsidiary called JMEV. The first car produced by JMEV, the E100, entered production at a Nanchang plant that same year. In 2016, the company opened an electric vehicle test and development centre and started production of a new car, the E200. That year, it got certifications from the government to produce electric cars. In 2017, the company launched two models: the E160 and E200S. It also got permission to produce and sell cars independently of JMCG. In April 2018, the company began building a new production base at Kunming with the capacity to assemble up to 100,000 cars per year. That year, JMEV launched the E400. In October 2019, the Kunming plant started producing EX5s. In December 2018, French manufacturer Renault announced it would acquire a \\"significant\\" JMEV stake. In July 2019, Renault completed the acquisition of a 50% JMEV stake through capital increase while JMCG and China Agricultural Development Construction Fund Corporation kept a 37% and 13% respectively. The company was reorganised as a joint venture. Models =E100= The E100, a hatchback, has a length of and a wheelbase of . The car has a 104 Ah lithium-ion battery pack. The motor delivers up to .

Cerata are important in this clade in terms of their physical defense and efficient metabolic processes.This species is spread sporadically along tropical coastal regions such as Australia, Hawaii, and the Indo-Pacific living in diverse marine habitats such as coral reefs. Unlike other species in the Opisthobranch Mollusca clade, P. poindimiei‚Äôs lush pink cerata are used for defensive purposes other than Nematocyst (dinoflagellate) capture and toxin release. Organismal ties within these thriving, tropical ecosystems can be determinants of environment change, which affects massive coral ecosystems. Continuously changing marine ecosystems, such as coral reefs, are directly linked to the evolution of organisms that live and thrive in the tropics such as the soft nudibrach P. poindimiei.  Evolution and description  Phyllodesmium poindimiei is shown to have translucent pink cerata lining the aboral surface and two pairs of olfactory tentacles with an eye at each base. This monophyletic clade of mollusks were prosobranchs that eventually rid themselves of an exoskeleton. Elongated metazoans will lengthen themselves out to about 50 mm at longest. P. poindimiei typically has two pairs of tentacles with a built in olfactory system containing an eye at each base. The soft shell-less slug has cerata outgrowths on its upper side filled with the organism‚Äôs respiratory and digestive systems and can be cast off for protective purposes. These cylindrical gill cavities typically have two main defenses resulting from nematocyst or zooxanthellae obtainment. These translucent cerata for most Phyllodesmium contain cnidosacs at the tips in which nudibranchs digest nematocysts from Cnidarian prey, such as jellyfish or corals. P. poindimiei lack these cnidosacs that could be used for its own defense against the swimming crab Thalamita integer. Another modification this species lacks is the ability to accumulate zooxanthellae, microscopic photosynthetic dinoflagellates, in the branched digestive tract. The non-symbiotic species such as P. poindimiei were thought to have evolved earlier than the symbiotic clades. Diet and growth P. poindimiei live up to twelve months and develop from an egg to a free-swimming veliger larva. They feed on Telesto, Caridoa, and other Alcyonaceans with very small radula. Members of the Porifera phyla, sponges, act as epibiont on sediment or ectozoans on organisms, such as Octocorallia. Excess spongiform growth thereby prevents this Aeolid from consuming octocoral, a common prey for P. poindimiei which can become a problem for these picky eaters. Ecology and conservation Heterobranchs range from aquatic to terrestrial environments but P. poindimiei specifically tends to surround itself with other multicellular organisms in tropical sessile environments such as diverse coral reefs. Many of the tropical locations where P. poindimiei reside are climate change research biotopes. Environment change is ideally studied using these animals because of their prompt life span and revival linkage to a diverse habitat sensitive to oceanic temperature change that could potentially cause coral bleaching. Most species of Phyllodesmium are found along the coastline of Australia, Hawaii, and the Indo-Pacific regions. Coastal channels and estuaries allow for ample shelter for these marine gastropod nudibranchs.

It is the oldest fanfare of the militia in uninterrupted service in Canada. Like the Band and Bugles of The Rifles, the QOR band employed bugles at its front, as a testament to the fact that those instruments were used to give orders on the battlefield during the conflicts of the 18th century. It is currently one of only several drum and bugle corps in the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) in service.http://www.dcxmuseum.org/assets/15%2520-%2520Canadian%2520Military%2520Drum%2520and%2520Bugle%2520Corps.pdf&ved;=2ahUKEwjEyq3ThP7fAhUR2qwKHRKFCnEQFjAfegQIBhAB&usg;=AOvVaw2p9l-GZYX4FDm3EkT4dJFS http://www.middlehornleader.com/Evolution%20of%20the%20Bugle%20--%20Section%202.htm  History  The band was formed in Toronto in 1862 under the direction of Adam Maul, an Englishman who had served in the British Army. The band, at that point, was one of many regiment bands in the Dominion and was not very different from its counterparts. Under the leadership of John Bayley beginning in the mid to late 1870s, the band quickly gained international recognition, especially in the United States. The band toured Canada from east to west for the rest of the century and even made a visit to London in 1910 under the direction of G. L. Timpson. In 1922 and 1923 the band won the First Class 'A' band contest at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto. During that time it also assisted the 2,300-member Canadian National Exhibition Chorus in performances at the Central Coliseum. During World War II, director James Buckle maintained the band with great efficiency, performing at concerts for Canadian soldiers throughout Europe. After the war, Captain William T. Atkins was appointed as band director. Serving for 21 years in the band, he organized the band into a first-class musical ensemble which performed often at the Royal Winter Fair and for hockey nights at Maple Leaf Gardens. During the 1980s and early 1990s the band, with an increasing number of women members, was one of the more active units in the Toronto Garrison, performing in parks, at the CNE and often playing at mess functions of the regular force staff.History Members of the band in Toronto, 1909. The DBC portion of the band and bugles has a separate history. It was founded just two years before the band in 1860 by Francis Clark, the first regimental bugle major, and in 1866 was turned into a full drum and bugle corps ‚Äì the first in the Canadian Army and a pioneer ensemble in North American armed forces, when a bass drummer was added to the growing ensemble of side (snare) drummers and buglers.http://www.middlehornleader.com/Evolution%20of%20the%20Bugle%20--%20Section%202.htm When Charles Swift became its bandmaster in 1876, its instrumentation was revised, and the bugles now had crook adjustments which made them longer and thus capable of playing F major, aside from the usual B flat major tunes and bugle calls. Its touring concerts in the United States in the late 1880s and into the 1890s thus served as a partial inspiration towards the introduction of the US drum and bugle corps traditions, as well as similar traditions within Canada.

On 24 September 1968, they entered Milwaukee's Brumder Building, site of nine Wisconsin draft boards, gathered up about 10,000 files, carried them to an open public space, and set them on fire with homemade napalm. The fourteen then remained at the site, singing and reading from the gospels of John and Luke as Milwaukee firemen and police officers arrived. The subsequent trial of twelve of the protestors became the first resistance trial in which the defendants chose to represent themselves. After a trial of eleven days, the defendants were each found guilty of theft, arson, and burglary.

In February 1966 Barry Bondhus destroyed draft files in Elk River, Minnesota by pouring human excrement over them. In October 1967 four men poured blood on draft records at the Baltimore City Custom House. Then, on 17 May 1968 nine protestors burned draft records in Catonsville, MD. The Milwaukee group was inspired by the action in Catonsville and \\"timed their action to draw attention to the upcoming trial of the Catonsville Nine.\\" Jim Forest and Daniel Berrigan traveled to Milwaukee where they met with Michael Cullen and others at Casa Maria, a Catholic Worker house of hospitality. According to Forest, \\"On our second night at Casa Maria, Dan and I found ourselves drinking beer in a crowded kitchen in which several of those present, Michael among them, made clear they were eager to follow the Catonsville example.\\" In August 1968 a retreat was held at a Catholic monastery in New Jersey to consider who of those present might participate in another draft board action‚Äîand when it would take place. Forest describes it: > The gathering was shaped liked a retreat, with Mass each morning and a > period of Bible study later in the day. In addition there were sessions at > which we got to know each other, discuss our motives and backgrounds, and to > make decisions about who would take part in the action, who would form a > support team, and which of several cities being considered should be chosen. Forest explained the decision to act in Milwaukee, > There were several cities that were being considered (New York City, where I > lived, wasn‚Äôt one of them) and two or three people appointed to see what the > possibilities might be. When we met to hear the reports, it was clear that > Milwaukee was the best site; more people from our group came from Milwaukee > than any place else and there were nine draft boards side by side on the > same floor of the same office building, with a convenient little park ideal > for burning the draft records right across the street. The group agreed to come together in Milwaukee on September 22.  The Action  > The night before the event, the Milwaukee 14 gathered together and > determined their roles for the burglary portion of the action. The afternoon > of the event, the men walked side by side [\\"in pairs from a variety of > starting points\\"] to the building that housed the nine different draft > boards, with burlap bags to collect the 1-A draft files. Shortly before 6:00 on Tuesday evening, 24 September 1968, the group entered the second floor offices where the draft boards were located in Milwaukee's Brumder Building. They encountered a cleaning woman from whom they took office keys. Later, at the trial she would describe their manner towards her as \\"very respectful.\\" Files classified as 1-A and \\"other files that were in a drawer marked ‚ÄòDelinquent‚Äô ‚Äî people who were in trouble with the Selective Service System\\"‚Äî were gathered and carried out of the building and across W. Wells Street to a grassy area (now known as Postman's Square) and piled at the foot of a flagpole dedicated to dead WWI soldiers. A car drove up from which canisters of napalm were taken; they were poured over the pile of burlap bags and set on fire. The group understood the importance of public attention to and awareness of their action. Through the Milwaukee Organizing Committee, an anti-war and anti-draft group, they had contacted the local media and, safeguarding the details of the action, led them by an indirect route to the site. > The deed done, the Fourteen gathered together in a supportive embrace and > waited to be arrested, singing the Lord's Prayer and reading scripture as > fire trucks wailed in the distance.

Eventually this was reduced by another judge and, after a month in jail, the Fourteen were released on bail to await trial in May of the following year. Throughout the city there were many heated and negative responses to the destruction of draft files. The Milwaukee County Council unanimously condemned the act. A Milwaukee Journal editorial called the protest \\"inexcusable hooliganism,\\" and the paper published a cartoon that compared the Milwaukee Fourteen to Nazis, members of the Ku Klux Klan and other fanatical groups. The white working class base of the city's Democratic Party was angry: > Although the war was not necessarily popular among these white blue-collar > voters, they despised the protests and protesters‚Äîwhom they associated with > civil rights marchers‚Äîeven more. It was their sons who were being sacrificed > in Vietnam, and they resented college kids, and now even Catholic priests, > telling them that their sons had died or might die for an unjust cause. Support was found on local college campuses and among those who had recently worked for civil rights and fair housing practices in Milwaukee. Fr. James Groppi, a prominent Milwaukee priest known for his civil rights work, stood up for the Fourteen. He helped to set up the Milwaukee Fourteen Defense Fund and on 1 October‚Äîtogether with comedian Dick Gregory‚Äîled a rally of 150 people who marched to the Milwaukee County Safety Building to sing and chant their support for the jailed activists.  The Trials  = The State of Wisconsin Trial = On 5 May 1969 Judge Charles Larson, at the request of the Milwaukee District Attorneys, decided to postpone the trial until 23 June, but a few hours later he re-set the starting date for 12 May. As a result, twelve members of the group were tried by the State of Wisconsin from 12 to 26 May 1969, charged with theft, arson, and burglary. They had decided to represent themselves. \\"This gave us greater leeway to express our views,\\" explains Jim Forest. As Francine du Plessix Gray, who was present for the trial, observed, \\"Another purpose of the draft board raids is to turn American courtrooms into political forums on the illegality and the immorality of the Vietnam war.\\" The trial was presided over by Judge Larson. The jury consisted of \\"eight men, four women, one of them black, eight of them Catholics.\\" State prosecutors were Deputy District Attorney Allen Samson and Assistant D. A. Harold Jackson Jr. There were no defense attorneys since twelve members had chosen to defend themselves. Two of the accused‚ÄîMichael Cullen and Jerry Gardner‚Äîhad decided to retain counsel. On 26 May the jury was given instructions and sent out. They deliberated for seventy minutes and returned to find the defendants guilty on all counts of theft, arson, and burglary. They would remain free on bail until sentencing. At sentencing on 6 June, each member was given the same punishment of two years, with the possibility of parole after 14 months. The trial transcript for 6 June indicates that the sentences were given as follows: > ‚Äú[F]or the crime of larceny to property valued in excess of $100 ‚Ä¶ the court > sentences you to two years confinement in the Wisconsin State Prison; for > the offense of arson ‚Ä¶ the court sentences you to two years in the Wisconsin > State Prison, the sentences to be served concurrently; for the offense of > burglary ‚Ä¶ the court sentences you to four years in Wisconsin State prisons, > but ‚Ä¶ the court stays execution of the sentences for burglary of four years > just imposed and places you on probation ‚Ä¶ to commence after you have served > the two-year concurrent terms for the charges on which you have been > sentenced.‚Äù Gray noted that the Milwaukee Twelve's pro se defense had produced some fresh outcomes for the anti-war movement. \\"This first attempt at legal self-defense raised the political issues as no previous resistance trial had done. It had tortured the consciences of a few in power. The defendants had been let off lightly. The twelve could be paroled, after all, in a mere fourteen months. Movement lawyers began to write manuals for lay advocacy.\\" Two members of the group were not tried with \\"the Twelve\\", but they also were sentenced. Michael Cullen was an Irish citizen whose legal situation had been complicated by his immigrant status. He retained an attorney for his separate federal trial, was found guilty, and sentenced. Jerry Gardner pleaded \\"guilty\\" and had no trial. = The Federal Trial = On 9 June 1969 the twelve found themselves in a Federal District courtroom, facing charges of \\"destroying government property and interfering with the working of the Selective Service System\\" Journalist Gray was present to report: \\"After a tedious voirdire of two and a half days in which he cross-examined 141 prospective jurors‚Äîmostly hostile to the defendants‚ÄîFederal District Judge Myron Gordon dismissed the government charges against the twelve on grounds that 'prejudicial pre-trial publicity' caused by modern press media had made a fair trial impossible.\\" Gray notes that this was not particularly good news for the defendants since, if a re- trial were to be held and a conviction obtained, many months of punishment could have been added to their state sentences. But there was no re-trial.

Its purpose was advocacy for composite nationalism and a united India, thus opposing the partition of India as well as its underlying two-nation theory put forward by the pro-separatist All India Muslim League. The conference included representatives from various political parties and organizations such as Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, Majlis-e- Ahrar-ul-Islam, All India Momin Conference, All India Shia Political Conference, Khudai Khidmatgar, Krishak Praja Party, Anjuman-i-Watan Baluchistan, All India Muslim Majlis, and Jamiat Ahl-i-Hadis. The Canadian orientalist Wilfred Cantwell Smith felt that the attendees at the Delhi session in 1940 represented the \\"majority of India's Muslims\\". The Bombay Chronicle documented on 18 April 1946 that \\"The attendance at the Nationalist meeting was about five times than the attendance at the League meeting.\\"  History  The Azad Muslim Conference was established in 1929 by Allah Bakhsh Soomro, a later Chief Minister of Sindh, who had founded the Sind Ittehad Party (Sind United Party) a few years before. In the 20th century, many Muslims in British India \\"ferociously opposed the Muslim League‚Äôs demand for Pakistan\\". Allah Bakhsh Soomro stated: In the session of the Azad Muslim Conference held in Delhi, from April 27 to April 30, over 1400 nationalist Muslim delegates participated. Allah Baksh Soomro, the leader of the conference, stated \\"No power on earth can rob anyone of his faith and convictions, and no power on earth shall be permitted to rob Indian Muslims of their just rights as Indian nationals.\\" The participants primarily belonged to the working class of Muslims in British India, unlike the All India Muslim League, whose membership was largely composed of the elite. The Bombay Chronicle documented on 18 April 1946 that \\"The attendance at the Nationalist meeting was about five times than the attendance at the League meeting.\\" The Canadian orientalist Wilfred Cantwell Smith likewise stated that he felt the attendees represented the \\"majority of India's Muslims\\", as did the British press. Meetings of the Azad Muslim Conference were frequent in the 1940s, especially in 1942, and continued in several cities, which worried the rival Muslim League. From 27 December 1947 to 28 December 1947, the Azad Muslim Conference was convened in Lucknow by Hafiz Mohamad Ibrahim and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad.This meeting was also supported by leaders like Zahid bin Maulana Shaukat Ali of Khilafat Andolan.https://www.milligazette.com/news/15756-partition-of-india-and- patriotism-of-indian-muslims/ The Azad Muslim Conference concluded that the creation of Pakistan would be \\"impracticable and harmful to the country‚Äôs interest generally, and of Muslims in particular.\\" It called on Indian Muslims to work with Indians of other faiths to liberate India from British rule. Jawaharlal Nehru praised the Azad Muslim Conference as \\"very representative and very successful\\". The Azad Muslim Conference had support from the Deobandi school of Islam and their Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind. The All India Azad Muslim Conference, despite its political strength, was sidelined by British officials, who referred to the organisation as \\"so-called\\" in their correspondences. Victor Hope, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow, had referred to the organisation as \\"stage managed\\" in 1942 and eventually, the British were only willing to recognize the pro-separatist All India Muslim League as being the sole representative of Indian Muslims‚Äîa development that led to the partition of India.

Speaking to Newark airport workers in May 2017 he said, \\"It is un- American to be in this country, to work a full-time job and still live in poverty. That is unacceptable.

The singer gave guest performances in the role in Vienna, Berlin and Stuttgart, at La Scala in Milan, in London, Florence, Zurich, Buenos Aires, Bregenz and Brussels, among others. In the 1971/72 season, he sang it at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. Beckmesser was Kusche's signature role. His talent, which tended towards comedy, made him a suitable choice also for La Roche, the theatre director in Capriccio by Richard Strauss. Further important roles were Alberich in Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, the title role in Verdi's Falstaff, Leporello in Mozart's Don Giovanni, Faninal in Der Rosenkavalier by Richard Strauss, Papageno in Mozart's Die Zauberfl√∂te, Waldner in Arabella by Richard Strauss, and Don Alfonso in Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte, among others. Kusche played roles in operettas, notably Zsupan in Der Zigeunerbaron by Johann Strauss, Ollendorff in Der Bettelstudent and Frank in Die Fledermaus by Johann Strauss. He worked for opera broadcasts by WDR in Cologne during the 1950s and 1960s as part of the ensemble working with the conductor Franz Marszalek. They recorded well- known operettas such as Schwarzwaldm√§del, Gasparone and Gr√§fin Mariza, but also rarely played works such as Jabuka by Johann Strauss, and Paroli by Leo Fall. Kusche also appeared in contemporary opera, for example as an animal tamer in Alban Berg's Lulu and in buffo roles in Carl Orff's stage works, among others. He appeared regularly in Augsburg as Tevje in Fiddler on the Roof (Anatevka) until 1988. Kusche also appeared in films, for example ' (with Marisa Allasio and Ellen Schwiers), or took small roles in the movies, including A Summer You Will Never Forget (with Claus Biederstaedt, Karin Dor, Fita Benkhoff), ' (with his wife Christine G√∂rner and the Kessler Twins). He appeared as a guest star in the cult series ' 5 May 1976. In 1975, he appeared for the ZDF with Julia Migenes, and others in the role of the mayor in the operetta Viktoria und ihr Husar and also appeared in ' with Margit Schramm, Rudolf Schock and Ilse Werner. Kusche was a Bavarian Kammers√§nger and holder of the Bundesverdienstkreuzes 1. Klasse and the Bavarian Order of Merit. Kusche had a daughter Eveline from his first marriage. In 1960 he married the actress and soubrette Christine G√∂rner. They were divorced in 1986. Christian Kusche-Tomasini,Christian Kusche-Tomasini their son, works as a film composer in Italy.

(22.2 √ó 31.4 cm) The Grand Ball, signed MZ and dated 1500 (22 x 31 cm) Master MZ was an engraver active in south Germany around 1500.Sometimes \\"Master M.Z.\\", although unlike say Master E.S., the actual prints have no stops in the monogram. He signed his 22 engravings with his monogram \\"MZ\\", and six are dated, all 1500, 1501 or 1503. He worked in Munich in Bavaria, and in 1500 seems to have been connected to the court of Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria. There are complicated but inconclusive arguments for and against identifying him with a goldsmith called Matth√§us Zaisinger, a painter known as Master MS, and other figures. What appears to have been a brief period of printmaking, perhaps in mid- career, came when the prints of Albrecht D√ºrer, from nearby Nuremberg, were already taking German printmaking to new heights. MZ's style imitated D√ºrer's early engravings, without matching his quality, and perhaps he gave up the unequal struggle.Hutchison, 61; Shestack, biography Although some of his prints are of conventional religious subjects, many show original secular compositions, and all show an individual \\"artistic vision\\", which in many respects foreshadows developments by others in the rest of the century.Mezentseva, 13 Technically, his style is characterized by rather weak drawing of figures and shaky perspective, but \\"delicate and spontaneous burin work\\", and a great interest in effects of light. A number of drawings have been attributed to him. His plates survived for later reprinting, and many prints are relatively common for early engravings, with at least seventy examples of The Grand Ball known.Hutchison, 61; Mezentseva, 13 Engravings The count of 22 engravings does not include a set of 13 engraved book- illustrations to the Ars Moriendi; these loosely follow the standard compositions for the subjects, seen in the engraved set by Master E.S. and various woodcut versions.11 of these are online at the British Museum Otherwise, his subjects are divided equally between religious and secular ones, the former being mostly saints and including no images of the adult Christ. The nine saints include four martyrdoms, four standing figures, and Saint George defeating the dragon. The most popular prints are all secular: The Embrace and the two large images of court life, The Tournament and The Grand Ball. All of these are dated, and The Embrace, the only print he dated 1503, shows a growing mastery of the medium, suggesting it was his last print.Shestack, # 149 The Embrace, signed MZ and dated 1503 (15.8 x 11.7 cm). Most prints have detailed backgrounds, whether landscapes, room interiors, or the townscapes in the two large court prints. In these a very relaxed approach to relative scale and graphical perspective is evident, for example in the scale of the figures in the side streets of The Tournament compared to the buildings beside and forward of them, and the sketched figures in the windows. In the Grand Ball the central group at rear are larger than the dancing figures in the foreground, and the same is true for some of the foreground group of tournament figures and their horses.Shestack, # 153 Such effects are often exploited for an artistic purpose; in the Idolatry of Solomon the \\"huge\\" pagan wife towers over the kneeling king, and seems too tall for the room they are in.Russell, 162 The two large images of court life may represent specific festivities in 1500 at the court of Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria. He and his duchess Kunigunde of Austria are probably the figures playing cards at the back of the Ball, which compare well with their painted portraits, and the sketchy figures visible through the window at right may be taking part in the same tournament shown in the other print. In that print a couple on the balcony at top centre may also represent the duke and duchess, and the coat of arms of Bavaria appear below the date on a shop front at right. The palace building where the ball takes place has been identified by one scholar as the Neuveste at the north-east corner of the Munich Residenz, later replaced by the existing mainly Baroque buildings. Max Lehrs was uncertain about this, but agreed that a specific room in the Munich palace was shown.Shestack, # 152, 153 A preliminary drawing in chalk exists for two of the horsemen at lower right in the Tournament, which has a \\"spontaneous quality\\" lacking in the \\"awkward draftsmanship\\" in the engraving.Shestack, #153 The Embrace, showing a couple embracing in a small but expensively-furnished room, has been found an enigmatic image by many critics. The man's face cannot be seen, and the woman looks out at the viewer with an ambiguous expression, with half her face in shadow. The fashionable l√ºsterweibchen chandelier above them,photo of real example made of the bust of a woman holding a coat of arms and antlers (often real ones), may evoke the traditional use of horns and antlers as the symbol of the cuckold. This may be an illicit embrace, whether between lovers or a courtesan and her client, the last perhaps suggested by \\"the woman's off-the- shoulder dress and long, loose hair\\".Russell, 195 (quoted); Orenstein, 29; Hutchison, 61; Shestack, # 149 The room may be found \\"homey\\", or disquietingly small; though it seems as though the fourth wall has been removed for the viewer, the gap has been given an architectural frame.Orenstein, 29; Hutchison, 61; Shestack, # 149 (\\"homey\\") Some scholars consider that details such as the \\"open cupboard and unlocked door\\", the \\"door-fastening which is suggestive of a phallic symbol\\" and the mirror are references to an irregular sexual encounter,Mezentseva, 13 though others downplay the significance of these.Russell, 195 The unusual image of The Woman with the Owl, dated 1500, shows a woman lifting her skirts to protect an owl.Shestack #148; British Museum page The motto in the sky behind her reads Duck dich or \\"Hide yourself\\", and the owl may represent sin or evil. Alternatively the scene may depict the content of a German folk song.Shestack #148; British Museum page It is clear from analysis of the watermarks on the papers used, and the plate wear evident in many impressions, that most of the prints continued to be printed well into the 16th century. The watermarks suggest that later impressions were mostly printed in Cleves, Augsberg and Nuremberg.Hutchison, 61; Shestack, biography His engravings were also copied by other engravers.Copy in Chicago of The Woman and the Owl. Possible identities Fortune, drawing in black ink. The monogram of D√ºrer at the bottom is contemporary but fake. =Zaisinger= The name of Matth√§us Zaisinger or Zazinger is connected to the prints of Master MZ from very early, in the list of his prints made by the Nuremberg collector Paul Behaim in 1618, which survives. Behaim calls Master MZ \\"Matheus Zaszinger\\" or \\"Zingel\\", without giving any reasons. Joachim von Sandrart included MZ in his Teutsche Academie of 1675, suggesting the initials stood for Martin Zink, Zatzinger or Zasinger. A Matth√§us Zagel has also been introduced to the debate.Hutchison, 61; Shestack, biography Subsequently, records of Matth√§us Zaisinger (or Zaysinger) in Munich have been unearthed by scholars. These cover such a long period (active 1498-1555 as printer, goldsmith & mint official) that there are probably two of them, presumably father and son. The earlier is often identified with Master MZ, but this remains speculative.Hutchison, 61 A surviving engraved piece of metalwork, the back of a reliquary dated 1501, is thought to be by Zaisinger.Shestack, biography =Master MS= Another figure brought into the discussion is the painter who signed his works \\"MS\\" (as opposed to \\"MZ\\"), so is known as Master MS. Some scholars are attracted to identifying him with MZ because their styles are similar, and MS's engraving style, with much emphasis on effects of light, is regarded as indicating a training as a painter. His few drawings also suggest this. Little is known about Master MS, who is thought to have been German, but was apparently mainly active in Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica in modern Slovakia, a few years after the dates on MZ's engravings.Hutchison, 61; Shestack, biography Many authorities, especially German ones, regard MZ as Zaisinger, but English-speaking ones tend to regard the matter as too uncertain to make a determination.Hutchison, 61; Shestack, biography Jane Campbell Hutchison concludes her discussion \\"For this and other reasons, it seems prudent to retain the monogram MZ as the artist's designation\\",Hutchison, 61 and the British Museum's online biographical note says \\"None of these or other proposed identities is yet persuasive.\\" BM Context Albrecht D√ºrer established his workshop in Nuremberg on his return from Italy in 1495, and was quickly producing woodcuts and engravings of exceptional quality. The Free Imperial City of Nuremberg was a free imperial city, largely self-governing and controlling the area a good way around the city, and patchy territories beyond.Bartrum, 9-10; Nuremberg had the largest territories of all the free cities. Most of Bavaria was divided between the Duchies of Bavaria-Munich and Bavaria-Landshut, ruled by distantly-related branches of the House of Wittelsbach. Perhaps as a ducal response to the impact of D√ºrer, both duchies produced artists who made engravings for a very few years around 1500: Master MZ in Munich and Mair von Landshut in Landshut. The two make an interesting comparison, with strong similarities and differences. Like MZ, Mair is credited with just 22 engravings, but also three woodcuts. Ten Mair engravings are dated, all with 1499. Their biographical details are about equally unknown, but both were probably mainly painters; unlike MZ (unless he is also Master MS), several surviving paintings are attributed to Mair.Hind, 35-36. For Mair: Shestack, biography before # 142; Hutchison, 26-27. for MZ: Shestack, biography before # 142; Hutchison, 61 The Dead King and his Three Sons, 17.2 x 24.5 cm. The engravings of both divide between religious and secular subjects, and both share an interest in courtly life. Both sets of works display the idiosyncrasies of the artist even in conventional religious scenes. Mair likes to give his figures a setting in complicated and \\"fantastic architectural spaces, with walls joining at the most unlikely angles. The scenes resemble whimsical stage sets, and are endowed with an unreal character, like something from a fairy tale.\\"Shestack, #142 MZ's interior settings and landscape backgrounds are interesting, but he pays greater attention to details of dress, and \\"labyrinths of gracefully fluted drapery folds\\"; he is also more up to date in his fashions than Mair, some of whose figures seem to wear fashions some decades old.Mezentseva, 13, quoted They probably kept an eye on each other; it is unlikely to be coincidence that they both made engravings of the obscure subject of the story of The Dead King and his Three Sons, the only early prints of it that Wolfgang Stechow could find in his study.Stechow, 223 Both may be regarded, especially in comparison to D√ºrer, as the last backward-looking evocations of Late Gothic, but each had an innovative aspect. With Mair it is his experiments in bringing colour to his prints, many of which were made on \\"prepared\\" coloured paper, and then given coloured highlights by hand. These attempts were followed up by many northern printmakers within three decades.Hutchison, 27; Mezentseva, 13; Hind, 35 With MZ it is his free burin technique, and \\"his spontaneity in the rendering of light emanating from a multitude of sources and producing reflexes and rich shimmering shadows\\". These also look forward to 16th-century German art, especially that of the Danube School.Mezentseva, 13, quoted; Hind, 35-36 This world came to an abrupt end in 1503, especially for Landshut, with the death without a male heir of George the Rich, the last Duke of Bavaria-Landshut. This brought disaster to the area, with the Imperial armies of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor and brother-in-law of Duke Albert of Munich, devastating parts of it in the War of the Succession of Landshut (1503‚Äì05).Hutchison, 26 File:D12272.jpgMartyrdom of St Catherine File:R-20100923-0032.jpgMemento Mori File:Maestro MZ, fillide a cavalcioni di aristotele, 1500 ca, incisione.jpgPhyllis and Aristotle, a popular Power of Women subject.Russell, 149 File:R-20100923-0030.jpgFour Soldiers, c. 1500 (from the wide shoes).Shestack, #151 File:R-20100923-0035.jpgIdolatry of Solomon, dated 1501 Prints by Lehrs numbers The Woman with the Owl, dated 1500.

Biography L. J. Witts received secondary education at Boteler Grammar School, where he won in 1916 a scholarship to the University of Manchester. During WWI when he reached the age of 18 he joined the Inns of Court Officers Training Corps and then the Royal Field Artillery. Serving on the western front, he suffered a leg wound and was invalided back to civilian life. From 1919 to 1923 he studied at the University of Manchester, graduating there MB ChB in 1923. After house appointments, he became Dickinson travelling scholar of the University of Manchester and graduated there in 1926 with his higher MD thesis on blood research. He qualified MRCP in 1926. In 1926 Howard Florey became a Fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge and vacated his John Lucas Walker Studentship at the University of Cambridge. This studentship was filled by Witts, who worked from 1926 to 1928 in the department of pathology of the University of Cambridge. In 1931 he was elected FRCP. In 1932 he gave the Goulstonian Lectures on Pathology and treatment of anaemia. After junior appointments in Cambridge, in the USA, and at Guy's Hospital, he was appointed in 1933 a full physician and in 1935 a professor of medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital. From 1933 to 1937 at St Bartholomew's Hospital, Leslie Witts closely collaborated with the surgical unit, which was directed by James Paterson Ross. In 1937 Witts was appointed the first Nuffield professor of clinical medicine at the University of Oxford. He held the professorship until retirement in 1965 with successor Paul Beeson. For about 30 years Witts ran the weekly post-graduate case conferences at the Radcliffe Infirmary. In 1937 he was a co-founder of the British Society of Gastroenterology along with Arthur Frederick Hurst, John Ryle, Henry Letheby Tidy, and Lionel Hardy. Witts wrote about his opinions on medicine as ‚ÄòDoctor Don‚Äô in 1939 in The Lancet and, years later, in the ‚ÄòPersonal Views‚Äô series in the British Medical Journal. He was appointed CBE in 1959. Under the auspices of the Royal College of Physicians, he delivered in 1961 the Lumleian Lectures on Some aspects of the pathology of anaemia and in 1971 the Harveian Oration on The medical professorial unit. In 1929 in Cambridge he married Nancy Grace Salzman (1907‚Äì1992), younger daughter of the historian Louis Francis Salzman. When L. J.

History  In 1900, Abdullah Shaig moved from Tbilisi to Baku and lived in a small apartment in Icheri Sheher with his mother Mehri and his brother Yusuf Ziya Talibzade. Shortly after, he rented several apartments in different parts of the city and, finally, in 1916 moved to a five-room apartment that located on the 2nd floor of the building on Upper Mountain Street (now called A.

Ahmed Javad, Huseyn Javid, Jafar Jabbarli, Mikail Mushfig, Samad Vurgun, and other Azerbaijani intellectuals often used to visit the writer in this house. The writer also occasionally used to meet in this apartment with his students and even schoolchildren for giving advice and instructions. The museum was founded for the first time by elder son of the writer academician Kamal Talibzade and opened to the public since 2001.  Exhibitions  The Abdullah Shaig Memorial Museum consists of four rooms. In the first room (used as a kitchen) the own books of the writer and his various translations of world-known works such as ‚ÄúShahnameh‚Äù, ‚ÄúMacbeth‚Äù, ‚ÄúGulliver‚Äù, ‚ÄúRobinson Crusoe‚Äù and, etch are exhibited.

It is on the coast of the Tsitsikamma National Park, and is one of the oldest MPAs in the country. The MPA provides protection for marine habitat and wildlife, including birds and threatened and endangered fish species. The MPA is in near pristine condition, and is a suitable area for research on endangered fish species. It was designated as a Marine Protected Area in 1964. The length of the protected shoreline is 60 km, and the area of protected ocean is 186 km2. The MPA is managed by SANParks. History The MPA was proclaimed by the Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, Mohammed Valli Moosa, in Government Gazette No. 21948 of 29 December 2000 in terms section 43 of the Marine Natural Resources Act, 18 of 1998. Purpose A marine protected area is defined by the IUCN as \\"A clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values\\". Extent The length of the protected shoreline is 60 km, and the area of protected ocean is 186 km2. =Zonation= The entire MPA is zoned as a restricted (no-take) area. =Boundaries= *Northern boundary is the high-water mark between Die Punt, Nature's Valley, at S33¬∞59.0' E023¬∞34.561' (west), and the right bank of the Grootrivier at S34¬∞03.6', E024¬∞11.665, (east) *Eastern boundary is a line from the right bank of the Grootrivier at S34¬∞03.6', E024¬∞11.665, running due south to a point three nautical miles offshore at S34¬∞06.6', E024¬∞11.665 *Southern boundary is a straight line from S34¬∞06.6', E024¬∞11.665, approximately parallel to the shore, to a point three nautical miles from the high-water mark at S34¬∞01.817', E023¬∞38.857E measured along a line running due south from the right bank of the mouth of the Bloukrans River, and then due north to a point 0.5 nautical miles from the high-water mark at S33¬∞59.317', E023¬∞38.857', and then along a straight line roughly parallel to the shoreline to a point at S33¬∞59.5', E023¬∞34.561' due south of Die Punt, Nature's Valley. *The western boundary is a line from the high-water mark at Die Punt, Natures Valley, at S33¬∞59.0' E023¬∞34.561' due south to a point about 0.5 nautical miles offshore at S33¬∞59.5', E023¬∞34.561' The northern boundary of the MPA is the southern boundary of the Tsitsikamma National Park Restricted areas The whole MPA is a restricted zone. Management The marine protected areas of South Africa are the responsibility of the national government, which has management agreements with a variety of MPA management authorities, in this case, South African National Parks (SANParks), which manages the MPA with funding from the SA Government through the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA). The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is responsible for issuing permits, quotas and law enforcement. Use =Activities requiring a permit= Scuba diving Scuba diving requires a permit. There is an office at the Storms River mouth slipway where dives can be organised. =Prohibited activities= Geography =General topography= The coastline is fairly straight, and is generally very steep from a relatively flat coastal region between the inland mountains and the sea. Much of the shoreline can best be described as cliffs. The Storms River gorge is roughly perpendicular to the coastline, and very narrow ‚Äî the sides are approximately vertical. A boat trip or hike up the gorge will show a section through the coastal formations. =Geology= The rock formations are heavily folded sandstones and shales of the Table Mountain series. The coastline formation to the west of the river mouth is the Silurian Tchando formation, which is typically fine to coarse grained brown sandstone and shale, and inland and across the river to the east, mostly Ordovician Peninsula sandstone. Offshore formations may include Devonian Gydo shales and siltstones. Folding is roughly parallel to the coastline, and dip is frequently near vertical, even overfolded in places. Resistance to weathering is also very variable, with some extremely resistant quartzitic sandstone, and some very friable shales. As a result, there are areas with distinct ridges, often roughly parallel to the shoreline. =Hydrography= =Bathymetry= =Climate of the southern Cape= =Seasonal variations in sea conditions= Ecology Marine bioregions of the South African Exclusive Economic Zone: The Tsitsikamma Marine Protected Area is in the Agulhas bioregion. The MPA is in the warm temperate Agulhas inshore marine bioregion to the east of Cape Point which extends eastwards to the Mbashe River. The Mbashe River was chosen as the most appropriate boundary between the subtropical Natal province to the north, and the warm temperate Agulhas region to the south, but change is gradual between these regions. Upwelling on the south coast of South Africa is largely driven by the Agulhas current and the continental shelf. This form of upwelling forces cold deep water up onto the continental shelf, but not necessarily above the thermocline. In the region east of the Agulhas bank, wind enhanced upwelling, occurring mainly in summer, augments the current driven upwelling bringing the colder deeper waters to the surface. This enhances biological productivity by supply of nutrients to the euphotic zone (where plants have sufficient light to flourish) which fuels phytoplankton production, and rocky shores that are supplied with the nutrient rich water support rich algal biomass. There are a large proportion of species endemic to South Africa along this coastline. Three major habitats exist in the sea in this region, distinguished by the nature of the substrate. The substrate, or base material, is important in that it provides a base to which an organism can anchor itself, which is vitally important for those organisms which need to stay in one particular kind of place. Rocky shores and reefs provide a firm fixed substrate for the attachment of plants and animals. Sandy beaches and bottoms are a relatively unstable substrate and cannot anchor kelp or many of the other benthic organisms. Finally there is open water, above the substrate and clear of the kelp forest, where the organisms must drift or swim. Mixed habitats are also frequently found, which are a combination of those mentioned above. There are no significant estuarine habitats in the MPA. Rocky shores and reefs There are rocky reefs and mixed rocky and sandy bottoms. For many marine organisms the substrate is another type of marine organism, and it is common for several layers to co-exist. Examples of this are red bait pods, which are usually encrusted with sponges, ascidians, bryozoans, anemones, and gastropods, and abalone, which are usually covered by similar seaweeds to those found on the surrounding rocks, usually with a variety of other organisms living on the seaweeds. The type of rock of the reef is of some importance, as it influences the range of possibilities for the local topography, which in turn influences the range of habitats provided, and therefore the diversity of inhabitants. Sandstone and other sedimentary rocks erode and weather very differently, and depending on the direction of dip and strike, and steepness of the dip, may produce reefs which are relatively flat to very high profile and full of small crevices. These features may be at varying angles to the shoreline and wave fronts. There are fewer large holes, tunnels and crevices in sandstone reefs, but often many deep but low near- horizontal crevices. Sandy beaches and bottoms (including shelly, pebble and gravel bottoms) Sandy bottoms at first glance appear to be fairly barren areas, as they lack the stability to support many of the spectacular reef based species, and the variety of large organisms is relatively low. The sand is continually being moved around by wave action, to a greater or lesser degree depending on weather conditions and exposure of the area. This means that sessile organisms must be specifically adapted to areas of relatively loose substrate to thrive in them, and the variety of species found on a sandy or gravel bottom will depend on all these factors. Sandy bottoms have one important compensation for their instability, animals can burrow into the sand and move up and down within its layers, which can provide feeding opportunities and protection from predation. Other species can dig themselves holes in which to shelter, or may feed by filtering water drawn through the tunnel, or by extending body parts adapted to this function into the water above the sand.

Published in 1991, it is the second collection of poems by the American poet, Mark Doty, who lived through the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The poem serves as an elegy for the Doty's friend, Peter Holla, a Drag queen, and the first person the poet knew who died of AIDS. The poem wrestles with the accusation that gay men living through the HIV/AIDS plague years had \\"asked for it\\" simply by being homosexual and indulging in sexual practice with other men. According to Doty, \\"I was filled with rage at that ridiculous notion that we invite our own oppression as a consequence of pleasure\\"  Prosody  This poem has 45 lines broken up into 15, 3 line stanzas. This poem is heterometric, with some lines written in iambic pentameter, Iambic tetrameter, Iambic dimeter, trochaic pentameter, and trochaic tetrameter.  Synopsis  The poem begins with the Peter's death in a paper tiara. In the second stanza, the speaker offers a flashback of him and Peter in a hospital room, then transitions to his funeral in the third stanza. Some people make friendly jokes related to Peter's passion for drag, then, \\"someone said that he asked for it,\\" initiating the theme of gay men welcoming death by HIV/AIDS by having intimate homosexual relations. This statement triggers a series of abstract images where the speaker imagines a heaven with men lying peacefully on the grass while horses walk through orchard. All the while, the speaker muses on the nature of creation and mortal pleasure.

He worked in multiple mediums, including painting, printmaking, murals, stage design, ceramics, and enameling. Biography Elmer Brown was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and went to school in Columbus, Ohio. He moved to Cleveland, Ohio in 1929, when he was 20, and studied with artist Paul Travis at the Cleveland School of Art. Shortly after arriving in Cleveland, he became affiliated with Karamu House, where he became friends with Langston Hughes. He assisted with the production of Hughes's plays at Karamu House, and created artwork for lounges there. He exhibited prints at international exhibitions in New York City and Philadelphia, and displayed works several times in the Cleveland Museum of Art's May Show. Brown's best-known works are his Works Progress Administration murals. In 1940, he painted two murals known as Cleveland Past and Cleveland Present for the Cleveland Metropolitan Housing Authority's Valleyview Homes project in Cleveland's Tremont neighborhood. When the complex was razed in 2005, the murals were removed and restored by the Intermuseum Conservation Association, and in 2010, were reinstalled in a ballroom at Cleveland State University's student center. Reproductions were hung at Tremont Pointe, CMHA's replacement of the Valleyview Homes. In 1942, he created a mural for the City Club of Cleveland titled Freedom of Speech. The by mural, inspired by the work of Diego Rivera and other Mexican muralists, features muscular men and important documents of freedom, including the Magna Carta, the United States Bill of Rights, the United States Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution. It was relocated several times when the City Club moved to new locations, and was restored by a team headed by Gail Berg of Berg and Associates. Brown became the first African-American illustrator at American Greetings in 1953, and he worked there for 18 years. He also taught at the Cooper School of Art in Cleveland. In 1971, he died at the Cleveland Clinic after a long illness. He was survived by his wife, Anna V. Brown, and was buried in Martha's Vineyard.

It is native to the lower intertidal zone of the northeastern Pacific Ocean from British Columbia southwards to California. Description This dark brown, perennial kelp grows from a creeping, branching rhizome which sends up thalli at intervals. The thalli are ribbon-like and grow to a length of about and width of with a smooth surface and entire edges. They grow on short, cylindrical stipes some long and wide containing many mucilage ducts. It is very similar in appearance to Laminaria longipes but that species does not have mucilage glands in the stipes. In 1972, the American phycologist James W. Markham did some transplanting experiments to try to determine whether the presence of mucilage glands is a distinctive feature or the two species were identical. He found that they were indeed distinct and that there were some other differences between the two related to the width of blades, the shedding of the blades, the morphology of the reproductive structures, temperature tolerance and habitat preference. Distribution and habitat Laminaria sinclairii is found in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, its range extending from Vancouver Island in British Columbia, southwards to Ventura County, California. It occurs on rocky substrates, sometimes partially covered in sand, in the lower part of the intertidal zone. Ecology This is the dominant seaweed on rocks in the lower part of the intertidal zone in Oregon on beaches where sand levels fluctuate dramatically at different times of year. In March and April new thalli appear from the rhizomes but these blades are progressively buried by rising sand levels which results in the complete burial of the plants over the summer. With the arrival of storms in the fall, the sand is scoured away and the thalli reappear. Reproductive sori are produced on the old blades before they are shed in December and on the new blades that grow in the spring.

Foreman, was a noted Oklahoma historian. Born in Illinois, she moved to the city of Muskogee (then in Indian Territory) with her widowed father, John R. Thomas, a former congressman for Illinois in the 1880s, and politician, and who served as a federal judge after Oklahoma became a state in 1907. After marrying Grant Foreman in 1905, a lawyer and partner of her father, she became fascinated with the history of Oklahoma. After her father's murder in 1914, she and Grant closed the legal partnership and spent full time on historical research and writing. Grant died in 1953, but despite her own declining health, Foreman continued her historical work until her own death in 1967. Early years Carolyn Thomas Foreman (1872‚Äì1967), a native of Metropolis, Illinois, was the daughter of John Robert Thomas and Charlotte Maria \\"Lottie\\" n√©e Culver. They had married in 1870 and had five children. However, Lottie died in 1880, and three of the children also died early, leaving only Foreman and her brother John. Their father remarried, to Jessie Beattie on 1884, but this marriage produced no more issue. Much of her early education was in public and private schools in Washington, D.C., where her father served in the U.S. Congress between 1879 and 1889. After graduating from high school, Thomas attended Monticello College. When her father, an active Republican politician, did not run for reelection in 1889, he moved to Muskogee (then the main city in Indian Territory) and opened a private law practice. His family, including daughter Carolyn and son John Robert Jr also moved to Muskogee. While working on legal research in her father's law firm, she met lawyer and part-time historian Grant Foreman, who had joined the office in 1903. Grant and Carolyn married in 1905. They continued to live in the Thomas house for the rest of the lives, even after the judge's murder in 1914. After Grant died in 1953, Carolyn remained in the house until her own death in 1967. The house was renamed the Thomas‚ÄìForeman Historic Home and is now maintained as a museum by the Oklahoma Historical Society. Marriage to Grant Foreman Grant Foreman, a lawyer who had previously worked for the Dawes Commission, joined the Muskogee law firm of Carolyn's father in 1903. Carolyn, though she had no formal legal training, soon began helping Grant do research for his law cases. The couple formed a good partnership and married in 1905. They had no children, but both loved to travel and became fascinated with the Indian culture that surrounded them. Initially, she helped her husband by performing research in archives, taking notes during site visits and by translating primary documents that were written in French and Spanish. He not only encouraged her, but made sure she got proper credits in his books, which would document her credibility as a writer of history. Career as historian After Carolyn's father was killed in 1914, the law firm that had employed both Grant and Carolyn was apparently soon liquidated. The Foremans needed to decide how to support themselves. They continued living in the large house that John Robert had recently built. Foreman began her career as a historical writer somewhat later in life than did other women who chose a similar path. Author Linda Reese noted that she had written some articles that were published in local newspapers a few years earlier, but that her first historical article had been published in The Chronicles of Oklahoma in 1927, when she was 57 years old. That was just the icebreaker. During the remainder of her life, she contributed 83 articles to that one journal, plus wrote the notes that other writers would complete for three additional to the journal. About 1930, she started researching her first major book, Oklahoma Imprints, 1835‚Äì1907: A History of Printing in Oklahoma Before Statehood (1936). According to Wilson, Carolyn's abilities with learning and using foreign languages greatly contributed to her second book, Indians Abroad: 1493‚Äì1938 (1943). Carolyn completed authoring six books under her own name and co- authored one more. Later life and death Carolyn Foreman died at her home in Muskogee, Oklahoma, on February 18, 1967. Since Grant and Carolyn had no children, their home was inherited by the daughter of John Robert Thomas Jr., Mrs. William Biglow Neergaard. She deeded the home to the Oklahoma Historical Society, which made it a museum for the Foremans, now known as the Thomas- Foreman House. The house is maintained in the same condition as it was upon Foreman's death, and displays their collections, mementos and souvenirs.\\"Visit Oklahoma's Past in Muskogee.\\" NewsOK.

History Greenway was born in 1854,England & Wales, Civil Registration Birth Index, 1837‚Äì1915 the son of John David Greenway (1823‚Äì1889) of Taunton, Somerset, and his wife, Emily.England, Select Births and Christenings, 1538‚Äì1975 While employed as chief smelter by the Sheffield Smelting Company he was recruited as metallurgist for the Block 14 Company, Broken Hill, whose manager was S. R. Wilson, and arrived in Adelaide in January 1888. His one-year contract was not renewed, and the position was given to a Mr. Schlapp By 1889 Greenway was working as manager of the British Broken Hill Proprietary Company's Port Pirie smelting works, which consisted of five 80-ton furnaces, taken over in 1895 by the BHP company to complement their refinery works, erected in 1889. Greenway was succeeded at Port Pirie by Gregory Board. In 1893 he was manager of the Junction Silver Mining Company's works at Port Adelaide In 1896 he was appointed consulting engineer of the Broken Hill South mine. He was, like mining Captains Hancock and Warren, engrossed with the \\"sulphide problem\\". Much of the silver and lead ore was easy to reduce to the metal by smelting, and it was this ore which gave Broken Hill its first great profits. By contrast, the zinc ore was mostly in the form of sulphides, not readily reduced by the smelters at Broken Hill and Port Pirie so treated as waste, forming great hills around the treatment plants. It could be made profitable if the sulphides could be separated from non-economic material such as silica. The concentrated ore could then be loaded onto ships and sent to Europe for processing. Many processes were available (magnetic separation, froth flotation, vanning, jigging), most using water and agitation after pulverizing, to separate the metal sulphide from the lighter weight gangue, but none gave perfect separation, and each had to be optimized for the particular ore body. Another problem was \\"slimes\\", ore crushed so fine that it flowed, requiring separate treatment. Greenway was appointed to the South Australian School of Mines in 1898, as a replacement for Adam Adamson, who had recently died. In 1899 Greenway was with the Block 14 Company, Broken Hill, and at the same time, controversially, consulting engineer to the Broken Hill South mine, which he resigned in February 1900, to be replaced by Frederick Charles Howard (c. 1856‚Äì1919). He was around the same time appointed consulting engineer of the Sliding Rock mine, Beltana On 30 January 1902 Greenway, by then manager of the Block 14 smelting works at Port Adelaide, was driving a trap along the Ocean Steamers Wharf Road to the Block 14 company's smelting works at Port Adelaide with an assistant named Joseph Winter, when at a bend they were \\"bailed up\\" by a pair of masked highway robbers, one of whom had a revolver with which he shot dead the pony; they made off with the company payroll of over ¬£1200. Alfred Lawson and Myles Flynn were charged with the offence, found guilty and sentenced to twenty years' jail. Lawson admitted his guilt but insisted Flynn had nothing to do with the crime. Flynn, who had become overwrought, was consigned to the criminal ward of the Parkside Lunatic Asylum. In June 1902 Greenway was associated with the Stannary Hills mine in Queensland. Several reports about this time mis-reported him as \\"J T Greenway\\". He was appointed general manager of the Chillagoe Railway & Mining Co. in June 1902 and resigned in 1906. Greenway settled in Melbourne, and became manager of the Potter Sulphide Ore Treatment Company in 1909. In Victoria, Greenway was prominent in urging the Peacock and Bowser Ministries (1914‚Äì1918) to develop brown coal extraction in Gippsland. In 1917, described as a Melbourne mining engineer, he visited Petrograd, similarly described in 1919. In 1924 Greenway was appointed chairman of directors of Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, succeeded in 1926 by Major W. L. W. Bird. In May 1925 he left Australia for Canada. He died in Langley Prairie, British Columbia.British Columbia, Canada, Death Index, 1872‚Äì1990 Inventions *In February 1918 he secured a patent for a \\"means of destroying prickly pear and other pest vegetation\\". *He also made patent applications for various modifications to well-known ore separation techniques.

January 1887 ‚Äì 9 April 1950), born in Sheffield, was a student at St Peter's College (1899‚Äì1902), and Adelaide University, gaining his BSc in 1906 and getting mining experience in Broken Hill, at Upper Bingara, New South Wales and at Eaglehawk, Victoria before in November 1910 taking the managership of the Great Chaffinch mine, Western Australia, which became notorious as a fraud. He married Constance Tarlton Phillipps, a daughter of Herbert Phillipps, on 2 January 1917. As Maj. Greenway, he was decorated in the Great War and died in 1950 as Col. Greenway DSO, Croix de Guerre. He was associated with Persian Oil, then with coal mining in the Abermain Seaham Collieries Ltd. and the J. & A.

Biography  Davanzo was born in Ampezzo, from a wealthy family of traders. At young age he showed talent for painting and was noted by Camillo Boito, an eminent architect and art critic. Boito convinced the family to send him to the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia, where he studied under Ettore Tito and Antonio Dal Z√≤tto. Upon completing his military service in Rome in 1898, Davanzo exhibited successfully in Turin's Nazionale. This exploit made him know thorough Europe, and he was subsequently invited to display in London (1903), at the Venice Biennale (1903), at the Salon d'Automne in Paris (1904) and at the International Exposition in Munich (1912). After the Battle of Caporetto, he and his family had to flee from his hometown, finding refuge in Marche region. Between the two World Wars Davanzo developed a looser, chromatically brighter style. In 1935 Davanzo was invited to another Biennale in 1935; in his later years he became more and more secluded, moving near the Alps in Ampezzo that featured in so many of his landscapes. He kept painting until his death in 1955.  Style and works  Davanzo was a realist painter. Characteristic of his work are crystalline atmospheres, verismo in depicting the agrarian world and a refractive synthesis between light and color. In his portraits, Davanzo sought to blend plastic rendition, painterly strokes and psychological scrutiny of the subject.

Routes R1 & R2 operate every 20 minutes during peak hours and route R2 operates every 35-60 minutes at other times on weekdays, and 60 minutes on the weekends. R1 trips are roughly 32 minutes and R2 trips are roughly 55 minutes.  Background  Route R1 and R2 provides service along Riggs Road between Fort Totten station and Adelphi, Maryland or Calverton. Route R1 operates in the weekday peak-hour direction only while route R2 operates daily. The line operates every 20-30 minutes during weekday peak hours, 35 minutes at all other times on weekdays, and 55-65 on the weekends. Routes R1 and R2 currently operates from Bladensburg division but had some trips operated by Northern division during peak hours until 2018. The line often utilizes articulated buses due to its high ridership volume. History The Riggs Road Line was originally operated by routes R8 and R9 beginning in the 1970s running from Downtown DC to Calverton. Around the late 1970s, service to Downtown was discontinued and was replaced by the Red Line. Route R2 was created on February 6, 1978, to serve as part of the Queens Chapel Road Line running with routes R4, R6, and R7. Route R2 operated between the newly opened Brookland‚ÄìCUA station and Centerpark Office Park in Calverton, via Queens Chapel Road, Belcrest Road, Prince George's Plaza, Baltimore Avenue, Rhode Island Avenue, and Powder Mill Road. At one point, route R2 would operate between Calverton and Kennedy Center but was later shortened to Brookland‚ÄìCUA station. Around the same time, route R8 along with the R4 would operate between Calverton and Crystal City station but would be later shorten to Fort Totten station. Route R5 would also operate between Fort McNair and Kennedy Center but would be later replaced. =Service change (1993)= On December 11, 1993, R2 was rerouted to operate between Fort Totten station and intersection of Plum Orchard Drive and Broadbirch Drive in Calverton, Maryland via Riggs Road, East-West Highway, Prince George's Plaza station, Prince George's Plaza, Powder Mill Road, Beltsville Drive, Calverton Boulevard, Broadbirch Drive, Plum Orchard Drive, and Cherry Hill Road completely replacing routes R8 and R9. Unlike the former R8 and R9 routes, route R2 was rerouted to divert from Riggs Road onto East-West Highway and travel eastwards on East-West Highway to serve both Prince George's Plaza station and Prince George's Plaza mall, before returning westwards on East-West Highway, to rejoin Riggs Road and take over the former R8 routing. Service along East-West Highway, Baltimore Avenue, Rhode Island Avenue, and Powder Mill Road, was replaced by route 86. Route R7 also joined the Riggs Road Line operating the same routing as route R2 but diverting into the United States Army Research Laboratory along Floral Drive. WMATA also created the new R1 and R5 routes, to serve as part of the Riggs Road Line. R5 would follow most of R2's route to Calverton except not serving Prince George's Plaza station and Prince George's Plaza Mall and instead remain straight up on Riggs Road past East-West Highway running during weekday peak hours only. Route R1 would also remain straight on Riggs Road, skipping route R2's diversion to Prince Georges Plaza, but would terminate in Presidential Park in Adelphi, Maryland by making a loop along Metzerott Road, New Hampshire Avenue, Adelphi Road, and Edwards Way, going back onto Riggs Road, where R1 would reach its Adelphi terminus at the intersection of Riggs Road & Edwards Way. This provided new Metrobus service was added on Metzerott Road and the small portion of Adelphi Road between New Hampshire Avenue and Edwards Way that had not previously been available, though the Shuttle-UM Adelphi North bus route did previously operate on these route corridors before Metrobus service existed on them. =Service change (1998)= In 1998, route R7 was eliminated due to security concerns at the United States Army Research Laboratory. Service was replaced by route R2. =Service change (2003)= On May 15, 2003, the original bus bays inside Prince Georges Plaza mall, were demolished in order to build a new Target store. Route R2 along with routes 86, C4, F4, F6, F8, R3, R4 and TheBus 13, 14, 18 have stopped entering and looping inside around the mall. This change did not affect routes R1 or R5. =2010-11 Proposed Changes= In 2010, a series of proposals were made that'll affect routes R2 and R5 as part of WMATA's FY2011 and FY2012 budget. WMATA proposed to reroute route R2 into Lewisdale neighborhood along 23rd avenue and University Boulevard replacing route R3 service which is proposed to be eliminated. Route R2 would also discontinue service to Prince George's Plaza station with alternative service provided by routes C4, F4, and TheBus 18. Route R5 would be discontinued and replaced by more frequent R2 service. Route R1 would not be affected by the changes. The proposal would be brought up again in 2011 sharing the same proposal idea from the 2010 proposed changes. =Service changes (2012)= On June 17, 2012, route R5 was discontinued and route R2 discontinued service to Prince Georges Plaza and instead was rerouted along 23rd avenue and University Boulevard to serve the Lewisdale Neighborhood replacing route R3 which was shorten to Prince Georges Plaza. The only change from the R2 and R3 into Lewisdale was route R3 turned onto Fordham street, while route R2 remained straight along 23rd avenue and turned onto University Boulevard. Service to Prince Georges Plaza was replaced by routes C4 and F4 and TheBus 18. Discontinued service on Riggs Road between East-West Highway and University Boulevard was taken over by routes C4 and R1. The R2's former routing between the intersection of East-West Highway & Riggs Road and Prince George's Plaza station, was replaced by routes C4, F4 and TheBus 18. The rest of the R2's routing between Fort Totten station and the intersection of Riggs Road & East- West Highway, as well as between the intersection of Riggs Road & University Boulevard and Calverton, remained the same. Route R1 was not affected from any of the changes. =Proposed changes (2019)= On December 30, 2018, WMATA announced a proposal to make changes to the R2 routing. One proposal was to extend the R2 beyond Calverton to Muirkirk station on the MARC Camden Line or to Greenbelt station discontinuing the Calverton loop. The second proposal was to eliminate the segment of Route R2 service 23rd Avenue in Lewisdale and discontinue the R1 completely to create a more direct route for the R2 and to simplify the line. The discontinued segments in Lewisdale would be replaced by a rerouted route F8 and the already running TheBus route 18. Route F8 was proposed to make all stops on the proposed discontinued route R2 service in Lewisdale and discontinue service along Adelphi road. If the proposals are made, the R2 would provide a more direct route to Calverton or Fort Totten for customer convenience with the R1 being discontinued due to it being a duplication of the R2. Other proposals mentioned that weren't considered were the following: * Creating a new MetroExtra route for the Riggs Road Line. * Moving either route R1 or R2 terminal to Prince George's Plaza station with the other route remaining at Fort Totten station. * Rerouting route R1 to Takoma Langley Crossroads Transit Center discontinuing service to Adelphi. * Giving route R1 daily service but having route R2 be rerouted to Prince George's Plaza station from Calverton. * Swap route R1 and R2 routing in Lewisdale with R2 remaining on Riggs Road while R1 is rerouted along 23rd Avenue and University Boulevard. None of the proposals went through due to public feedback.

After retreating west across Ukraine for four months and 600 kilometers, the anarchist Makhno Black Army turned east and surprised the White Army. The Black Army reclaimed its capital within ten days.  Background  In mid-June 1919, Andrei Shkuro of the Cossack White Army took advantage of the chaos between the Bolsheviks and anarchists to pillage the village of Huliaipole, burning houses, killing men, raping women, and expropriating loot to the Kuban, similar to what had been done in other peasant villages. The Black Army and thousands of refugees retreated hundreds of kilometers to the west. They crossed the Dnieper at a bridge near Alexandrovsk to reach Yelisavetgrad, run by the ataman Nikifor Grigoriev. Their alliance with him lasted only a month (June 25 to July 27), when the ataman was killed for refusing to fight Anton Denikin's army; Mayer 2014, p. 433. and his participation in the pogroms. The Makhno Black Army continued to Dobrovelichkovka, in southern Ukraine, where they reconciled with the Red Army in early August. They launched counter-offensives that temporarily pushed their targets to the east, but Denikin soon sent reinforcements. The Makhno Black Army continued its western retreat as the White Army arrived in Kursk to the north. After a month of retreat and skirmishes, leaving more than 8,000 wounded, the Black Army arrived in Uman in late August 1919.; . Being on the border of Petliura territory, they decided to negotiate. The nationalists were also at war with the White Army and did not want more enemies. They decided to cease hostilities, exchange prisoners, and let 3,000 Makhnovists attend the nationalist hospitals for two weeks before settling in the village of Tekuche, near Uman.; . Before long, the anarchists came to distrust the nationalists. With Petliura to their north and west, and Denikin to their south and east, by September 25, the White Army had surrounded the Makhno Black Army.  Battle  After four months of western retreat over 600 kilometers, the Black Army decided to turn east and face the White Army in the village of Kruten'koe. The White Army fled in surprise.; . The next day would be a decisive battle for the less than 8,000 remaining guerrillas. The attack began at 03:00 hours. When the White Army lines had not broken after six hours, the Black Army formed in a new assault in which the women joined. This push reduced the White Army's soldiers and machine gun fire. Makhno, who had rode ahead with a cavalry squadron to flank the defenders earlier in the night, attacked from the rear and entered the village with hand-to-hand combat in the streets.; . With this attack from both ends, the White Army fled but was pursued by the Black Army's horsemen, leaving many dead in the fields and hundreds drowned in attempt to ford a nearby river.  Result  About 4,000 White soldiers scattered into the forests to the north, where they were killed by regional peasants. After the victory, the Blacks formed three columns and advanced to the Dnieper, eliminating all enemies. This offensive included 7,000 Whites killed in Alexandrovsk, including 2,500 Chechens. Within ten days, the Black Army had returned to reclaim their capital, take Mariupol, Polohy, Melitopol, and Berdiansk, and other items of worth. They conquered Ekaterinoslav on October 20 and the Whites who took refuge in Taganrog. At the peak of their power, the Makhno anarchists territory ran from the center of the Yekaterinoslav Governorate to the northeast of the Taurida Governorate, an area populated by about three million. The battlezone remained under the command of Ataman Volodin and 6,000 partisans until 1920.  References   Bibliography   *  Further reading  * Telitsyn, V. L.

It is co-hosted by O'Brien's assistant, Sona Movsesian, and producer, Matt Gourley. The podcast debuted in November 2018 and features O'Brien discussing friendship with comedians and actors in the industry, including Jeff Goldblum, Adam Sandler, Stephen Colbert, David Letterman, Will Ferrell, Kristen Bell, Bill Burr, Tom Hanks, and Tina Fey; along with his real friends, such as Lisa Kudrow and Timothy Olyphant; as well as people he admires, such as Michelle Obama, Neil Young, and Robert Caro. Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend has received positive reviews from critics and is one of the top podcasts on iTunes. The first 36 episodes of the podcast were packaged together as one season. A second season consisting of another 36 episodes premiered on October 7, 2019 after a run of six special episodes titled Deep Dive with Dana Carvey. A third season premiered on August 3, 2020. Background Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend premiered November 18, 2018, when O'Brien's talk show was on hiatus and being retooled from an hour-long format into a half-hour format. O'Brien announced, \\"After 25 years of extensive market research, we have learned that people want to hear my voice without seeing my face. So rejoice, America.\\" The title refers to the podcast's premise that O'Brien is only friends with people who work for him, and the friendly conversations he has with celebrities on his talk show rarely translate to lasting friendships, an issue he is looking to fix. Format The podcast episodes opens with the guests stating their names and saying, \\"I feel _____ about being Conan O'Brien's friend\\" in which they state their feelings about their respective friendships with Conan, intercut with guitar music by Jimmy Vivino. This is followed by the show's theme music, \\"We're Going to Be Friends\\" by The White Stripes. The majority of the podcast is then a casual interview between O'Brien and the guest. Sona Movsesian, O'Brien's long-time personal assistant, and Matt Gourley, the podcast's producer, serve as sidekicks. Many of the episodes feature O'Brien periodically reading ads, sometimes introduced as a segment called \\"Conan O'Brien Pays Off the Mortgage on His Beach House\\". To close out the podcast, conversations largely unrelated to the preceding interview are featured, with O'Brien, Movsesian, and Gourley discussing topics including minor workplace squabbles, the success of the podcast, O'Brien's idiosyncrasies, or listeners' messages. Reception =Critical reception= Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend has received strong reviews. Writing for Rolling Stone, Matt Saincome listed it among the best new podcasts of 2018: \\"Instead of the heavily choreographed late-night talk show conversations, listeners are treated to a much more vulnerable, behind the scenes vibe from O'Brien. The dynamic between him and his assistant Sona Movsesian helps with this. The relationship is endearing and serves as a springboard for the listener to get to know Conan better, by hearing how those around him see him.\\" Saincome listed the podcasts with Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard as highlights among the first few episodes, writing, \\"All episodes of this podcast are worth a listen so far, but the one-two punch of Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard stood out for the genuine warmth and discussion of Conan's personal life.\\" In his review for Vulture, Nicholas Quah praised O'Brien as a stellar podcast host in a very crowded field, writing, \\"His weirdness translates well to the casual intimacy that's come to define the podcast as a platform for performance, and his default stance of efficient self-deprecation makes the show feel accessible in ways that other comedy podcasts, fronted by needier ids, may not.\\" Quah also praised the dynamic among O'Brien and his sidekicks on the show, Sona Movsesian and Matt Gourley: \\"It also helps that O'Brien is great at the performance of longer-form interviews, effectively balancing the impulse of filling the room with being genuinely curious, and there's also a lot of charm to be found in the podcast, particularly in the core O'Brien-Movsesian-Gourley workplace dynamic, which goes a long way to providing listeners with a sheen of habitual comfort.\\" In an article for The Boston Globe, Joshua Macht noted that O'Brien establishing a weekly podcast confirmed that podcasting is no longer on the fringes of the digital audio market. Macht writes, \\"The arrival of heavy hitters such as Conan O'Brien may not signal the end of podcasting‚Äîor even the peak‚Äîbut it will usher in a new phase for the medium.\\" In a review for BBC Radio 4's Podcast Radio Hour, Jake Yapp celebrated the \\"sincerity and openness\\" of the show, despite its strong humor content. Yapp also praised the parity between guest and host, despite the many outstanding comedians on the podcast, and noted that there was a sincere lack of one-upmanship common among comedians. According to Irish writer Mark Farrelly, who called the podcast an \\"auditory delight\\", the podcast has been developing a \\"cult following\\" in the British Isles. Farrelly also praised the unexpected humor in the \\"Conan O'Brien Pays Off the Mortgage on His Beach House\\" segments, with O'Brien \\"showing his genius by turning live reads into top notch comedy material.\\" O'Brien's success as a podcast host was the cover story of the August 20, 2019, issue of Variety magazine, in which he was dubbed \\"the darling of the podcasting world.\\" That day, Marc Maron appeared on Conan with the issue, jokingly taking offense that O'Brien had been dubbed a pioneer of the medium after approximately 30 episodes, whereas Maron had done more than 1,000 at that point. =Downloads= Matt Gourley stated in the May 12, 2019 episode featuring Bill Hader, that each episode receives one million downloads in its first cycle, shortly after release, which Variety referred to as \\"blockbuster numbers for a podcast.\\" Episodes =Series overview= =Season 1 (2018‚Äì19)= = Deep Dive with Dana Carvey (2019)= =Season 2 (2019‚Äì2020)= Episodes 37, 38, and 39 were rereleases of the Jeff Goldblum, Michelle Obama, and Bob Newhart episodes respectively. = Summer S'mores (& Tom Hanks) (2020)= =Season 3 (2020‚Äìpresent)= References External links * Category:2018 podcast debuts Category:Audio podcasts Category:Comedy and humor podcasts Category:Conan O'Brien Category:Interview podcasts Category:Earwolf ","title":"Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend"},{"id":"59732519","text":"Donji Ka≈°iƒá is a village in Croatia, in the municipality/town of Benkovac, Zadar County.

The church is part of the Ashburton benefice, of the Church of England Diocese of Exeter, and the building is Grade I listed.  History  The church dates from the fifteenth century; it is first mentioned in the register of Bishop Lacey in 1420 when it was described as a daughter Church of Ashburton.St Mary the Virgin Bickington - A Short History Sept 2012 It is suspected the church is built on a pre-Norman Christian burial ground. The clues being the deviation of an old lane from Chipley to the moor which doglegs past the building, and the circular raised churchyard. The present church was built in 1443, and the north aisle built in the 16th century; although there are references to an earlier church. It is not known who financed the building of the church at Bickington. The only house with features of the period is East Burn although in both Herebere and Ramshorn we also find carved mantles, an indication of a fair amount of disposable wealth. These are very difficult to date precisely, but are similar to that found in Church House which is dated to around 1500. These are but possibilities. It is likely that Thomas Shabbetour and John made their contribution to the building of the church, but the task, even in a small church such as Bickington's, called for a considerable amount of money. In 1842 Bickington was constituted as a Parish by order in Council. However, in 1952 by order of the Church Commissioners the Parish was ecclesiastically reunited with Ashburton and the vicarage was sold. The church once again became a daughter Church of Ashburton in 2006. The church was extensively restored in 1884 and the vicarage was built at the same time on the site of a fifteenth century Curate's house which was pulled down. The total cost of restoring the church and building the vicarage was ¬£2,114. The church itself is built of limestone and has an embattled tower of two stages complete with restored pinnacles a stair turret on the south side. All the exterior of the church and the whole of the south walls were renewed at the time of the restoration. The stalls were restored by Hems of Exeter and Harry Hems was responsible for most of the carving in the church including the lectern and credence table. The Reredos carving which is particularly worthy of note was designed by R. Medley Fulford of Exeter. It was a gift of the Reverend William Smith who was the vicar at this time (1887). The screen was demolished in 1825 and only a few portions remain, some showing linen fold carving which was incorporated into the sedila on the south side and into the modern low screen and the choir stalls. The screen extends across the north chapel which is known as the \\"Wrigwell Pew\\". The Bickford family owned estates including Wrigwell in Bickington for 600 years and many memorials to the family can be seen around the church. The building was recorded as Grade I listed in 1955.  Lych gate  Lychgate as seen approaching from the Barton The 15th-century lych gate on the south side was rebuilt in 1901. It was designed by the Reverend R. M. Fulford to resemble as near as possible the original gate; the carved beams of the wooden structure were retained but all the rest was replaced. On the east side of the gate is a small chamber on the ground floor, whilst the upper floor is approached by a flight of steps. This room has been used variously to house two of the poor of the parish, as a changing room for the priest-in-charge when he came from Ashburton, as a meeting room by the Mothers Union, a meeting place for the Parochial Church Council, a venue for the youth club and as a cobbler's shop.  Bells  Of the church bells Ellacombe recorded \\"In 1553 there were at Beckunton 111 belles in the tower‚Äù. Two of the bells were recast in the seventeenth century and all the bells were overhauled in 1960 and retuned, quarter turned and rehung in a new wooden frame with new fittings for the hand chimes, this was done by John Taylor of Loughborough.

The following list is composed of objects, (largely) unknown lands, breakthrough ideas/concepts, principles, phenomena, processes, methods, techniques, styles etc., that were discovered or invented (or pioneered) by people from the Netherlands and Dutch-speaking people from the former Southern Netherlands (Zuid-Nederlanders in Dutch). Until the fall of Antwerp (1585), the Dutch and Flemish were generally seen as one people.Frisians, specifically West Frisians, are an ethnic group; present in the North of the Netherlands; mainly concentrating in the Province of Friesland. Culturally, modern Frisians and the (Northern) Dutch are rather similar; the main and generally most important difference being that Frisians speak West Frisian, one of the three sub- branches of the Frisian languages, alongside Dutch. West Frisians in the general do not feel or see themselves as part of a larger group of Frisians, and, according to a 1970 inquiry, identify themselves more with the Dutch than with East or North Frisians. Because of centuries of cohabitation and active participation in Dutch society, as well as being bilingual, the Frisians are not treated as a separate group in Dutch official statistics.  Inventions and innovations  = Arts and architecture =  Movements and styles  = De Stijl (Neo-Plasticism) (1917) = The De Stijl school proposed simplicity and abstraction, both in architecture and painting, by using only straight horizontal and vertical lines and rectangular forms. Furthermore, their formal vocabulary was limited to the primary colours, red, yellow, and blue and the three primary values, black, white and grey. De Stijl's principal members were painters Theo van Doesburg (1883‚Äì1931), Piet Mondrian (1872‚Äì1944), Vilmos Husz√°r (1884‚Äì1960), and Bart van der Leck (1876‚Äì1958) and architects Gerrit Rietveld (1888‚Äì1964), Robert van 't Hoff (1888‚Äì1979) and J.J.P. Oud (1890‚Äì1963).  Architecture  = Brabantine Gothic architecture (14th century) = Brabantine Gothic, occasionally called Brabantian Gothic, is a significant variant of Gothic architecture that is typical for the Low Countries. It surfaced in the first half of the 14th century at Saint Rumbold's Cathedral in the City of Mechelen. The Brabantine Gothic style originated with the advent of the Duchy of Brabant and spread across the Burgundian Netherlands. = Netherlandish gabled architecture (15th‚Äì17th centuries) = Frederiksborg Castle (Hiller√∏d, Denmark) was built as a royal residence for King Christian IV of Denmark. The majority of the present castle was built between 1600 and 1620 in Dutch Renaissance style with red brick fa√ßade, sweeping gables, and sandstone decorations. B√∏rsen, Copenhagen's old stock exchange, was designed by Lorentz and Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger and is the oldest stock exchange in Denmark. Dutch Renaissance gabled fa√ßade of the House of Blackheads (Riga's Old Town). The original building was erected during the first third of the 14th century for the Brotherhood of Blackheads, a guild for unmarried German merchants in Riga. The Dutch Renaissance/Mannerist style (with typically Dutch gables and red Dutch brick fa√ßades) blossomed more fully in Nordic countries and Hanseatic cities than in its homeland. Great Armoury in Gda≈Ñsk/Danzig, Poland. It was built in typically Dutch Mannerist style with a stepped-gable fa√ßade of red Dutch brick and sandstone decorations. The Green Gate (Brama Zielona) is one of the most notable tourist attractions in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland. It was built between 1568 and 1571 in the Netherlandic/Dutch Mannerist style with a typically Dutch gable fa√ßade. The Baiturrahman Grand Mosque in the center of Banda Aceh city, Aceh Province, Indonesia. The mosque was built (1879) in Dutch East Indies architectural style with the combination of occidental and oriental features. The mosque's stepped gables (trapgevel in Dutch) are reminiscent of Dutch Renaissance architectural style. The Dutch gable was a notable feature of the Dutch-Flemish Renaissance architecture (or Northern Mannerist architecture) that spread to northern Europe from the Low Countries, arriving in Britain during the latter part of the 16th century. Notable castles/buildings including Frederiksborg Castle, Rosenborg Castle, Kronborg Castle, B√∏rsen, Riga's House of the Blackheads and Gda≈Ñsk's Green Gate were built in Dutch-Flemish Renaissance style with sweeping gables, sandstone decorations and copper-covered roofs. Later Dutch gables with flowing curves became absorbed into Baroque architecture. Examples of Dutch-gabled buildings can be found in historic cities across Europe such as Potsdam (Dutch Quarter), Friedrichstadt, Gda≈Ñsk and Gothenburg. The style spread beyond Europe, for example Barbados is well known for Dutch gables on its historic buildings. Dutch settlers in South Africa brought with them building styles from the Netherlands: Dutch gables, then adjusted to the Western Cape region where the style became known as Cape Dutch architecture. In the Americas and Northern Europe, the West End Collegiate Church (New York City, 1892), the Chicago Varnish Company Building (Chicago, 1895), Pont Street Dutch-style buildings (London, 1800s), Helsing√∏r Station (Helsing√∏r, 1891), and Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology's Main Building (Gda≈Ñsk, 1904) are typical examples of the Dutch Renaissance Revival (Neo-Renaissance) architecture in the late 19th century. = Netherlandish Mannerist architecture (Antwerp Mannerism) (16th century) = Antwerp Mannerism is the name given to the style of a largely anonymous group of painters from Antwerp in the beginning of the 16th century. The style bore no direct relation to Renaissance or Italian Mannerism, but the name suggests a peculiarity that was a reaction to the classic style of the early Netherlandish painting. Antwerp Mannerism may also be used to describe the style of architecture, which is loosely Mannerist, developed in Antwerp by about 1540, which was then influential all over Northern Europe. The Green Gate (Brama Zielona) in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland, is a building which is inspired by the Antwerp City Hall. It was built between 1568 and 1571 by Regnier van Amsterdam and Hans Kramer to serve as the formal residence of the Polish monarchs when visiting Gda≈Ñsk. = Cape Dutch architecture (1650s) = Cape Dutch architecture is an architectural style found in the Western Cape of South Africa. The style was prominent in the early days (17th century) of the Cape Colony, and the name derives from the fact that the initial settlers of the Cape were primarily Dutch. The style has roots in medieval Netherlands, Germany, France and Indonesia. Houses in this style have a distinctive and recognisable design, with a prominent feature being the grand, ornately rounded gables, reminiscent of features in townhouses of Amsterdam built in the Dutch style. = Amsterdam School (Dutch Expressionist architecture) (1910s) = The Amsterdam School (Dutch: Amsterdamse School) flourished from 1910 through about 1930 in the Netherlands. The Amsterdam School movement is part of international Expressionist architecture, sometimes linked to German Brick Expressionism. = Rietveld Schr√∂der House (De Stijl architecture) (1924) = The exterior of the Rietveld Schr√∂der House. The Rietveld Schr√∂der House (Rietveld Schr√∂derhuis) is considered one of the icons of the Modern architecture. With its radical approach to design and the use of space, the Rietveld Schr√∂derhuis occupies a seminal position in the development of architecture in the modern age. The Rietveld Schr√∂der House or Schr√∂der House (Rietveld Schr√∂derhuis in Dutch) in Utrecht was built in 1924 by Dutch architect Gerrit Rietveld. It became a listed monument in 1976 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000. The Rietveld Schr√∂der House constitutes both inside and outside a radical break with tradition, offering little distinction between interior and exterior space. The rectilinear lines and planes flow from outside to inside, with the same colour palette and surfaces. Inside is a dynamic, changeable open zone rather than a static accumulation of rooms. The house is one of the best known examples of De Stijl architecture and arguably the only true De Stijl building.Hertzberger, Herman (1991).

Women and the Making of the Modern House: A Social and Architectural History, p. 65 = Van Nelle Factory (1925‚Äì1931) = The Van Nelle factory was built between 1925 and 1931. Its most striking feature is its huge glass fa√ßades. The factory was designed on the premise that a modern, transparent and healthy working environment in green surroundings would be good both for production and for workers' welfare. The factory had a huge impact on the development of modern architecture in Europe and elsewhere. The Van Nelle Factory is a Dutch national monument (Rijksmonument) and since 2014 has the status of UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Justification of Outstanding Universal Value was presented in 2013 to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee. = Super Dutch (1990‚Äìpresent) = An architectural movement started by a generation of new architects during the 1990, among this generation of architects were OMA, MVRDV, UNStudio, Mecanoo, Meyer en Van Schooten and many more. They started with buildings, which became internationally known for their new and refreshing style. After which Super Dutch Architecture spread out across the globe.  Furniture  = Dutch door (17th century) = A Dutch door with the top half open, in South Africa The Dutch door (also known as stable door or half door) is a type of door divided horizontally in such a fashion that the bottom half may remain shut while the top half opens. The initial purpose of this door was to keep animals out of farmhouses, while keeping children inside, yet allowing light and air to filter through the open top. This type of door was common in the Netherlands in the seventeenth century and appears in Dutch paintings of the period. They were commonly found in Dutch areas of New York and New Jersey (before the American Revolution) and in South Africa.\\"Dutch door (American) (34.79a,b)\\". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000 (October 2006) = Red and Blue Chair (1917) = A Rietveld joint, also called a Cartesian node in furniture-making, is an overlapping joint of three battens in the three orthogonal directions. It was a prominent feature in the Red and Blue Chair that was designed by Gerrit Rietveld in 1917. Rietveld joints are inextricably linked with the early 20th century Dutch artistic movement called De Stijl (of which Gerrit Rietveld was a member). The Red and Blue Chair was designed in 1917 by Gerrit Rietveld. It represents one of the first explorations by the De Stijl art movement in three dimensions. It features several Rietveld joints. = Zig-Zag Chair (1934) = The Zig-Zag Chair was designed by Rietveld in 1934. It is a minimalist design without legs, made by 4 flat wooden tiles that are merged in a Z-shape using Dovetail joints. It was designed for the Rietveld Schr√∂der House in Utrecht.  Visual arts  = Foundations of modern oil painting (15th century) = Signature of Jan van Eyck. Jan Van Eyck is often credited as the first master of oil painting. Although oil paint was first used for Buddhist paintings by Indian and Chinese painters sometime between the fifth and tenth centuries, it did not gain notoriety until the 15th century. Its practice may have migrated westward during the Middle Ages. Oil paint eventually became the principal medium used for creating artworks as its advantages became widely known. The transition began with Early Netherlandish painting in northern Europe, and by the height of the Renaissance oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced tempera paints in the majority of Europe. Early Netherlandish painting (Jan van Eyck in particular) in the 15th century was the first to make oil the default painting medium, and to explore the use of layers and glazes, followed by the rest of Northern Europe, and only then Italy.Ione, Amy (2005).

Als ich can: How Jan van Eyck Extended the Vernacular from Dutch Poetry to Oil Painting in The Transformation of Vernacular Expression in Early Modern Arts, edited by Joost Keizer and Todd M. Richardson (2012) = Glaze (painting technique) (15th century) = Glazing is a technique employed by painters since the invention of modern oil painting. Early Netherlandish painters in the 15th century were the first to make oil the usual painting medium, and explore the use of layers and glazes, followed by the rest of Northern Europe, and only then Italy. = Proto-Realism (15th‚Äì17th centuries) = Two aspects of realism were rooted in at least two centuries of Dutch tradition: conspicuous textural imitation and a penchant for ordinary and exaggeratedly comic scenes. Two hundred years before the rise of literary realism, Dutch painters had already made an art of the everyday ‚Äì pictures that served as a compelling model for the later novelists. By the mid-1800s, 17th-century Dutch painting figured virtually everywhere in the British and French fiction we esteem today as the vanguard of realism. = Proto-Surrealism (1470s‚Äì1510s) = Hieronymus Bosch is considered one of the prime examples of Pre-Surrealism. The surrealists relied most on his insights. In the 20th century, Bosch's paintings (e.g. The Garden of Earthly Delights, The Haywain, The Temptation of St. Anthony and The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things) were cited by the Surrealists as precursors to their own visions. = Modern still-life painting (16th‚Äì17th century) = Still-life painting as an independent genre or specialty first flourished in the Netherlands in the last quarter of the 16th century, and the English term derives from stilleven: still life, which is a calque, while Romance languages (as well as Greek, Polish, Russian and Turkish) tend to use terms meaning dead nature. = Naturalistic landscape painting (16th‚Äì17th century) = The Windmill at Wijk by Jacob van Ruisdael (1670). It is a commonplace of art history that the genre of \\"naturalistic landscape painting\\" first emerged in Holland in the seventeenth century. The word \\"landscape\\" entered the modern English language as landskip (variously spelt), an anglicization of the Dutch landschap, around the start of the 17th century. The 17th-century Dutch landscape art had considerable influences on the British landscape art, American Hudson River School, and French Barbizon School in subsequent centuries. The term \\"landscape\\" derives from the Dutch word landschap (and the German Landschaft), which originally meant \\"region, tract of land\\" but acquired the artistic connotation, \\"a picture depicting scenery on land\\" in the early 16th century. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the tradition of depicting pure landscapes declined and the landscape was seen only as a setting for religious and figural scenes. This tradition continued until the 16th century when artists began to view the landscape as a subject in its own right. The Dutch Golden Age painting of the 17th century saw the dramatic growth of landscape painting, in which many artists specialized, and the development of extremely subtle realist techniques for depicting light and weather. = Genre painting (15th century) = The Flemish Renaissance painter Pieter Brueghel the Elder chose peasants and their activities as the subject of many paintings. Genre painting flourished in Northern Europe in his wake. Adriaen van Ostade, David Teniers, Aelbert Cuyp, Jan Steen, Johannes Vermeer and Pieter de Hooch were among many painters specializing in genre subjects in the Netherlands during the 17th century. The generally small scale of these artists' paintings was appropriate for their display in the homes of middle class purchasers. = Marine painting (17th century) = The genre of marine painting as a distinct category separate from landscape is attributed to Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom from early in the seventeenth century. Marine painting began in keeping with medieval Christian art tradition. Such works portrayed the sea only from a bird's eye view, and everything, even the waves, was organized and symmetrical. The viewpoint, symmetry and overall order of these early paintings underlined the organization of the heavenly cosmos from which the earth was viewed. Later Dutch artists such as Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom, Cornelius Claesz, Abraham Storck, Jan Porcellis, Simon de Vlieger, Willem van de Velde the Elder, Willem van de Velde the Younger and Ludolf Bakhuizen developed new methods for painting, often from a horizontal point of view, with a lower horizon and more focus on realism than symmetry.Russel, Margarita (1983). Visions of the Sea: Hendrick C. Vroom and the Origins of Dutch Marine PaintingUnger, Richard W. (1996). Marine Paintings and the History of Shipbuilding (p. 75‚Äì93) in Art in History/History in Art: Studies in Seventeenth-Century Dutch Culture, edited by David Freedberg and Jan de Vries (1996) = Vanitas (17th century) = The term vanitas is most often associated with still life paintings that were popular in seventeenth-century Dutch art, produced by the artists such as Pieter Claesz. Common vanitas symbols included skulls (a reminder of the certainty of death); rotten fruit (decay); bubbles, (brevity of life and suddenness of death); smoke, watches, and hourglasses, (the brevity of life); and musical instruments (the brevity and ephemeral nature of life). Fruit, flowers and butterflies can be interpreted in the same way, while a peeled lemon, as well as the typical accompanying seafood was, like life, visually attractive but with a bitter flavor. = Civil group portraiture (17th century) = Group portraits were produced in great numbers during the Baroque period, particularly in the Netherlands. Unlike in the rest of Europe, Dutch artists received no commissions from the Calvinist Church which had forbidden such images or from the aristocracy which was virtually non- existent. Instead, commissions came from civic and businesses associations. Dutch painter Frans Hals used fluid brush strokes of vivid color to enliven his group portraits, including those of the civil guard to which he belonged. Rembrandt benefitted greatly from such commissions and from the general appreciation of art by bourgeois clients, who supported portraiture as well as still-life and landscape painting. Notably, the world's first significant art and dealer markets flourished in Holland at that time. = Tronie (17th century) = Girl with a Pearl Earring (1665), Vermeer's masterpiece is often considered as a \\"tronie\\". In the 17th century, Dutch painters (especially Frans Hals, Rembrandt, Jan Lievens and Johannes Vermeer) began to create uncommissioned paintings called tronies that focused on the features and/or expressions of people who were not intended to be identifiable. They were conceived more for art's sake than to satisfy conventions. The tronie was a distinctive type of painting, combining elements of the portrait, history, and genre painting. This was usually a half-length of a single figure which concentrated on capturing an unusual mood or expression. The actual identity of the model was not supposed to be important, but they might represent a historical figure and be in exotic or historic costume. In contrast to portraits, \\"tronies\\" were painted for the open market. They differ from figurative paintings and religious figures in that they are not restricted to a moral or narrative context. It is, rather, much more an exploration of the spectrum of human physiognomy and expression and the reflection of conceptions of character that are intrinsic to psychology's pre-history. = Rembrandt lighting (17th century) = The typical Rembrandt lighting setup. Rembrandt's treatment of light and dark in his portraiture created a style of lighting known today as Rembrandt lighting. Rembrandt lighting technique is used by many modern photographers and cinematographers. Rembrandt lighting is a lighting technique that is used in studio portrait photography. It can be achieved using one light and a reflector, or two lights, and is popular because it is capable of producing images which appear both natural and compelling with a minimum of equipment. Rembrandt lighting is characterized by an illuminated triangle under the eye of the subject, on the less illuminated side of the face. It is named for the Dutch painter Rembrandt, who often used this type of lighting in his portrait paintings.  Mezzotint (1642)  The first known mezzotint was done in Amsterdam in 1642 by Utrecht-born German artist Ludwig von Siegen. He lived in Amsterdam from 1641 to about 1644, when he was supposedly influenced by Rembrandt.Hind, Arthur M. (1963). A History of Engraving and Etching, p. 261Martin, Henri-Jean (1994). The History and Power of Writing, p. 407  Aquatint (1650s)  The painter and printmaker Jan van de Velde is often credited to be the inventor of the aquatint technique, in Amsterdam around 1650. = Pronkstilleven (1650s) = Pronkstilleven (pronk still life or ostentatious still life) is a type of banquet piece whose distinguishing feature is a quality of ostentation and splendor. These still lifes usually depict one or more especially precious objects. Although the term is a post-17th century invention, this type is characteristic of the second half of the seventeenth century. It was developed in the 1640s in Antwerp from where it spread quickly to the Dutch Republic. Flemish artists such as Frans Snyders and Adriaen van Utrecht started to paint still lifes that emphasized abundance by depicting a diversity of objects, fruits, flowers and dead game, often together with living people and animals. The style was soon adopted by artists from the Dutch Republic.Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms: Pronkstilleven A leading Dutch representative was Jan Davidsz. de Heem, who spent a long period of his active career in Antwerp and was one of the founders of the style in Holland.Jan Davidsz. de Heem at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Ben van Beneden, Massijs, Rubens, Van Dyck en de anderen. Schilderkunst in Antwerpen, 1500‚Äì1650 Other leading representatives in the Dutch Republic were Abraham van Beyeren, Willem Claeszoon Heda and Willem Kalf. = Proto-Expressionism (1880s) = Vincent van Gogh's work is most often associated with Post-Impressionism, but his innovative style had a vast influence on 20th-century art and established what would later be known as Expressionism, also greatly influencing fauvism and early abstractionism. His impact on German and Austrian Expressionists was especially profound. \\"Van Gogh was father to us all,\\" the German Expressionist painter Max Pechstein proclaimed in 1901, when Van Gogh's vibrant oils were first shown in Germany and triggered the artistic reformation, a decade after his suicide in obscurity in France. In his final letter to Theo, Van Gogh stated that, as he had no children, he viewed his paintings as his progeny. Reflecting on this, the British art historian Simon Schama concluded that he \\"did have a child of course, Expressionism, and many, many heirs.\\" = M. C. Escher's graphic arts (1920s‚Äì1960s) = Dutch graphic artist Maurits Cornelis Escher, usually referred to as M. C. Escher, is known for his often mathematically inspired woodcuts, lithographs, and mezzotints. These feature impossible constructions, explorations of infinity, architecture and tessellations. His special way of thinking and rich graphic work has had a continuous influence in science and art, as well as permeating popular culture. His ideas have been used in fields as diverse as psychology, philosophy, logic, crystallography and topology. His art is based on mathematical principles like tessellations, spherical geometry, the M√∂bius strip, unusual perspectives, visual paradoxes and illusions, different kinds of symmetries and impossible objects. G√∂del, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter discusses the ideas of self-reference and strange loops, drawing on a wide range of artistic and scientific work, including Escher's art and the music of J. S. Bach, to illustrate ideas behind G√∂del's incompleteness theorems. = Miffy (Nijntje) (1955) = Miffy (Nijntje) is a small female rabbit in a series of picture books drawn and written by Dutch artist Dick Bruna.  Music  = Franco-Flemish School (Netherlandish School) (15th‚Äì16th century) = In music, the Franco- Flemish School or more precisely the Netherlandish school refers to the style of polyphonic vocal music composition in the Burgundian Netherlands in the 15th and early 16th centuries, and to the composers who wrote it. = Venetian School (Venetian polychoral style) (16th century) = The Venetian School of polychoral music was founded by the Netherlandish composer Adrian Willaert. = Hardcore (electronic dance music genre) (1990s) = Hardcore or hardcore techno is a subgenre of electronic dance music originating in Europe from the emergent raves in the 1990s. It was initially designed at Rotterdam in Netherlands, derived from techno. = Hardstyle (electronic dance music genre) (1990s‚Äì2000s) = Hardstyle is an electronic dance genre mixing influences from hardtechno and hardcore. Hardstyle was influenced by gabber. Hardstyle has its origins in the Netherlands where artists like DJ Zany, Lady Dana, DJ Isaac, DJ Pavo, DJ Luna and The Prophet, who produced hardcore, started experimenting while playing their hardcore records. = Agriculture =  Holstein Friesian cattle (2nd century BC)  A typical Holstein-Friesian cow. Holstein cattle, a breed that now dominates the global dairy industry, are most quickly recognized by their distinctive color markings and outstanding milk production. Holsteins or Holstein-Friesians are a breed of cattle known today as the world's highest-production dairy animals. Originating in Europe, Holstein-Friesians were bred in the two northern provinces of North Holland and Friesland, and Schleswig-Holstein in what became Germany. The animals were the regional cattle of the Frisians and the Saxons. The origins of the breed can be traced to the black cows and white cows of the Batavians and Frisians ‚Äì migrant tribes who settled the coastal Rhine region more than two thousand years ago.  Brussels sprout ( 13th century)  Forerunners to modern Brussels sprouts were likely cultivated in ancient Rome. Brussels sprouts as we now know them were grown possibly as early as the 13th century in the Low Countries (may have originated in Brussels). The first written reference dates to 1587. During the 16th century, they enjoyed a popularity in the Southern Netherlands that eventually spread throughout the cooler parts of Northern Europe.  Orange-coloured carrot (16th century)  Orange-coloured carrots. Before the 18th century, carrots from Asia were usually purple, while those in Europe were either white or red. Dutch farmers bred a variety that was orange. The long orange Dutch carrot, first described in 1721, is the ancestor of the orange horn carrot, one of the most common types found in supermarkets today. It takes its name from the town of Hoorn, in the Netherlands. selectively bred to produce different colours. Through history, carrots weren't always orange. They were black, purple, white, brown, red and yellow. Probably orange too, but this was not the dominant colour. Orange-coloured carrots appeared in the Netherlands in the 16th century. Dutch farmers in Hoorn bred the color. They succeeded by cross- breeding pale yellow with red carrots. It is more likely that Dutch horticulturists actually found an orange rooted mutant variety and then worked on its development through selective breeding to make the plant consistent. Through successive hybridisation the orange colour intensified. This was developed to become the dominant species across the world, a sweet orange.  Belle de Boskoop (apple) (1856)  Belle de Boskoop is an apple cultivar which, as its name suggests, originated in Boskoop, where it began as a chance seedling in 1856. There are many variants: Boskoop red, yellow or green. This rustic apple is firm, tart and fragrant. Greenish-gray tinged with red, the apple stands up well to cooking. Generally Boskoop varieties are very high in acid content and can contain more than four times the vitamin C of 'Granny Smith' or 'Golden Delicious'.Violeta, N. O. U. R., Ion Trandafir, and Mira Elena Ionica. \\"Compositional characteristics of fruits of several apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) cultivars.\\" Notulae Botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca 38.3 (2010): 228‚Äì33.  Karmijn de Sonnaville (apple) (1949)  Karmijn de Sonnaville is a variety of apple bred by Piet de Sonnaville, working in Wageningen in 1949. It is a cross of Cox's Orange Pippin and Jonathan, and was first grown commercially beginning in 1971. It is high both in sugars (including some sucrose) and acidity. It is a triploid, and hence needs good pollination, and can be difficult to grow. It also suffers from fruit russet, which can be severe. In Manhart's book, \\"apples for the 21st century\\", Karmijn de Sonnaville is tipped as a possible success for the future. Karmijn de Sonnaville is not widely grown in large quantities, but in Ireland, at The Apple Farm, it is grown for fresh sale and juice-making, for which the variety is well suited.  Elstar (apple) (1950s)  Elstar apple is an apple cultivar that was first developed in the Netherlands in the 1950s by crossing Golden Delicious and Ingrid Marie apples. It quickly became popular, especially in Europe and was first introduced to America in 1972.Elstar profile on cffresh.com It remains popular in Continental Europe. The Elstar is a medium-sized apple whose skin is mostly red with yellow showing. The flesh is white, and has a soft, crispy texture. It may be used for cooking and is especially good for making apple sauce. In general, however, it is used in desserts due to its sweet flavour.  Groasis Waterboxx (2010)  The Groasis Waterboxx is a device designed to help grow trees in dry areas. It was developed by former flower exporter Pieter Hoff, and won Popular Science's \\"Green Tech Best of What's New\\" Innovation of the year award for 2010. = Cartography and geography =  Method for determining longitude using a clock (1530)  The Dutch-Frisian geographer Gemma Frisius was the first to propose the use of a chronometer to determine longitude in 1530. In his book On the Principles of Astronomy and Cosmography (1530), Frisius explains for the first time how to use a very accurate clock to determine longitude.Allaby, Michael (2009). Oceans: A Scientific History of Oceans and Marine Life (Discovering the Earth) The problem was that in Frisius‚Äô day, no clock was sufficiently precise to use his method. In 1761, the British clock-builder John Harrison constructed the first marine chronometer, which allowed the method developed by Frisius.  Triangulation and the modern systematic use of triangulation networks (1533 and 1615)'  Triangulation had first emerged as a map-making method in the mid sixteenth century when the Dutch-Frisian mathematician Gemma Frisius set out the idea in his Libellus de locorum describendorum ratione (Booklet concerning a way of describing places).Swann, G.

The Grapes of Math: How Life Reflects Numbers and Numbers Reflect Life, p. 74 Dutch cartographer Jacob van Deventer was among the first to make systematic use of triangulation, the technique whose theory was described by Gemma Frisius in his 1533 book. The modern systematic use of triangulation networks stems from the work of the Dutch mathematician Willebrord Snell (born Willebrord Snel van Royen), who in 1615 surveyed the distance from Alkmaar to Bergen op Zoom, approximately 70 miles (110 kilometres), using a chain of quadrangles containing 33 triangles in allKirby, Richard Shelton et al.

Mercator projection (1569)  Mercator map of the world (Nova et Aucta Orbis Terrae Descriptio ad Usum Navigantium Emendate Accommodata). The Mercator projection is a cylindrical map projection presented by the Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569. It became the standard map projection for nautical purposes because of its ability to represent lines of constant course, known as rhumb lines or loxodromes, as straight segments which conserve the angles with the meridians.Haven, Kendall (2005). 100 Greatest Science Inventions of All Time, p. 51  First modern world atlas (1570)  World map Theatrum Orbis Terrarum by Ortelius (1570). The period of late 16th and much of the 17th century (approximately 1570‚Äì1672) has been called the \\"Golden Age of Dutch (Netherlandish) Cartography\\". The cartographers/publishers of Antwerp and Amsterdam, especially, were leaders in supplying maps and charts for all of Western Europe. Flemish geographer and cartographer Abraham Ortelius generally recognized as the creator of the world's first modern atlas, the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (Theatre of the World). Ortelius's Theatrum Orbis Terrarum is considered the first true atlas in the modern sense: a collection of uniform map sheets and sustaining text bound to form a book for which copper printing plates were specifically engraved. It is sometimes referred to as the summary of sixteenth-century cartography.Harwood, Jeremy (2006). To the Ends of the Earth: 100 Maps that Changed the World, p. 83Woodward, David (1987).

Maps and Civilization: Cartography in Culture and Society, Third Edition, p. 81  First printed atlas of nautical charts (1584)  Waghenaer (1584). The publication of Waghenaer's De Spieghel der Zeevaerdt (1584) is widely considered as one of the most important developments in the history of nautical cartography. The first printed atlas of nautical charts (De Spieghel der Zeevaerdt or The Mirror of Navigation / The Mariner's Mirror) was produced by Lucas Janszoon Waghenaer in Leiden. This atlas was the first attempt to systematically codify nautical maps. This chart-book combined an atlas of nautical charts and sailing directions with instructions for navigation on the western and north-western coastal waters of Europe. It was the first of its kind in the history of maritime cartography, and was an immediate success. The English translation of Waghenaer's work was published in 1588 and became so popular that any volume of sea charts soon became known as a \\"waggoner\\", the Anglicized form of Waghenaer's surname.Struik, Dirk J.

Gerardus Mercator was the first to coin the word atlas to describe a bound collection of maps through his own collection entitled \\"Atlas sive Cosmographicae meditationes de fabrica mvndi et fabricati figvra\\". He coined this name after the Greek god who held The Sky up, later changed to holding up The Earth.Harwood, Jeremy (2006). To the Ends of the Earth: 100 Maps that Changed the World, p. 81  First systematic charting of the far southern skies (southern constellations) (1595‚Äì97)  map (chart) the largely unknown far southern skies in the late 16th century. Among the IAU's 88 modern constellations, there are 15 Dutch- created constellations, including 12 southern constellations. The Dutch Republic's explorers and cartographers like Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser, Frederick de Houtman, Petrus Plancius and Jodocus Hondius were the pioneers in first systematic charting/mapping of largely unknown southern hemisphere skies in the late 16th century. The constellations around the South Pole were not observable from north of the equator, by Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese or Arabs. The modern constellations in this region were defined during the Age of Exploration, notably by Dutch navigators Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman at the end of sixteenth century. These twelve Dutch-created southern constellations represented flora and fauna of the East Indies and Madagascar. They were depicted by Johann Bayer in his star atlas Uranometria of 1603. Several more were created by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in his star catalogue, published in 1756. By the end of the Ming dynasty, Xu Guangqi introduced 23 asterisms of the southern sky based on the knowledge of western star charts. These asterisms have since been incorporated into the traditional Chinese star maps. Among the IAU's 88 modern constellations, there are 15 Dutch-created constellations (including Apus, Camelopardalis, Chamaeleon, Columba, Dorado, Grus, Hydrus, Indus, Monoceros, Musca, Pavo, Phoenix, Triangulum Australe, Tucana and Volans).  Continental drift hypothesis (1596)  The speculation that continents might have 'drifted' was first put forward by Abraham Ortelius in 1596. The concept was independently and more fully developed by Alfred Wegener in 1912. Because Wegener's publications were widely available in German and English and because he adduced geological support for the idea, he is credited by most geologists as the first to recognize the possibility of continental drift. During the 1960s geophysical and geological evidence for seafloor spreading at mid-oceanic ridges established continental drift as the standard theory or continental origin and an ongoing global mechanism. = Chemicals and materials =  Bow dye (1630)  While making a coloured liquid for a thermometer, Cornelis Drebbel dropped a flask of Aqua regia on a tin window sill, and discovered that stannous chloride makes the color of carmine much brighter and more durable. Though Drebbel himself never made much from his work, his daughters Anna and Catharina and his sons-in-law Abraham and Johannes Sibertus Kuffler set up a successful dye works. One was set up in 1643 in Bow, London, and the resulting color was called bow dye.  Dyneema (1979)  Dutch chemical company DSM invented and patented the Dyneema in 1979. Dyneema fibres have been in commercial production since 1990 at their plant at Heerlen. These fibers are manufactured by means of a gel-spinning process that combines extreme strength with incredible softness. Dyneema fibres, based on ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), is used in many applications in markets such as life protection, shipping, fishing, offshore, sailing, medical and textiles. = Communication and multimedia =  Compact cassette (1962)  Compact Cassette In 1962 Philips invented the compact audio cassette medium for audio storage, introducing it in Europe in August 1963 (at the Berlin Radio Show) and in the United States (under the Norelco brand) in November 1964, with the trademark name Compact Cassette.Daniel, Eric D.; Mee, C.

Video signal transducer, 1970. Disc-shaped member, 1990. By 1969, Philips developed a videodisc in reflective mode, which has great advantages over the transparent mode. MCA and Philips decided to join forces. They first publicly demonstrated the videodisc in 1972. Laserdisc entered the market in Atlanta, on 15 December 1978, two years after the VHS VCR and four years before the CD, which is based on Laserdisc technology. Philips produced the players and MCA made the discs.  Compact disc (1979)  Compact Disc The compact disc was jointly developed by Philips (Joop Sinjou) and Sony (Toshitada Doi). In the early 1970s, Philips' researchers started experiments with \\"audio-only\\" optical discs, and at the end of the 1970s, Philips, Sony, and other companies presented prototypes of digital audio discs.  Bluetooth (1990s)  Bluetooth, a low-energy, peer-to-peer wireless technology was originally developed by Dutch electrical engineer Jaap Haartsen and Swedish engineer Sven Mattisson in the 1990s, working at Ericsson in Lund, Sweden. It became a global standard of short distance wireless connection.  Wi-fi (1990s)  In 1991, NCR Corporation/AT&T; Corporation invented the precursor to 802.11 in Nieuwegein. Dutch electrical engineer Vic Hayes chaired IEEE 802.11 committee for 10 years, which was set up in 1990 to establish a wireless networking standard. He has been called the father of Wi-Fi (the brand name for products using IEEE 802.11 standards) for his work on IEEE 802.11 (802.11a & 802.11b) standard in 1997.  DVD (1995)  The DVD optical disc storage format was invented and developed by Philips and Sony in 1995.  Ambilight (2002)  Ambilight, short for \\"ambient lighting\\", is a lighting system for televisions developed by Philips in 2002.  Blu-ray (2006)  Philips and Sony in 1997 and 2006 respectively, launched the Blu-ray video recording/playback standard. = Computer science and information technology =  Dijkstra's algorithm (1956)  Dijkstra's algorithm, conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1956 and published in 1959, is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge path costs, producing a shortest path tree. Dijkstra's algorithm is so powerful that it not only finds the shortest path from a chosen source to a given destination, it finds all of the shortest paths from the source to all destinations. This algorithm is often used in routing and as a subroutine in other graph algorithms. Dijkstra's algorithm is considered as one of the most popular algorithms in computer science. It is also widely used in the fields of artificial intelligence, operational research/operations research, network routing, network analysis, and transportation engineering.  Foundations of distributed computing (1960s)  Through his fundamental contributions Edsger Dijkstra helped shape the field of computer science. His groundbreaking contributions ranged from the engineering side of computer science to the theoretical one and covered several areas including compiler construction, operating systems, distributed systems, sequential and concurrent programming, software engineering, and graph algorithms. Many of his papers, often just a few pages long, are the source of whole new research areas. Several concepts that are now completely standard in computer science were first identified by Dijkstra and/or bear names coined by him. Edsger Dijkstra's foundational work on concurrency, semaphores, mutual exclusion, deadlock, finding shortest paths in graphs, fault-tolerance, self- stabilization, among many other contributions comprises many of the pillars upon which the field of distributed computing is built. The Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing (sponsored jointly by the ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing and the EATCS International Symposium on Distributed Computing) is given for outstanding papers on the principles of distributed computing, whose significance and impact on the theory and/or practice of distributed computing has been evident for at least a decade.  Foundations of concurrent programming (1960s)  The academic study of concurrent programming (concurrent algorithms in particular) started in the 1960s, with Edsger Dijkstra (1965) credited with being the first paper in this field, identifying and solving mutual exclusion. A pioneer in the field of concurrent computing, Per Brinch Hansen considers Dijkstra's Cooperating Sequential Processes (1965) to be the first classic paper in concurrent programming. As Brinch Hansen notes: ‚ÄòHere Dijkstra lays the conceptual foundation for abstract concurrent programming.‚ÄôBrinch Hansen, Per (2002). The Origin of Concurrent Programming: From Semaphores to Remote Procedure Calls. (Springer)., p. 8  Foundations of software engineering (1960s)  Computer programming in the 1950s to 1960s was not recognized as an academic discipline and unlike physics there were no theoretical concepts or coding systems. Dijkstra was one of the moving forces behind the acceptance of computer programming as a scientific discipline. In 1968, computer programming was in a state of crisis. Dijkstra was one of a small group of academics and industrial programmers who advocated a new programming style to improve the quality of programs. Dijkstra coined the phrase \\"structured programming\\" and during the 1970s this became the new programming orthodoxy.Knuth, Donald (1974). Structured Programming with Go To Statements. Computing Surveys 6 (4): 261‚Äì301. doi:10.1145/356635.356640. \\"A revolution is taking place in the way we write programs and teach programming, because we are beginning to understand the associated mental processes more deeply. It is impossible to read the recent [E. W. Dijkstra, O.-J. Dahl, and C. A. R. Hoare] book Structured Programming, without having it change your life. The reason for this revolution and its future prospects have been aptly described by E.W. Dijkstra in his 1972 Turing Award Lecture, The Humble Programmer.\\"Mills, Harlan D. (1986). Structured Programming: Retrospect and Prospect. (IEEE Software 3(6): 58‚Äì66, November 1986). \\"Edsger W. Dijkstra's 1969 \\"Structured Programming\\" article precipitated a decade of intense focus on programming techniques that has fundamentally altered human expectations and achievements in software development. Before this decade of intense focus, programming was regarded as a private, puzzle-solving activity of writing computer instructions to work as a program. After this decade, programming could be regarded as a public, mathematics- based activity of restructuring specifications into programs. Before, the challenge was in getting programs to run at all, and then in getting them further debugged to do the right things. After, programs could be expected to both run and do the right things with little or no debugging. Before, it was common wisdom that no sizable program could be error-free. After, many sizable programs have run a year or more with no errors detected. These expectations and achievements are not universal because of the inertia of industrial practices. But they are well-enough established to herald fundamental change in software development.\\"Reilly, Edwin D. (2004). Concise Encyclopedia of Computer Science. (John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.), p. 734. \\"The major contributions of structured programming have been twofold ‚Äì the elevation of programming technique to something less of an art and more of a science, and the demonstration that carefully structured programs can be creative works of sufficient literary merit to deserve being read by humans and not just by computer.\\"Broy, Manfred; Denert, Ernst (eds.) (2002). Software Pioneers: Contributions to Software Engineering, p. 19. (Springer) As Bertrand Meyer remarked: \\"The revolution in views of programming started by Dijkstra's iconoclasm led to a movement known as structured programming, which advocated a systematic, rational approach to program construction. Structured programming is the basis for all that has been done since in programming methodology, including object-oriented programming.\\"Meyer, Bertrand (2009). Touch of Class: Learning to Program Well with Objects and Contracts. (Springer), p. 188. Dijkstra's ideas about structured programming helped lay the foundations for the birth and development of the professional discipline of software engineering, enabling programmers to organize and manage increasingly complex software projects.Hashagen, Ulf; Keil-Slawik, Reinhard; Norberg, A. (eds.) (2002). History of Computing: Software Issues (International Conference on the History of Computing, ICHC 2000 April 5‚Äì7, 2000 Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum Paderborn, Germany). (Springer), p. 106. \\"Structured programming is a topic which links the histories of software as science, software as engineering, software dependability, and, perhaps above all, software as labour process.\\"Henderson, Harry (2009). Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology, revised edition. (Facts on File, Inc.), p. 150  Shunting-yard algorithm (1960)  In computer science, the shunting-yard algorithm is a method for parsing mathematical expressions specified in infix notation. It can be used to produce output in Reverse Polish notation (RPN) or as an abstract syntax tree (AST). The algorithm was invented by Edsger Dijkstra and named the \\"shunting yard\\" algorithm because its operation resembles that of a railroad shunting yard. Dijkstra first described the Shunting Yard Algorithm in the Mathematisch Centrum report.  Schoonschip (early computer algebra system) (1963)  In 1963/64, during an extended stay at SLAC, Dutch theoretical physicist Martinus Veltman designed the computer program Schoonschip for symbolic manipulation of mathematical equations, which is now considered the very first computer algebra system.  Mutual exclusion (mutex) (1965)  In computer science, mutual exclusion refers to the requirement of ensuring that no two concurrent processes are in their critical section at the same time; it is a basic requirement in concurrency control, to prevent race conditions. The requirement of mutual exclusion was first identified and solved by Edsger W. Dijkstra in his seminal 1965 paper titled Solution of a problem in concurrent programming control,Taubenfeld, The Black-White Bakery Algorithm. In Proc. Distributed Computing, 18th international conference, DISC 2004. Vol 18, 56‚Äì70, 2004 and is credited as the first topic in the study of concurrent algorithms.  Semaphore (programming) (1965)  The semaphore concept was invented by Dijkstra in 1965 and the concept has found widespread use in a variety of operating systems.  Sleeping barber problem (1965)  In computer science, the sleeping barber problem is a classic inter-process communication and synchronization problem between multiple operating system processes. The problem is analogous to that of keeping a barber working when there are customers, resting when there are none and doing so in an orderly manner. The sleeping barber problem was introduced by Edsger Dijkstra in 1965.McHoes, Ann; Flynn, Ida M. (2014). Understanding Operating Systems (7th edition)  Banker's algorithm (deadlock prevention algorithm) (1965)  The Banker's algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an \\"s-state\\" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue. The algorithm was developed in the design process for the THE multiprogramming system and originally described (in Dutch) in EWD108. (in Dutch; An algorithm for the prevention of the deadly embrace) The name is by analogy with the way that bankers account for liquidity constraints.  Dining philosophers problem (1965)  In computer science, the dining philosophers problem is an example problem often used in concurrent algorithm design to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for resolving them. It was originally formulated in 1965 by Edsger Dijkstra as a student exam exercise, presented in terms of computers competing for access to tape drive peripherals. Soon after, Tony Hoare gave the problem its present formulation.  Dekker's algorithm (1965)  Dekker's algorithm is the first known correct solution to the mutual exclusion problem in concurrent programming. Dijkstra attributed the solution to Dutch mathematician Theodorus Dekker in his manuscript on cooperating sequential processes. It allows two threads to share a single-use resource without conflict, using only shared memory for communication. Dekker's algorithm is the first published software-only, two- process mutual exclusion algorithm.  THE multiprogramming system (1968)  The THE multiprogramming system was a computer operating system designed by a team led by Edsger W. Dijkstra, described in monographs in 1965‚Äì66 (14 June 1965) and published in 1968.  Van Wijngaarden grammar (1968)  Van Wijngaarden grammar (also vW-grammar or W-grammar) is a two-level grammar that provides a technique to define potentially infinite context-free grammars in a finite number of rules. The formalism was invented by Adriaan van Wijngaarden to rigorously define some syntactic restrictions that previously had to be formulated in natural language, despite their formal content. Typical applications are the treatment of gender and number in natural language syntax and the well-definedness of identifiers in programming languages. The technique was used and developed in the definition of the programming language ALGOL 68. It is an example of the larger class of affix grammars.  Structured programming (1968)  In 1968, computer programming was in a state of crisis. Dijkstra was one of a small group of academics and industrial programmers who advocated a new programming style to improve the quality of programs. Dijkstra coined the phrase \\"structured programming\\" and during the 1970s this became the new programming orthodoxy. Structured programming is often regarded as \\"goto-less programming\\". But as Bertrand Meyer notes, \\"As the first book on the topic [Structured Programming by Dijkstra, Dahl, and Hoare] shows, structured programming is about much more than control structures and the goto. Its principal message is that programming should be considered a scientific discipline based on mathematical rigor.\\"Meyer, Bertrand (2009), p. 188 As a programming paradigm, structured programming ‚Äì especially in the 1970s and 1980s ‚Äì significantly influenced the birth of many modern programming languages such as Pascal,Ryder, Barbara G.; Soffa, Mary Lou; Burnett, Margaret (2005). Impact of Software Engineering Research on Modern Programming Languages. ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology, Vol. 14, No. 4, October 2005, p. 431‚Äì77. \\"Of great influence to Pascal was Structured Programming, put forth by E. W. Dijkstra. This method of proceeding in a design would obliviously be greatly encouraged by the use of a Structured Language, a language with a set of constructs that could freely be combined and nested. The textual structure of a program should directly reflect its flow of control.\\"Wirth, Niklaus (2008). A Brief History of Software Engineering. IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, vol.30, no. 3, July‚ÄìSeptember 2008, p. 32‚Äì39. \\"In 1965 Dijkstra wrote his famous Notes on Structured Programming and declared programming as a discipline in contrast to a craft. Also in 1965 Hoare published an important paper about data structuring. These ideas had a profound influence on new programming language, in particular Pascal. Languages are the vehicles in which these ideas were to be expressed. Structured programming became supported by a structured programming language.\\" C, Modula-2, and Ada.Reilly, Edwin D. (2004), p. 734. \\"The first significant SP [Structured Programming] language was Algol 60 (q.v.). Subsequently developed SP languages in current use are Ada, C (q.v.), C++ (q.v.), Pascal, and Java (q.v.).\\" The Fortran 77 version which incorporates the concepts of structured programming, was released in 1978. The C++ language was a considerably extended and enhanced version of the popular structured programming language C (see also: list of C-based programming languages). Since C++ was developed from a more traditional structured language, it is a 'hybrid language', rather than a pure object-oriented programming language.Graba, Jan (1998). Up and Running with C++. (Springer), p. 1  EPROM (1971)  An EPROM or erasable programmable read only memory, is a type of memory chip that retains its data when its power supply is switched off. Development of the EPROM memory cell started with investigation of faulty integrated circuits where the gate connections of transistors had broken. Stored charge on these isolated gates changed their properties. The EPROM was invented by the Amsterdam-born Israeli electrical engineer Dov Frohman in 1971, who was awarded US patent 3660819 in 1972.  Self-stabilization (1974)  Self-stabilization is a concept of fault- tolerance in distributed computing. A distributed system that is self- stabilizing will end up in a correct state no matter what state it is initialized with. That correct state is reached after a finite number of execution steps. Many years after the seminal paper of Edsger Dijkstra in 1974, this concept remains important as it presents an important foundation for self-managing computer systems and fault-tolerant systems. Self- stabilization became its own area of study in distributed systems research, and Dijkstra set the stage for the next generation of computer scientists such as Leslie Lamport, Nancy Lynch, and Shlomi Dolev. As a result, Dijkstra's paper received the 2002 ACM PODC Influential-Paper Award (later renamed as Dijkstra Prize or Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing since 2003).  Predicate transformer semantics (1975)  Predicate transformer semantics were introduced by Dijkstra in his seminal paper \\"Guarded commands, nondeterminacy and formal derivation of programs\\".  Guarded Command Language (1975)  The Guarded Command Language (GCL) is a language defined by Edsger Dijkstra for predicate transformer semantics. It combines programming concepts in a compact way, before the program is written in some practical programming language.  Van Emde Boas tree (VEB tree) (1975)  A Van Emde Boas tree (or Van Emde Boas priority queue, also known as a vEB tree, is a tree data structure which implements an associative array with m-bit integer keys. The vEB tree was invented by a team led by Dutch computer scientist Peter van Emde Boas in 1975.  ABC (programming language) (1980s)  ABC is an imperative general-purpose programming language and programming environment developed at CWI, Netherlands by Leo Geurts, Lambert Meertens, and Steven Pemberton. It is interactive, structured, high-level, and intended to be used instead of BASIC, Pascal, or AWK. It is not meant to be a systems- programming language but is intended for teaching or prototyping. The language had a major influence on the design of the Python programming language (as a counterexample); Guido van Rossum, who developed Python, previously worked for several years on the ABC system in the early 1980s.The A-Z of Programming Languages: Python . \\"...I figured I could design and implement a language 'almost, but not quite, entirely unlike' ABC, improving upon ABC's deficiencies...\\", Computerworld (5 August 2008).

Dijkstra- Scholten algorithm (1980)  The Dijkstra‚ÄìScholten algorithm (named after Edsger W. Dijkstra and Carel S. Scholten) is an algorithm for detecting termination in a distributed system. The algorithm was proposed by Dijkstra and Scholten in 1980.  Smoothsort (1981)  Smoothsort is a comparison- based sorting algorithm. It is a variation of heapsort developed by Edsger Dijkstra in 1981. Like heapsort, smoothsort's upper bound is O(n log n). The advantage of smoothsort is that it comes closer to O(n) time if the input is already sorted to some degree, whereas heapsort averages O(n log n) regardless of the initial sorted state.  Amsterdam Compiler Kit (1983)  The Amsterdam Compiler Kit (ACK) is a fast, lightweight and retargetable compiler suite and toolchain developed by Andrew Tanenbaum and Ceriel Jacobs at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. It is MINIX's native toolchain. The ACK was originally closed-source software (that allowed binaries to be distributed for MINIX as a special case), but in April 2003 it was released under an open- source BSD license. It has frontends for programming languages C, Pascal, Modula-2, Occam, and BASIC. The ACK's notability stems from the fact that in the early 1980s it was one of the first portable compilation systems designed to support multiple source languages and target platforms.  Eight-to- fourteen modulation (1985)  EFM (Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation) was invented by Dutch electrical engineer Kees A. Schouhamer Immink in 1985. EFM is a data encoding technique ‚Äì formally, a channel code ‚Äì used by CDs, laserdiscs and pre-Hi-MD MiniDiscs.  MINIX (1987)  MINIX (from \\"mini- Unix\\") is a Unix-like computer operating system based on a microkernel architecture. Early versions of MINIX were created by Andrew S. Tanenbaum for educational purposes. Starting with MINIX 3, the primary aim of development shifted from education to the creation of a highly reliable and self-healing microkernel OS. MINIX is now developed as open-source software. MINIX was first released in 1987, with its complete source code made available to universities for study in courses and research. It has been free and open- source software since it was re-licensed under the BSD license in April 2000. Tanenbaum created MINIX at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam to exemplify the principles conveyed in his textbook, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation (1987), that Linus Torvalds described as \\"the book that launched me to new heights\\".  Amoeba (operating system) (1989)  Amoeba is a distributed operating system developed by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and others at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. The aim of the Amoeba project was to build a timesharing system that makes an entire network of computers appear to the user as a single machine. The Python programming language was originally developed for this platform.  Python (programming language) (1989)  Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library. Python was conceived in the late 1980s and its implementation was started in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL) capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, benevolent dictator for life (BDFL).  Vim (text editor) (1991)  Vim is a text editor written by the Dutch free software programmer Bram Moolenaar and first released publicly in 1991. Based on the Vi editor common to Unix-like systems, Vim carefully separated the user interface from editing functions. This allowed it to be used both from a command line interface and as a standalone application in a graphical user interface.  Blender (1995)  Big Buck Bunny, a short computer animated comedy film by the Blender Institute, part of the Blender Foundation. Like the foundation's previous film Elephants Dream, the film was made using Blender. Blender is a professional free and open-source 3D computer graphics software product used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, interactive 3D applications and video games. Blender's features include 3D modeling, UV unwrapping, texturing, raster graphics editing, rigging and skinning, fluid and smoke simulation, particle simulation, soft body simulation, sculpting, animating, match moving, camera tracking, rendering, video editing and compositing. Alongside the modelling features it also has an integrated game engine. Blender has been successfully used in the media industry in several parts of the world including Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Russia, Sweden, and the United States. The Dutch animation studio Neo Geo and Not a Number Technologies (NaN) developed Blender as an in-house application, with the primary author being Ton Roosendaal. The name Blender was inspired by a song by Yello, from the album Baby.  EFMPlus (1995)  EFMPlus is the channel code used in DVDs and SACDs, a more efficient successor to EFM used in CDs. It was created by Dutch electrical engineer Kees A. Schouhamer Immink, who also designed EFM. It is 6% less efficient than Toshiba's SD code, which resulted in a capacity of 4.7 gigabytes instead of SD's original 5 GB. The advantage of EFMPlus is its superior resilience against disc damage such as scratches and fingerprints. = Economics =  Dutch East India Company  bond from the Dutch East India Company (VOC), dating from 7 November 1623. The VOC was the first company in history to actually issue bonds and shares of stock to the general public. It was the VOC that invented the idea of investing in the company rather than in a specific venture governed by the company. The VOC was also the first company to use a fully-fledged capital market (including the bond market and the stock market) as a crucial channel to raise medium-term and long-term funds. The Dutch East India Company (Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie, or VOC), founded in 1602, was the world's first multinational, joint-stock,Embree, Ainslie Thomas; Gluck, Carol (1997).

The VOC was also the first company to actually issue stocks and bonds through a stock exchange.Funnell, Warwick; Robertson, Jeffrey (2013). Accounting by the First Public Company: The Pursuit of Supremacy (Routledge New Works in Accounting History) In 1602, the VOC issued shares that were made tradable on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. This invention enhanced the ability of joint-stock companies to attract capital from investors as they could now easily dispose their shares. The company was known throughout the world as the VOC thanks to its logo featuring those initials, which became the first global corporate brand. The company's monogram also became the first global logo.Christensen, Thomas (2012). 1616: The World in Motion, p. 41  First megacorporation (1602)  A coin (duit) minted in 1744 by the VOC. The Dutch East India Company was arguably the first megacorporation, possessing quasi-governmental powers, including the ability to wage war, imprison and execute convicts, negotiate treaties, coin money and establish colonies. Many economic and political historians consider the Dutch East India Company as the most valuable, powerful and influential corporation in the world history. The VOC existed for almost 200 years from its founding in 1602, when the States- General of the Netherlands granted it a 21-year monopoly over Dutch operations in Asia until its demise in 1796. During those two centuries (between 1602 and 1796), the VOC sent almost a million Europeans to work in the Asia trade on 4,785 ships, and netted for their efforts more than 2.5 million tons of Asian trade goods. By contrast, the rest of Europe combined sent only 882,412 people from 1500 to 1795, and the fleet of the English (later British) East India Company, the VOC's nearest competitor, was a distant second to its total traffic with 2,690 ships and a mere one-fifth the tonnage of goods carried by the VOC. The VOC enjoyed huge profits from its spice monopoly through most of the 17th century.  Dutch auction (17th century)  A Dutch auction is also known as an open descending price auction. Named after the famous auctions of Dutch tulip bulbs in the 17th century, it is based on a pricing system devised by Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning economist William Vickrey. In the traditional Dutch auction, the auctioneer begins with a high asking price which is lowered until some participant is willing to accept the auctioneer's price. The winning participant pays the last announced price. Dutch auction is also sometimes used to describe online auctions where several identical goods are sold simultaneously to an equal number of high bidders. In addition to cut flower sales in the Netherlands, Dutch auctions have also been used for perishable commodities such as fish and tobacco.  First modern art market (17th century)  The Dutch Republic was the birthplace of the first modern art market (open art market or free art market). The seventeenth-century Dutch were the pioneering arts marketers, successfully combining art and commerce together as we would recognise it today.North, Michael (1999). Art and Commerce in the Dutch Golden Age. Translated by Catherine Hill. (Yale University Press) Until the 17th century, commissioning works of art was largely the preserve of the church, monarchs and aristocrats. The emergence of a powerful and wealthy middle class in Holland, though, produced a radical change in patronage as the new Dutch bourgeoisie bought art. For the first time, the direction of art was shaped by relatively broadly-based demand rather than religious dogma or royal whim, and the result was a market which today's dealers and collectors would find familiar. With the creation of the first large-scale open art market, prosperous Dutch merchants, artisans, and civil servants bought paintings and prints in unprecedented numbers. Foreign visitors were astonished that even modest members of Dutch society such as farmers and bakers owned multiple works of art.  Concept of corporate governance (17th century)  The seventeenth-century Dutch businessmen were the pioneers in laying the basis for modern corporate governance. Isaac Le Maire, an Amsterdam businessman and a sizeable shareholder of the VOC, became the first recorded investor to actually consider the corporate governance's problems. In 1609, he complained of the VOC's shoddy corporate governance. On 24 January 1609, Le Maire filed a petition against the VOC, marking the first recorded expression of shareholder activism. In what is the first recorded corporate governance dispute, Le Maire formally charged that the directors (the VOC's board of directors ‚Äì the Heeren XVII) sought to \\"retain another's money for longer or use it ways other than the latter wishes\\" and petitioned for the liquidation of the VOC in accordance with standard business practice.Gelderblom, Oscar; De Jong, Abe; Jonker, Joost (2010). Putting Le Maire into Perspective: Business Organization and the Evolution of Corporate Governance in the Dutch Republic, 1590‚Äì1610, in J. Koppell, ed., Origins of Shareholder Advocacy. (New York: Palgrave Macmillan)Mueller, Dennis C. (ed.), (2012). The Oxford Handbook of Capitalism, p. 333. (New York: Oxford University Press) The first shareholder revolt happened in 1622, among Dutch East India Company (VOC) investors who complained that the company account books had been \\"smeared with bacon\\" so that they might be \\"eaten by dogs.\\" The investors demanded a \\"reeckeninge,\\" a proper financial audit. The 1622 campaign by the shareholders of the VOC is a testimony of genesis of CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) in which shareholders staged protests by distributing pamphlets and complaining about management self enrichment and secrecy.De Jongh, Matthijs (2010). Shareholder Activism at the Dutch East India Company 1622‚Äì1625, in Origins of Shareholder Advocacy (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011)  Modern concept of foreign direct investment (17th century)  The construction in 1619 of a train-oil factory on Smeerenburg in the Spitsbergen islands by the Noordsche Compagnie, and the acquisition in 1626 of Manhattan Island by the Dutch West India Company are referred to as the earliest cases of outward foreign direct investment (FDI) in Dutch and world history. Throughout the seventeenth century, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and the Dutch West India Company (GWIC/WIC) also began to create trading settlements around the globe. Their trading activities generated enormous wealth, making the Dutch Republic one of the most prosperous countries of that time. The Dutch Republic's extensive arms trade occasioned an episode in the industrial development of early-modern Sweden, where arms merchants like Louis de Geer and the Trip brothers, invested in iron mines and iron works, another early example of outward foreign direct investment.  First modern market-oriented economy (17th century)  It was in the Dutch Republic that some important industries (economic sectors) such as shipbuilding, shipping, printing and publishing were developed on a large- scale export-driven model for the first time in history. The ship building district of Zaan, near Amsterdam, became the first industrialized area in the world,De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 301‚Äì302 with around 900 industrial windmills at the end of the 17th century, but there were industrialized towns and cities on a smaller scale also. Other industries that saw significant growth were papermaking, sugar refining, printing, the linen industry (with spin-offs in vegetable oils, like flax and rape oil), and industries that used the cheap peat fuel, like brewing and ceramics (brickworks, pottery and clay- pipe making). The Dutch shipbuilding industry was of modern dimensions, inclining strongly toward standardised, repetitive methods. It was highly mechanized and used many labor-saving devices-wind-powered sawmills, powered feeders for saw, block and tackles, great cranes to move heavy timbers-all of which increased productivity.Wallerstein, Immanuel (2011). The Modern World- System II: Mercantilism and the Consolidation of the European World-Economy, 1600‚Äì1750, p. 43‚Äì44 Dutch shipbuilding benefited from various design innovations which increased carrying capacity and cut costs.Kotilane, J.

The shipbuilding district of Zaan, near Amsterdam, became one of the world's earliest known industrialized areas, with around 900 wind-powered sawmill at the end of the 17th century. In the 1590s the Dutch shipbuilders began to develop wind-driven sawmilling technology. By the early seventeenth century Dutch shipyards were producing a large number of ships to a standard design, allowing extensive division of labour, specialization which further reduced unit costs.Zahedieh, Nuala (2010). The Capital and the Colonies: London and the Atlantic Economy 1660‚Äì1700 (Cambridge University Press), p. 152 A Satire of Tulip Mania by Jan Brueghel the Younger (ca. 1640) depicts speculators as brainless monkeys in contemporary upper-class dress. Generally considered to be the first recorded speculative bubble (or economic bubble), the Tulip Mania of 1636‚Äì1637 was an episode in which contract prices for bulbs of the recently introduced tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then suddenly collapsed. The term \\"Tulip Mania\\" is now often used metaphorically to refer to any large economic bubble (when asset prices deviate from intrinsic values). Economic historians consider the Netherlands as the first predominantly capitalist nation.MacDonald, Scott B.; Gastmann, Albert L. (2001), p. 95Andrew Roberts in his book A History of the English-Speaking Peoples Since 1900 (2010), observed: \\"The English-speaking peoples did not invent the ideas that nonetheless made them great: the Romans invented the concept of Law, the Greeks one-freeman-one-vote democracy, the Dutch modern capitalism...\\" The development of European capitalism began among the city-states of Italy, Flanders, and the Baltic. It spread to the European interstate system, eventually resulting in the world's first capitalist nation-state, the Dutch Republic of the seventeenth century.Manning, Patrick; Gills, Barry K. (2013). Andre Gunder Frank and Global Development: Visions, Remembrances, and Explorations, p.107 The Dutch were the first to develop capitalism on a nationwide scale (as opposed to earlier city states). They also played a pioneering role in the emergence of the capitalist world-system.Hall, Thomas D. (2000). A World-Systems Reader: New Perspectives on Gender, Urbanism, Cultures, Indigenous Peoples, and Ecology, p. 32 Simon Schama aptly titled his work The Embarrassment of Riches, capturing the astonishing novelty and success of the commercial revolution in the Dutch Republic. World-systems theorists (including Immanuel Wallerstein and Giovanni Arrighi) often consider the economic primacy of the Dutch Republic in the 17th century as the first capitalist hegemonyIsrael, Jonathan (1989).

First modern economic miracle (1585‚Äì1714)  The Dutch economic transition from a possession of the Holy Roman Empire in the 1590s to the foremost maritime and economic power in the world has been called the \\"Dutch Miracle\\" (or \\"Dutch Tiger\\") by many economic historians, including K. W. Swart. Until the 18th century, the economy of the Dutch Republic was the most advanced and sophisticated ever seen in history.Kaletsky, Anatole (2010). Capitalism 4.0: The Birth of a New Economy in the Aftermath of Crisis, p. 109. \\"In 1602, exploiting their advantage against the declining Spanish and Portuguese maritime powers, the citizens of Holland founded the Dutch East India Company, quickly gaining a monopoly over most of Europe's trade with Asia. This incredible commercial opportunity inspired and financially underpinned the creation in Holland of the first mercantile capitalist nation. This was arguably the most important event in the economic history of the world up to that point.\\" During their Golden Age, the provinces of the Northern Netherlands rose from almost total obscurity as the poor cousins of the industrious and heavily urbanised southern regions (Southern Netherlands) to become the world leader in economic success.Davids, Karel; Lucassen, Jan (1995).

Fairtrade certification (1988)  The concept of fair trade has been around for over 40 years, but a formal labelling scheme emerged only in the 1980s. At the initiative of Mexican coffee farmers, the world's first Fairtrade labeling organisation, Stichting Max Havelaar, was launched in the Netherlands on 15 November 1988 by Nico Roozen, Frans van der Hoff and Dutch ecumenical development agency Solidaridad. It was branded \\"Max Havelaar\\" after a fictional Dutch character who opposed the exploitation of coffee pickers in Dutch colonies. = Finance =  Concept of bourse ( 13th century)  An exchange, or bourse, is a highly organized market where (especially) tradable securities, commodities, foreign exchange, futures, and options contracts are sold and bought. The term bourse is derived from the 13th-century inn named Huis ter Beurze in Bruges, Low Countries, where traders and foreign merchants from across Europe conducted business in the late medieval period.Bourse. Online Etymology Dictionary The building, which was established by Robert van der Buerze as a hostelry, had operated from 1285. Its managers became famous for offering judicious financial advice to the traders and merchants who frequented the building. This service became known as the \\"Beurze Purse\\" which is the basis of bourse, meaning an organised place of exchange.  Foundations of stock market (1602)  One of the oldest known stock certificates, issued by the VOC chamber of Enkhuizen, dated 9 September 1606. The establishment of Amsterdam Stock Exchange (1602) by the VOC, has long been recognized as the origin of modern stock exchanges that specialize in creating and sustaining secondary markets in the securities issued by corporations. By the 1680s, the financial techniques used in the Amsterdam financial markets were as sophisticated as any practiced today. Engraving depicting the Amsterdam Stock Exchange (Amsterdam's old bourse, a.k.a. Beurs van Hendrick de Keyser in Dutch), built by Hendrick de Keyser (c. 1612). The Amsterdam Stock Exchange was the world's first official stock exchange when it began trading the VOC's freely transferable securities (including bonds and shares of stock). Courtyard of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange (Beurs van Hendrick de Keyser) by Emanuel de Witte, 1653. The Amsterdam Stock Exchange is said to have been the first stock exchange to introduce continuous trade in the early 17th century. It was in seventeenth-century Amsterdam that the global securities market began to take on its modern form. Amsterdam was also the first city where derivatives that were based on securities were used freely for a long period of time. The seventeenth-century Dutch merchants laid the foundations for modern stock market that now influences greatly the global economy. It was in the Dutch Republic that a fully-fledged stock market was established and developed for the first time in history. The Dutch merchants were also the pioneers in developing the basic techniques of stock trading. Although bond sales by municipalities and states can be traced to the thirteenth century, the origin of modern stock exchanges that specialize in creating and sustaining secondary markets in corporate securities goes back to the formation of the Dutch East India Company in the year 1602.Nadesan, Majia Holmer (2008).

The Dutch East India Company, founded in 1602, became the first to offer shares... This buying and selling of shares in the Dutch East India Company became the basis of the first stock market.\\"Shorto, Russell (2013). Amsterdam: A History of the World's Most Liberal City. \\"The truly revolutionary innovation of Amsterdam's stock market lay in the fact that it became the world's first market in the sale of company shares: a secondary securities market. If a company's shares of stock are frozen, its ownership is frozen and the business is a private affair. But if those shares, or derivatives based on them, can be resold, then you have a financial marketplace, which is a kind of living thing, constantly churning. It can then become a means of individual expression and power, allowing for anyone with a few extra coins to play a part in the great economic drama society.\\" Dutch investors were the first to trade their shares at a regular stock exchange.Micklethwait, John; Wooldridge, Adrian (2003). The Company: A Short History of a Revolutionary Idea The Amsterdam Stock Exchange is considered the oldest in the world. It was established in 1602 by the Dutch East India Company for dealings in its printed stocks and bonds. Here, the Dutch also pioneered stock futures, stock options, short selling, debt-equity swaps, merchant banking, bonds, unit trusts and other speculative instruments. Unlike the competing companies, the VOC allowed anyone (including housemaids) to purchase stock in the trading at the fully operational Amsterdam Bourse. The practice of naked short selling was also invented in the Dutch Republic. In 1609, Isaac Le Maire, an Amsterdam merchant and a sizeable shareholder of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), became the first recorded short seller in history. The first recorded ban on short selling also took place in the Dutch Republic in the same year. In the early 17th century, Dutch merchants invented the common stock ‚Äì that of the VOC. Also, the Dutch experienced the first recorded stock market crash in history, the Tulip Mania of 1636‚Äì1637. Since 1602, stock market trading has come a long way. But basically, the concept and principle of stock market trading is still upheld and is still being implemented up to now.Brooks, John (1968). \\"The Fluctuation: The Little Crash in '62\\" in \\"Business Adventures: Twelve Classic Tales from the World of Wall Street\\". (New York: Weybright & Talley). \\"The stock market ‚Äì the daytime adventure serial of the well-to-do ‚Äì would not be the stock market if it did not have its ups and downs. (...) And it has many other distinctive characteristics. Apart from the economic advantages and disadvantages of stock exchanges ‚Äì the advantage that they provide a free flow of capital to finance industrial expansion, for instance, and the disadvantage that they provide an all too convenient way for the unlucky, the imprudent, and the gullible to lose their money ‚Äì their development has created a whole pattern of social behavior, complete with customs, language, and predictable responses to given events. What is truly extraordinary is the speed with which this pattern emerged full blown following the establishment, in 1611, of the world‚Äôs first important stock exchange ‚Äì a roofless courtyard in Amsterdam ‚Äì and the degree to which it persists (with variations, it is true) on the New York Stock Exchange in the nineteen-sixties. Present-day stock trading in the United States ‚Äì a bewilderingly vast enterprise, involving millions of miles of private telegraph wires, computers that can read and copy the Manhattan Telephone Directory in three minutes, and over twenty million stockholder participants ‚Äì would seem to be a far cry from a handful of seventeenth- century Dutchmen haggling in the rain. But the field marks are much the same. The first stock exchange was, inadvertently, a laboratory in which new human reactions were revealed. By the same token, the New York Stock Exchange is also a sociological test tube, forever contributing to the human species‚Äô self-understanding. The behaviour of the pioneering Dutch stock traders is ably documented in a book entitled \\"Confusion of Confusions,\\" written by a plunger on the Amsterdam market named Joseph de la Vega; originally published in 1688, it was reprinted in English translation a few years ago by the Harvard Business School.\\"Petram, Lodewijk (2014). The World's First Stock Exchange (Columbia Business School Publishing)  First fully functioning (fully-fledged) financial market (17th century)  The Dutch Republic (Amsterdam in particular) was the birthplace of the world's first fully functioning financial market, with the birth of a fully fledged capital market. Capital markets for debt and equity shares are used to raise long-term funds. New stocks and bonds are sold in primary markets (including initial public offerings) and secondary markets (including stock exchanges). While the Italian city-states produced the first transferable municipal bonds, they didn't develop the other ingredient necessary to produce a fully fledged capital market: corporate shareholders. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) became the first company to offer shares of stock to the general public. Dutch investors were the first to trade their shares at a regular stock exchange. In 1602 the Dutch East India Company (VOC) established an exchange in Amsterdam where the VOC stocks and bonds could be traded in a secondary market.Giroux, Gary (2013). Business Scandals, Corruption, and Reform: An Encyclopedia [2 volumes], p. 95 The buying and selling of the VOC's securities (including shares and bonds) became the basis of the first official stock market. The Dutch were also the first to use a fully-fledged capital market (including bond market and stock market) to finance companies (such as the VOC and the WIC). It was in seventeenth-century Amsterdam that the global securities market began to take on its modern form.  Foundations of corporate finance (17th century)  What is now known as corporate finance has its modern roots in financial management policies of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in the 17th century and some basic aspects of modern corporate finance began to appear in financial activities of Dutch businessmen in the early 17th century.  Initial public offering (1602)  The earliest form of a company which issued public shares was the publicani during the Roman Republic. In 1602, the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie or VOC) became the first modern company to issue shares to the public, thus launching the first modern initial public offering (IPO). The VOC held the first public offering of shares in history shortly after its founding.Chorafas, Dimitris N. (2005). The Management of Equity Investments, p. 79Ferguson, Niall (2008) With this first recorded initial public offering (IPO), the VOC brought in 6,424,588 guilders and the company subsequently grew to become the first true transnational corporation in the world.  Institutional foundations of investment banking (17th century)  The Dutch were the pioneers in laying the basis for investment banking, allowing the risk of loans to be distributed among thousands of investors in the early seventeenth century.Cross, Frank B.; Prentice, Robert A. (2007). Law and Corporate Finance, p. 130  Institutional foundations of central banking (first central bank) (1609)  A painting by Pieter Saenredam of the old town hall in Amsterdam where the Wisselbank was founded in 1609. The Amsterdamsche Wisselbank (literally meaning \\"Amsterdam Exchange Bank\\"), the precursor to, if not the first modern central bank. The Wisselbank's innovations helped lay the foundations for the central banking system that now plays a vital role in the world's economy. Prior to the 17th century most money was commodity money, typically gold or silver. However, promises to pay were widely circulated and accepted as value at least five hundred years earlier in both Europe and Asia. The Song dynasty was the first to issue generally circulating paper currency, while the Yuan dynasty was the first to use notes as the predominant circulating medium. In 1455, in an effort to control inflation, the succeeding Ming dynasty ended the use of paper money and closed much of Chinese trade. The medieval European Knights Templar ran an early prototype of a central banking system, as their promises to pay were widely respected, and many regard their activities as having laid the basis for the modern banking system. As the first public bank to \\"offer accounts not directly convertible to coin\\", the Bank of Amsterdam (Amsterdamsche Wisselbank or literally Amsterdam Exchange Bank) established in 1609 is considered to be the precursor to modern central banks, if not the first true central bank.Ferguson, Niall (2008).

The Bank of Amsterdam through the Lens of Monetary Competition. (Working Paper 2012‚Äì14, September 2012) There were earlier banks, especially in the Italian city-states, but the Wisselbank, with its public backing, provided for a scale of operations and stability hitherto unmatched. Along with a number of subsidiary local banks, it performed many of modern-day central banking functions.Kuzminski, Adrian (2013). The Ecology of Money: Debt, Growth, and Sustainability, p. 38 The model of the Wisselbank as a state bank was adapted throughout Europe, including the Bank of Sweden (1668) and the Bank of England (1694).Johnson, Hazel J. (2000). Banking Alliances, p. 7 It occupied a central position in the financial world of its day, providing an effective, efficient and trusted system for national and international payments. The establishment of the Wisselbank led to the introduction of the concept of bank money ‚Äì the bank guilder. Lucien Gillard (2004) calls it the European guilder (le florin europ√©en),Gillard, Lucien (2004) and Adam Smith devotes many pages to explaining how the bank guilder works (Smith 1776: 446‚Äì55). Considered by many experts to be the first internationally dominant reserve currency of modern times, the Dutch guilder was the dominant currency during the 17th and 18th centuries. It was just replaced by British pound sterling in the 19th century and the US dollar took the lead just after World War Two and has held it until this day.Quinn, Stephen; Roberds, William (2014). Death of a Reserve Currency. (Working Paper 2014‚Äì17, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta)  Short selling (1609)  Financial innovation in Amsterdam took many forms. In 1609, investors led by Isaac Le Maire formed history's first bear syndicate to engage in short selling, but their coordinated trading had only a modest impact in driving down share prices, which tended to be robust throughout the 17th century.  Concept of dividend policy (1610)  In the first decades of the 17th century, the VOC was the first recorded company ever to pay regular dividends. To encourage investors to buy shares, a promise of an annual payment (called a dividend) was made. An investor would receive dividends instead interest and the investment was permanent in the form of shares in the company. Between 1600 and 1800 the Dutch East India Company (VOC) paid annual dividends worth around 18 percent of the value of the shares.  First European banknote (1661)  In 1656, King Charles X Gustav of Sweden signed two charters creating two private banks under the directorship of Johan Palmstruch (though before having been ennobled he was called Johan Wittmacher or Hans Wittmacher), a Riga-born merchant of Dutch origin. Palmstruch modeled the banks on those of Amsterdam where he had become a burgher. The first real European banknote was issued in 1661 by the Stockholms Banco of Johan Palmstruch, a private bank under state charter (precursor to the Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden).  First book ever on stock trading (1688)  Joseph de la Vega, also known as Joseph Penso de la Vega, was an Amsterdam trader from a Spanish Jewish family and a prolific writer as well as a successful businessman. His 1688 book Confusion de Confusiones (Confusion of Confusions) explained the workings of the city's stock market. It was the earliest book about stock trading, taking the form of a dialogue between a merchant, a shareholder and a philosopher. The book described a market that was sophisticated but also prone to excesses, and de la Vega offered advice to his readers on such topics as the unpredictability of market shifts and the importance of patience in investment. The book has been described as the first precursor of modern behavioural finance, with its descriptions of investor decision-making still reflected in the way some investors operate today, and in 2001 was still rated by the Financial Times as one of the ten best investment book ever written.Westbrook, Ian (2014)  Concept of technical analysis (1688)  The principles of technical analysis are derived from hundreds of years of financial market data. These principles in a raw form have been studied since the seventeenth century.Joseph de la Vega, Confusi√≥n de Confusiones, 1688 Some aspects of technical analysis began to appear in Joseph de la Vega's accounts of the Dutch markets in the late 17th century. In Asia, technical analysis is said to be a method developed by Homma Munehisa during the early 18th century which evolved into the use of candlestick techniques, and is today a technical analysis charting tool.Nison, Steve (1994). Beyond Candlesticks: New Japanese Charting Techniques Revealed, John Wiley and Sons, p. 14.  Concept of behavioral finance (1688)  Josseph de la Vega was in 1688 the first person to give an account of irrational behaviour in financial markets. His 1688 book Confusion of Confusions, has been described as the first precursor of modern behavioural finance, with its descriptions of investor decision-making still reflected in the way some investors operate today.  First modern model of a financial centre (17th century)  The Dam Square in Amsterdam, by Gerrit Adriaensz Berckheyde, c. 1660. In the picture of the centre of highly cosmopolitan and tolerant Amsterdam, Muslim/Oriental figures (possibly Ottoman or Moroccan merchants) are shown negotiating. The seventeenth-century Amsterdam's institutional innovations greatly helped lay the foundations for modern (international) financial centres that now dominate the global financial system.Sylla, Richard (2015). \\"Financial Development, Corporations, and Inequality\\". (BHC-EBHA Meeting). As Richard Sylla notes, \\"In modern history, several nations had what some of us call financial revolutions. These can be thought of as creating in a short period of time all the key components of a modern financial system. The first was the Dutch Republic four centuries ago.\\" By the first decades of the 18th century, Amsterdam had become the world's leading financial centre for more than a century, having developed a sophisticated financial system with central banking, fully-fledged capital markets, certain kinds of financial derivatives, and publicly traded multinational corporations. Amsterdam was the first modern model of an international (global) financial centre that now operated in several countries around the world.  Foundations of modern financial system (17th century)  In the early 17th century, the Dutch revolutionized domestic and international finance by inventing common stock ‚Äì that of the Dutch East India Company and founding a proto-central bank, the Wisselbank or Bank of Amsterdam. In 1609, the Dutch had already had a government bond market for some decades. Shortly thereafter, the Dutch Republic had in place, in one form or another, all of the key components of a modern financial system: formalized public credit, stable money, elements of a banking system, a central bank of sorts and securities markets. The Dutch Republic went on to become that century's leading economy.  Concept of investment fund (1774)  The first investment fund has its roots back in 1774. A Dutch merchant named Adriaan van Ketwich formed a trust named Eendragt Maakt Magt. The name of Ketwich's fund translates to \\"unity creates strength\\". In response to the financial crisis of 1772‚Äì1773, Ketwich's aim was to provide small investors an opportunity to diversify (Rouwenhorst & Goetzman, 2005). This investment scheme can be seen as the first near-mutual fund. In the years following, near-mutual funds evolved and become more diverse and complex.  Mutual fund (1774)  The first mutual funds were established in 1774 in the Netherlands. Amsterdam-based businessman Abraham van Ketwich (a.k.a. Adriaan van Ketwich) is often credited as the originator of the world's first mutual fund.Rouwenhorst, K. Geert, \\"The Origins of Mutual Funds,\\" Yale ICF Working Paper No. 04-48 (12 December 2004), p. 5. The first mutual fund outside the Netherlands was the Foreign & Colonial Government Trust, which was established in London in 1868. = Foods and drinks =  Gibbing (14th century)  Gibbing is the process of preparing salt herring (or soused herring), in which the gills and part of the gullet are removed from the fish, eliminating any bitter taste. The liver and pancreas are left in the fish during the salt- curing process because they release enzymes essential for flavor. The fish is then cured in a barrel with one part salt to 20 herring. Today many variations and local preferences exist on this process. The process of gibbing was invented by Willem BeuckelszoonWilliam Buckels (aka Willem Beuckelsz, William BuckelsWillem Beuckelszoon or William Buckelsson), a 14th-century Zealand Fisherman. The invention of this fish preservation technique led to the Dutch becoming a seafaring power. This invention created an export industry for salt herring that was monopolized by the Dutch.  Doughnut (17th century)  Many people believe it was the Dutch who invented doughnuts. A Dutch snack made from potatoes had a round shape like a ball, but, like Gregory's dough balls, needed a little longer time when fried to cook the inside thoroughly. These potato-balls developed into doughnuts when the Dutch finally made them into ring-shapes reduce frying time.  Gin (jenever) (1650)  A selection of bottled gins offered at a liquor store. Gin is a spirit which derives its predominant flavour from juniper berries (Juniperus communis). From its earliest origins in the Middle Ages, gin has evolved over the course of a millennium from a herbal medicine to an object of commerce in the spirits industry. Gin was developed on the basis of the older Jenever, and become widely popular in Great Britain when William III of Orange, leader of the Dutch Republic, occupied the British throne with his wife Mary. Today, the gin category is one of the most popular and widely distributed range of spirits, and is represented by products of various origins, styles, and flavour profiles that all revolve around juniper as a common ingredient. The Dutch physician Franciscus Sylvius is often credited with the invention of gin in the mid 17th century, although the existence of genever is confirmed in Massinger's play The Duke of Milan (1623), when Dr. Sylvius would have been but nine years of age. It is further claimed that British soldiers who provided support in Antwerp against the Spanish in 1585, during the Eighty Years' War, were already drinking genever (jenever) for its calming effects before battle, from which the term Dutch Courage is believed to have originated. The earliest known written reference to genever appears in the 13th century encyclopaedic work Der Naturen Bloeme (Bruges), and the earliest printed genever recipe from 16th century work Een Constelijck Distileerboec (Antwerp).Belgian Genever: Belgium's Traditional Spirit for over 500 Years  Stroopwafel (1780s)  A stroopwafel (also known as syrup waffle, treacle waffle or caramel waffle) is a waffle made from two thin layers of baked batter with a caramel-like syrup filling the middle. They were first made in Gouda in the 1780s. The traditional way to eat the stroopwafel is to place it atop of a drinking vessel with a hot beverage (coffee, tea or chocolate) inside that fits the diameter of the waffle. The heat from the rising steam warms the waffle and slightly softens the inside and makes the waffle soft on one side while still crispy on the other.  Cocoa powder (foundations of modern chocolate industry) (1828)  A bowl of cocoa powder. In 1828, C. J. van Houten revolutionized the modern chocolate industry by inventing a hydraulic press that squeezed the cocoa butter (fat) out of the cocoa beans, producing cocoa powder. In 1815, Dutch chemist Coenraad van Houten introduced alkaline salts to chocolate, which reduced its bitterness. In the 1820s, Casparus van Houten, Sr. patented an inexpensive method for pressing the fat from roasted cocoa beans.Satre, Lowell Joseph (2005). Chocolate on Trial: Slavery, Politics, and the Ethics of Business, p. 14Grivetti, Louis E.; Shapiro, Howard-Yana (2011). Chocolate: History, Culture, and HeritageWilson, Philip K.; Hurst, William Jeffrey (2012). Chocolate as Medicine: A Quest Over the Centuries, p. 81 He created a press to remove about half the natural fat (cacao butter) from chocolate liquor, which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality. This innovation introduced the modern era of chocolate. Van Houten developed the first cocoa powder producing machine in the Netherlands. Van Houten's machine ‚Äì a hydraulic press ‚Äì reduced the cocoa butter content by nearly half. This created a \\"cake\\" that could be pulverized into cocoa powder, which was to become the basis of all chocolate products.Ensminger, Marion Eugene; Ensminger, Audrey H. (1994).

By using cocoa powder and low amounts of cocoa butter, it was then possible to manufacture chocolate bar. The term \\"chocolate\\" then came to mean solid chocolate, rather than hot chocolate.  Dutch-process chocolate (1828)  Dutch-processed chocolate or Dutched chocolate is chocolate that has been treated with an alkalizing agent to modify its color and give it a milder taste compared to \\"natural cocoa\\" extracted with the Broma process. It forms the basis for much of modern chocolate, and is used in ice cream, hot cocoa, and baking. The Dutch process was developed in the early 19th century by Dutch chocolate maker Coenraad Johannes van Houten, whose father Casparus is responsible for the development of the method of removing fat from cacao beans by hydraulic press around 1828, forming the basis for cocoa powder. = Law and jurisprudence =  Doctrine of the Freedom of the Seas (foundations of the Law of the Sea/UNCLOS) (1609)  In 1609, Hugo Grotius, the Dutch jurist who is generally known as the father of modern international law, published his book Mare Liberum (The Free Sea), which first formulated the notion of freedom of the seas. He developed this idea into a legal principle.Milun, Kathryn (2011). The Political Uncommons: The Cross-Cultural Logic of the Global Commons, p. 77‚Äì79 It is said to be 'the first, and classic, exposition of the doctrine of the freedom of the seas' which has been the essence and backbone of the modern law of the sea.Anand, Ram Prakash (1987). International Law and the Developing Countries: Confrontation Or Cooperation?, p. 5‚Äì9, 53‚Äì62Milun, Kathryn (2011). The Political Uncommons: The Cross-Cultural Logic of the Global Commons, p. 12, 77‚Äì79 It is generally assumed that Grotius first propounded the principle of freedom of the seas, although all countries in the Indian Ocean and other Asian seas accepted the right of unobstructed navigation long before Grotius wrote his De Jure Praedae (On the Law of Spoils) in the year of 1604. His work sparked a debate in the seventeenth century over whether states could exclude the vessels of other states from certain waters. Grotius won this debate, as freedom of the seas became a universally recognized legal principle, associated with concepts such as communication, trade and peace. Grotius's notion of the freedom of the seas would persist until the mid-twentieth century, and it continues to be applied even to this day for much of the high seas, though the application of the concept and the scope of its reach is changing.  Secularized natural law (foundations of modern international law) (1625)  The publication of De jure belli ac pacis (On the Laws of War and Peace) by Hugo Grotius in 1625 had marked the emergence of international law as an 'autonomous legal science'.O'Brien, John (2001). International Law, p. 9‚Äì11Boczek, Boleslaw Adam (2005). International Law: A Dictionary, p. 9‚Äì10Malone, Linda A. (2008). International Law, p. 2 Grotius's On the Law of War and Peace, published in 1625, is best known as the first systematic treatise on international law, but to thinkers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it seemed to set a new agenda in moral and political philosophy across the board. Grotius developed pivotal treatises on freedom of the seas, the law of spoils, the laws of war and peace and he created an autonomous place for international law as its own discipline. Jean Barbeyrac's Historical and Critical Account of the Science of Morality, attached to his translation of Samuel von Pufendorf's Law of Nature and Nations in 1706, praised Grotius as \\"the first who broke the ice\\" of \\"the Scholastic Philosophy; which [had] spread itself all over Europe\\" (1749: 67, 66).Darwall, Stephen (2013). Grotius at the Creation of Modern Moral Philosophy in Honor, History, and Relationship: Essays in Second- Personal Ethics II, p. 157 Grotius' truly distinctive contribution to jurisprudence and philosophy of law (public international law or law of nations in particular) was that he secularized natural law.Friedrich, Carl Joachim (1963).

Philosophy of Law: A Very Short Introduction, p. 6 Grotius had divorced natural law from theology and religion by grounding it solely in the social nature and natural reason of man. When Grotius, considered by many to be the founder of modern natural law theory (or secular natural law), said that natural law would retain its validity 'even if God did not exist' (etiamsi daremus non-esse Deum), he was making a clear break with the classical tradition of natural law.Tierney, Brian (1997).

International Relations: Perspectives, Controversies and Readings, p. 216 Adam Smith, in lectures delivered in 1762 on the subject of moral philosophy and the law of nations, said that: \\"Jurisprudence is that science which inquires into the general principles which ought to be the foundation of laws of all nations. Grotius seems to have been the first who attempted to give the world anything like a regular system of natural jurisprudence, and his treatise, 'On the Laws of War and Peace, ' with all its imperfections, is perhaps at this day the most complete work on this subject.\\"Kuiper, Kathleen (2010). The Britannica Guide to Theories and Ideas That Changed the Modern World, p. 275, 321‚Äì22  Grotian conception of international society (1625)  The Grotian conception of international society became the most distinctive characteristic of the internationalist (or rationalist) tradition in international relations. This is why it is also called the Grotian tradition. According to it international politics takes place within international society in which states are bound not only by rules of prudence or expediency but also of morality and law. Grotius was arguably not the first to formulate such a doctrine. However, he was first to clearly define the idea of one society of states, governed not by force or warfare but by laws and mutual agreement to enforce those laws. As many international law scholars noted, the spirit of the Peace of Westphalia (1648) was preceded with the thoughts and ideas of Grotius. Thomas Franck observed: ‚ÄòSince the Reformation, the Peace of Westphalia, and the writings of Hugo Grotius, there has been an explicit assumption that the international system is an association of sovereign states.‚ÄôFranck, Thomas M. (1999). The Empowered Self ‚àí Law and Society in the Age of Individualism. (Oxford University Press) As Hedley Bull declared: ‚ÄòThe idea of international society which Grotius propounded was given concrete expression in the Peace of Westphalia‚Äô, affirming that ‚ÄòGrotius must be considered the intellectual father of this first general peace settlement of modern times‚Äô.Bull, Hedley Hugo Grotius and International Relations, 1992  Cannon shot rule (1702)  By the end of the seventeenth century, support was growing for some limitation to the seaward extent of territorial waters. What emerged was the so-called \\"cannon shot rule\\", which acknowledged the idea that property rights could be acquired by physical occupation and in practice to the effective range of shore-based cannon: about three nautical miles. The rule was long associated with Cornelis van Bijnkershoek, a Dutch jurist who, especially in his De Dominio Maris Dissertatio (1702), advocated a middle ground between the extremes of Mare Liberum and John Selden's Mare Clausum, accepting both the freedom of states to navigate and exploit the resources of the high seas and a right of coastal states to assert wide-ranging rights in a limited marine territory.  Permanent Court of Arbitration (1899)  The Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) is an international organization based in The Hague in the Netherlands. The court was established in 1899 as one of the acts of the first Hague Peace Conference, which makes it the oldest global institution for international dispute resolution. Its creation is set out under Articles 20 to 29 of the 1899 Hague Convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes, which was a result of the first Hague Peace Conference. The most concrete achievement of the Conference was the establishment of the PCA as the first institutionalized global mechanism for the settlement of disputes between states. The PCA encourages the resolution of disputes that involve states, state entities, intergovernmental organizations, and private parties by assisting in the establishment of arbitration tribunals and facilitating their work. The court offers a wide range of services for the resolution of international disputes which the parties concerned have expressly agreed to submit for resolution under its auspices. Dutch-Jew legal scholar Tobias Asser's role in the creation of the PCA at the first Hague Peace Conference (1899) earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1911.  International Opium Convention (1912)  The International Opium Convention, sometimes referred to as the Hague Convention of 1912, signed on 23 January 1912 at The Hague, was the first international drug control treaty and is the core of the international drug control system. The adoption of the Convention was a turning point in multilateralism, based on the recognition of the transnational nature of the drug problem and the principle of shared responsibility.  Marriage equality (legalization of same-sex marriage) (2001)  Denmark was the first state to recognize a legal relationship for same-sex couples, establishing \\"registered partnerships\\" very much like marriage in 1989. In 2001, the Netherlands became the first nation in the world to grant same-sex marriages. The first laws enabling same-sex marriage in modern times were enacted during the first decade of the 21st century. , sixteen countries (Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark,Excluding the Faroe Islands and Greenland. France, Iceland, Netherlands,Excluding Aruba, Cura√ßao and St Maarten. New Zealand,Excluding Tokelau, Niue and the Cook Islands. Norway, Portugal, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, United Kingdom,Excluding Northern Ireland. The Scottish parliament has passed a bill that allows same-sex marriages to take place from October 2014. Uruguay) and several sub-national jurisdictions (parts of Mexico and the United States) allow same-sex couples to marry. Polls in various countries show that there is rising support for legally recognizing same-sex marriage across race, ethnicity, age, religion, political affiliation, and socioeconomic status. = Measurement =  Pendulum clock (first high- precision clock) (1656)  Spring driven pendulum clock, designed by Huygens, built by instrument maker Salomon Coster (1657), and manuscript Horologium Oscillatorium Christiaan Huygens ‚Äì \\"the most ingenious watchmaker of all time\\" (Arnold Sommerfeld)Gindikin, Simon; Shuchat, Alan (2007). Tales of Mathematicians and Physicists, p. 79 The first mechanical clocks, employing the verge escapement mechanism with a foliot or balance wheel timekeeper, were invented in Europe at around the start of the 14th century, and became the standard timekeeping device until the pendulum clock was invented in 1656. The pendulum clock remained the most accurate timekeeper until the 1930s, when quartz oscillators were invented, followed by atomic clocks after World War 2. A pendulum clock uses a pendulum's arc to mark intervals of time. From their invention until about 1930, the most accurate clocks were pendulum clocks. Pendulum clocks cannot operate on vehicles or ships at sea, because the accelerations disrupt the pendulum's motion, causing inaccuracies. The pendulum clock was invented by Christian Huygens, based on the pendulum introduced by Galileo Galilei. Although Galileo studied the pendulum as early as 1582, he never actually constructed a clock based on that design. Christiaan Huygens invented pendulum clock in 1656 and patented the following year. He contracted the construction of his clock designs to clockmaker Salomon Coster, who actually built the clock.  Concept of the standardization of the temperature scale (1665)  Various authors have credited the invention of the thermometer to Cornelis Drebbel, Robert Fludd, Galileo Galilei or Santorio Santorio. The thermometer was not a single invention, however, but a development. However, each inventor and each thermometer was unique ‚Äì there was no standard scale. In 1665 Christiaan Huygens suggested using the melting and boiling points of water as standards.Bir√≥, Tam√°s S√°ndor (2011). Is There a Temperature?: Conceptual Challenges at High Energy, Acceleration and Complexity (Fundamental Theories of Physics), p. 9Wei, James (2012). Great Inventions that Changed the World, p. 237 The Fahrenheit scale is now usually defined by two fixed points: the temperature at which water freezes into ice is defined as 32 degrees Fahrenheit (¬∞F), and the boiling point of water is defined to be , a 180-degree separation, as defined at sea level and standard atmospheric pressure. In 1742, Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius created a temperature scale which was the reverse of the scale now known by the name \\"Celsius\\": 0 represented the boiling point of water, while 100 represented the freezing point of water. From 1744 until 1954, 0 ¬∞C was defined as the freezing point of water and 100 ¬∞C was defined as the boiling point of water, both at a pressure of one standard atmosphere with mercury being the working material.  Spiral-hairspring watch (first high-precision watch) (1675)  Drawing of one of his first balance springs, attached to a balance wheel, by Christiaan Huygens, published in his letter in the Journal des S√ßavants of 25 February 1675. The application of the spiral balance spring for watches ushered in a new era of accuracy for portable timekeepers, similar to that which the pendulum had introduced for clocks. A mechanical watch movement. From its invention in 1675 by Christiaan Huygens, the spiral hairspring (balance spring) system for portable timekeepers, still used in mechanical watchmaking industry today. The invention of the mainspring in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first pocketwatches by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the balance spring was added to the balance wheel in the mid 17th century. Some dispute remains as to whether British scientist Robert Hooke (his was a straight spring) or Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens was the actual inventor of the balance spring. Huygens was clearly the first to successfully implement a spiral balance spring in a portable timekeeper. This is significant because up to that point the pendulum was the most reliable.M√§kikalli, Aino (2007). From Eternity to Time: Conceptions of Time in Daniel Defoe's Novels, p. 160‚Äì61Macey, Samuel L. (1994) . Encyclopedia of Time, p. 125‚Äì26Perman, Stacy (2013). A Grand Complication: The Race to Build the World's Most Legendary Watch, p. 150 This innovation increased watches' accuracy enormously, reducing error from perhaps several hours per dayMilham 1945, p.226 to perhaps 10 minutes per day, resulting in the addition of the minute hand to the face from around 1680 in Britain and 1700 in France. Like the invention of pendulum clock, Huygens' spiral hairspring (balance spring) system of portable timekeepers, helped lay the foundations for the modern watchmaking industry. The application of the spiral balance spring for watches ushered in a new era of accuracy for portable timekeepers, similar to that which the pendulum had introduced for clocks. From its invention in 1675 by Christiaan Huygens, the spiral hairspring (balance spring) system for portable timekeepers, still used in mechanical watchmaking industry today.  Mercury thermometer (first practical, accurate thermometer) (1714)  A medical mercury-in-glass maximum thermometer. Fahrenheit's mercury-in-glass thermometer was far more reliable and accurate than any that had existed before, and the mercury thermometers in use today are made in the way Fahrenheit devised. Various authors have credited the invention of the thermometer to Cornelis Drebbel, Robert Fludd, Galileo Galilei or Santorio Santorio. The thermometer was not a single invention, however, but a development. Though Galileo is often said to be the inventor of the thermometer, what he produced were thermoscopes. The difference between a thermoscope and a thermometer is that the latter has a scale.T.D. McGee (1988) Principles and Methods of Temperature Measurement p. 3, The first person to put a scale on a thermoscope is variously said to be Francesco SagredoJ.E. Drinkwater (1832)Life of Galileo Galilei p. 41 or Santorio SantorioThe Galileo Project: Santorio Santorio in about 1611 to 1613. Before there was the thermometer, there was the earlier and closely related thermoscope, best described as a thermometer without a temperature scale. A thermoscope only showed the differences in temperatures, for example, it could show something was getting hotter. However, the thermoscope did not measure all the data that a thermometer could, for example an exact temperature in degrees. What can be considered the first modern thermometer, the mercury thermometer with a standardized scale, was invented by German-Dutch scientist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (who had settled in Amsterdam in 1701) in 1714.Lydolph, Paul E. (1985). Weather and Climate, p. 13Allaby, Michael (2002). Encyclopedia of Weather and Climate, p. 204Don Rittner (2003). A to Z of Scientists in Weather and Climate, p. 53‚Äì54Richard Myers (2003). The Basics of Chemistry, p. 104Allaby, Michael (2004). A Chronology of Weather, p. 92Haven, Kendall (2005). 100 Greatest Science Inventions of All Time, p. 66 Fahrenheit invented the first truly accurate thermometer using mercury instead of alcohol and water mixtures. He began constructing his own thermometers in 1714, and it was in these that he used mercury for the first time.  Fahrenheit scale (first standardized temperature scale) (1724)  Thermometer with Fahrenheit (symbol ¬∞F) and Celsius (symbol ¬∞C) units. Various authors have credited the invention of the thermometer to Cornelis Drebbel, Robert Fludd, Galileo Galilei or Santorio Santorio. The thermometer was not a single invention, however, but a development. However, each inventor and each thermometer was unique ‚Äì there was no standard scale. In 1665 Christiaan Huygens suggested using the melting and boiling points of water as standards, and in 1694 Carlo Renaldini proposed using them as fixed points on a universal scale. In 1701 Isaac Newton proposed a scale of 12 degrees between the melting point of ice and body temperature. Finally in 1724 Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit produced a temperature scale which now (slightly adjusted) bears his name. He could do this because he manufactured thermometers, using mercury (which has a high coefficient of expansion) for the first time and the quality of his production could provide a finer scale and greater reproducibility, leading to its general adoption. The Fahrenheit scale was the first widely used temperature scale. By the end of the 20th century, most countries used the Celsius scale rather than the Fahrenheit scale, though Canada retained it as a supplementary scale used alongside Celsius. Fahrenheit remains the official scale for Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Belize, the Bahamas, Palau and the United States and associated territories.  Snellen chart (1862)  The Snellen chart is an eye chart used by eye care professionals and others to measure visual acuity. Snellen charts are named after Dutch ophthalmologist Hermann Snellen who developed the chart in 1862. Vision scientists now use a variation of this chart, designed by Ian Bailey and Jan Lovie.  String galvanometer (1902)  Previous to the string galvanometer, scientists used a machine called the capillary electrometer to measure the heart's electrical activity, but this device was unable to produce results at a diagnostic level. Dutch physiologist Willem Einthoven developed the string galvanometer in the early 20th century, publishing the first registration of its use to record an electrocardiogram in a Festschrift book in 1902. The first human electrocardiogram was recorded in 1887, however only in 1901 was a quantifiable result obtained from the string galvanometer.  Schilt photometer (1922)  In 1922, Dutch astronomer Jan Schilt invented the Schilt photometer, a device that measures the light output of stars and, indirectly, their distances. = Medicine =  Clinical electrocardiography (first diagnostic electrocardiogram) (1902)  ECG as done by Willem Einthoven In the 19th century it became clear that the heart generated electric currents. The first to systematically approach the heart from an electrical point-of-view was Augustus Waller, working in St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London. In 1911 he saw little clinical application for his work. The breakthrough came when Einthoven, working in Leiden, used his more sensitive string galvanometer, than the capillary electrometer that Waller used. Einthoven assigned the letters P, Q, R, S and T to the various deflections that it measured and described the electrocardiographic features of a number of cardiovascular disorders. He was awarded the 1924 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for his discovery.Snellen, H. A. (1995).

The shape forms an inverted equilateral triangle with the heart at the center that produces zero potential when the voltages are summed. It is named after Willem Einthoven, who theorized its existence.  First European blood bank (1940)  When German bombers attacked The Hague in 1940 while Willem Johan Kolff was there, he organised the first blood bank in continental Europe. It was located in the Zuidwal hospital in The Hague. 'Biografie Willem Johan Kolff' rug.nl. Retrieved 12 April 2016. Eleven patients were given blood transfusions in The Hague, six of whom survived. Donated blood was also used for victims of the bombardment of Rotterdam, whither it was transported by civilian car.  Rotating drum dialysis machine (first practical artificial kidney) (1943)  Kolff's artificial kidney An artificial kidney is a machine and its related devices which clean blood for patients who have an acute or chronic failure of their kidneys. The first artificial kidney was developed by Dutchman Willem Johan Kolff. The procedure of cleaning the blood by this means is called dialysis, a type of renal replacement therapy that is used to provide an artificial replacement for lost kidney function due to renal failure. It is a life support treatment and does not treat disease.Katz, Jay; Capron, Alexander Morgan (1975). Catastrophic Diseases: Who Decides What?, p. 35‚Äì36Simmons, John G. (2002).

The dog lived for 90 minutes. In 1967, Dr. Kolff left Cleveland Clinic to start the Division of Artificial Organs at the University of Utah and pursue his work on the artificial heart. Under his supervision, a team of surgeons, chemists, physicists and bioengineers developed an artificial heart and made it ready for industrial production. To help manage his many endeavors, Dr. Kolff assigned project managers. Each project was named after its manager. Graduate student Robert Jarvik was the project manager for the artificial heart, which was subsequently renamed the Jarvik-7. Based on lengthy animal trials, this first artificial heart was successfully implanted into the thorax of patient Barney Clark in December 1982. Clark survived 112 days with the device. = Military =  Modern model of sea power (1585‚Äì1688)  The Dutch Republic has been considered by many political and military historians as the first modern (global) sea power.Mead, Walter Russell (2007). God and Gold: Britain, America and the Making of the Modern WorldKraska, James (2011). Maritime Power and the Law of the Sea: Expeditionary Operations in World Politics, p. 46‚Äì50Eizenstat, Stuart E. (2012). The Future of the Jews: How Global Forces are Impacting the Jewish People, Israel, and Its Relationship with the United States, p. 12. As Eizenstat observes, \\"since the Dutch invented modern capitalism in the seventeenth century, global powers have thrived by combining economic and military forces.\\" The United Provinces of the Netherlands was the first state to possess the full triad of foreign commerce, forward bases and merchant and naval fleets. In the middle of the 17th century the Dutch navy was the most powerful navy in the world.Glete, Jan (2000). Warfare at Sea, 1500‚Äì1650: Maritime Conflicts and the Transformation of Europe. (Routledge)Glete, Jan (2001). The Dutch Navy, Dutch State Formation and the Rise of Dutch Maritime Supremacy. (Paper for the Anglo-American Conference for Historians:The Sea, 4‚Äì6 July 2001, University of London, Institute of Historical Research). \\"From the late sixteenth to the early eighteenth century, Holland, Zeeland and Friesland, that is, the maritime provinces of the Dutch Republic, formed Europe‚Äôs leading maritime society. This society had a great mercantile community, a huge mercantile marine, a large seafaring population, many ports, shipyards and a large market for naval stores. Dutch maritime activities are normally described as superior to those of other nations and proofs of the Dutch society‚Äôs ability to combine technology, entrepreneurship and low transaction costs. The Dutch was in this period the naval enemy or ally of Spain, Portugal, England, France, Denmark-Norway and Sweden. In the naval histories of these countries, the Dutch navy is treated with respect, admiration or envy. In 1639, it won one of the most decisive victories ever achieved in a major fleet contest against Spain-Portugal in the Channel, and in 1658‚Äì59 it saved Denmark from possible extinction as an independent state by Sweden. In 1667, it attacked the English fleet in its bases, in 1672‚Äì73 it waged a very successful defensive campaign against the combined fleets of France and England, and in 1688 it achieved an invasion of England in an excellently administrated surprise mobilisation of a major fleet. In a European perspective, the Dutch navy is a strong candidate for the position as the most successful naval organisation of the seventeenth century.\\" The Dutch Republic had a commercial fleet that was larger than that of England, France, Germany, Portugal, and Spain combined. According to Walter Russell Mead, the \\"modern version of sea power was invented by the Dutch. The system of global trade, investment, and military power the Dutch built in the seventeenth century was the envy and the wonder of the world at the time, and many of its basic features were adopted by the British and the Americans in subsequent years.\\"Mead, Walter Russell (2007). God and Gold: Britain, America and the Making of the Modern World. \\"That Dutch system was like version 1.0 of the operating software on which much of the world still runs. At the turn of eighteenth century the British introduced version 2.0; there were several incremental upgrades along the way until the Americans introduced version 3.0 after the Second World War.\\" When the Peter the Great determined to achieve sea power for Imperial Russia, he came to the Dutch Republic to learn about shipbuilding, seamanship and nautical sciences.Tuchman, Barbara W. (1988). The First Salute: A View of the American Revolution During his stay in Holland (1697) the Tsar engaged, with the help of Russian and Dutch assistants, many skilled workers such as builders of locks, fortresses, shipwrights and seamen. They had to help him with his modernization of Russia. The best-known sailor who made the journey from the Dutch Republic to Russia was Norwegian-Dutch Cornelius Cruys. Cruys performed well in Russia and came be regarded as the architect of the Russian Navy. He became the first commander of the Russian Baltic Fleet and the vice admiral of the Imperial Russian Navy. Peter the Great designed his new capital on the model of Amsterdam and gave it a Dutch name, Sint Pieterburgh (later Germanized into Sankt Peterburg). In St. Petersburg, there is an island which is still called Novaya Gollandiya (literally \\"New Holland\\"). The triangular man-made island took its name after a number of canals and shipbuilding facilities that rendered its appearance similar to Amsterdam. The Tsar chose to call his island \\"New Holland\\", commemorating his enthusiasm for all things Dutch.  House of Orange- Nassau's military reforms (1590s‚Äì17th century)  Dutch States Army musketeer by Jacob de Gheyn II from his Wapenhandelinge. Dutch military reforms had considerable influences on the European warfare in the early modern period (the 17th and 18th centuries in particular).Karsten, Peter (2013). The Military-State-Society Symbiosis, p. 37‚Äì60 The early modern Military Revolution began with reforms inaugurated by Prince Maurice of Nassau with his cousins Count Willem Lodewijk of Nassau-Dillenburg and Count John VII of Nassau during the 1590s. Maurice developed a system of linear formations (linear tactics), discipline, drill and volley fire based on classical Roman methods that made his army more efficient and his command and control more effective. He also developed a 43-step drill for firing the musket that was included in an illustrated weapons manual by Jacob de Gheyn II in 1607 (Wapenhandelinghe or Exerise of Arms). This became known as the Dutch drill. It was widely read and emulated in the rest of Europe. Adopting and perfecting the techniques pioneered by Maurice of Nassau several decades earlier, Gustavus Adolphus repeatedly proved his techniques by defeating the armies of the Holy Roman empire(1630‚Äì1632), an adversary with resources fantastically larger than Sweden's during the Thirty Years' War.Steinmetz, George (1999).

Globalization and Time Descartes served for a while in the army of the Dutch military leader Prince Maurice of Orange-Nassau, and developed a fascination for practical technology. Maurice' s military innovations had considerable influences on Descartes' system of philosophy.Karsten, Luchien (2012). Globalization and Time  Norden bombsight (1920s)  The Norden bombsight was designed by Carl Norden, a Dutch engineer educated in Switzerland who emigrated to the U.S. in 1904. In 1920, he started work on the Norden bombsight for the United States Navy. The first bombsight was produced in 1927. It was essentially an analog computer, and bombardiers were trained in great secrecy on how to use it. The device was used to drop bombs accurately from an aircraft, supposedly accurate enough to hit a 100-foot circle from an altitude of 21,000 feet ‚Äì but under actual combat situations, such an accuracy was never achieved.  Submarine snorkel (1939)  A submarine snorkel is a device that allows a submarine to operate submerged while still taking in air from above the surface. It was invented by the Dutchman J.J. Wichers shortly before World War II and copied by the Germans during the war for use by U-Boats. Its common military name is snort.  Goalkeeper CIWS (1975)  Goalkeeper is a close-in weapon system (CIWS) still in use as of 2015. It is autonomous and completely automatic short-range defense of ships against highly maneuverable missiles, aircraft and fast maneuvering surface vessels. Once activated the system automatically performs the entire process from surveillance and detection to destruction, including selection of priority targets. = Musical instruments =  Metronome (1812)  A mechanical wind-up metronome in motion The first (mechanical) metronome was invented by Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel in Amsterdam in 1812, but named (patented) after Johann Maelzel, who took the idea and popularized it.Apel, Willi (1969).

Violin For Dummies, 2nd Edition  Fokker organ (1950)  Dutch musician-physicist Adriaan Fokker designed and had built keyboard instruments capable of playing microtonal scales via a generalized keyboard. The best-known of these is his 31-tone equal-tempered organ, which was installed in Teylers Museum in Haarlem in 1951. It is commonly called the Fokker organ.  Kraakdoos (1960s)  The Kraakdoos or Cracklebox is a custom-made battery-powered noise-making electronic device. It is a small box with six metal contacts on top, which when pressed by fingers generates unusual sounds and tones. The human body becomes a part of the circuit and determines the range of sounds possible ‚Äì different players generate different results. The concept was first conceived by Michel Waisvisz and Geert Hamelberg in the 1960s, and developed further in the 1970s when Waisvisz joined the STEIM foundation in Amsterdam.  Moodswinger (2006)  The Moodswinger is a twelve-string electric zither with an additional third bridge designed by Dutch luthier Yuri Landman. The rod functions as the third bridge and divides the strings into two sections to add overtones, creating a multiphonic sound.  Springtime (guitar) (2008)  The Springtime is an experimental electric guitar with seven strings and three outputs. Landman created the instrument in 2008. = Philosophy and social sciences =  Neostoicism (1580s)  Neostoicism was a syncretic philosophical movement, joining Stoicism and Christianity. Neostoicism was founded by Dutch-Flemish humanist Justus Lipsius, who in 1584 presented its rules, expounded in his book De Constantia (On Constancy), as a dialogue between Lipsius and his friend Charles de Langhe. The eleven years (1579‚Äì1590) that Lipsius spent in Leiden (Leiden University) were the period of his greatest productivity. It was during this time that he wrote a series of works designed to revive ancient Stoicism in a form that would be compatible with Christianity. The most famous of these is De Constantia (1584). Neostoicism had a direct influence on many seventeenth and eighteenth-century writers including Montesquieu, Bossuet, Francis Bacon, Joseph Hall, Francisco de Quevedo and Juan de Vera y Figueroa.  Modern rationalism (1630s‚Äì1670s)  The rise of modern rationalism in the Dutch Republic, had a profound influence on the 17th-century philosophy. Descartes is often considered to be the first of the modern rationalists. Descartes himself had lived in the Dutch Republic for some twenty years (1628‚Äì1649) and served for a while in the army of the Dutch military leader Prince Maurice of Orange-Nassau. The Dutch Republic was the first country in which Descartes' rationalistic philosophy (Cartesianism) succeeded in replacing Aristotelianism as the academic orthodoxy. Fritz Berolzheimer considers Hugo Grotius the Descartes of legal philosophy and notes Grotian rationalism's influence on the 17th-century jurisprudence: \\"As the Cartesian \\"cogito ergo sum\\" became the point of departure of rationalistic philosophy, so the establishment of government and law upon reason made Hugo Grotius the founder of an independent and purely rationalistic system of natural law.\\" In the late 1650s Leiden was a place where one could study Cartesian philosophy. Sometime between 1656 and 1661 it appears that Spinoza did some formal study of philosophy at the University of Leiden. Philosophy of Spinoza (Spinozism) was a systematic answer to Descartes' famous dualist theory that the body and spirit are separate.  Modern pantheism (1670s)  Pantheism was popularized in the modern era as both a theology and philosophy based on the work of the 17th-century Dutch Jew philosopher Baruch Spinoza, whose Ethics was an answer to Descartes' famous dualist theory that the body and spirit are separate. Spinoza is regarded as the chief source of modern pantheism. Spinoza held that the two are the same, and this monism is a fundamental quality of his philosophy. He was described as a \\"God-intoxicated man,\\" and used the word God to describe the unity of all substance. Although the term pantheism was not coined until after his death, Spinoza is regarded as its most celebrated advocate.  Early liberalism (foundations of liberalism) (17th century)  European liberalism, Isaiah Berlin wrote, \\"wears the appearance of a single coherent movement, little altered during almost three centuries, founded upon relatively simple foundations, laid by Locke or Grotius or even Spinoza; stretching back to Erasmus and Montaigne...\\"Ullmann-Margalit, Edna; Margalit, Avishai (1991). Isaiah Berlin: A Celebration, p. 16 As Bertrand Russell noted in his A History of Western Philosophy (1945): \\"Descartes lived in Holland for twenty years (1629‚Äì49), except for a few brief visits to France and one to England, all on business. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of Holland in the seventeenth century, as the one country where there was freedom of speculation. Hobbes had to have his books printed there; Locke took refuge there during the five worst years of reaction in England before 1688; Bayle (of the Dictionary) found it necessary to live there; and Spinoza would hardly have been allowed to do his work in any other country.\\"Russell, Bertrand (1945). A History of Western Philosophy Russell described early liberalism in Europe: \\"Early liberalism was a product of England and Holland, and had certain well-marked characteristics. It stood for religious toleration; it was Protestant, but of a latitudinarian rather than of a fanatical kind; it regarded the wars of religion as silly...\\" As Russell Shorto states: \\"Liberalism has many meanings, but in its classical sense it is a philosophy based on individual freedom. History has long taught that our modern sensibility comes from the eighteenth century Enlightenment. In recent decades, historians have seen the Dutch Enlightenment of the seventeenth century as the root of the wider Enlightenment.\\"Feuer, Lewis S. (1987). Spinoza and the Rise of LiberalismDunthorne, H. (2004). The Dutch Republic: ‚Äòthat Mother Nation of Liberty‚Äô, in The Enlightenment World, M. Fitzpatrick, P. Jones, C. Knellwolf and I. McCalman eds. London: Routledge, p. 87‚Äì103 And at the center of this sits the city of Amsterdam.\\" Amsterdam, to Shorto, was not only the first city in Europe to develop the cultural and political foundations of what we now call liberalism ‚Äì a society focused on the concerns and comforts of individuals, run by individuals acting together, and tolerant of religion, ethnicity, or other differences ‚Äì but also an exporter of these beliefs to the rest of Europe and the New World.Shorto, Russell (2013). Amsterdam: A History of the World's Most Liberal City  Cartesianism (1630s‚Äì1640s)  If Descartes is still considered the father of modern philosophy, Dutch Republic can be called its cradle. Cartesianism is the name given to the philosophical doctrine of Ren√© Descartes. Descartes is often regarded as the first thinker to emphasize the use of reason to develop the natural sciences. Cartesianism had been controversial for several years before 1656. Descartes himself had lived in the Dutch Republic for some twenty years (1628‚Äì1649). Descartes served for a while in the army of the Dutch military leader Prince Maurice of Orange-Nassau, and developed a fascination for practical technology. In the 1630s, while staying in the Dutch city Deventer, Descartes worked on a text which became published as Traite' de l'Homme (1664). Throughout his writing, he used words such as clock, automaton, and self ‚Äì moving machine as interchangeable constructs. He postulated an account of the physical world that was thoroughly materialistic. His mechanical view of nature replaced the organism model which had been popular since the Renaissance. His Discours de la m√©thode (1637) was originally published at Leiden, and his Principia philosophiae (1644) appeared from the presses at Amsterdam. In the 1630s and 1640s, Descartes's ideas gained a foothold at the Dutch universities.Frijhoff, Willem; Spies, Marijke (2004). Dutch Culture in a European Perspective 1: 1650: Hard-Won Unity, p. 294  Spinozism (1660s‚Äì1670s)  Spinozism is the monist philosophical system of the Dutch-Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza which defines \\"God\\" as a singular self-subsistent substance, with both matter and thought as its attributes.  Affect (philosophy) (1670s)  Affect (affectus or adfectus in Latin) is a concept used in the philosophy of Spinoza and elaborated by Henri Bergson, Gilles Deleuze and F√©lix Guattari that emphasizes bodily experience. The term \\"affect\\" is central to what became known as the \\"affective turn\\" in the humanities and social sciences.  Mandeville's paradox (1714)  Mandeville's paradox is named after Bernard Mandeville, who shows that actions which may be qualified as vicious with regard to individuals have benefits for society as a whole. This is already clear from the subtitle of his most famous work, The Fable of The Bees: ‚ÄòPrivate Vices, Publick Benefits‚Äô. He states that \\"Fraud, Luxury, and Pride must live; Whilst we the Benefits receive.\\") (The Fable of the Bees, ‚ÄòThe Moral‚Äô).  Mathematical intuitionism (1907‚Äì1908)  Mathematical intuitionism was founded by the Dutch mathematician and philosopher Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer. In the philosophy of mathematics, intuitionism, or neointuitionism (opposed to preintuitionism), is an approach where mathematics is considered to be purely the result of the constructive mental activity of humans rather than the discovery of fundamental principles claimed to exist in an objective reality. That is, logic and mathematics are not considered analytic activities wherein deep properties of objective reality are revealed and applied, but are instead considered the application of internally consistent methods used to realize more complex mental constructs, regardless of their possible independent existence in an objective reality. = Religion and ethics =  Devotio Moderna (1370s‚Äì1390s)  Devotio Moderna, or Modern Devotion, was a movement for religious reform, calling for apostolic renewal through the rediscovery of genuine pious practices such as humility, obedience and simplicity of life. It began in the late fourteenth-century, largely through the work of Gerard Groote, and flourished in the Low Countries and Germany in the fifteenth century, but came to an end with the Protestant Reformation. Gerard Groote, father of the movement, founded the Brethren of the Common Life; after his death, disciples established a house of Augustinian Canons at Windesheim (near Zwolle, Overijssel). These two communities became the principal exponents of Devotio Moderna. Martin Luther studied under the Brethren of the Common Life at Magdeburg before going on to the University of Erfurt. Another famous member of the Brethren of the Common Life was Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam. Devotio Moderna, an undogmatic form of piety which some historians have argued helped to pave the road for the Protestant Reformation, is most known today through its influence on Thomas √† Kempis, the author of The Imitation of Christ a book which proved highly influential for centuries.  Mennonites (1536)  The Mennonites are a Christian group based around the church communities of Anabaptist denominations named after Menno Simons (1496‚Äì1561) of Friesland. Through his writings, Simons articulated and formalized the teachings of earlier Swiss founders. The teachings of the Mennonites were founded on their belief in both the mission and Ministry of Jesus Christ, which they held to with great conviction despite persecution by various Roman Catholic and Protestant states.  Dutch Reformed Church (1571)  The Dutch Reformed Church (in Dutch: Nederlandse Hervormde Kerk or NHK) was a Reformed Christian denomination. It developed during the Protestant Reformation, with its base in what became known as the Roman Catholic Church. It was founded in the 1570s and lasted until 2004, the year it merged with the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Kingdom of the Netherlands to form the Protestant Church in the Netherlands.  Arminianism (1620)  Arminianism is based on the theological ideas of Dutch Reformed theologian Jacobus Arminius (1560‚Äì1609) and his historic supporters known as the Remonstrants. His teachings held to the five solae of the Reformation, but they were distinct from the particular teachings of Martin Luther, Zwingli, John Calvin, and other Protestant Reformers. Arminius (Jacobus Hermanszoon) was a student of Beza (successor of Calvin) at the Theological University of Geneva. Many Christian denominations have been influenced by Arminian views on the will of man being freed by grace prior to regeneration, notably the Baptists in the 16th century, the Methodists in the 18th century and the Seventh-day Adventist Church. John Wesley was influenced by Arminianism. Also, Arminianism was an important influence in Methodism, which developed out of the Wesleyan movement. Some assert that Universalists and Unitarians in the 18th and 19th centuries were theologically linked with Arminianism.  First synagogue to be established in the (Americas) New World (1636)  The first synagogue of the New World, Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue, is founded in Recife, Brazil by the Dutch Jews. The Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue in Recife, Brazil, erected in 1636, was the first synagogue erected in the Americas. Its foundations have been recently discovered, and the 20th-century buildings on the site have been altered to resemble a 17th-century Dutch synagogue.Israel, Jonathan Irvine; Schwartz, Stuart B. (2007). The Expansion of Tolerance: Religion in Dutch Brazil (1624‚Äì1654), p. 13  Jansenism (1640s)  Jansenism was a Catholic theological movement, primarily in France, that emphasized original sin, human depravity, the necessity of divine grace, and predestination. The movement originated from the posthumously published work (Augustinus) of the Dutch theologian Cornelius Jansen, who died in 1638. It was first popularized by Jansen's friend Abbot Jean Duvergier de Hauranne, of Saint-Cyran-en-Brenne Abbey, and after Duvergier's death in 1643, was led by Antoine Arnauld. Through the 17th and into the 18th centuries, Jansenism was a distinct movement within the Catholic Church. The theological centre of the movement was the convent of Port-Royal Abbey, Paris, which was a haven for writers including Duvergier, Arnauld, Pierre Nicole, Blaise Pascal, and Jean Racine.  First Jewish congregation to be established in (the United States) North America (1654)  Congregation Shearith Israel, the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue in the City of New Amsterdam, was founded in 1654, the first Jewish congregation to be established in North America. Its founders were twenty- three Jews, mostly of Spanish and Portuguese origin, who had been living in Recife, Brazil. When the Portuguese defeated the Dutch for control of Recife, and brought with them the Inquisition, the Jews of that area left. Some returned to Amsterdam, where they had originated. Others went to places in the Caribbean such as St. Thomas, Jamaica, Surinam and Cura√ßao, where they founded sister Sephardic congregations. One group of twenty-three Jews, after a series of unexpected events, landed in New Amsterdam. After being initially rebuffed by anti-Semitic Governor Peter Stuyvesant, Jews were given official permission to settle in the colony in 1655. These pioneers fought for their rights and won permission to remain. This marks the founding of the Congregation Shearith Israel. = Scientific instruments =  Telescope (optical telescope) (1608)  The first historical records of a telescope appear in patents filed 1608 by Hans Lippershey and Jacob Metius.galileo.rice.edu The Galileo Project Science The Telescope by Al Van Helden: \\"The Hague discussed the patent applications first of Hans Lipperhey of Middelburg, and then of Jacob Metius of Alkmaar... another citizen of Middelburg, Sacharias Janssen had a telescope at about the same time but was at the Frankfurt Fair where he tried to sell it\\"Mumford, Lewis (2010).

Huygens eyepiece (first compound eyepiece) (1670s)  Huygens eyepieces consist of two plano- convex lenses with the plane sides towards the eye separated by an air gap. The lenses are called the eye lens and the field lens. The focal plane is located between the two lenses. It was invented by Christiaan Huygens in the late 1660s and was the first compound (multi-lens) eyepiece.Philip S. Harrington, \\"Star Ware\\", p. 181Thompson, Allyn J. (2003).

Applied Physics, p. 303‚Äì04Paolini, William (2013). Choosing and Using Astronomical Eyepieces, p. 5 Huygens discovered that two air spaced lenses can be used to make an eyepiece with zero transverse chromatic aberration. These eyepieces work well with the very long focal length telescopes (in Huygens day they were used with single element long focal length non-achromatic refracting telescopes, including very long focal length aerial telescopes). This optical design is now considered obsolete since with today's shorter focal length telescopes the eyepiece suffers from short eye relief, high image distortion, chromatic aberration, and a very narrow apparent field of view. Since these eyepieces are cheap to make they can often be found on inexpensive telescopes and microscopes.astro- tom.com Huygens Because Huygens eyepieces do not contain cement to hold the lens elements, telescope users sometimes use these eyepieces in the role of \\"solar projection\\", i.e. projecting an image of the Sun onto a screen. Other cemented eyepieces can be damaged by the intense, concentrated light of the Sun.  Microorganisms (1670s)  Replica of microscope by Leeuwenhoek. Van Leeuwenhoek is considered to be the first to observe and describe microorganisms (animalcules) using a microscope. Using an improved simple microscope, in 1673 Antonie van Leeuwenhoek becomes the first to discover, observe, describe, study and conduct scientific experiments with single-celled organisms, which he originally referred to as animalcules, and which now referred to as micro-organisms or microbes.Burgess, Jeremy; Marten, Michael; Taylor, Rosemary (1990).

His simple microscopes were made of silver or copper frames, holding specially shaped single glass sphere that acted as a small lens. The smaller the sphere, the more in magnified. Those that have survived are capable of magnification up to 275 times. It is suspected that Van Leeuwenhoek possessed units that could magnify up to 500 times.  Cycloidal pendulum (1673)  The cycloid pendulum was invented by Christiaan Huygens in 1673. Its purpose is to eliminate the lack of isochronism of the ordinary simple pendulum. This is achieved by making the mass point move on a cycloid instead of a circular arc.Blume, Frank (2005).

Mathematics and Its History, p. 258‚Äì59  Pyrometer (1739)  The pyrometer, invented by Pieter van Musschenbroek, is a temperature measuring device. A simple type uses a thermocouple placed either in a furnace or on the item to be measured. The voltage output of the thermocouple is read from a meter. Many different types of thermocouple are available, for measuring temperatures from ‚àí200 ¬∞C to above 1500 ¬∞C.  Leyden jar (first practical capacitor) (1745‚Äì1746)  A battery of four water-filled Leyden jars, Museum Boerhaave, Leiden. The Leyden jar was the first device capable of storing an electric charge. A Leyden jar, or Leiden jar, is a device that \\"stores\\" static electricity between two electrodes on the inside and outside of a glass jar. It was the original form of a capacitor (originally known as a \\"condenser\\"). It was invented independently by German cleric Ewald Georg von Kleist on 11 October 1745 and by Dutch scientist Pieter van Musschenbroek of Leiden (Leyden) in 1745‚Äì1746. The invention was named for the city. The Leyden jar was used to conduct many early experiments in electricity, and its discovery was of fundamental importance in the study of electricity. Previously, researchers had to resort to insulated conductors of large dimensions to store a charge. The Leyden jar provided a much more compact alternative. Like many early electrical devices, there was no particular use for the Leyden jar at first, other than to allow scientists to do a greater variety of electrical experiments. Benjamin Franklin, for example, used a Leyden jar to store electricity from lightning in his famous kite experiment in 1752. By doing so he proved that lightning was really electricity. The idea for the Leyden jar was discovered independently by two parties: German scientist and jurist Ewald Georg von Kleist, and Dutchmen Pieter van Musschenbroek and Andreas Cunaeus. These scientists developed the Leyden jar while working under a theory of electricity that saw electricity as a fluid, and hoped to develop the jar to \\"capture\\" this fluid. In 1744 von Kleist lined a glass jar with silver foil, and charged the foil with a friction machine. Kleist was convinced that a substantial electric charge could be collected when he received a significant shock from the device. The effects of this \\"Kleistian jar\\" were independently discovered around the same time by Dutch scientists Pieter van Musschenbroek and Cunaeus at the University of Leiden. Van Musschenbroek communicated on it with the French scientific community where it was called the Leyden jar.Heilbron, J. L. (1979).

It took Eisinga seven years to build his planetarium, completing it in 1781. The orrery still exists and is the world's oldest working planetarium.  Kipp's apparatus (1860)  Kipp's apparatus, also called a Kipp generator, is designed for preparation of small volumes of gases. It was invented around 1860 by Dutch pharmacist Petrus Jacobus Kipp and widely used in chemical laboratories and for demonstrations in schools into the second half of the 20th century.  Phase contrast microscope (1933)  A phase-contrast microscope. Frits Zernike's invention permits the study of internal cell structure without the need to stain and thus kill the cells. In optical microscopy many objects such as cell parts in protozoans, bacteria and sperm tails are essentially fully transparent unless stained (and therefore killed). The difference in densities and composition within these objects however often gives rise to changes in the phase of light passing through them, hence they are sometimes called \\"phase objects\\". Using the phase-contrast technique makes these structures visible and allows the study of living specimens. This phase contrast technique proved to be such an advancement in microscopy that Dutch physicist Frits Zernike was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1953.  Magnetic horn (1961)  The magnetic horn (also known as the Van der Meer horn) is a high-current, pulsed focusing device, invented by the Dutch physicist Simon van der Meer at CERN. It selects pions and focuses them into a sharp beam. Its original application was in the context of neutrino physics, where beams of pions have to be tightly focused. When the pions then decay into muons and neutrinos or antineutrinos, an equally well-focused neutrino beam is obtained. The muons were stopped in a wall of 3000 tons of iron and 1000 tons of concrete, leaving the neutrinos or antineutrinos to reach the Gargamelle bubble chamber. = Sports and games =  Kolf (forerunner of modern golf) ( 13th century)  Kolf players on ice, Hendrick Avercamp's painting (1625) A golf-like game (kolf in Dutch) is recorded as taking place on 26 February 1297, in a city called Loenen aan de Vecht, where the Dutch played a game with a stick and leather ball. The winner was whomever hit the ball with the least number of strokes into a target several hundred yards away. Some scholars argue that this game of putting a small ball in a hole in the ground using clubs was also played in 17th-century Netherlands and that this predates the game in Scotland.  Figure skating (prototype) (15th‚Äì17th centuries)  St. Lidwina of Schiedam's fall when she was ice skating, wood drawing from the 1498 edition of John Brugman's Vita of Lidwina. The Dutch played a significant role in the history of ice skating (including speed skating and figure skating). The first feature of ice skating in a work of art was made in the 15th century. The picture, depicted Saint Lidwina, patron saint of ice skaters, falling on the ice. Another important aspect is a man seen in the background, who is skating on one leg. This means that his skates must have had sharp edges similar to those found on modern ice skates. Until the 17th century, ice skating was mostly used for transportation. Some of the Stuarts (including King Charles II of England) who had fled to the Dutch Republic during the Cromwell Royal reign later returned to Britain, bringing with them the new sport. Upon his return to England in 1658, the King brought two innovations in ice skating ‚Äì a pair of iron skates and the Dutch roll. The Dutch roll was the first form of a gliding or skating motion made possible by the iron skate's two edges. However, speed skating was the focus of the Dutch, while the English developed modern figure skating.  Speed skating (15th‚Äì17th centuries)  Speed skating match on the Zuiderzee near Hindeloopen in 1828 Speed skating, which had developed in the Netherlands in the 17th century, was given a boost by the innovations in skate construction. Speed skating, or speedskating, is a competitive form of skating in which skaters race each other over a certain distance. Types of speed skating are long track speed skating, short track speed skating and marathon speed skating. In the modern Olympic Games, long-track speed skating is usually referred to as just \\"speed skating\\", while short-track speed skating is known as \\"short track\\".  Yachting (sport sailing) (17th century)  Sailing, also known as yachting, is a sport in which competitors race from point to point, or around a race course, in sail-powered boats. Yachting refers to recreational sailing or boating, the specific act of sailing or using other water vessels for sporting purposes. The invention of sailing is prehistoric, but the racing of sailing boats is believed to have started in the Netherlands some time in the 17th century. While living in the Dutch Republic, King Charles II of England fell in love with sailing and in 1660, took home the Dutch gifted 66-foot yacht he called Mary. The sport's popularity spread across the British Isles. The world's first yacht club was founded in Cork, Ireland in 1720.  International Skating Union (1892)  The International Skating Union (ISU) is the international governing body for competitive ice skating disciplines, including figure skating, synchronized skating, speed skating, and short track speed skating. It was founded in Scheveningen, Netherlands, in 1892, making it the oldest governing international winter sport federation and one of the oldest international sport federations. The first official World Championships in Speed Skating (open to men only) directly under the auspices of the ISU were held in Amsterdam in 1893.  Korfball (1902)  Korfball (Korfbal in Dutch) is a mixed gender team sport, with similarities to netball and basketball. A team consists of eight players; four female and four male. A team also includes a coach. It was founded in the Netherlands in 1902 by Nico Broekhuysen.  Cruyff Turn (1974)  The Cruijff Turn (also known as Cruyff Turn), is a famous dribbling trick in football, was perfected by the Dutch football player Johan Cruijff for whom the evasive trick was named. To make this move, the player first looks to pass or cross the ball. However, instead of kicking it, he drags the ball behind his planted foot with the inside of his other foot, turns through 180 degrees and accelerates away. The trick was famously employed by Cruijff in the 1974 FIFA World Cup, first seen in the Dutch match against Sweden and soon widely copied.  Total Football (1970s)  The foundations for Total Football (Dutch: totaalvoetbal) were laid by Englishman Jack Reynolds who was the manager of AFC Ajax. Rinus Michels, who played under Reynolds, later became manager of Ajax and refined the concept into what is known today as \\"Total Football\\" (Totaalvoetbal in Dutch language), using it in his training for the Ajax Amsterdam squad and the Netherlands national football team in the 1970s.Winner, David (2000). Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch FootballKraba, Milile (2010). The Story Has Been Told, p. 99Richards, Ted (2010). Soccer and Philosophy: Beautiful Thoughts on the Beautiful Game (Popular Culture and Philosophy) It was further refined by Stefan Kovacs after Michels left for FC Barcelona. Johan Cruyff was the system's most famous exponent. Due to Cruyff's style of play, he is still referred to as the total footballer.With regards to role models, Brazilian football manager and former player Tel√™ Santana has mentioned in one interview (1992) that he had no idols, though: \\"My greatest satisfaction would be to manage a team such as 1974 Holland. It was a team where you could pick [Johan] Cruyff and place him on the right wing. If I had to put him in the left-wing, he would still play [the same]. I could choose Neeskens, who played both to the right and to the left of the midfield. Thus, everyone played in any position.\\" Its cornerstone was a focus on positional interchange. The invention of totaalvoetbal helped lay the foundations for the significant successes of Dutch football at both club and international level in the 1970s. During that decade, the Dutch football rose from almost total obscurity to become a powerhouse in world football. In an interview published in the 50th anniversary issue of World Soccer magazine, the captain of the Brazilian team that won the 1970 FIFA World Cup, Carlos Alberto, went on to say: \\"The only team I‚Äôve seen that did things differently was Holland at the 1974 World Cup in Germany. Since then everything looks more or less the same to me‚Ä¶. Their ‚Äòcarousel‚Äô style of play was amazing to watch and marvellous for the game.\\"  Tiki-taka (1990s)  FC Barcelona and the Spain national football team play a style of football known as Tiki-taka that has its roots in Total Football. Johan Cruyff founded Tiki-taka (commonly spelled tiqui-taca in Spanish) during his time as manager of FC Barcelona (1988‚Äì1996). The style was successfully adopted by the all-conquering Spain national football team (2008‚Äì2012) and Pep Guardiola's Barcelona team (2009‚Äì2011). Tiki-taka style differs from Total Football in that it focuses on ball movement rather than positional interchange. = Technology and engineering =  First pound lock in Europe (1373)  Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier. The Delta Works and the Zuiderzee Works have been declared one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The Zuiderzee Works turned the Zuiderzee into a fresh water lake IJsselmeer, and created 1650 km¬≤ of land. Flood control and land reclamation have been ongoing through history, making the Dutch among the world's leading experts in hydraulic engineering.In the Netherlands, one of the earliest large-scale land reclamation projects was the Beemster Polder, realized in 1612 adding 70 km2 of land. The Flevopolder, reclaimed from the IJsselmeer, is the largest reclaimed artificial island in the world. Dutch hydraulic engineering (flood control, drainage, land reclamation, and canal building) helped form many urban areas of the world such as Friedrichstadt, Gda≈Ñsk/Danzig, Gothenburg, Jakarta, and Saint Petersburg. Skilled in the art of land reclamation, the Dutch were in demand all over Europe. With their experiences in land reclamation and farming, Dutch Mennonites were invited to farm the wetlands in the Vistula Delta of Prussia. Dutch hydraulic engineer Cornelius Vermuyden introduced Dutch land-reclamation methods in England and drained the Fens, the low marshy lands in the east of England. The Palm Islands (Dubai, United Arab Emirates) are artificial islands constructed from sand dredged from the bottom of the Persian Gulf by the Dutch company, Van Oord and the Belgian company, Jan De Nul. The Dutch have demonstrated that it is perfectly feasible to safely live below sea level. About 30% of the Netherlands lies below sea level. Also, about 55% of its area is vulnerable to flooding, and about 29% is susceptible to river flooding. As a really small-sized country with few natural resources, about 1/6 of the entire country (about 7,000 km2 in total) has been reclaimed from the sea, lakes, marshes and swamps. This has led to an old Dutch saying, \\"God created the world, but the Dutch created Holland (or the Netherlands)\\". The Netherlands revived the construction of canals during the 13th‚Äì14th century that had generally been discontinued since the fall of the Roman Empire. They also contributed in the development of canal construction technology, such as introducing the first flash locks in Europe. The first pound lock in Europe was built by the Dutch in 1373 at Vreeswijk, where a canal from Utrecht joins the river Lek.Carlisle, Rodney (2004). Scientific American Inventions and Discoveries: All the Milestones in Ingenuity From the Discovery of Fire to the Invention of the Microwave Oven, p. 93‚Äì94  Thermostat (automatic temperature regulator) (1620s)  Bimetallic thermostat for buildings. In the 1620s, Cornelius Drebbel invented a mercury thermostat to regulate the temperature of a chicken incubator. This is one of the first recorded modern Feedback-controlled devices. Around the 1620s, Cornelis Drebbel developed an automatic temperature control system for a furnace, motivated by his belief that base metals could be turned to gold by holding them at a precise constant temperature for long periods of time. He also used this temperature regulator in an incubator for hatching chickens.Beniger, James R. (1986).

Magic lantern (first practical image projector; the forerunner of modern slide projector) (1659)  Magic lantern at the Wymondham Museum. The magic lantern (Laterna magica or Lanterna magica) was the forerunner of the modern slide projector. The magic lantern is an optical device, an early type of image projector developed in the 17th century. People have been projecting images using concave mirrors and pin-hole cameras (camera obscura) since Roman times. But glass lens technology wasn't sufficiently developed to make advanced optical devices (such as telescope and microscope) until the 17th century. With pinhole cameras and camera obscura it was only possible to project an image of actual scene, such as an image of the sun, on a surface. The magic lantern on the other hand could project a painted image on a surface, and marks the point where cameras and projectors became two different kinds of devices. There has been some debate about who the original inventor of the magic lantern is, but the most widely accepted theory is that Christiaan Huygens developed the original device in the late 1650s.Pfragner, Julius. \\"Index.\\" The Motion Picture: From Magic Lantern to Sound.

He describes a device such as the magic lantern in his book Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae.Waddington, Damer. \\"Introduction.\\" Panoramas, Magic Lanterns and Cinemas. Channel Islands, NJ: Tocan Books. xiii‚Äìxv. Print. Huygens is credited because of his major innovation in lantern technology, which was the replacement of images etched on mirrors from earlier lanterns such as Kircher's with images painted on glass. This is what paved the way for the use of colour and for double-layered slide projections (generally used to simulate movement). The first allusion to a 'magic lantern' is by Huygens in the 1650s and he is generally credited with inventing it ‚Äì though he didn't want to admit it, considering it frivolous. Huygens was the first to describe a fully functioning magic lantern, one he made, and wrote about it in a work in 1659. Huygens magic lantern has been described as the predecessor of today's slide projector and the forerunner of the motion picture projector. Images were hand painted onto the glass slide until the mid-19th century when photographic slides were employed. Huygens introduced this curiosity to the Danish mathematician Thomas Walgenstein who realized its commercial value for entertainment and traveled through Europe ‚Äì mostly France and Italy ‚Äì demonstrating his machine to foreign princes and selling them replicas for their own amusement. The forerunner of the modern slide projector as well as moving pictures, magic lanterns retained their popularity for centuries and were also the first optical toy to be used for family entertainment in the home.  Fire hose (1673)  In Amsterdam, the Superintendent of the Fire Brigade, Jan van der Heyden, and his son Nicholaas took firefighting to its next step with the fashioning of the first fire hose in 1673.  Gunpowder engine (first practical rudimentary internal combustion piston engine) (1678‚Äì80)  Huygens' gunpowder engine is often considered as the earliest recognizable forerunner of modern internal combustion engines. A gunpowder engine, also known as an explosion engine or Huygens' engine, is a type of internal combustion engine using gunpowder as its fuel. It was considered essentially as the first rudimentary internal combustion piston engine.McNeil, Ian (1990). An Encyclopedia of the History of Technology, p. 304‚Äì05Mokyr, Joel (1990).

Energy Science: Principles, Technologies, and Impacts (2nd Edition) In 1678 he outlined a gunpowder engine consisting of a vertical tube containing a piston. Gunpowder was inserted into the tube and lit through a small hole at the base, like a cannon. The expanding gasses would drive the piston up the tube until it reached a point near the top. Here, the piston uncovered holes in the tube that allowed any remaining hot gasses to escape. The weight of the piston and the vacuum formed by the cooling gasses in the now-closed cylinder drew the piston back into the tube, lifting a test mass to provide power.Galloway, Robert Lindsay (1881). \\"The Steam Engine and Its Inventors\\", p. 22 According to sources, a single example of this sort of engine was built in 1678 or 79 using a cannon as the cylinder. The cylinder was held down to a base where the gunpowder sat, making it a breech loading design. The gasses escaped via two leather tubes attached at the top of the barrel. When the piston reached them the gasses blew the tubes open, and when the pressure fell, gravity pulled the leather down causing the tubes droop to the side of the cylinder, sealing the holes. Huygens‚Äô presented a paper on his invention in 1680, A New Motive Power by Means of Gunpowder and Air.Galloway, Robert Lindsay (1881). \\"The Steam Engine and Its Inventors\\", p. 21 By 1682, the device had successfully shown that a dram (1/16th of an ounce) of gunpowder, in a cylinder seven or eight feet high and fifteen or eighteen inches in diameter, could raise seven or eight boys (or about 1,100 pounds) into the air, who held the end of the rope.Galloway, Robert Lindsay (1881). \\"The Steam Engine and Its Inventors\\", p. 24  Hollander beater (1680s)  The Hollander beater is a machine developed by the Dutch in 1680 to produce pulp from cellulose-containing plant fibers. It replaced stamp mills for preparing pulp because the Hollander could produce in one day the same quantity of pulp that a stamp mill could produce in eight.  Gas lighting (1783)  In 1783, Maastricht-born chemist Jan Pieter Minckelers used coal gas for lighting and developed the first form of gas lighting.  Meat slicer (1898)  A meat slicer, also called a slicing machine, deli slicer or simply a slicer, is a tool used in butcher shops and delicatessens to slice meats and cheeses. The first meat slicer was invented by Wilhelm van Berkel (Wilhelmus Adrianus van Berkel) in Rotterdam in 1898. Older models of meat slicer may be operated by crank, while newer ones generally use an electric motor.  Pentode (1926)  A pentode is an electronic device having five active electrodes. The term most commonly applies to a three-grid vacuum tube (thermionic valve), which was invented by the Dutchman Bernhard D.H. Tellegen in 1926.Okamura, S≈çgo (1994).

Dawn of the Electronic Age: Electrical Technologies in the Shaping of the Modern World, 1914 to 1945, p. 152  Philishave (1939)  Philishave was the brand name for electric shavers manufactured by the Philips Domestic Appliances and Personal Care unit of Philips (in the US, the Norelco name is used). The Philishave shaver was invented by Philips engineer Alexandre Horowitz, who used rotating cutters instead of the reciprocating cutters that had been used in previous electric shavers.  Gyrator (1948)  A gyrator is a passive, linear, lossless, two-port electrical network element invented by Tellegen as a hypothetical fifth linear element after the resistor, capacitor, inductor and ideal transformer.Dorf, Richard C.

Electrical Impedance: Principles, Measurement, and Applications, p .16  Traffic enforcement camera (1958)  Dutch company Gatsometer BV, founded by the 1950s rally driver Maurice Gatsonides, invented the first traffic enforcement camera. Gatsonides wished to better monitor his speed around the corners of a race track and came up with the device in order to improve his time around the circuit. The company developed the first radar for use with road traffic and is the world's largest supplier of speed-monitoring camera systems. Because of this, in some countries speed cameras are sometimes referred to as \\"Gatsos\\". They are also sometimes referred to as \\"photo radar\\", even though many of them do not use radar. The first systems introduced in the late 1960s used film cameras, replaced by digital cameras beginning in the late 1990s.  Variomatic (1958)  Variomatic is the stepless, fully automatic transmission of the Dutch car manufacturer DAF, originally developed by Hub van Doorne. The Variomatic was introduced in 1958 (DAF 600), the first automatic gear box made in the Netherlands. It continues in use in motorscooters. Variomatic was the first commercially successful continuously variable transmissions (CVT).  Red light camera (1965)  A Red light camera is a traffic enforcement camera that captures an image of a vehicle that enters an intersection against a red traffic light. By automatically photographing such vehicles, the camera produces evidence that assists authorities in their enforcement of traffic laws. The first red light camera system was introduced in 1965, using tubes stretched across the road to detect the violation and trigger the camera. One of the first developers of these red light camera systems was Dutch company Gatsometer BV.  Stochastic cooling (1968)  Stochastic cooling is a form of particle beam cooling. It is used in some particle accelerators and storage rings to control the emission of particle beams. This process uses the electrical signals that the individual charged particles generate in a feedback loop to reduce the tendency of individual particles to move away from other particles in the beam. This technique was invented and applied at the Intersecting Storage Rings, and later the Super Proton Synchrotron, at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland by Dutch physicist Simon van der Meer. By increasing the particle density to close to the required energy, this technique improved the beam quality and, inter alia, brought the discovery of W and Z bosons within reach.  Clap skate (1980)  The clap skate (also called clapskates, slap skates, slapskates) is a type of ice skate used in speed skating. Clap skates were developed at the Faculty of Human Movement Sciences of the Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam, led by Gerrit Jan van Ingen Schenau, although the idea is much older. van Ingen Schenau, who started work on a hinged speed skate in 1979, created his first prototype in 1980 and finished his PhD thesis on the subject in 1981 using the premise that a skater would benefit from extended movement keeping the blade on the ice, allowing the calf muscles more time to exert force.  Cremulator (1981)  The Cremulator is a machine developed by the Dutch company ALL Europe in 1981. The Cremulator is used after cremation, about 3 kg of ashes remain on average. These ash residues are reduced in a cremulator for subsequent scattering or in an urn. Also called asmill. The Cremulator is now further developed by DFW Europe as cremation equipment manufacturer in The Netherlands. = Transportation =  Ice skate improvements (14th‚Äì15th centuries)  During the 13th and 14th century, wooden skates with metal blades were introduced by Dutch. These ice skates were made of steel, with sharpened edges on the bottom to aid movement. The construction of modern ice skates has stayed largely the same since then. In the 14th century, the Dutch started using wooden platform skates with flat iron bottom runners. The skates were attached to the skater's shoes with leather straps and poles were used to propel the skater. Around 1500, the Dutch shifted to a narrow metal double edged blade, so the skater could now push and glide with his feet, eliminating the need for a pole.  Herring Buss (15th century)  A herring buss () was a type of seagoing fishing vessel, used by Dutch and Flemish herring fishermen in the 15th through early 19th centuries. The Buis was first adapted for use as a fishing vessel in the Netherlands, after the invention of gibbing made it possible to preserve herring at sea.De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 244 This made longer voyages feasible, and hence enabled Dutch fishermen to follow the herring shoals far from the coasts. The first herring buss was probably built in Hoorn around 1415. The last one was built in Vlaardingen in 1841.  Yacht (1580s)  An 18th-century Dutch yacht owned by the Rotterdam chapter of the Dutch East India Company. This yacht has the gaff rig and leeboards of the period. Originally defined as a light, fast sailing vessel used by the Dutch navy to pursue pirates and other transgressors around and into the shallow waters of the Low Countries. Later, yachts came to be perceived as luxury, or recreational vessels.  Fluyt (16th century)  Dutch fluyt, 1677 Fluyt, a type of sailing vessel originally designed as a dedicated cargo vessel. Originating from the Netherlands in the 16th century, the vessel was designed to facilitate transoceanic delivery with the maximum of space and crew efficiency. The inexpensive ship could be built in large numbers. This ship class was credited with enhancing Dutch competitiveness in international trade and was widely employed by the Dutch East India Company in the 17th and 18th centuries. The fluyt was a significant factor in the 17th century rise of the Dutch seaborne empire.Gereffi, Gary; Korzeniewicz, Miguel (1994).

Renewable and Alternative Energy, p. 21 Prior to the invention of sawmills, boards were rived and planed, or more often sawn by two men with a whipsaw using saddleblocks to hold the log and a pit for the pitman who worked below and got the benefit of sawdust in his eyes. Sawing was slow and required strong and durable sawmen. The topsawer had to be the stronger of the two because the saw was pulled in turn by each man, and the lower had the advantage of gravity. The topsawyer also had to guide the saw to produce a plank of even thickness. This was often done by following a chalkline. Early sawmills adapted the whipsaw to mechanical power, generally driven by a water wheel to speed up the process. The circular motion of the wheel was changed to back-and-forth motion of the saw blade by a pitman thus introducing a term used in many mechanical applications. A pitman is similar to a crankshaft used in reverse. A crankshaft converts back-and-forth motion to circular motion. Generally only the saw was powered and the logs had to be loaded and moved by hand. An early improvement was the development of a movable carriage, also water powered, to steadily advance the log through the saw blade.  Schooner (prototype) (17th century)  A schooner is a type of sailing vessel with fore-and-aft sails on two or more masts, the foremast being no taller than the rear mast(s). Such vessels were first used by the Dutch in the 16th or 17th century (but may not have been called that at the time). Schooners first evolved from a variety of small two-masted gaff-rigged vessels used in the coast and estuaries of the Netherlands in the late 17th century. Most were working craft but some pleasure yachts with schooner rigs were built for wealthy merchants and Dutch nobility. Following arrival of the Dutch-born prince William III the Orange on the British throne, the British Royal Navy built a Royal yacht with a schooner rig in 1695, HMS Royal Transport. This vessel, captured in a detailed Admiralty model, is the earliest fully documented schooner.Karl Heinz Marquardt, The Global Schooner: Origins, Development, Design and Construction 1695‚Äì1845, Naval Institute Press (2003), p. 13 Royal Transport was quickly noted for its speed and ease of handling and mercantile vessels soon adopted the rig in Europe and in European colonies in North America. Schooners were immediately popular with colonial traders and fishermen in North America with the first documented reference to a schooner in America appearing in Boston port records in 1716.Marquardt, p. 21 North American shipbuilders quickly developed a variety of schooner forms for trading, fishing and privateering. According to the language scholar Walter William Skeat, the term schooner comes from scoon, while the sch spelling comes from the later adoption of the Dutch spelling (\\"schoener\\"). Another study suggests that a Dutch expression praising ornate schooner yachts in the 17th century, \\"een schoone Schip\\", may have led to the term \\"schooner\\" being used by English speakers to describe the early versions of the schooner rig as it evolved in England and America.Marquardt, p. 8  Land yacht (1600)  Land yachts designed by Simon Stevin in the year 1600 The Wind chariot or land yacht (Zeilwagen) was designed by Flemish-born mathematician & engineer Simon Stevin for Prince Maurice of Orange. Land yacht. It offered a carriage with sails, of which a little model was preserved in Scheveningen until 2012. Around the year 1600, Stevin, Maurice and twenty-six others used it on the beach between Scheveningen and Petten. The carriage was propelled solely by force of wind, and traveled faster than horse-drawn vehicles.

The third model had 6 oars and could carry 16 passengers. This model was demonstrated to King James I and several thousand Londoners. The submarine stayed submerged for three hours and could travel from Westminster to Greenwich and back, cruising at a depth of from . This submarine was tested many times in the Thames, but never used in battle.Cartmell, Donald (2004).

This was shown in the BBC TV programme Building the Impossible in November 2002. It is a scale working model of the original and was built using tools and construction methods common in 17th century boat building and was successfully tested under water with two rowers at Dorney Lake, diving beneath the surface and being rowed underwater for 10 minutes. Legal considerations prevented its use on the River Thames itself.  First ever car equipped with a six-cylinder engine, along with four-wheel drive (1903)  The 1903 Spyker 60 HP racing car was the world's first car with a six-cylinder engine as well as permanent four- wheel drive and four-wheel brakes. Spyker is credited with building and racing the first ever four-wheel racing car in 1903. The first four-wheel-drive car, as well as hill-climb racer, with internal combustion engine, the Spyker 60 H.P., was presented in 1903 by Dutch brothers Jacobus and Hendrik-Jan Spijker of Amsterdam.Allen, Jim (2002).

The anthem was first written down in 1574 (during the Dutch Revolt). The Japanese anthem, Kimigayo, has the oldest (9th century) lyrics, but a melody was only added in the late 19th century, making it a poem rather than an anthem for most of its lifespan. Although the Wilhelmus was not officially recognised as the Dutch national anthem until 1932, it has always been popular with parts of the Dutch population and resurfaced on several occasions in the course of Dutch history before gaining its present status.

Without the birth of this great commonwealth, the various historical phenomena of the sixteenth and following centuries must have either not existed, or have presented themselves under essential modifications.\\"Rybczynski, Witold (1987). Home: A Short History of an Idea. According to Witold Rybczynski‚Äôs Home: A Short History of an Idea, private spaces in households are a Dutch seventeenth-century invention, despite their commonplace nature today. He has argued that home as we now know it came from the Dutch canal house of the seventeenth century. That, he said, was the first time that people identified living quarters as being precisely the residence of a man, a woman and their children. \\"The feminization of the home in seventeenth century Holland was one of the most important events in the evolution of the domestic interior.\\" This evolution took place in part due to Dutch law being \\"explicit on contractual arrangements and on the civil rights of servants\\". And, \\"for the first time, the person who was in intimate contact with housework was also in a position to influence the arrangement and disposition of the house.\\" Rybczynski (2007) discusses why we live in houses in the first place: \\"To understand why we live in houses, it is necessary to go back several hundred years to Europe. Rural people have always lived in houses, but the typical medieval town dwelling, which combined living space and workplace, was occupied by a mixture of extended families, servants, and employees. This changed in seventeenth-century Holland. The Netherlands was Europe‚Äôs first republic, and the world‚Äôs first middle-class nation. Prosperity allowed extensive home ownership, republicanism discouraged the widespread use of servants, a love of children promoted the nuclear family, and Calvinism encouraged thrift and other domestic virtues. These circumstances, coupled with a particular affection for the private family home, brought about a cultural revolution... The idea of urban houses spread to the British Isles thanks to England's strong commercial and cultural links with the Netherlands.\\"Tabor, Philip (2005). \\"Striking Home: The Telematic Assault on Identity\\". Published in Jonathan Hill, editor, Occupying Architecture: Between the Architect and the User. Philip Tabor states the contribution of 17th century Dutch houses as the foundation of houses today: \\"As far as the idea of the home is concerned, the home of the home is the Netherlands. This idea's crystallization might be dated to the first three-quarters of the seventeenth century, when the Dutch Netherlands amassed the unprecedented and unrivalled accumulation of capital, and emptied their purses into domestic space.\\" According to Jonathan Hill (Immaterial Architecture, 2006), compared to the large scaled houses in England and the Renaissance, the 17th Century Dutch house was smaller, and was only inhabited by up to four to five members. This was due to their embracing \\"self-reliance\\", in contrast to the dependence on servants, and a design for a lifestyle centered on the family. It was important for the Dutch to separate work from domesticity, as the home became an escape and a place of comfort. This way of living and the home has been noted as highly similar to the contemporary family and their dwellings. House layouts also incorporated the idea of the corridor as well as the importance of function and privacy. By the end of the 17th Century, the house layout was soon transformed to become employment-free, enforcing these ideas for the future. This came in favour for the industrial revolution, gaining large-scale factory production and workers. The house layout of the Dutch and its functions are still relevant today. The Netherlandsincluding the Dutch- speaking Southern Netherlands prior to 1585 and its people have made numerous seminal contributions to the world's civilization,Taylor, Peter J. (2002). Dutch Hegemony and Contemporary Globalization. \\"The Dutch developed a social formula, which we have come to call modern capitalism, that proved to be transferable and ultimately deadly to all other social formulations.\\"Dunthorne, Hugh (2004).

London: Routledge, p. 87‚Äì103 especially in art,The Dutch Republic was the birthplace of the first modern art market, successfully combining art and commerce together as we would recognise it today. Until the 17th century, commissioning works of art was largely the preserve of the church, monarchs and aristocrats. The emergence of a powerful and wealthy middle class in Holland, though, produced a radical change in patronage as the new Dutch bourgeoisie bought art. For the first time, the direction of art was shaped by relatively broadly-based demand rather than religious dogma or royal whim, and the result was the birth of a large-scale open (free) art market which today's dealers and collectors would find familiar.Jaff√©, H.

The Britannica Guide to Inventions That Changed the Modern World economics and finance,During their Golden Age, the Dutch were responsible for three major institutional innovations in economic and financial history. The first major innovation was the foundation of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), the world's first publicly traded company, in 1602. As the first listed company (the first company to be ever listed on an official stock exchange), the VOC was the first company to actually issue stock and bonds to the general public. Considered by many experts to be the world's first truly (modern) multinational corporation, the VOC was also the first permanently organized limited-liability joint-stock company, with a permanent capital base. The Dutch merchants were the pioneers in laying the basis for modern corporate governance. The VOC is often considered as the precursor of modern corporations, if not the first truly modern corporation. It was the VOC that invented the idea of investing in the company rather than in a specific venture governed by the company. With its pioneering features such as corporate identity (first globally-recognized corporate logo), entrepreneurial spirit, legal personhood, transnational (multinational) operational structure, high stable profitability, permanent capital (fixed capital stock), freely transferable shares and tradable securities, separation of ownership and management, and limited liability for both shareholders and managers, the VOC is generally considered a major institutional breakthrough and the model for the large-scale business enterprises that now dominate the global economy. The second major innovation was the creation of the world's first fully functioning financial market, with the birth of a fully fledged capital market. The Dutch were also the first to effectively use a fully-fledged capital market (including the bond market and the stock market) to finance companies (such as the VOC and the WIC). It was in seventeenth-century Amsterdam that the global securities market began to take on its modern form. In 1602 the Dutch East India Company (VOC) established an exchange in Amsterdam where VOC stock and bonds could be traded in a secondary market. The VOC undertook the world's first recorded IPO in the same year. The Amsterdam Stock Exchange (Amsterdamsche Beurs in Dutch) was also the world's first fully-fledged stock exchange. While the Italian city-states produced the first transferable government bonds, they didn't develop the other ingredient necessary to produce a fully fledged capital market: corporate shareholders. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) became the first company to offer shares of stock. The dividend averaged around 18% of capital over the course of the company's 200-year existence. Dutch investors were the first to trade their shares at a regular stock exchange. The buying and selling of these shares of stock in the VOC became the basis of the first stock market. It was in the Dutch Republic that the early techniques of stock-market manipulation were developed. The Dutch pioneered stock futures, stock options, short selling, bear raids, debt-equity swaps, and other speculative instruments. Amsterdam businessman Joseph de la Vega's Confusion of Confusions (1688) was the earliest book about stock trading. The third major innovation was the establishment of the Bank of Amsterdam (Amsterdamsche Wisselbank in Dutch) in 1609, which led to the introduction of the concept of bank money. The Bank of Amsterdam was arguably the world's first central bank. The Wisselbank's innovations helped lay the foundations for the birth and development of the central banking system that now plays a vital role in the world's economy. It occupied a central position in the financial world of its day, providing an effective, efficient and trusted system for national and international payments, and introduced the first ever international reserve currency, the bank guilder. Lucien Gillard (2004) calls it the European guilder (le florin europ√©en), and Adam Smith devotes many pages to explaining how the bank guilder works (Smith 1776: 446‚Äì55). The model of the Wisselbank as a state bank was adapted throughout Europe, including the Bank of Sweden (1668) and the Bank of England (1694).De Vries, Jan; Woude, Ad van der (1997).

Dutch-speaking people, in spite of their relatively small number, have a significant history of invention, innovation, discovery and exploration. The following list is composed of objects, (largely) unknown lands, breakthrough ideas/concepts, principles, phenomena, processes, methods, techniques, styles etc., that were discovered or invented (or pioneered) by people from the Netherlands and Dutch-speaking people from the former Southern Netherlands (Zuid-Nederlanders in Dutch). Until the fall of Antwerp (1585), the Dutch and Flemish were generally seen as one people.Frisians, specifically West Frisians, are an ethnic group; present in the North of the Netherlands; mainly concentrating in the Province of Friesland. Culturally, modern Frisians and the (Northern) Dutch are rather similar; the main and generally most important difference being that Frisians speak West Frisian, one of the three sub-branches of the Frisian languages, alongside Dutch. West Frisians in the general do not feel or see themselves as part of a larger group of Frisians, and, according to a 1970 inquiry, identify themselves more with the Dutch than with East or North Frisians. Because of centuries of cohabitation and active participation in Dutch society, as well as being bilingual, the Frisians are not treated as a separate group in Dutch official statistics.  Discoveries  = Archaeology =  Java Man (Homo erectus erectus) (1891)  Original fossils of Pithecanthropus erectus (now Homo erectus) found in Java in 1891. Estimated to be between 700,000 and 1,000,000 years old, at the time of their discovery the fossils of \\"Java Man\\" were the oldest hominin fossils ever found. Java Man (Homo erectus erectus) is the name given to hominid fossils discovered in 1891 at Trinil ‚Äì Ngawi Regency on the banks of the Solo River in East Java, Indonesia, one of the first known specimens of Homo erectus. Its discoverer, Dutch paleontologist Eug√®ne Dubois, gave it the scientific name Pithecanthropus erectus, a name derived from Greek and Latin roots meaning upright ape-man. = Astronomy =  Columba (constellation) (1592)  Columba is a small, faint constellation named in the late sixteenth century. Its name is Latin for dove. It is located just south of Canis Major and Lepus. Columba was named by Dutch astronomer Petrus Plancius in 1592 in order to differentiate the 'unformed stars' of the large constellation Canis Major. Plancius first depicted Columba on the small celestial planispheres of his large wall map of 1592. It is also shown on his smaller world map of 1594 and on early Dutch celestial globes.  Novaya Zemlya effect (1597)  The first person to record the Novaya Zemlya effect was Gerrit de Veer, a member of Willem Barentsz' ill-fated third expedition into the polar region. Novaya Zemlya, the archipelago where de Veer first observed the phenomenon, lends its name to the effect.  12 southern constellations (1597‚Äì1598)  Plancius defined 12 constellations created by Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman.Ridpath, Ian (1988).

A Dictionary of Astronomy (Oxford Paperback Reference), p. 96 * Apus is a faint constellation in the southern sky, first defined in the late 16th century. Its name means \\"no feet\\" in Greek, and it represents a bird-of-paradise (once believed to lack feet). It first appeared on a 35 cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. * Chamaeleon is named after the chameleon, a kind of lizard. * Dorado is now one of the 88 modern constellations. Dorado has been represented historically as a dolphinfish and a swordfish. * Grus is Latin for the crane, a species of bird. The stars that form Grus were originally considered part of Piscis Austrinus (the southern fish). * Hydrus' name means \\"male water snake\\". * Indus represents an Indian, a word that could refer at the time to any native of Asia or the Americas. * Musca is one of the minor southern constellations. It first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius and Hondius. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer's Uranometria of 1603. * Pavo is Latin for peacock. * Phoenix is a minor southern constellation, named after the mythical phoenix. It was the largest of the twelve. * Triangulum Australe is Latin for \\"the southern triangle\\", which distinguishes it from Triangulum in the northern sky and is derived from the almost equilateral pattern of its three brightest stars. It was first depicted on a celestial globe as Triangulus Antarcticus by Plancius in 1589, and later with more accuracy and its current name by Johann Bayer in his 1603 Uranometria. * Tucana is Latin for the toucan, a South American bird. * Volans represents a flying fish; its name is a shortened form of its original name, Piscis Volans.  Camelopardalis (constellation) (1612‚Äì1613)  Camelopardalis was created by Plancius in 1613 to represent the animal Rebecca rode to marry Isaac in the Bible. One year later, Jakob Bartsch featured it in his atlas. Johannes Hevelius gave it the official name of \\"Camelopardus\\" or \\"Camelopardalis\\" because he saw the constellation's many faint stars as the spots of a giraffe.  Monoceros (constellation) (1612‚Äì1613)  Monoceros is a relatively modern creation. Its first certain appearance was on a globe created by Plancius in 1612 or 1613. It was later charted by Bartsch as Unicornus in his 1624 star chart.  Rings of Saturn (1655)  Christiaan Huygens was the first person to describe Saturn's rings as a disk surrounding Saturn In 1655, Huygens became the first person to suggest that Saturn was surrounded by a ring, after Galileo's much less advanced telescope had failed to show rings. Galileo had reported the anomaly as possibly 3 planets instead of one.  Titan (Saturn's moon) (1655)  Titan was the first known moon of Saturn, discovered in 1655 by Christiaan Huygens. In 1655, using a 50 power refracting telescope that he designed himself, Huygens discovered the first of Saturn's moons, Titan.  Kapteyn's Star (1897)  Kapteyn's Star is a class M1 red dwarf about 12.76 light years from Earth in the southern constellation Pictor, and the closest halo star to the Solar System. With a magnitude of nearly 9 it is visible through binoculars or a telescope. It had the highest proper motion of any star known until the discovery of Barnard's Star in 1916. Attention was first drawn to what is now known as Kapteyn's Star by the Dutch astronomer Jacobus Kapteyn, in 1897.  Discovery of evidence for galactic rotation (1904)  In 1904, studying the proper motions of stars, Dutch astronomer Jacobus Kapteyn reported that these were not random, as it was believed in that time; stars could be divided into two streams, moving in nearly opposite directions. It was later realized that Kapteyn's data had been the first evidence of the rotation of our Galaxy, which ultimately led to the finding of galactic rotation by Bertil Lindblad and Jan Oort.  Galactic halo (1924)  In 1924, Dutch astronomer Jan Oort discovered the galactic halo, a group of stars orbiting the Milky Way but outside the main disk.  Oort constants (1927)  The Oort constants (discovered by Jan Oort) A and B are empirically derived parameters that characterize the local rotational properties of the Milky Way.  Evidence of dark matter (1932)  In 1932, Dutch astronomer Jan Oort became the first person to discover evidence of dark matter. Oort proposed the substance after measuring the motions of nearby stars in the Milky Way relative to the galactic plane. He found that the mass of the galactic plane must be more than the mass of the material that can be seen. A year later (1933), Fritz Zwicky examined the dynamics of clusters of galaxies and found their movements similarly perplexing.  Discovery of methane in the atmosphere of Titan (1944)  The first formal proof of the existence of an atmosphere around Titan came in 1944, when Gerald Kuiper observed Titan with the new McDonald telescope and discovered spectral signatures on Titan at wavelengths longer than 0.6 Œºm (micrometers), among which he identified two absorption bands of methane at 6190 and 7250 √Ö (Kuiper1944). This discovery was significant not only because it requires a dense atmosphere with a significant fraction of methane, but also because the atmosphere needs to be chemically evolved, since methane requires hydrogen in the presence of carbon, and molecular and atomic hydrogen would have escaped from Titan's weak gravitational field since the formation of the solar system.Brown, Robert Hanbury; Lebreton, Jean-Pierre; Waite, John H. (2009). Titan from Cassini-Huygens, p. 10  Discovery of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of Mars (1947)  Using infrared spectrometry, in 1947 the Dutch-American astronomer Gerard Kuiper detected carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere, a discovery of biological significance because it is a principal gas in the process of photosynthesis (see also: History of Mars observation). He was able to estimate that the amount of carbon dioxide over a given area of the surface is double that on the Earth.  Miranda (Uranus's moon) (1948)  Miranda is the smallest and innermost of Uranus's five major moons. It was discovered by Gerard Kuiper on 16 February 1948 at McDonald Observatory.  Nereid (Neptune's moon) (1949)  Nereid, also known as Neptune II, is the third-largest moon of Neptune and was its second moon to be discovered, on 1 May 1949, by Gerard Kuiper, on photographic plates taken with the 82-inch telescope at McDonald Observatory.  Oort cloud (1950)  The Oort cloud or √ñpik‚ÄìOort cloud, named after Dutch astronomer Jan Oort and Estonian astronomer Ernst √ñpik, is a spherical cloud of predominantly icy planetesimals believed to surround the Sun at a distance of up to . Further evidence for the existence of the Kuiper belt emerged from the study of comets. That comets have finite lifespans has been known for some time. As they approach the Sun, its heat causes their volatile surfaces to sublimate into space, gradually evaporating them. In order for comets to continue to be visible over the age of the Solar System, they must be replenished frequently. One such area of replenishment is the Oort cloud, a spherical swarm of comets extending beyond 50,000 AU from the Sun first hypothesised by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1950. The Oort cloud is believed to be the point of origin of long-period comets, which are those, like Hale‚ÄìBopp, with orbits lasting thousands of years.  Kuiper belt (1951)  The Kuiper belt was named after Dutch-American astronomer Gerard Kuiper, regarded by many as the father of modern planetary science, though his role in hypothesising it has been heavily contested. In 1951, he proposed the existence of what is now called the Kuiper Belt, a disk-shaped region of minor planets outside the orbit of Neptune, which also is a source of short-period comets. = Biology =  Foundations of modern reproductive biology (1660s ‚Äì1670s)  In the 1660s and 1670s the Dutch Republic-based scientists (in particular Leiden University-based Jan Swammerdam and Nicolas Steno, and Delft-based Regnier de Graaf and Anton van Leeuwenhoek) made key discoveries about animal and human reproduction. Their research and discoveries contributed greatly to the modern understanding of the female mammalian reproductive system.Cobb, Matthew (2006). Generation: The Seventeenth-Century Scientists Who Unraveled the Secrets of Sex, Life, and Growth. (New York: Bloomsbury) Many authors see Regnier de Graaf as the founder of modern reproductive biology (Setchell, 1974).Setchell, B. P. (1974) \\"The Contributions of Regnier de Graaf to Reproductive Biology,\\" European Journal of Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, Volume 4, Issue 1, p. 1‚Äì39, 1974 This is due essentially to his use of convergent scientific methods: meticulous dissections, clinical observations and critical analysis of the available literature (Ankumet al., 1996).Hunter, R. H. F. (2003). Physiology of the Graafian Follicle and Ovulation. (Cambridge University Press)  Function of the Fallopian tubes (1660s)  Dutch physician & anatomist Regnier de Graaf may have been the first to understand the reproductive function of the Fallopian tubes. He described the hydrosalpinx, linking its development to female infertility. de Graaf recognized pathologic conditions of the tubes. He was aware of tubal pregnancies, and he surmised that the mammalian egg traveled from the ovary to the uterus through the tube.  Development of ovarian follicles (1672)  In his De Mulierum Organis Generatione Inservientibus (1672), de Graaf provided the first thorough description of the female gonad and established that it produced the ovum. De Graaf used the terminology vesicle or egg (ovum) for what now called the ovarian follicle. Because the fluid-filled ovarian vesicles had been observed previously by others, including Andreas Vesalius and Falloppio, De Graaf did not claim their discovery. He noted that he was not the first to describe them, but to describe their development. De Graaf was the first to observe changes in the ovary before and after mating and describe the corpus luteum. From the observation of pregnancy in rabbits, he concluded that the follicle contained the oocyte. The mature stage of the ovarian follicle is called the Graafian follicle in his honour, although others, including Fallopius, had noticed it previously but failed to recognize its reproductive significance.  Foundations of microbiology (discovery of microorganisms) (1670s)  Van Leeuwenhoek is universally acknowledged as the father of microbiology because he was the first to undisputedly discover/observe, describe, study and conduct scientific experiments with microbes (microorganisms), using simple single- lensed microscopes of his own design.Huerta, Robert D. (2003). Giants of Delft: Johannes Vermeer and the Natural Philosophers: the Parallel Search for Knowledge During the Age of DiscoveryLane, Nick (6 March 2015). \\"The Unseen World: Reflections on Leeuwenhoek (1677) 'Concerning Little Animal'.\\" Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2015 Apr; 370 (1666): 20140344. [doi:10.1098/rstb.2014.0344] Leeuwenhoek is also considered to be the father of bacteriology and protozoology. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek is often considered to be the father of microbiology. Robert Hooke is cited as the first to record microscopic observation of the fruiting bodies of molds, in 1665. However, the first observation of microbes using a microscope is generally credited to van Leeuwenhoek. In the 1670s, he observed and researched bacteria and other microorganisms, using a single-lens microscope of his own design.Windelspecht, Michael (2002).

In 1779, Jan Ingenhousz discovered the essential role of light in the process of photosynthesis, by which green plants in sunlight absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. Photosynthesis is a fundamental biochemical process in which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight to chemical energy. The process was discovered by Jan Ingenhousz in 1779.Ord, M.G.; Stocken, L.A. (1997). Further Milestones in Biochemistry (Foundations of Modern Biochemistry), p. 25Blankenship, Robert E. (2002).

Chemical Research on Plant Growth: A translation of Th√©odore de Saussure's Recherches chimiques sur la V√©g√©tation The chemical energy is used to drive reactions such as the formation of sugars or the fixation of nitrogen into amino acids, the building blocks for protein synthesis. Ultimately, nearly all living things depend on energy produced from photosynthesis. It is also responsible for producing the oxygen that makes animal life possible. Organisms that produce energy through photosynthesis are called photoautotrophs. Plants are the most visible representatives of photoautotrophs, but bacteria and algae also employ the process.  Plant respiration (1779)  Plant respiration was also discovered by Ingenhousz in 1779.  Foundations of virology (1898)  Martinus Beijerinck is considered one of the founders of virology. In 1898, he published results on his filtration experiments, demonstrating that tobacco mosaic disease is caused by an infectious agent smaller than a bacterium. His results were in accordance with similar observations made by Dmitri Ivanovsky in 1892. Like Ivanovsky and Adolf Mayer, predecessor at Wageningen, Beijerinck could not culture the filterable infectious agent. He concluded that the agent can replicate and multiply in living plants. He named the new pathogen virus to indicate its non-bacterial nature. This discovery is considered to be the beginning of virology.  Chemistry of photosynthesis (1931)  In 1931, Cornelis van Niel made key discoveries explaining the chemistry of photosynthesis. By studying purple sulfur bacteria and green sulfur bacteria, he was the first scientist to demonstrate that photosynthesis is a light- dependent redox reaction, in which hydrogen reduces carbon dioxide.Stenesh, J. (1998). Biochemistry, p. 377Khanna, Pragya (2008). Cell and Molecular Biology, p. 151 Expressed as: :2 H2A + CO2 ‚Üí 2A + CH2O + H2O where A is the electron acceptor. His discovery predicted that H2O is the hydrogen donor in green plant photosynthesis and is oxidized to O2. The chemical summation of photosynthesis was a milestone in the understanding of the chemistry of photosynthesis. This was later experimentally verified by Robert Hill.  Foundations of modern ethology (Tinbergen's four questions) (1930s)  Many naturalists have studied aspects of animal behaviour throughout history. Ethology has its scientific roots in the work of Charles Darwin and of American and German ornithologists of the late 19th and early 20th century, including Charles O. Whitman, Oskar Heinroth, and Wallace Craig. The modern discipline of ethology is generally considered to have begun during the 1930s with the work of Dutch biologist Nikolaas Tinbergen and by Austrian biologists Konrad Lorenz and Karl von Frisch.Burkhardt, Jr., Richard W. (2005). Patterns of Behavior: Konrad Lorenz, Niko Tinbergen, and the Founding of Ethology. (University of Chicago Press) Tinbergen's four questions, named after Nikolaas Tinbergen, one of the founders of modern ethology, are complementary categories of explanations for behaviour. It suggests that an integrative understanding of behaviour must include both a proximate and ultimate (functional) analysis of behaviour, as well as an understanding of both phylogenetic/developmental history and the operation of current mechanisms.Daly, M & Wilson, M. (1983). Sex, evolution, and behaviour. Brooks- Cole.  Vroman effect (1975)  The Vroman effect, named after Leo Vroman, is exhibited by protein adsorption to a surface by blood serum proteins. = Chemistry =  Concept of gas (1600s)  Flemish physician Jan Baptist van Helmont is sometimes considered the founder of pneumatic chemistry, coining the word gas and conducting experiments involving gases. Van Helmont had derived the word ‚Äúgas‚Äù from the Dutch word geest, which means ghost or spirit.  Foundations of stereochemistry (1874)  Dutch chemist Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff is generally considered to be one of the founders of the field of stereochemistry. In 1874, Van 't Hoff built on the work on isomers of German chemist Johannes Wislicenus, and showed that the four valencies of the carbon atom were probably directed in space toward the four corners of a regular tetrahedron, a model which explained how optical activity could be associated with an asymmetric carbon atom. He shares credit for this with the French chemist Joseph Le Bel, who independently came up with the same idea. Three months before his doctoral degree was awarded Van 't Hoff published this theory, which today is regarded as the foundation of stereochemistry, first in a Dutch pamphlet in the fall of 1874, and then in the following May in a small French book entitled La chimie dans l'espace. A German translation appeared in 1877, at a time when the only job Van 't Hoff could find was at the Veterinary School in Utrecht. In these early years his theory was largely ignored by the scientific community, and was sharply criticized by one prominent chemist, Hermann Kolbe. However, by about 1880 support for Van 't Hoff's theory by such important chemists as Johannes Wislicenus and Viktor Meyer brought recognition.  Foundations of modern physical chemistry (1880s)  Jacobus van 't Hoff is also considered as one of the modern founders of the disciple of physical chemistry.Laidler, Keith J.. Chemical Kinetics and the Origins of Physical Chemistry. (Archive for History of Exact Sciences, March 1985, Volume 32, Issue 1, p. 43‚Äì75) The first scientific journal specifically in the field of physical chemistry was the German journal, Zeitschrift f√ºr Physikalische Chemie, founded in 1887 by Wilhelm Ostwald and Van 't Hoff. Together with Svante Arrhenius, these were the leading figures in physical chemistry in the late 19th century and early 20th century.  Van 't Hoff equation (1884)  The Van 't Hoff equation in chemical thermodynamics relates the change in the equilibrium constant, Keq, of a chemical equilibrium to the change in temperature, T, given the standard enthalpy change, ŒîH ~~o~~ , for the process. It was proposed by Dutch chemist Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff in 1884.Biography on Nobel prize website. Nobelprize.org (1911-03-01). Retrieved on 2013-11-8. The Van 't Hoff equation has been widely utilized to explore the changes in state functions in a thermodynamic system. The Van 't Hoff plot, which is derived from this equation, is especially effective in estimating the change in enthalpy, or total energy, and entropy, or amount of disorder, of a chemical reaction.  Van 't Hoff factor (1884)  The van 't Hoff factor i is a measure of the effect of a solute upon colligative properties such as osmotic pressure, relative lowering in vapor pressure, elevation of boiling point and freezing point depression. The van 't Hoff factor is the ratio between the actual concentration of particles produced when the substance is dissolved, and the concentration of a substance as calculated from its mass.  Lobry de Bruyn‚Äìvan Ekenstein transformation (1885)  In carbohydrate chemistry, the Lobry de Bruyn‚Äìvan Ekenstein transformation is the base or acid-catalyzed transformation of an aldose into the ketose isomer or vice versa, with a tautomeric enediol as reaction intermediate. The transformation is relevant for the industrial production of certain ketoses and was discovered in 1885 by Cornelis Adriaan Lobry van Troostenburg de Bruyn and Willem Alberda van Ekenstein.  Prins reaction (1919)  The Prins reaction is an organic reaction consisting of an electrophilic addition of an aldehyde or ketone to an alkene or alkyne followed by capture of a nucleophile. Dutch chemist Hendrik Jacobus Prins discovered two new organic reactions, both now carrying the name Prins reaction. The first was the addition of polyhalogen compounds to olefins, was found during Prins doctoral research, while the others, the acid-catalyzed addition of aldehydes to olefinic compounds, became of industrial relevance.  Hafnium (1923)  Dutch physicist Dirk Coster and Hungarian-Swedish chemist George de Hevesy co-discovered Hafnium (Hf) in 1923, by means of X-ray spectroscopic analysis of zirconium ore. Hafnium' is named after Hafnia', the Latin name for Copenhagen (Denmark), where it was discovered.  Crystal bar process (1925)  The crystal bar process (also known as iodide process or the van Arkel‚Äìde Boer process) was developed by Dutch chemists Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer in 1925. It was the first industrial process for the commercial production of pure ductile metallic zirconium. It is used in the production of small quantities of ultra- pure titanium and zirconium.  Koopmans' theorem (1934)  Koopmans' theorem states that in closed-shell Hartree‚ÄìFock theory, the first ionization energy of a molecular system is equal to the negative of the orbital energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). This theorem is named after Tjalling Koopmans, who published this result in 1934. Koopmans became a Nobel laureate in 1975, though neither in physics nor chemistry, but in economics. = Genetics =  Concept of pangene/gene (1889)  In 1889, Dutch botanist Hugo de Vries published his book Intracellular Pangenesis, in which he postulated that different characters have different hereditary carriers, based on a modified version of Charles Darwin's theory of Pangenesis of 1868. He specifically postulated that inheritance of specific traits in organisms comes in particles. He called these units pangenes, a term shortened in 1909 to genes by Danish botanist Wilhelm Johannsen.  Rediscovery the laws of inheritance (1900)  1900 marked the \\"rediscovery of Mendelian genetics\\". The significance of Gregor Mendel's work was not understood until early in the twentieth century, after his death, when his research was re-discovered by Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns and Erich von Tschermak, who were working on similar problems.Kuiper, Kathleen (2010). The Britannica Guide to Theories and Ideas That Changed the Modern World, p. 56 They were unaware of Mendel's work. They worked independently on different plant hybrids, and came to Mendel's conclusions about the rules of inheritance. = Geology =  Bushveld Igneous Complex (1897)  The Bushveld Igneous Complex (or BIC) is a large, layered igneous intrusion within the Earth's crust that has been tilted and eroded and now outcrops around what appears to be the edge of a great geological basin, the Transvaal Basin. Located in South Africa, the BIC contains some of Earth's richest ore deposits. The complex contains the world's largest reserves of platinum group metals (PGMs), platinum, palladium, osmium, iridium, rhodium, and ruthenium, along with vast quantities of iron, tin, chromium, titanium and vanadium. The site was discovered around 1897 by Dutch geologist Gustaaf Molengraaff. = Mathematics =  Analytic geometry (1637)  Descartes (1596‚Äì1650) was born in France, but spent most of his adult life in the Dutch Republic. As Bertrand Russell noted in his A History of Western Philosophy (1945): \\"He lived in Holland for twenty years (1629‚Äì49), except for a few brief visits to France and one to England, all on business....\\". In 1637, Descartes published his work on the methods of science, Discours de la m√©thode in Leiden. One of its three appendices was La G√©om√©trie, in which he outlined a method to connect the expressions of algebra with the diagrams of geometry. It combined both algebra and geometry under one specialty ‚Äì algebraic geometry, now called analytic geometry, which involves reducing geometry to a form of arithmetic and algebra and translating geometric shapes into algebraic equations.  Cartesian coordinate system (1637)  Descartes' La G√©om√©trie contains Descartes' first introduction of the Cartesian coordinate system.  Differential geometry of curves (concepts of the involute and evolute of a curve) (1673)  Christiaan Huygens was the first to publish in 1673 (Horologium Oscillatorium) a specific method of determining the evolute and involute of a curveUngs, Michael (2010). The Theory of Quantum Torus Knots: Its Foundation in Differential Geometry, Volume II, p. 334  Korteweg‚Äìde Vries equation (1895)  In mathematics, the Korteweg‚Äìde Vries equation (KdV equation for short) is a mathematical model of waves on shallow water surfaces. It is particularly notable as the prototypical example of an exactly solvable model, that is, a non-linear partial differential equation whose solutions can be exactly and precisely specified. The equation is named for Diederik Korteweg and Gustav de Vries who, in 1895, proposed a mathematical model which allowed to predict the waves behaviour on shallow water surfaces.De Gloria, Alessandro (2014). Applications in Electronics Pervading Industry, Environment and Society, p. 91  Proof of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem (1911)  Brouwer fixed-point theorem is a fixed-point theorem in topology, named after Dutchman Luitzen Brouwer, who proved it in 1911.  Proof of the hairy ball theorem (1912)  The hairy ball theorem of algebraic topology states that there is no nonvanishing continuous tangent vector field on even-dimensional n-spheres. The theorem was first stated by Henri Poincar√© in the late 19th century. It was first proved in 1912 by Brouwer.Georg-August-Universit√§t G√∂ttingen  Debye functions (1912)  The Debye functions are named in honor of Peter Debye, who came across this function (with n = 3) in 1912 when he analytically computed the heat capacity of what is now called the Debye model.  Kramers‚ÄìKronig relations (1927)  The Kramers‚ÄìKronig relations are bidirectional mathematical relations, connecting the real and imaginary parts of any complex function that is analytic in the upper half-plane. The relation is named in honor of Ralph Kronig and Hendrik Anthony Kramers.  Heyting algebra (formalized intuitionistic logic) (1930)  Formalized intuitionistic logic was originally developed by Arend Heyting to provide a formal basis for Luitzen Brouwer's programme of intuitionism. Arend Heyting introduced Heyting algebra (1930) to formalize intuitionistic logic.Hesseling, Dennis E. (2003). Gnomes in the Fog: The Reception of Brouwer's Intuitionism in the 1920s. (Birkh√§user Verlag)Van Atten, Mark; Boldini, Pascal; Bourdeau, Michel; Heinzmann, Gerhard (2008). One Hundred Years of Intuitionism (1907‚Äì2007). (Birkh√§user Verlag)  Zernike polynomials (1934)  In mathematics, the Zernike polynomials are a sequence of polynomials that are orthogonal on the unit disk. Named after Frits Zernike, the Dutch optical physicist, and the inventor of phase contrast microscopy, they play an important role in beam optics.  Minnaert function (1941)  In 1941, Marcel Minnaert invented the Minnaert function, which is used in optical measurements of celestial bodies. The Minnaert function is a photometric function used to interpret astronomical observations and remote sensing data for the Earth. = Mechanics =  Proof of the law of equilibrium on an inclined plane (1586)  In 1586, Simon Stevin (Stevinus) derived the mechanical advantage of the inclined plane by an argument that used a string of beads. Stevin's proof of the law of equilibrium on an inclined plane, known as the \\"Epitaph of Stevinus\\".  Centripetal force (1659)  A body experiencing uniform circular motion requires a centripetal force, towards the axis as shown, to maintain its circular path. In 1659, Christiaan Huygens coined the term \\"centrifugal force\\" and was the first to derive the now standard mathematical description for the centripetal force. Christiaan Huygens stated what is now known as the second of Newton's laws of motion in a quadratic form.Ernst Mach, The Science of Mechanics (1919), e.g. p. 143, p. 172 and p. 187 . In 1659 he derived the now standard formula for the centripetal force, exerted by an object describing a circular motion, for instance on the string to which it is attached.Westfall, Richard S. (1971). The Construction of Modern Science: Mechanisms and Mechanics, p. 130Gindikin, Semyon Grigorevich (1988). Tales of Physicists and Mathematicians, p. 86‚Äì87Jammer, Max (1997).

The publication of the general formula for this force in 1673 was a significant step in studying orbits in astronomy. It enabled the transition from Kepler's third law of planetary motion, to the inverse square law of gravitation.  Centrifugal force (1659)  Huygens coined the term centrifugal force in his 1659 De Vi Centrifiga and wrote of it in his 1673 Horologium Oscillatorium on pendulums.  Formula for the period of mathematical pendulum (1659)  In 1659, Christiaan Huygens was the first to derive the formula for the period of an ideal mathematical pendulum (with massless rod or cord and length much longer than its swing),Barbour, Julian B. (1989).

By his study of the oscillation period of compound pendulums Huygens made pivotal contributions to the development of the concept of moment of inertia.  Tautochrone curve (isochrone curve) (1659)  A tautochrone or isochrone curve is the curve for which the time taken by an object sliding without friction in uniform gravity to its lowest point is independent of its starting point. The curve is a cycloid, and the time is equal to œÄ times the square root of the radius over the acceleration of gravity. Christiaan Huygens was the first to discover the tautochronous property (or isochronous property) of the cycloid.Knoebel, Arthur; Laubenbacher, Reinhard; Lodder, Jerry; Pengelley, David (2007). Mathematical Masterpieces: Further Chronicles by the Explorers. (Springer), p. 169. \\"The cycloid had already occupied the minds of great mathematicians and scientists such as Galileo, Torricelli, Mersenne, Roberval, Fermat, Descartes, Pascal, and others [18], yet none of them discovered its isochronous property.\\" The tautochrone problem, the attempt to identify this curve, was solved by Christiaan Huygens in 1659. He proved geometrically in his Horologium Oscillatorium, originally published in 1673, that the curve was a cycloid. Huygens also proved that the time of descent is equal to the time a body takes to fall vertically the same distance as the diameter of the circle which generates the cycloid, multiplied by œÄ‚ÅÑ2. The tautochrone curve is the same as the brachistochrone curve for any given starting point. Johann Bernoulli posed the problem of the brachistochrone to the readers of Acta Eruditorum in June, 1696. He published his solution in the journal in May of the following year, and noted that the solution is the same curve as Huygens's tautochrone curve.Struik, Dirk Jan (1986). A Source Book in Mathematics, 1200‚Äì1800. (Princeton University Press), p. 392Farouki, Rida T. (2007). Pythagorean- Hodograph Curves: Algebra and Geometry Inseparable. (Springer), p. 161. As Bernoulli noted: \\"We have a just admiration for Huygens, because he was the first to discover that a heavy point on an ordinary cycloid falls in the same time, whatever the position from which the motion begins.\\"  Coupled oscillation (spontaneous synchronization) (1665)  Christiaan Huygens observed that two pendulum clocks mounted next to each other on the same support often become synchronized, swinging in opposite directions. In 1665, he reported the results by letter to the Royal Society of London. It is referred to as \\"an odd kind of sympathy\\" in the Society's minutes. This may be the first published observation of what is now called coupled oscillations. In the 20th century, coupled oscillators took on great practical importance because of two discoveries: lasers, in which different atoms give off light waves that oscillate in unison, and superconductors, in which pairs of electrons oscillate in synchrony, allowing electricity to flow with almost no resistance. Coupled oscillators are even more ubiquitous in nature, showing up, for example, in the synchronized flashing of fireflies and chirping of crickets, and in the pacemaker cells that regulate heartbeats. = Medicine =  Foundations of modern (human) anatomy (1543)  One of the large, detailed illustrations in Andreas Vesalius's De humani corporis fabrica, 1543 Flemish anatomist and physician Andreas Vesalius is often referred to as the founder of modern human anatomy for the publication of the seven-volume De humani corporis fabrica (On the Structure of the Human Body) in 1543.  Crystals in gouty tophi (1679)  In 1679, van Leeuwenhoek used a microscopes to assess tophaceous material and found that gouty tophi consist of aggregates of needle-shaped crystals, and not globules of chalk as was previously believed.  Boerhaave syndrome (1724)  Boerhaave syndrome (also known as spontaneous esophageal perforation or esophageal rupture) refers to an esophageal rupture secondary to forceful vomiting. Originally described in 1724 by Dutch physician/botanist Herman Boerhaave, it is a rare condition with high mortality. The syndrome was described after the case of a Dutch admiral, Baron Jan von Wassenaer, who died of the condition.  Factor V Leiden (1994)  Factor V Leiden is an inherited disorder of blood clotting. It is a variant of human factor V that causes a hypercoagulability disorder. It is named after the city Leiden, where it was first identified by R. Bertina, et al., in 1994. = Microbiology =  Blood cells (1658)  In 1658 Dutch naturalist Jan Swammerdam was the first person to observe red blood cells under a microscope and in 1695, microscopist Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, also Dutch, was the first to draw an illustration of \\"red corpuscles\\", as they were called. No further blood cells were discovered until 1842 when the platelets were discovered.  Red blood cells (1658)  The first person to observe and describe red blood cells was Dutch biologist Jan Swammerdam, who had used an early microscope to study the blood of a frog.  Micro-organisms (1670s)  Replica of microscope by Leeuwenhoek. Van Leeuwenhoek is considered to be the first to observe and describe microorganisms (animalcules) using a microscope. A resident of Delft, Anton van Leeuwenhoek, used a high-power single-lens simple microscope to discover the world of micro-organisms. His simple microscopes were made of silver or copper frames, holding hand-ground lenses were capable of magnification up to 275 times. Using these he was the first to observe and describe single-celled organisms, which he originally referred to as animalcules, and which now referred to as micro-organisms or microbes.Ruestow, Edward G. (1996). The Microscope in the Dutch Republic: The Shaping of DiscoveryBurgess, Jeremy; Marten, Michael; Taylor, Rosemary (1990). Under the Microscope: A Hidden World Revealed, p. 186 * Infusoria (1674) ‚Äì Infusoria is a collective term for minute aquatic creatures including ciliate, euglena, paramecium, protozoa and unicellular algae that exist in freshwater ponds. However, in formal classification microorganism called infusoria belongs to Kingdom Animalia, Phylum Protozoa, Class Ciliates (Infusoria). They were first discovered by Antoni van Leeuwenhoek. Leishmania donovani, (a species of protozoa) in a bone marrow cell * Protozoa (1674) ‚Äì In 1674, Van Leeuwenhoek was the first person to observe and describe protozoa. * Bacteria (1676) ‚Äì The first bacteria were observed by van Leeuwenhoek in 1676 using his single-lens microscope.Maczulak, Anne (2010). Allies and Enemies: How the World Depends on Bacteria, p. 1‚Äì2Fensham, Peter J.; Gunstone, Richard F.; White, Richard Thomas (1994).

Bacteria and Viruses (Biochemistry, Cells, and Life), p. 1‚Äì3Goes, Frank Joseph (2013). The Eye in History, p. 338‚Äì41 He described the creatures he saw as small creatures. The name bacterium was introduced much later, by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in 1828, derived from the Greek word Œ≤Œ±Œ∫œÑŒ∑œÅŒπŒøŒΩ meaning \\"small stick\\". Because of the difficulty in describing individual bacteria and the importance of their discovery, the study of bacteria is generally that of the study of microbiology. * Sperm cells (1677) ‚Äì Sperm cells were first observed by Anton van Leeuwenhoek in 1677. The term \\"sperm\\" refers to the male reproductive cells. A uniflagellar sperm cell that is motile is referred to as a \\"spermatozoon\\", whereas a non- motile sperm cell is referred to as a \\"spermatium\\". * Spermatozoa (1677) ‚Äì A spermatozoon or spermatozoon (pl. spermatozoa), from the ancient Greek œÉœÄŒµœÅŒºŒ± (seed) and Œ∂œâŒΩ (alive) and more commonly known as a sperm cell, is the haploid cell that is the male gamete. Sperm cells were first observed by a student of van Leeuwenhoek in 1677. Leeuwenhoek pictured sperm cells with great accuracy. Giardia trophozoite, SEM. The trophozoite form of Giardia was first observed in 1681 by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in his own diarrhea stools. * Giardia (1681) ‚Äì Giardia is a genus of anaerobic flagellated protozoan parasites of the phylum Sarcomastigophora that colonise and reproduce in the small intestines of several vertebrates, causing giardiasis. Their life cycle alternates between an actively swimming trophozoite and an infective, resistant cyst. The trophozoite form of Giardia was first observed in 1681 by Van Leeuwenhoek during observation of his own stool. Volvox (1700)- Volvox is a genus of chlorophytes, a type of green algae. It forms spherical colonies of up to 50,000 cells. They live in a variety of freshwater habitats, and were first reported by Van Leeuwenhoek in 1700.  Biological nitrogen fixation (1885)  Biological nitrogen fixation was discovered by Martinus Beijerinck in 1885.  Rhizobium (1888)  Rhizobium is a genus of Gram-negative soil bacteria that fix nitrogen. Rhizobium forms an endosymbiotic nitrogen fixing association with roots of legumes and Parasponia. Martinus Beijerinck in the Netherlands was the first to isolate and cultivate a microorganism from the nodules of legumes in 1888. He named it Bacillus radicicola, which is now placed in Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology under the genus Rhizobium.  Spirillum (first isolated sulfate-reducing bacteria) (1895)  Martinus Beijerinck discovered the phenomenon of bacterial sulfate reduction, a form of anaerobic respiration. He learned that bacteria could use sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor, instead of oxygen. He isolated and described Spirillum desulfuricans (now called Desulfovibrio desulfuricans), the first known sulfate-reducing bacterium.  Concept of virus (1898)  Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) symptoms on tobacco. TMV was the first virus to ever be discovered and crystallized. In 1898, Martinus Beijerinck coined the term of \\"virus\\" to indicate that the causal agent of tobacco mosaic disease was of non-bacterial nature. This discovery is considered to be the beginning of virology. In 1898 Beijerinck coined the term \\"virus\\" to indicate that the causal agent of tobacco mosaic disease was non-bacterial. Beijerinck discovered what is now known as the tobacco mosaic virus. He observed that the agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing and he called it a contagium vivum fluidum (contagious living fluid). Beijerinck's discovery is considered to be the beginning of virology.Calisher, Charles H.; Horzinek, M.C.

Tapeworms, Lice, and Prions: A Compendium of Unpleasant Infections, p. 429  Azotobacter (1901)  Azotobacter is a genus of usually motile, oval or spherical bacteria that form thick-walled cysts and may produce large quantities of capsular slime. They are aerobic, free-living soil microbes which play an important role in the nitrogen cycle in nature, binding atmospheric nitrogen, which is inaccessible to plants, and releasing it in the form of ammonium ions into the soil. Apart from being a model organism, it is used by humans for the production of biofertilizers, food additives, and some biopolymers. The first representative of the genus, Azotobacter chroococcum, was discovered and described in 1901 by the Dutch microbiologist and botanist Martinus Beijerinck.  Enrichment culture (1904)  Beijerinck is credited with developing the first enrichment culture, a fundamental method of studying microbes from the environment. = Physics =  31 equal temperament (1661)  Division of the octave into 31 steps arose naturally out of Renaissance music theory; the lesser diesis ‚Äì the ratio of an octave to three major thirds, 128:125 or 41.06 cents ‚Äì was approximately a fifth of a tone and a third of a semitone. In 1666, Lemme Rossi first proposed an equal temperament of this order. Shortly thereafter, having discovered it independently, scientist Christiaan Huygens wrote about it also. Since the standard system of tuning at that time was quarter-comma meantone, in which the fifth is tuned to 51/4, the appeal of this method was immediate, as the fifth of 31-et, at 696.77 cents, is only 0.19 cent wider than the fifth of quarter-comma meantone. Huygens not only realized this, he went farther and noted that 31-ET provides an excellent approximation of septimal, or 7-limit harmony. In the twentieth century, physicist, music theorist and composer Adriaan Fokker, after reading Huygens's work, led a revival of interest in this system of tuning which led to a number of compositions, particularly by Dutch composers. Fokker designed the Fokker organ, a 31-tone equal-tempered organ, which was installed in Teyler's Museum in Haarlem in 1951.  Foundations of classical mechanics (1673)  Through his fundamental contributions Christiaan Huygens helped shape and lay the foundations of classical mechanics. His works cover all the fields of mechanics, from the invention of technical devices applicable to different machines to a purely rational knowledge of motion.Chareix, Fabien (2004). Huygens and Mechanics (ESA Science & Technology, University of Paris IV). Huygens published his results in a classic of the 17th-century mechanics, Horologium Oscillatorium (1673), that is regarded as one of the three most important work done in mechanics in the 17th century, the other two being Galileo Galilei‚Äôs Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences (1638) and Isaac Newton's Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1687). It is Huygens' major work on pendulums and horology. As Domenico Bertoloni Meli (2006) notes, Horologium Oscillatorium was ‚Äúa masterful combination of sophisticated mathematics and mechanics mixed with a range of practical applications culminating with a new clock aimed at resolving the vexing problem of longitude.‚ÄùMeli, Domenico Bertoloni (2006). Thinking with Objects: The Transformation of Mechanics in the Seventeenth Century. (Johns Hopkins University Press), p. 206  Foundations of physical optics / wave optics (wave theory of light) (1678)  Huygens' groundbreaking research on the nature of light helped lay the foundations of modern optics (physical optics in particular).Laermann, Karl-Hans (2000). Optical Methods in Experimental Solid Mechanics. (Springer), p. 198Wayne, Randy O. (2014). Light and Video Microscopy. (Academic Press, Elsevier), p. 43 Huygens is remembered especially for his wave theory of light, which he first communicated in 1678 to France's Royal Acad√©mie des sciences and which he published in 1690 in his Treatise on light. His argument that light consists of waves now known as the Huygens‚ÄìFresnel principle, two centuries later became instrumental in the understanding of wave‚Äìparticle duality. The interference experiments of Thomas Young vindicated Huygens' s wave theory in 1801.Buchwald, Jed Z. (1989).

Lenses and Waves: Christiaan Huygens and the Mathematical Science of Optics in the Seventeenth Century, p. 159  Polarization of light (1678)  In 1678, Huygens discovered the polarization of light by double refraction in calcite.Turner, Gerard L'Estrange (1983). Nineteenth-century Scientific Instruments, p. 149Driggers, Ronald G. (2003). Encyclopedia of Optical Engineering, Volume 1, p. 183Coulson, Kinsell (2012). Solar and Terrestrial Radiation: Methods and Measurements, p. 12  Huygens' principle (concepts of the wavefront and wavelet) (1690)  Huygens is now remembered mostly as the founder and the foremost champion of wave theory of light. His argument that light consists of waves, expounded in his Trait√© de la Lumi√©re (Treatise on light), now known as the Huygens‚ÄìFresnel principle, which two centuries later became instrumental in the understanding of wave‚Äìparticle duality. In his Treatise on light, Huygens showed how Snell's law of sines could be explained by, or derived from, the wave nature of light, using the Huygens‚ÄìFresnel principle.  Bernoulli's principle (1738)  Bernoulli's principle was discovered by Dutch-Swiss mathematician and physicist Daniel Bernoulli and named after him. It states that for an inviscid flow, an increase in the speed of the fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy.  Brownian motion (1785)  In 1785, Ingenhousz described the irregular movement of coal dust on the surface of alcohol and therefore has a claim as discoverer of what came to be known as Brownian motion.  Buys Ballot's law (1857)  The law takes its name from Dutch meteorologist C. H. D. Buys Ballot, who published it in the Comptes Rendus, in November 1857. While William Ferrel first theorized this in 1856, Buys Ballot was the first to provide an empirical validation. The law states that in the Northern Hemisphere, if a person stands with his back to the wind, the low pressure area will be on his left, because wind travels counterclockwise around low pressure zones in that hemisphere. this is approximately true in the higher latitudes and is reversed in the Southern Hemisphere.  Foundations of molecular physics (1873)  Spearheaded by Mach and Ostwald, a strong philosophical current that denied the existence of molecules arose towards the end of the 19th century. The molecular existence was considered unproven and the molecular hypothesis unnecessary. At the time Van der Waals' thesis was written (1873), the molecular structure of fluids had not been accepted by most physicists, and liquid and vapor were often considered as chemically distinct. But Van der Waals's work affirmed the reality of molecules and allowed an assessment of their size and attractive strength.Johannes van der Waals: \\"...It will be perfectly clear that in all my studies I was quite convinced of the real existence of molecules, that I never regarded them as a figment of my imagination, nor even as mere centres of force effects. I considered them to be the actual bodies, thus what we term \\"body\\" in daily speech ought better to be called \\"pseudo body\\". It is an aggregate of bodies and empty space. We do not know the nature of a molecule consisting of a single chemical atom. It would be premature to seek to answer this question but to admit this ignorance in no way impairs the belief in its real existence. When I began my studies I had the feeling that I was almost alone in holding that view. And when, as occurred already in my 1873 treatise, I determined their number in one gram-mol, their size and the nature of their action, I was strengthened in my opinion, yet still there often arose within me the question whether in the final analysis a molecule is a figment of the imagination and the entire molecular theory too. And now I do not think it any exaggeration to state that the real existence of molecules is universally assumed by physicists. Many of those who opposed it most have ultimately been won over, and my theory may have been a contributory factor. And precisely this, I feel, is a step forward. Anyone acquainted with the writings of Boltzmann and Willard Gibbs will admit that physicists carrying great authority believe that the complex phenomena of the heat theory can only be interpreted in this way. It is a great pleasure for me that an increasing number of younger physicists find the inspiration for their work in studies and contemplations of the molecular theory...\\" (The equation of state for gases and liquids, Nobel Lecture, December 12, 1910) By comparing his equation of state with experimental data, Van der Waals was able to obtain estimates for the actual size of molecules and the strength of their mutual attraction.Sengers, Johanna Levelt (2002), p. 16 The effect of Van der Waals's work on molecular science in the 20th century was direct and fundamental, as is well recognized and documented, due in large part to books by John Rowlinson (1988), and by Kipnis and Yavelov (1996). By introducing parameters characterizing molecular size and attraction in constructing his equation of state, Van der Waals set the tone for molecular physics (molecular dynamics in particular) of the 20th century. That molecular aspects such as size, shape, attraction, and multipolar interactions should form the basis for mathematical formulations of the thermodynamic and transport properties of fluids is presently considered an axiom.Sengers, Johanna Levelt (2002), p. 255‚Äì56  Van der Waals equation of state (1873)  In 1873, J. D. van der Waals introduced the first equation of state derived by the assumption of a finite volume occupied by the constituent molecules.Van der Waals, J. D. (1873). On the Continuity of the Gaseous and Liquid States (Doctoral dissertation, Universiteit Leiden). The Van der Waals equation is generally regarded as the first somewhat realistic equation of state (beyond the ideal gas law). Van der Waals noted the non-ideality of gases and attributed it to the existence of molecular or atomic interactions. His new formula revolutionized the study of equations of state, and was most famously continued via the Redlich-Kwong equation of state (1949) and the Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong. While the Van der Waals equation is definitely superior to the ideal gas law and does predict the formation of a liquid phase, the agreement with experimental data is limited for conditions where the liquid forms. Except at higher pressures, the real gases do not obey Van der Waals equation in all ranges of pressures and temperatures. Despite its limitations, the equation has historical importance, because it was the first attempt to model the behaviour of real gases.  Van der Waals forces (1873)  The Van der Waals force between atoms, molecules and surfaces is a part of everyday life in many different ways. Geckos can stick to walls and ceilings because of Van der Waals forces. The van der Waals forces are named after the scientist who first described them in 1873. Johannes Diderik van der Waals noted the non-ideality of gases and attributed it to the existence of molecular or atomic interactions. They are forces that develop between the atoms inside molecules and keep them together.Parsegian, V. Adrian (2005). Van der Waals Forces: A Handbook for Biologists, Chemists, Engineers, and Physicists, p. 2 The Van der Waals forces between molecules, much weaker than chemical bonds but present universally, play a fundamental role in fields as diverse as supramolecular chemistry, structural biology, polymer science, nanotechnology, surface science, and condensed matter physics. Elucidation of the nature of the Van der Waals forces between molecules has remained a scientific effort from Van der Waals's days to the present.  Van der Waals radius (1873)  The Van der Waals radius, r, of an atom is the radius of an imaginary hard sphere which can be used to model the atom for many purposes. It is named after Johannes Diderik van der Waals, winner of the 1910 Nobel Prize in Physics, as he was the first to recognise that atoms were not simply points and to demonstrate the physical consequences of their size through the van der Waals equation of state.  Law of corresponding states (1880)  The law of corresponding states was first suggested and formulated by van der Waals in 1880. This showed that the van der Waals equation of state can be expressed as a simple function of the critical pressure, critical volume and critical temperature. This general form is applicable to all substances. The compound- specific constants a and b in the original equation are replaced by universal (compound-independent) quantities. It was this law that served as a guide during experiments which ultimately led to the liquefaction of hydrogen by James Dewar in 1898 and of helium by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in 1908.  Lorentz ether theory (1892)  Lorentz ether theory has its roots in Hendrik Lorentz's \\"theory of electrons\\", which was the final point in the development of the classical aether theories at the end of the 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century. Lorentz's initial theory created in 1892 and 1895 was based on a completely motionless aether. Many aspects of Lorentz's theory were incorporated into special relativity with the works of Albert Einstein and Hermann Minkowski.  Lorentz force law (1892)  Lorentz force F on a charged particle (of charge q) in motion (instantaneous velocity v). The E field and B field vary in space and time. In 1892, Hendrik Lorentz derived the modern form of the formula for the electromagnetic force which includes the contributions to the total force from both the electric and the magnetic fields.Wadhwani, Navina (2007). Electricity And Magnetism, p. 78Andriesse, Cornelis Dirk (2008). Dutch Messengers: A History of Science Publishing, 1930‚Äì1980, p. 12Miyazaki, Terunobu; Jin, Hanmin (2012). The Physics of Ferromagnetism, p. 3 In many textbook treatments of classical electromagnetism, the Lorentz force law is used as the definition of the electric and magnetic fields E and B.See, for example, Jackson p. 777‚Äì78.. These authors use the Lorentz force in tensor form as definer of the electromagnetic tensor F, in turn the fields E and B. To be specific, the Lorentz force is understood to be the following empirical statement: :The electromagnetic force F on a test charge at a given point and time is a certain function of its charge q and velocity v, which can be parameterized by exactly two vectors E and B, in the functional form: ::\\\\mathbf{F}=q(\\\\mathbf{E}+\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B})  Abraham‚ÄìLorentz force (1895)  In the physics of electromagnetism, the Abraham‚ÄìLorentz force (also Lorentz-Abraham force) is the recoil force on an accelerating charged particle caused by the particle emitting electromagnetic radiation. It is also called the radiation reaction force or the self force.  Lorentz transformation (1895)  In physics, the Lorentz transformation (or Lorentz transformations) is named after the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz. It was the result of attempts by Lorentz and others to explain how the speed of light was observed to be independent of the reference frame, and to understand the symmetries of the laws of electromagnetism. The Lorentz transformation is in accordance with special relativity, but was derived before special relativity. Early approximations of the transformation were published by Lorentz in 1895. In 1905, Poincar√© was the first to recognize that the transformation has the properties of a mathematical group, and named it after Lorentz.  Lorentz contraction (1895)  In physics, length contraction (more formally called Lorentz contraction or Lorentz‚ÄìFitzGerald contraction after Hendrik Lorentz and George FitzGerald) is the phenomenon of a decrease in length measured by the observer, of an object which is traveling at any non-zero velocity relative to the observer. This contraction is usually only noticeable at a substantial fraction of the speed of light.  Lorentz factor (1895)  The Lorentz factor or Lorentz term is the factor by which time, length, and relativistic mass change for an object while that object is moving. It is an expression which appears in several equations in special relativity, and it arises from deriving the Lorentz transformations. The name originates from its earlier appearance in Lorentzian electrodynamics ‚Äì named after the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz.One universe, by Neil deGrasse Tyson, Charles Tsun- Chu Liu, and Robert Irion.  Zeeman effect (1896)  Discoverer of the Zeeman effect, Pieter Zeeman with Albert Einstein and Paul Ehrenfest in his laboratory in Amsterdam (circa 1920). The Zeeman effect, named after the Dutch physicist Pieter Zeeman, is the effect of splitting a spectral line into several components in the presence of a static magnetic field. It is analogous to the Stark effect, the splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of an electric field. Also similar to the Stark effect, transitions between different components have, in general, different intensities, with some being entirely forbidden (in the dipole approximation), as governed by the selection rules. Since the distance between the Zeeman sub- levels is a function of the magnetic field, this effect can be used to measure the magnetic field, e.g. that of the Sun and other stars or in laboratory plasmas. The Zeeman effect is very important in applications such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and M√∂ssbauer spectroscopy. It may also be utilized to improve accuracy in atomic absorption spectroscopy. A theory about the magnetic sense of birds assumes that a protein in the retina is changed due to the Zeeman effect.The magnetic compass mechanisms of birds and rodents are based on different physical principles. Journal of the Royal Society When the spectral lines are absorption lines, the effect is called inverse Zeeman effect.  Liquid helium (liquefaction of helium) (1908)  Liquid helium in a cup. Helium was first liquefied (liquid helium) on 10 July 1908, by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes. With the production of liquid helium, it was said that ‚Äúthe coldest place on Earth‚Äù was in Leiden.Matricon, Jean; Waysand, Georges (1994).

Superconductivity: A Very Short Introduction, p. 23‚Äì24  Superconductivity (1911)  Paul Ehrenfest, Hendrik Lorentz and Niels Bohr visit Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in the cryogenic lab (where Onnes discovered the phenomenon of superconductivity in 1911). Superconductivity, the ability of certain materials to conduct electricity with little or no resistance, was discovered by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes.Vidali, Gianfranco (1993).

Absolute Zero and the Conquest of Cold, p. 233Buckel, Werner; Kleiner, Reinhold (2004). Superconductivity: Fundamentals and Applications  Einstein‚Äìde Haas effect (1910s)  The Einstein‚Äìde Haas effect or the Richardson effect (after Owen Willans Richardson), is a physical phenomenon delineated by Albert Einstein and Wander Johannes de Haas in the mid 1910s, that exposes a relationship between magnetism, angular momentum, and the spin of elementary particles.  Debye model (1912)  In thermodynamics and solid state physics, the Debye model is a method developed by Peter Debye in 1912 for estimating the phonon contribution to the specific heat (heat capacity) in a solid. It treats the vibrations of the atomic lattice (heat) as phonons in a box, in contrast to the Einstein model, which treats the solid as many individual, non-interacting quantum harmonic oscillators. The Debye model correctly predicts the low temperature dependence of the heat capacity.  De Sitter precession (1916)  The geodetic effect (also known as geodetic precession, de Sitter precession or de Sitter effect) represents the effect of the curvature of spacetime, predicted by general relativity, on a vector carried along with an orbiting body. The geodetic effect was first predicted by Willem de Sitter in 1916, who provided relativistic corrections to the Earth‚ÄìMoon system's motion.  De Sitter space and anti-de Sitter space (1920s)  In mathematics and physics, a de Sitter space is the analog in Minkowski space, or spacetime, of a sphere in ordinary, Euclidean space. The n-dimensional de Sitter space, denoted dSn, is the Lorentzian manifold analog of an n-sphere (with its canonical Riemannian metric); it is maximally symmetric, has constant positive curvature, and is simply connected for n at least 3. The de Sitter space, as well as the anti-de Sitter space is named after Willem de Sitter (1872‚Äì1934), professor of astronomy at Leiden University and director of the Leiden Observatory. Willem de Sitter and Albert Einstein worked in the 1920s in Leiden closely together on the spacetime structure of our universe. De Sitter space was discovered by Willem de Sitter, and, at the same time, independently by Tullio Levi-Civita.  Van der Pol oscillator (1920)  In dynamical systems, a Van der Pol oscillator is a non-conservative oscillator with non- linear damping. It was originally proposed by Dutch physicist Balthasar van der Pol while he was working at Philips in 1920. Van der Pol studied a differential equation that describes the circuit of a vacuum tube. It has been used to model other phenomenon such as human heartbeats by colleague Jan van der Mark.  Kramers' opacity law (1923)  Kramers' opacity law describes the opacity of a medium in terms of the ambient density and temperature, assuming that the opacity is dominated by bound-free absorption (the absorption of light during ionization of a bound electron) or free-free absorption (the absorption of light when scattering a free ion, also called bremsstrahlung).Phillips (1999), p. 92. It is often used to model radiative transfer, particularly in stellar atmospheres.Carroll (1996), p. 274‚Äì276. The relation is named after the Dutch physicist Hendrik Kramers, who first derived the form in 1923.Carroll (1996), p. 274.  Electron spin (1925)  In 1925, Dutch physicists George Eugene Uhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit co- discovered the concept of electron spin, which posits an intrinsic angular momentum for all electrons.  Solidification of helium (1926)  In 1926, Onnes' student, Dutch physicist Willem Hendrik Keesom, invented a method to freeze liquid helium and was the first person who was able to solidify the noble gas.  Ehrenfest theorem (1927)  The Ehrenfest theorem, named after the Austrian-born Dutch-Jew theoretical physicist Paul Ehrenfest at Leiden University.  De Haas‚Äìvan Alphen effect (1930)  The de Haas‚Äìvan Alphen effect, often abbreviated to dHvA, is a quantum mechanical effect in which the magnetic moment of a pure metal crystal oscillates as the intensity of an applied magnetic field B is increased. It was discovered in 1930 by Wander Johannes de Haas and his student P. M. van Alphen.  Shubnikov‚Äìde Haas effect (1930)  The Shubnikov‚Äìde Haas effect (ShdH) is named after Dutch physicist Wander Johannes de Haas and Russian physicist Lev Shubnikov.  Kramers degeneracy theorem (1930)  In quantum mechanics, the Kramers degeneracy theorem states that for every energy eigenstate of a time-reversal symmetric system with half-integer total spin, there is at least one more eigenstate with the same energy. It was first discovered in 1930 by H. A. KramersKramers, H. A., Proc. Amsterdam Acad. 33, 959 (1930) as a consequence of the Breit equation.  Minnaert resonance frequency (1933)  In 1933, Marcel Minnaert published a solution for the acoustic resonance frequency of a single bubble in water, the so-called Minnaert resonance. The Minnaert resonance or Minnaert frequency is the acoustic resonance frequency of a single bubble in an infinite domain of water (neglecting the effects of surface tension and viscous attenuation).  Casimir effect (1948)  In quantum field theory, the Casimir effect and the Casimir‚ÄìPolder force are physical forces arising from a quantized field. Dutch physicists Hendrik Casimir and Dirk Polder at Philips Research Labs proposed the existence of a force between two polarizable atoms and between such an atom and a conducting plate in 1947. After a conversation with Niels Bohr who suggested it had something to do with zero-point energy, Casimir alone formulated the theory predicting a force between neutral conducting plates in 1948; the former is called the Casimir‚ÄìPolder force while the latter is the Casimir effect in the narrow sense.  Tellegen's theorem (1952)  Tellegen's theorem is one of the most powerful theorems in network theory. Most of the energy distribution theorems and extremum principles in network theory can be derived from it. It was published in 1952 by Bernard Tellegen. Fundamentally, Tellegen's theorem gives a simple relation between magnitudes that satisfy Kirchhoff's laws of electrical circuit theory.  Stochastic cooling (1970s)  In the early 1970s Simon van der Meer, a Dutch particle physicist at CERN, discovered this technique to concentrate proton and anti-proton beams, leading to the discovery of the W and Z particles. He won the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physics together with Carlo Rubbia.  Renormalization of gauge theories (1971)  In 1971, Gerardus 't Hooft, who was completing his PhD under the supervision of Dutch theoretical physicist Martinus Veltman, renormalized Yang‚ÄìMills theory. They showed that if the symmetries of Yang‚ÄìMills theory were to be realized in the spontaneously broken mode, referred to as the Higgs mechanism, then Yang‚ÄìMills theory can be renormalized.Regularization and Renormalization of Gauge Fields by 't Hooft and Veltman (PDF) Renormalization of Yang‚ÄìMills theory is considered as a major achievement of twentieth century physics.  Holographic principle (1993)  The holographic principle is a property of string theories and a supposed property of quantum gravity that states that the description of a volume of space can be thought of as encoded on a boundary to the region ‚Äì preferably a light-like boundary like a gravitational horizon. In 1993, Dutch theoretical physicist Gerard 't Hooft proposed what is now known as the holographic principle. It was given a precise string-theory interpretation by Leonard Susskind who combined his ideas with previous ones of 't Hooft and Charles Thorn.

It is bordered by H4 Dansteed Way to the north, V4 Watling Street to the west, a tiny stretch of H8 Standing Way to the south, and the West Coast Main Line to the east.Civil Parish (geographic area): Loughton & Great Holm Office of National Statistics, 2013 It was renamed from Loughton to Loughton and Great Holm in 2013  Loughton  Loughton is an ancient village and modern district. The village spreads between Watling Street and the modern A5 road. It is to the west of, and about 1 mile from, Central Milton Keynes, with pedestrian access to Milton Keynes Central railway station. The original village has now been incorporated into the modern 'grid square' of Loughton. However much of the character of the old village remains; to the north-east of Bradwell Road the area bounded by School Lane and Church Lane contains the Church and remnants of the original parish of Great Loughton. To the south- west of Bradwell Road, around The Green there is a cluster of several sixteenth century buildings (Manor Farm, Manor Farm Cottages and Cell Farm) which constitute the remains of the original parish of Little Loughton. Today Loughton is a mainly residential area but is also home to a large Equestrian Centre, in the grounds of which the medieval field pattern and fish pond can still be seen. The district is bounded by the A5 to the east, H5 Portway to the north, V4 Watling Street to the west and H6 Childs Way to the south.  Great Holm  Great Holm is primarily a residential district and contains a high point overlooking much of the central area of Milton Keynes. The MacIntyre Charity which provides support for people with learning disabilities has a care home in Great Holm and a large centre providing a variety of day time activities. They also run a popular coffee shop and bakery which is open to the public but provides supported employment for people with learning disabilities. = Loughton Lodge = Loughton Lodge is a small area of Great Holm next to Loughton 'grid square' linked to Loughton by an underpass under which runs the old Bradwell Road and separated from the bulk of Great Holm by Lodge Lake (a balancing lake). Loughton Lodge is home to the National Badminton Centre, health club, Girl Guides site and a small gated development of luxury apartments. This district is bordered by H4 Dansteed Way to the north, V4 Watling Street to the west, H5 Portway to the south and the A5 to the east.  Knowlhill  Knowlhill is primarily an employment area with a large parkland alongside the A5. Much of this area is a flood plain of the Shenley Brook, and contains the \\"Teardrop Lakes\\" ‚Äî small balancing lakes. In the late 1980s, Knowlhill was designated by Milton Keynes Development Corporation as being the industrial part of the \\"Energy Park\\" ‚Äì with the residential part across Watling Street (in Shenley Lodge), home to the 1986 Energy World exhibition. All buildings were expected to meet higher standards of energy efficiency than were normal at the time, and five exemplar offices were built before 1990 including the then headquarters of Royal Mail Parcelforce. In 1990 the rest of the area was unsuccessfully marketed as a single large-scale development opportunity, intended to fund a National Energy Centre through development gain.Marketing brochures and \\"Energy Park News\\" produced by MKDC and National Energy Foundation, dated 1990-1 Although this plan failed, the area retains a strong link with sustainable energy and hosts the main offices for the National Energy Foundation (which occupies a low energy building on the intended site of the National Energy Centre), the Zero Carbon Hub, United Sustainable Energy Agency and the National Home Energy Rating Scheme. The area also contains the head office of the National House Building Council (NHBC) and a testing laboratory set up by the Consumers' Association but subsequently owned by Intertek, as well as lawyers, graphic design companies and warehousing. This district is bordered by H6 Childs Way to the north, V4 Watling Street to the west, H7 Chaffron Way to the south and the A5 to the east.  National Bowl and Elfield Park  The National Bowl and its associated land is almost triangular, bordered by H7 Chaffron Way to the north, V4 Watling Street to the west, a tiny stretch of H8 Standing Way to the south, and the A5 to the east. The adjacent Elfield Park is a narrow strip of land between the A5 and the railway line, in part a nature studies reserve and in part a general utility space.

Home: A Short History of an Idea. According to Witold Rybczynski's Home: A Short History of an Idea, private spaces in households are a Dutch seventeenth-century invention, despite their commonplace nature today. He has argued that home as we now know it came from the Dutch canal house of the seventeenth century. That, he said, was the first time that people identified living quarters as being precisely the residence of a man, a woman and their children. \\"The feminization of the home in seventeenth century Holland was one of the most important events in the evolution of the domestic interior.\\" This evolution took place in part due to Dutch law being \\"explicit on contractual arrangements and on the civil rights of servants\\". And, \\"for the first time, the person who was in intimate contact with housework was also in a position to influence the arrangement and disposition of the house.\\" Rybczynski (2007) discusses why we live in houses in the first place: \\"To understand why we live in houses, it is necessary to go back several hundred years to Europe. Rural people have always lived in houses, but the typical medieval town dwelling, which combined living space and workplace, was occupied by a mixture of extended families, servants, and employees. This changed in seventeenth-century Holland. The Netherlands was Europe‚Äôs first republic, and the world‚Äôs first middle-class nation. Prosperity allowed extensive home ownership, republicanism discouraged the widespread use of servants, a love of children promoted the nuclear family, and Calvinism encouraged thrift and other domestic virtues. These circumstances, coupled with a particular affection for the private family home, brought about a cultural revolution... The idea of urban houses spread to the British Isles thanks to England's strong commercial and cultural links with the Netherlands.\\"Tabor, Philip (2005). \\"Striking Home: The Telematic Assault on Identity\\". Published in Jonathan Hill, editor, Occupying Architecture: Between the Architect and the User. Philip Tabor states the contribution of 17th century Dutch houses as the foundation of houses today: \\"As far as the idea of the home is concerned, the home of the home is the Netherlands. This idea's crystallization might be dated to the first three-quarters of the seventeenth century, when the Dutch Netherlands amassed the unprecedented and unrivalled accumulation of capital, and emptied their purses into domestic space.\\" According to Jonathan Hill (Immaterial Architecture, 2006), compared to the large scaled houses in England and the Renaissance, the 17th Century Dutch house was smaller, and was only inhabited by up to four to five members. This was due to their embracing \\"self-reliance\\", in contrast to the dependence on servants, and a design for a lifestyle centered on the family. It was important for the Dutch to separate work from domesticity, as the home became an escape and a place of comfort. This way of living and the home has been noted as highly similar to the contemporary family and their dwellings. House layouts also incorporated the idea of the corridor as well as the importance of function and privacy. By the end of the 17th Century, the house layout was soon transformed to become employment-free, enforcing these ideas for the future. This came in favour for the industrial revolution, gaining large-scale factory production and workers. The house layout of the Dutch and its functions are still relevant today. The Netherlandsincluding the Dutch- speaking Southern Netherlands prior to 1585 and its people have made numerous seminal contributions to the world's civilization,Taylor, Peter J. (2002).

London: Routledge, p. 87‚Äì103 especially in art,The Dutch Republic was the birthplace of the first modern art market, successfully combining art and commerce together as we would recognise it today. Until the 17th century, commissioning works of art was largely the preserve of the church, monarchs and aristocrats. The emergence of a powerful and wealthy middle class in Holland, though, produced a radical change in patronage as the new Dutch bourgeoisie bought art. For the first time, the direction of art was shaped by relatively broadly-based demand rather than religious dogma or royal whim, and the result was the birth of a large-scale open (free) art market which today's dealers and collectors would find familiar.Jaff√©, H.

The Britannica Guide to Inventions That Changed the Modern World economics and finance,During their Golden Age, the Dutch were responsible for three major institutional innovations in economic and financial history. The first major innovation was the foundation of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), the world's first publicly traded company, in 1602. As the first listed company (the first company to be ever listed on an official stock exchange), the VOC was the first company to actually issue stock and bonds to the general public. Considered by many experts to be the world's first truly (modern) multinational corporation, the VOC was also the first permanently organized limited-liability joint-stock company, with a permanent capital base. The Dutch merchants were the pioneers in laying the basis for modern corporate governance. The VOC is often considered as the precursor of modern corporations, if not the first truly modern corporation. It was the VOC that invented the idea of investing in the company rather than in a specific venture governed by the company. With its pioneering features such as corporate identity (first globally-recognized corporate logo), entrepreneurial spirit, legal personhood, transnational (multinational) operational structure, high stable profitability, permanent capital (fixed capital stock), freely transferable shares and tradable securities, separation of ownership and management, and limited liability for both shareholders and managers, the VOC is generally considered a major institutional breakthrough and the model for the large-scale business enterprises that now dominate the global economy. The second major innovation was the creation of the world's first fully functioning financial market, with the birth of a fully fledged capital market. The Dutch were also the first to effectively use a fully-fledged capital market (including the bond market and the stock market) to finance companies (such as the VOC and the WIC). It was in seventeenth-century Amsterdam that the global securities market began to take on its modern form. In 1602 the Dutch East India Company (VOC) established an exchange in Amsterdam where VOC stock and bonds could be traded in a secondary market. The VOC undertook the world's first recorded IPO in the same year. The Amsterdam Stock Exchange (Amsterdamsche Beurs in Dutch) was also the world's first fully-fledged stock exchange. While the Italian city-states produced the first transferable government bonds, they didn't develop the other ingredient necessary to produce a fully fledged capital market: corporate shareholders. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) became the first company to offer shares of stock. The dividend averaged around 18% of capital over the course of the company's 200-year existence. Dutch investors were the first to trade their shares at a regular stock exchange. The buying and selling of these shares of stock in the VOC became the basis of the first stock market. It was in the Dutch Republic that the early techniques of stock-market manipulation were developed. The Dutch pioneered stock futures, stock options, short selling, bear raids, debt-equity swaps, and other speculative instruments. Amsterdam businessman Joseph de la Vega's Confusion of Confusions (1688) was the earliest book about stock trading. The third major innovation was the establishment of the Bank of Amsterdam (Amsterdamsche Wisselbank in Dutch) in 1609, which led to the introduction of the concept of bank money. The Bank of Amsterdam was arguably the world's first central bank. The Wisselbank's innovations helped lay the foundations for the birth and development of the central banking system that now plays a vital role in the world's economy. It occupied a central position in the financial world of its day, providing an effective, efficient and trusted system for national and international payments, and introduced the first ever international reserve currency, the bank guilder. Lucien Gillard (2004) calls it the European guilder (le florin europ√©en), and Adam Smith devotes many pages to explaining how the bank guilder works (Smith 1776: 446‚Äì55). The model of the Wisselbank as a state bank was adapted throughout Europe, including the Bank of Sweden (1668) and the Bank of England (1694).De Vries, Jan; Woude, Ad van der (1997).

Although many of the basic concepts had first appeared in Italy during the Renaissance, the Dutch, especially the citizens of the city of Amsterdam, were the real innovators. They transformed banking, stock exchanges, credit, insurance, and limited- liability corporations into a coherent financial and commercial system.\\"Gordon, Scott (1999).

Dutch-speaking people, in spite of their relatively small number, have a significant history of invention, innovation, discovery and exploration. The following list is composed of objects, (largely) unknown lands, breakthrough ideas/concepts, principles, phenomena, processes, methods, techniques, styles etc., that were discovered or invented (or pioneered) by people from the Netherlands and Dutch-speaking people from the former Southern Netherlands (Zuid-Nederlanders in Dutch). Until the fall of Antwerp (1585), the Dutch and Flemish were generally seen as one people.Frisians, specifically West Frisians, are an ethnic group; present in the North of the Netherlands; mainly concentrating in the Province of Friesland. Culturally, modern Frisians and the (Northern) Dutch are rather similar; the main and generally most important difference being that Frisians speak West Frisian, one of the three sub-branches of the Frisian languages, alongside Dutch. West Frisians in the general do not feel or see themselves as part of a larger group of Frisians, and, according to a 1970 inquiry, identify themselves more with the Dutch than with East or North Frisians. Because of centuries of cohabitation and active participation in Dutch society, as well as being bilingual, the Frisians are not treated as a separate group in Dutch official statistics.

Willem Barentsz made the first indisputable discovery of Svalbard in 1596, in an attempt to find the Northern Sea Route. The three voyages of Willem Barents are remembered today chiefly for the first documented wintering in the High Arctic. Objects found in Het Behouden Huys (The Saved House) on Novaya Zemlya. The first undisputed discovery of the archipelago was an expedition led by the Dutch mariner Willem Barentsz, who was looking for the Northern Sea Route to China.Arlov (1994): 9 He first spotted Bj√∏rn√∏ya on 10 June 1596Arlov (1994): 10 and the northwestern tip of Spitsbergen on 17 June. The sighting of the archipelago was included in the accounts and maps made by the expedition and Spitsbergen was quickly included by cartographers. The name Spitsbergen, meaning \\"pointed mountains\\" (from the Dutch spits ‚Äì pointed, bergen ‚Äì mountains), was at first applied to both the main island and the Svalbard archipelago as a whole.  Winter surviving in the High Arctic (1596‚Äì1597)  Willem Barentsz' ship among the Arctic ice Het Behouden Huys on Novaya Zemlya The search for the Northern Sea Route in the 16th century led to its exploration. Dutch explorer Willem Barentsz reached the west coast of Novaya Zemlya in 1594, and in a subsequent expedition of 1596 rounded the Northern point and wintered on the Northeast coast. Willem Barents, Jacob van Heemskerck and their crew were blocked by the pack ice in the Kara Sea and forced to winter on the east coast of Novaya Zemlya. The wintering of the shipwrecked crew in the 'Saved House' was the first successful wintering of Europeans in the High Arctic. Twelve of the 17 men managed to survive the polar winter (De Veer, 1917). Barentsz died during the expedition, and may have been buried on the northern island.\\"Search for Barents: Evaluation of Possible Burial Sites on North Novaya Zemlya, Russia\\", Jaapjan J. Zeeberg et al., Arctic Vol. 55, No. 4 (December 2002) p. 329‚Äì338  Falkland Islands/Sebald Islands (1600)  In 1600 the Dutch navigator Sebald de Weert made the first undisputed sighting of the Falkland Islands. It was on his homeward leg back to the Netherlands after having left the Straits of Magellan that Sebald De Weert noticed some unnamed and uncharted islands, at least islands that did not exist on his nautical charts. There he attempted to stop and replenish but was unable to land due to harsh conditions. The islands Sebald de Weert charted were a small group off the northwest coast of the Falkland Islands and are in fact part of the Falklands. De Weert then named these islands the \\"Sebald de Weert Islands\\" and the Falklands as a whole were known as the Sebald Islands until well into the 18th century.  Pennefather River, Northern Australia (1606)  Duyfken replica under sail. The first documented and undisputed European sighting of and landing on Australia was in late February or early March 1606, by the Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon aboard the Duyfken. Australia is more than three times the size of Greenland, the world's largest island. Australia is sometimes dubbed \\"The Island Continent\\", and sometimes accorded the role of \\"Earth‚Äôs largest island but smallest continent\\". Hollandia Nova, 1659 map prepared by Joan Blaeu based on voyages by Abel Tasman and Willem Jansz, this image shows a French edition of 1663. Australia (Nova Hollandia) was the last inhabitable continent to be explored and mapped (by non-natives). The Dutch were the first to undisputedly explore and map Australia's coastline. In the 17th century, the Dutch navigators charted almost three-quarters of the Australian coastline, except the east coast. The Dutch ship, Duyfken, led by Willem Janszoon, made the first documented European landing in Australia in 1606.J.P. Sigmond and L.H. Zuiderbaan (1979) Dutch Discoveries of Australia.

Dutch vessel Duyfken, captained by Janszoon, followed the coast of New Guinea, missed Torres Strait, and explored perhaps of western side of Cape York, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, believing the land was still part of New Guinea. The Dutch made one landing, but were promptly attacked by Maoris and subsequently abandoned further exploration.Day, Alan (2003).

He sighted the coast of Cape York Peninsula in early 1606, and made landfall on 26 February at the Pennefather River near the modern town of Weipa on Cape York. p. 233. The Dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines and named the island continent \\"New Holland\\" during the 17th century, but made no attempt at settlement.  First charting of Manhattan, New York (1609)  The area that is now Manhattan was long inhabited by the Lenape Indians. In 1524, Florentine explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano ‚Äì sailing in service of the king Francis I of France ‚Äì was the first European to visit the area that would become New York City. It was not until the voyage of Henry Hudson, an Englishman who worked for the Dutch East India Company, that the area was mapped.  Hudson Valley (1609)  At the time of the arrival of the first Europeans in the 17th century, the Hudson Valley was inhabited primarily by the Algonquian-speaking Mahican and Munsee Native American people, known collectively as River Indians. The first Dutch settlement was in the 1610s at Fort Nassau, a trading post (factorij) south of modern-day Albany, that traded European goods for beaver pelts. Fort Nassau was later replaced by Fort Orange. During the rest of the 17th century, the Hudson Valley formed the heart of the New Netherland colony operations, with the New Amsterdam settlement on Manhattan serving as a post for supplies and defense of the upriver operations.  Brouwer Route (1610‚Äì1611)  The Brouwer Route was a route for sailing from the Cape of Good Hope to Java. The Route took ships south from the Cape into the Roaring Forties, then east across the Indian Ocean, before turning northwest for Java. Thus it took advantage of the strong westerly winds for which the Roaring Forties are named, greatly increasing travel speed. It was devised by Dutch sea explorer Hendrik Brouwer in 1611, and found to halve the duration of the journey from Europe to Java, compared to the previous Arab and Portuguese monsoon route, which involved following the coast of East Africa northwards, sailing through the Mozambique Channel and then across the Indian Ocean, sometimes via India. The Brouwer Route played a major role in the discovery of the west coast of Australia.  Jan Mayen Island (1614)  After unconfirmed reports of Dutch discovery as early as 1611, the island was named after Dutchman Jan Jacobszoon May van Schellinkhout, who visited the island in July 1614. As locations of these islands were kept secret by the whalers, Jan Mayen got its current name only in 1620.Mills, William J. (2003). Exploring Polar Frontiers: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1, p. 332‚Äì33  Hell Gate, Long Island Sound, Connecticut River and Fisher's Island (1614)  Block's map of his 1614 voyage, with the first appearance of the term \\"New Netherland\\" The name \\"Hell Gate\\" is a corruption of Dutch phrase Hellegat, which could mean either \\"hell's hole\\" or \\"bright gate/passage\\". It was originally applied to the entirety of the East River. The strait was described in the journals of Dutch explorer Adriaen Block, who is the first European known to have navigated the strait, during his 1614 voyage aboard the Onrust. The first European to record the existence of Long Island Sound and the Connecticut River was Dutch explorer Adriaen Block, who entered it from the East River in 1614. Fishers Island was called Munnawtawkit by the Native American Pequot nation. Block named it Visher's Island in 1614, after one of his companions. For the next 25 years, it remained a wilderness, visited occasionally by Dutch traders.  Staten Island (Argentina), Cape Horn, Tonga, Hoorn Islands (1615)  On 25 December 1615, Dutch explorers Jacob le Maire and Willem Schouten aboard the Eendracht, discovered Staten Island, close to Cape Horn. The voyage of Willem Schouten and Jacob le Maire in 1615‚Äì1616 On 29 January 1616, they sighted land they called Cape Horn, after the city of Hoorn. Aboard the Eendracht was the crew of the recently wrecked ship called Hoorn. Arrival of Abel Tasman in Tongatapu, 1643, drawing by Isaack Gilsemans They discovered Tonga on 21 April 1616 and the Hoorn Islands on 28 April 1616. They discovered New Ireland around May‚ÄìJuly 1616. They discovered the Schouten Islands (also known as Biak Islands or Geelvink Islands) on 24 July 1616. The Schouten Islands (also known as Eastern Schouten Islands or Le Maire Islands) of Papua New Guinea, were named after Schouten, who visited them in 1616.  Dirk Hartog Island (1616)  Dirk Hartog's plate in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam Map of Shark Bay area showing Dirk Hartog Island and Cape Inscription Hendrik Brouwer's discovery that sailing east from the Cape of Good Hope until land was sighted, and then sailing north along the west coast of Australia was a much quicker route than around the coast of the Indian Ocean made Dutch landfalls on the west coast inevitable. The first such landfall was in 1616, when Dirk Hartog landed at Cape Inscription on what is now known as Dirk Hartog Island, off the coast of Western Australia, and left behind an inscription on a pewter plate. In 1697 the Dutch captain Willem de Vlamingh landed on the island and discovered Hartog's plate. He replaced it with one of his own, which included a copy of Hartog's inscription, and took the original plate home to Amsterdam, where it is still kept in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam.  Houtman Abrolhos (1619)  The first sighting of the Houtman Abrolhos by Europeans was by Dutch VOC ships Dordrecht and Amsterdam in 1619, three years after Hartog made the first authenticated sighting of what is now Western Australia, 13 years after the first authenticated voyage to Australia, that of the Duyfke in 1606. Discovery of the islands was credited to Frederick de Houtman, Captain-General of the Dordrecht, as it was Houtman who later wrote of the discovery in a letter to Company directors.  Carstensz Glacier, Carstensz Pyramid/Puncak Jaya (1623)  The first person to spot Carstensz Pyramid (or Puncak Jaya) is reported to be the Dutch navigator and explorer Jan Carstensz in 1623, for whom the mountain is named. Carstensz was the first (non-native) to sight the glaciers on the peak of the mountain on a rare clear day. The sighting went unverified for over two centuries, and Carstensz was ridiculed in Europe when he said he had seen snow and glaciers near the equator. The snowfield of Puncak Jaya was reached as early as 1909 by a Dutch explorer, Hendrik Albert Lorentz with six of his indigenous Dayak Kenyah porters recruited from the Apo Kayan in Borneo. The now highest Carstensz Pyramid summit was not climbed until 1962, by an expedition led by the Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer with three other expedition members ‚Äì the New Zealand mountaineer Philip Temple, the Australian rock climber Russell Kippax, and the Dutch patrol officer Albertus (Bert) Huizenga.  Gulf of Carpentaria (Northern Australia) (1623)  The first known European explorer to visit the region was Dutch Willem Janszoon (also known as Willem Jansz) on his 1605‚Äì06 voyage. His fellow countryman, Jan Carstenszoon (also known as Jan Carstensz), visited in 1623 and named the gulf in honour of Pieter de Carpentier, at that time the Governor-General of Dutch East Indies. Abel Tasman explored the coast in 1644.  Staaten River (Cape York Peninsula, Northern Australia) (1623)  The Staaten River is a river in the Cape York Peninsula, Australia that rises more than to the west of Cairns and empties into the Gulf of Carpentaria. The river was first named by Carstenszoon in 1623.  Arnhem Land and Groote Eylandt (Gulf of Carpentaria, Northern Australia) (1623)  In 1623 Dutch East India Company captain Willem van Colster sailed into the Gulf of Carpentaria. Cape Arnhem is named after his ship, the Arnhem, which itself was named after the city of Arnhem. Groote Eylandt was first sighted the Arnhem. Only in 1644, when Abel Tasman arrived, was the island given a European name, Dutch for \\"Large Island\\" in an archaic spelling. The modern Dutch spelling is Groot Eiland.  Hermite Islands (1624)  In February 1624, Dutch admiral Jacques l'Hermite discovered the Hermite Islands at Cape Horn.  Southern Australia coast (1627)  In 1627, Dutch explorers Fran√ßois Thijssen and Pieter Nuyts discovered the south coast of Australia and charted about of it between Cape Leeuwin and the Nuyts Archipelago.Garden 1977, p.8. Fran√ßois Thijssen, captain of the ship 't Gulden Zeepaert (The Golden Seahorse), sailed to the east as far as Ceduna in South Australia. The first known ship to have visited the area is the Leeuwin (\\"Lioness\\"), a Dutch vessel that charted some of the nearby coastline in 1622. The log of the Leeuwin has been lost, so very little is known of the voyage. However, the land discovered by the Leeuwin was recorded on a 1627 map by Hessel Gerritsz: Caert van't Landt van d'Eendracht (\\"Chart of the Land of Eendracht\\"), which appears to show the coast between present-day Hamelin Bay and Point D‚ÄôEntrecasteaux. Part of Thijssen's map shows the islands St Francis and St Peter, now known collectively with their respective groups as the Nuyts Archipelago. Thijssen's observations were included as soon as 1628 by the VOC cartographer Hessel Gerritsz in a chart of the Indies and New Holland. This voyage defined most of the southern coast of Australia and discouraged the notion that \\"New Holland\\", as it was then known, was linked to Antarctica. St Francis Island (originally in Dutch: Eyland St. Fran√ßois) is an island on the south coast of South Australia near Ceduna. It is now part of the Nuyts Archipelago Wilderness Protection Area. It was one of the first parts of South Australia to be discovered and named by Europeans, along with St Peter Island. Thijssen named it after his patron saint, St. Francis. St Peter Island is an island on the south coast of South Australia near Ceduna to the south of Denial Bay. It is the second largest island in South Australia at about 13 km long. It was named in 1627 by Thijssen after Pieter Nuyts' patron saint.  Western Australia (1629)  Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort on the West Wallabi Island The Weibbe Hayes Stone Fort, remnants of improvised defensive walls and stone shelters built by Wiebbe Hayes and his men on the West Wallabi Island, are Australia's oldest known European structures, more than 150 years before expeditions to the Australian continent by James Cook and Arthur Phillip.  Tasmania and the surrounding islands (1642)  Tasman's routes of the first and second voyage In 1642, Abel Tasman sailed from Mauritius and on 24 November, sighted Tasmania. He named Tasmania Van Diemen's Land, after Anthony van Diemen, the Dutch East India Company's Governor General, who had commissioned his voyage.Fenton, James (1884).

Paradise Past: The Transformation of the South Pacific, 1520‚Äì1920, p. 31 It was officially renamed Tasmania in honour of its first European discoverer on 1 January 1856. Map of the Maatsuyker Islands Maatsuyker Islands, a group of small islands that are the southernmost point of the Australian continent. were discovered and named by Tasman in 1642 after a Dutch official. The main islands of the group are De Witt Island (354 m), Maatsuyker Island (296 m), Flat Witch Island, Flat Top Island, Round Top Island, Walker Island, Needle Rocks and Mewstone. Maria Island was discovered and named in 1642 by Tasman after Maria van Diemen (n√©e van Aelst), wife of Anthony. The island was known as Maria's Isle in the early 19th century. Tasman's journal entry for 29 November 1642 records that he observed a rock which was similar to a rock named Pedra Branca off China, presumably referring to the Pedra Branca in the South China Sea. Schouten Island is a island in eastern Tasmania, Australia. It lies 1.6 kilometres south of Freycinet Peninsula and is a part of Freycinet National Park. In 1642, while surveying the south-west coast of Tasmania, Tasman named the island after Joost Schouten, a member of the Council of the Dutch East India Company. Tasman also reached Storm Bay, a large bay in the south-east of Tasmania, Australia. It is the entrance to the Derwent River estuary and the port of Hobart, the capital city of Tasmania. It is bordered by Bruny Island to the west and the Tasman Peninsula to the east.  New Zealand and Fiji (1642)  Murderers' Bay, drawing by Isaack Gilsemans, 1642 Detail from a 1657 map by Jan Janssonius, showing the western coastline of Nova Zeelandia. Tasman voyage of 1642‚Äì43 was the known (documented) first to sail across the Tasman Sea and explore its islands. In 1642, the first Europeans known to reach New Zealand were the crew of Dutch explorer Abel Tasman who arrived in his ships Heemskerck and Zeehaen. Tasman anchored at the northern end of the South Island in Golden Bay (he named it Murderers' Bay) in December 1642 and sailed northward to Tonga following a clash with local MƒÅori. Tasman sketched sections of the two main islands' west coasts. Tasman called them Staten Landt, after the States General of the Netherlands, and that name appeared on his first maps of the country. In 1645 Dutch cartographers changed the name to Nova Zeelandia in Latin, from Nieuw Zeeland, after the Dutch province of Zeeland. It was subsequently Anglicised as New Zealand by British naval captain James Cook Various claims have been made that New Zealand was reached by other non-Polynesian voyagers before Tasman, but these are not widely accepted. Peter Trickett, for example, argues in Beyond Capricorn that the Portuguese explorer Crist√≥v√£o de Mendon√ßa reached New Zealand in the 1520s, and the Tamil bell\\"The Tamil Bell\\", Te Papa discovered by missionary William Colenso has given rise to a number of theories, but historians generally believe the bell 'is not in itself proof of early Tamil contact with New Zealand'.Kerry R. Howe (2003). The Quest for Origins: Who First Discovered and Settled New Zealand and the Pacific Islands? pp 144‚Äì45 Auckland:Penguin. In 1643, still during the same expedition, Tasman discovered Fiji.  Tongatapu and Ha ªapai (Tonga) (1643)  Tasman discovered Tongatapu and Ha ªapai in 1643 commanding two ships, the Heemskerck and the Zeehaen commissioned by the Dutch East India Company. The expedition's goals were to chart the unknown southern and eastern seas and to find a possible passage through the South Pacific and Indian Ocean providing a faster route to Chile.  Sakhalin (Cape Patience) (1643)  The first European known to visit Sakhalin was Martin Gerritz de Vries, who mapped Cape Patience and Cape Aniva on the island's east coast in 1643.  Kuril Islands (1643)  In the summer of 1643, the Castricum, under command of Martin Gerritz de Vries sailed by the southern Kuril Islands, visiting Kunashir, Iturup and Urup, which they named \\"Company Island\\" and claimed for the Netherlands. Vries Strait or Miyabe Line is a strait between two main islands of the Kurils. It is located between the northeastern end of the island of Iturup and the southwestern headland of Urup Island, connecting the Sea of Okhotsk on the west with the Pacific Ocean on the east. The strait is named after de Vries, the first recorded European to explore the area. The Gulf of Patience is a large body of water off the southeastern coast of Sakhalin, Russia, between the main body of Sakhalin Island in the west and Cape Patience in the east. It is part of the Sea of Okhotsk. The first Europeans to visit the bay sailed on Castricum. They named the gulf in memory of the fog that had to clear for them to continue their expedition.  Rottnest Island and Swan River (1696)  A Quokka family on Rottnest Island, Western Australia The first Europeans known to land on the Rottnest Island were 13 Dutch sailors including Abraham Leeman from the Waeckende Boey who landed near Bathurst Point on 19 March 1658 while their ship was nearby. The ship had sailed from Batavia in search of survivors of the missing Vergulde Draeck which was later found wrecked north near present-day Ledge Point. The island was given the name \\"Rotte nest\\" (meaning \\"rat nest\\" in the 17th century Dutch language) by Dutch captain Willem de Vlamingh who spent six days exploring the island from 29 December 1696, mistaking the quokkas for giant rats. De Vlamingh led a fleet of three ships, De Geelvink, De Nijptang and Weseltje and anchored on the northern side of the island, near The Basin. Willem de Vlamingh's ships, with black swans, at the entrance to the Swan River, Western Australia, coloured engraving (1796), derived from an earlier drawing (now lost) from the de Vlamingh expeditions of 1696‚Äì97. An adult black swan and cygnet. For some 1500 years, the black swan existed in the European imagination as a metaphor for that which could not exist. Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh made the first European record of sighting a black swan in 1697. The sighting was significant in Europe, where \\"all swans are white\\" had long been used as a standard example of a well-known truth. On 10 January 1697, de Vlamingh ventured up the Swan River. He and his crew are believed to have been the first Europeans to do so. He named the Swan River (Zwaanenrivier in Dutch) after the large numbers of black swans that he observed there.  Easter Island and Samoa (1722)  Easter Island is world-famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called moai On Easter Sunday, 5 April 1722, Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen discovered Easter Island. Easter Island is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world. The nearest inhabited land (50 residents) is Pitcairn Island away, the nearest town with a population over 500 is Rikitea on island Mangareva away, and the nearest continental point lies in central Chile, away. The name \\"Easter Island\\" was given by the island's first recorded European visitor, the Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen, who encountered it on Easter Sunday (5 April\\"Calculate the Date of Easter Sunday\\", Astronomical Society of South Australia. Retrieved 7 February 2013.) 1722, while searching for Davis or David's island. Roggeveen named it Paasch-Eyland (18th century Dutch for \\"Easter Island\\").An English translation of the originally Dutch journal by Jacob Roggeveen, with additional significant information from the log by Cornelis Bouwman, was published in: Andrew Sharp (ed.), The Journal of Jacob Roggeveen (Oxford 1970). The island's official Spanish name, Isla de Pascua, also means \\"Easter Island\\". On 13 June Roggeveen discovered the islands of Samoa.  Orange River (1779)  The Orange River was named by Colonel Robert Gordon, commander of the Dutch East India Company garrison at Cape Town, on a trip to the interior in 1779. = Scientific expeditions=  First systematic mapping of southern celestial hemisphere (1595‚Äì1597)  In 1595, Petrus Plancius, a key promoter to the East Indies expeditions, asked Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser, the chief pilot on the Hollandia, to make observations to fill in the blank area around the south celestial pole on European maps of the southern sky. Plancius had instructed Keyser to map the skies in the southern hemisphere, which were largely uncharted at the time. Keyser died in Java the following year but his catalogue of 135 stars, probably measured up with the help of explorer-colleague Frederick de Houtman, was delivered to Plancius, and then those stars were arranged into 12 new southern constellations, letting them be inscribed on a 35-cm celestial globe that was prepared in late 1597 (or early 1598). This globe was produced in collaboration with the Amsterdam cartographer Jodocus Hondius. Plancius's constellations (mostly referring to animals and subjects described in natural history books and travellers' journals of his day) are Apis the Bee (later changed to Musca by Lacaille), Apus the Bird of Paradise, Chamaeleon, Dorado the Goldfish (or Swordfish), Grus the Crane, Hydrus the Small Water Snake, Indus the Indian, Pavo the Peacock, Phoenix, Triangulum Australe the Southern Triangle, Tucana the Toucan, and Volans the Flying Fish. The acceptance of these new constellations was assured when Johann Bayer, a German astronomer, included them in his Uranometria of 1603, the leading star atlas of its day. These 12 southern constellations are still recognized today by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).Ridpath, Ian (1988). Star Tales, p. 9‚Äì10Lankford, John (1997).

Visions of Savage Paradise: Albert Eckcourt, Court Painter in Colonial Dutch Brazil, 1637‚Äì1644Van Groesen, Michiel (2014). The Legacy of Dutch Brazil To that end, Johan Maurits brought from Europe with him a team of artists and scientists who lived in Recife between 1637 and 1644: painter Albert Eckhout (specializing in the human figure), painter Frans Post (landscape painter), natural historian Georg Marcgraf (who also produced drawings and prints), and the physician Willem Piso. Together with Georg Marcgraf, and originally published by Joannes de Laet, Piso wrote the Historia Naturalis Brasiliae (1648), an important early western insight into Brazilian flora and fauna, also is the first scientific book about Brazil. Albert Eckhout, along with the landscape artist Frans Post, was one of two formally trained painters charged with recording the complexity of the local scene. The seven years Eckhout spent in Brazil constitute an invaluable contribution to the understanding of the European colonization of the New World. During his stay he created hundreds of oil sketches ‚Äì mostly from life ‚Äì of the local flora, fauna and people. These paintings by Eckhout and the landscapes by Post were among the Europeans' first, introductions to South America.  First ethnographic descriptions of New Netherland and North American Indians (1641‚Äì1653)  In 1641, Kiliaen van Rensselaer, the director of the Dutch West India Company, hired Adriaen van der Donck (1620‚Äì1655) to be his lawyer for his large, semi-independent estate, Rensselaerswijck, in New Netherland. Until 1645, van der Donck lived in the Upper Hudson River Valley, near Fort Orange (later Albany), where he learned about the Company's fur trade, the Mohawk and Mahican Indians who traded with Dutch, the agriculturist settlers, and the area's plants and animals. In 1649, after a serious disagreement with the new governor, Peter Stuyvesant, he returned to the Dutch Republic to petition Dutch government. In 1653, still in the Netherlands waiting for the government to decide his case, Adriaen van der Donck wrote a comprehensive description of the New Netherland's geography and native peoples based on material in his earlier Remonstrance. The book, Beschryvinge van Nieuw- Nederlant or A Description of New Netherland later published in 1655. This new book was well-crafted to the interests of his audience, consisting of an extensive description of American Indians and their customs, reports on the abundance of the area's agriculture and wealth of its natural resources.Franklin, Wayne (1979).

Description of the New Netherlands = Others =  First non-Asian first-hand account of Korea (1653‚Äì1666)  Jan Weltevree (1595‚Äì?) is regarded as the first naturalized Westerner to Korea. Weltevree was a Dutch sailor who arrived on the shores of an island off Joseon's west coast in 1627 in a shipwreck. The Joseon Dynasty at that time maintained an isolation policy, so the captured foreigner could not leave the country. Weltevree took the name Bak Yeon (also Pak Yeon). He became an important government official and aided King Hyojong with his keen knowledge of modern weaponry. His adventures were recorded in the report by Dutch East India Company accountant Hendrik Hamel.Lach, Donald F.; Van Kley, Edwin J. (1993).

East Asia: A New History, p. 316 Dutch seafarer and VOC's bookkeeper Hendrick Hamel was the first westerner to experience first-hand and write about Korea in Joseon era (1392‚Äì1897). In 1653, Hamel and his men were shipwrecked on Jeju island, and they remained captives in Korea for more than a decade. The Joseon dynasty was often referred to as the \\"Hermit Kingdom\\" for its harsh isolationism and closed borders. The shipwrecked Dutchmen were given some freedom of movement, but were forbidden to leave the country. After thirteen years (1653‚Äì1666), Hamel and seven of his crewmates managed to escape to the VOC trading mission at Dejima (an artificial island in the bay of Nagasaki, Japan), and from there to the Netherlands. In 1666, three different publishers published his report (Journal van de Ongeluckige Voyage van 't Jacht de Sperwer or An account of the shipwreck of a Dutch vessel on the coast of the isle of Quelpaert together with the description of the kingdom of Corea), describing their improbable adventure and giving the first detailed and accurate description of Korea to the western world.Lach, Donald F.; Van Kley, Edwin J.

The seven-minute film is composed entirely of archival footage and features a speech from Fritz Julius Kuhn, the leader of the German American Bund, in which anti-Semitic and pro white- Christian sentiments are espoused. Release and reception The documentary premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2018 and was nominated for the 91st Academy Awards for Best Documentary Short.  Synopsis  The film uses footage from Monday, February 20, 1939, and opens outside Madison Square Garden with shots of the New York City Police Department reining in anti-Nazi counter-protesters along with a marquee that lists a \\"pro-American rally\\" scheduled on that night, above a National Hockey League match and an NCAA Division I college basketball game later in the week. After a procession of flag bearers to a stage decorated with swastika-adorned pennants, U.S. flags, and a portrait of George Washington, a German-accented man leads the audience in the Pledge of Allegiance. Kuhn steps up to the podium and casually remarks about how he is depicted as a \\"creature with horns, a cloven hoof, and long tail\\" by \\"the Jewish-controlled press.\\" As he begins to outline a program calling for a \\"socially-just, white, Gentile-controlled United States\\" and \\"Gentile-controlled labor unions, free from Jewish Moscow-directed domination,\\" a counter-protester rushes on stage in an attempt to attack Kuhn. He is beaten onstage by the Bund's paramilitaries, and as he is hauled away by the police the footage is slowed to focus on him. The footage ends with a rendition of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" by a German-accented woman, before cutting to a title card noting that the rally occurred when Adolf Hitler was overseeing construction of Nazi Germany's sixth concentration camp and seven months before the German invasion of Poland and the beginning of World War II.  Background  The documentary was produced using footage of the rally originally intended for newsreels that had never been widely issued due to its controversial content. Many film exhibitors avoided footage of Hitler and Nazism due to strongly negative reactions and even disorderly conduct from audiences. News of the Day never released its footage, while RKO-Path√© News quickly withdrew a newsreel incorporating the footage after deeming it \\"too inflammatory.\\" As a result, the rally was widely forgotten after the end of World War II. After viewing the footage and expressing surprise at the event's obscurity, Curry was inspired to produce the documentary by the rise of the alt-right in the United States and the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The footage was retrieved and edited from the National Archives, the Grinberg Film Library, Streamline Films, and the UCLA Film and Television Archive.

After graduating with her Bachelor of Education in Chemistry and Mathematics as well as her Bachelor of Science in Chemistry with honors in atmospheric chemistry, Hornbrook began her Doctor of Philosophy in Chemistry at York University. Throughout her graduate education, she worked alongside Jochen Rudolph conducting research on Volatile organic compounds and their role in the chemistry of the troposphere. Hornbrook published a total of seven papers before graduating with her Ph.D in chemistry from York University in 2005. Hornbrook is the recipient of two Governor General's Academic Medals which are awarded to the student who graduates a Canadian school with the highest grades. She was awarded the Gold Medal in 2006 for her Ph.D dissertation completed the year before at York University and the Bronze Medal in 1994 while attending Innisdale Secondary School.  Career at NCAR and field campaigns  After obtaining her Ph.D, Hornbrook accepted a position at NCAR where she currently serves as a Project Scientist II. Hornbrook has been a part of various groups and has received funding from both the National Science Foundation and NASA. Hornbrook has completed research in locations worldwide as well as the United States. = Research in the United States = Hornbrook's work in the United States has focused on VOCs and air quality in specific regions. Most recently, Hornbrook was a part of the WE-CAN project which studied the effects of wildfires on air quality and the atmosphere. Wildfires have been a topic of interest to Hornbrook as one of her authored papers, Observations of nonmethane organic compounds during ARCTAS - Part 1: Biomass burning emissions and plume enhancements, focuses on the effects of wildfires on air quality at distances further away from the fires. Hornbrook has also contributed to increasing the understanding of anthropogenic emissions in the United States by focusing on VOCs and chemical changes of the atmosphere. In 2018, Hornbrook began to work as a part of the NASA ATom project which was part of the larger goal to prepare for the potential effects of global climate change. Her authored poster, as a result of the project, details the observations made of how the upper troposphere reacts with VOCs emitted by humans. WINTER was a 2015 project based out of northern Virginia that had an emphasis on looking at emissions in the northeastern United States and their effect on pollution over the region as well as the Atlantic Ocean. In 2013, Hornbrook contributed to the NOMADSS project which focused on looking at the effects of anthropogenic emissions in Chicago, Illinois and Gary, Indiana concluding that these emissions led to an increase of mercury in the area. A significant amount of Hornbrook's research has taken place in the Colorado Front Range. The BEACHON-ROCS study took place at the Manitou Forest Observatory in August, 2010 in order to understand reactive organic gases which can help model the atmosphere's oxidation capacity. The 2014 FRAPPE project was another Colorado based project that took a look at air quality in the Colorado Front Range and was partially funded by the state of Colorado. Hornbrook's research helped to understand how some weather patterns are more likely to retain aerosols than other weather patterns. Hornbrook gave a presentation at the Gordon Research Conference where she presented a poster about VOC observations during the FRAPPE project in the Colorado Front Range. Prior to the FRAPPE project, Hornbrook worked on DC3 in Kansas, an airborne campaign which focused on how convective clouds interact with the upper troposphere at mid latitudes. Hornbrook's group observed that the storms observed possessed a logical relationship on a chemical level. In 2009, Hornbrook conducted research in Barrow, Alaska as part of the OASIS-2009 campaign (Ocean-Atmosphere-Sea Ice-Snowpack). As part of a larger team, Hornbrook focused on studying VOCs as well as seasonal trends and oxidization events in the arctic. The research concluded that arctic seasonality does have an effect on the chemistry of the atmosphere. OASIS-2009 also provided a large set of data from the arctic that could be used for future analysis. = International research = Hornbrook is active in international projects that work to understand the atmosphere in a variety of locations. Hornbrook was a part of the 2016 ORCAS campaign by assisting with measuring TOGA reactive gases in the airborne study over the Southern Ocean. The study took a look at carbon dioxide and oxygen's behavior interacting with the Southern Ocean which is one of the most remote oceans on the planet. At the 2016 International Global Atmospheric Chemistry meeting, Hornbrook gave a poster presentation regarding the findings of the ORCAS project specific to VOC observations. In the early part of 2012, Hornbrook began to work on the TORERO campaign in order to study reactive halogen gases and VOCs in the Tropical Eastern Pacific Ocean. The study was an airborne campaign which took data at various altitudes in order to learn more about atmospheric oxidization capacities at differing altitudes in tropical regions. Hornbrook's contributions to the project increased the understanding of VOCs in the studied area off of the South American Coast. Hornbrook continued to work to understand the atmosphere in tropical locations. The 2014 CONTRAST took place in Guam with the goal of learning how convection in a tropical setting can effect the movement of atmospheric gases. = TOGA group and instrumentation = 2009 marked Hornbrook's first year with the Trace Organic Gas Analyzer (TOGA) team. Based out of NCAR, the TOGA team worked on creating instrumentation to improve the measurement of mixing ratios of different VOCs. In 2011, Hornbrook authored a paper detailing a new method to measure HO2 and RO2 while better separating the two differing compounds. The method proved to be effective at measuring VOCs and trace organic gases in both group based and airborne studies. The instrumentation dramatically increased the ability to detect trace organic gases by almost tripling the amount of compounds that are able to be measured.  Other involvement  Hornbrook is very involved in helping women realize their potential in STEM and enter STEM fields. She has served as a mentor for the PROGRESS campaign (Promoting Geoscience Research Education and Success) which pairs women with an interest in geosciences with a mentor in a geoscience field. In 2016, Hornbrook also visited Mackintosh Academy in Boulder, Colorado to run a workshop for girls in science. Hornbrook has also served as a mentor for the Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science (SOARS) program. The program works to help students from underrepresented groups have an opportunity to conduct research related to atmospheric sciences.

The regency is the government of a State during the minor age, absence or incapacity of its legitimate prince.  First Regency  After the entry of the Trigarante Army, or the Army of the Three Guarantees on September 27, 1821, the viceregal government was dissolved and the Independence of Mexico was consumed, so on September 28, 1821, a Provisional Government Junta was installed, whose members took the oath and decreed the Act of Independence to confirm the freedom and sovereignty of Mexico. Agustin de Iturbide was unanimously elected as President of the Junta. The Junta constituted the Regency of the Mexican Empire in the night session of September 28, 1821 with 5 members, which would exercise the Executive Power, selecting Iturbide as president, and secretaries to Juan O'Donoj√∫ (replaced by Antonio Joaqu√≠n P√©rez Mart√≠nez on 8 of October when he died), Manuel de la B√°rcena, Jos√© Isidro Ya√±ez and Manuel Vel√°zquez de Le√≥n, who had been secretary of the viceroyalty. Once the Junta realized that Agust√≠n de Iturbide had been also elected president in the Regency, Antonio Joaqu√≠n P√©rez Mart√≠nez, the Bishop of Puebla was elected as the new president of the Junta, so then the \\"Executive Power\\" resided in the Regency and the \\"Legislative Power\\" in the Provisional Government Junta until the formation of a Constituent Congress. The Plan of Iguala stipulated a monarchical- constitutional government by a Congress. On the night of May 18, 1822, by popular acclamation, he reached the doors of the Iturbide house, now known as the Palace of Iturbide in Mexico City, to ask him to take the throne. On May 19, 1822 the Congress met, where Agust√≠n de Iturbide said that he would be subject to what the deputies, representatives of the people, decided, while the people cheered. The deputies Alcocer, Guti√©rrez, Ansorena, Ter√°n, Rivas, San Mart√≠n and others, faced the popular excitement trying that at least, the pronouncement was legalized by means of a plebiscite. The deputy Valent√≠n G√≥mez Far√≠as, supported by 46 deputies, said that once the Treaty of C√≥rdoba and the Plan of Iguala had been broken - since they had not been accepted in Spain - it was up to the deputies to cast their vote for Iturbide to be declared Emperor of Mexico. G√≥mez Far√≠as added that he should be obliged to obey the Constitution, laws, orders and decrees issued by the Mexican Congress. The deputies began to debate in the midst of shouts and interruptions, then, proceeded to the vote. Iturbide was elected by 67 votes against 15. The crowd cheered the result and accompanied the generalissimo cheering him from Congress to his residence. By popular desire and by legitimate decision of the Congress, Agustin de Iturbide was proclaimed Constitutional Emperor of Mexico as Agust√≠n I of Mexico. The principal objectives of the Plan of Iguala were called \\"the Three Guarantees\\", and these were: \\"independence, union and religion of all races of the nation\\". A new army, called the Trigarante Army, would be in charge of carrying out this plan and would be identified with a new flag. The Plan of Iguala was an act of political agreement, intensely complex in its consequences, although simple in its phrasing, which united conservatives and liberals, rebels and realists, and Creoles and Spaniards. It consisted of 23 articles, and it had something for everyone: article 1, for example, declared that the religion of the nation would be the Roman Apostolic catholic, without tolerance of other religion. Article 2, the independence of the nation and Article 3, advocated the establishment of a Mexican monarchy regulated by a constitution. = First Council of the Regency (1821-1822) = * Agust√≠n de Iturbide, President (September 28, 1821 - April 11, 1822) * Juan O'Donoj√∫ (September 28, 1821 - October 8, 1821) replaced after his death by Antonio P√©rez Mart√≠nez y Robles (October 9, 1821 - April 11, 1822) * Manuel de la B√°rcena (September 28, 1821 - April 11, 1822) * Jos√© Isidro Ya√±ez y Nu√±o (September 28, 1821 - April 11, 1822) * Manuel Vel√°zquez de Le√≥n y P√©rez (September 28, 1821 - April 11, 1822) = Second Council of the Regency (1822-1822) = * Agust√≠n de Iturbide, President (April 11, 1822 - May 18, 1822) * Jos√© Isidro Ya√±ez y Nu√±o (April 11, 1822 - May 18, 1822) * Miguel Valent√≠n y Tamayo (April 11, 1822 - May 18, 1822) * Manuel de Heras Soto (April 11, 1822 - May 18, 1822) * Nicol√°s Bravo (April 11, 1822 - May 18, 1822)  Second Regency  At the end of the War of Reform, President Benito Ju√°rez decreed the suspension of all public debts on July 17, 1861 and annul any possible payment such as the Mon-Almonte Treaty, promulgated in Paris between Alejandro Mon and Juan Nepomuceno Almonte for the ratification by monetary payments to delayed debts of Spain and by the murders of Spaniards in San VicenteTreaty Mon-Almonte. UANL PDFcdigital and San Dimas, including those contracted with the foreign nations, being a very remarkable fact, because it was the determining cause of the arrival in Mexico of the representatives from England, France and Spain, with their respective armies to demand the payment of their respective debts, for this reason, 51 deputies asked for the resignation of Benito Ju√°rez as president and to promote Jes√∫s Gonz√°lez Ortega as the new President of Mexico, but another 54 deputies asked Benito Juarez not to resign, while the War and Foreign Secretaries of Benito Ju√°rez dismissed all the conservatives abroad on behalf of the Mexican legation just after President Miguel Miram√≥n and his secretaries traveled to Europe to meet with the French emperor Napoleon III, among the delegates dismissed by Benito Ju√°rez were Juan Nepomuceno Almonte and Jos√© Manuel Hidalgo. Meanwhile, England and France broke relations with the liberal Mexican government of Benito Ju√°rez, while the conservative Mexican government by Jos√© Manuel Hidalgo, Juan Nepomuceno Almonte and Jos√© Mar√≠a Guti√©rrez de Estrada got the first steps to establish a monarchy in Mexico with Maximilian of Habsburg as Emperor of Mexico. Juan Nepomuceno Almonte arrives in Spain to visit the Minister of Justice Fernando Calder√≥n to inform him about the establishment of the monarchy in Mexico and the candidacy of Maximilian, so he arrived in France a few days later to visit Maximilian at his Castle of Miramar, where Maximilian entrusted activities for his return to Mexico on March 1, 1862, thus achieving the arrival of French ships and the immediate departure of Benito Juarez with his army and most of the Liberal residents of the capital of the Republic. The Superior Government Junta was created on June 21, 1863 from the conservative governments parallel to the Benito Ju√°rez Liberal Government, which appointed General Juan Nepomuceno Almonte, Jos√© Ignacio Pav√≥n, Jos√© Mariano Salas and the \\"Executive Power\\" to the Archbishop of Mexico Pelagio Antonio de Labastida who, in less than two months, was dismissed from office because of the struggles he had with the French authorities and with Almonte who did not wait. The prelate manifested himself soon in his disagreements, especially his intention to prevent the ratification of the rights of sale of ecclesiastical property. This triumvirate assumed the role of the Regency of the Second Mexican Empire by decree on July 11, 1863. = Third Council of the Regency = * Juan Nepomuceno Almonte, President (July 11, 1863 - May 20, 1864) * Jos√© Mariano Salas (July 11, 1863 - May 20, 1864) * Pelagio Antonio de Labastida (July 11, 1863 - November 17, 1863) replaced by Juan Bautista de Ormaechea, Bishop of Tulancingo (November 17, 1863 - May 20, 1864) * Jos√© Ignacio Pav√≥n (July 11, 1863 - January 2, 1864) dismissed for disobeying the orders of the Regency in relation to the nationalization and confiscation of church property.

She made one voyage to Africa during which she was captured and recaptured and then became a slave ship. She made one voyage to the West Indies as a merchant ship, and one voyage as a whaler, but was damaged in 1801 as she returned home from that whaling voyage and apparently never sailed again.

African Queen had been on a direct voyage (for wood, ivory, and palm oil for Britain), not gathering slaves for the West Indies. Slave voyage: Rather than returning to Bristol, African Queen commenced slave trading. She gathered her slaves at Cape Coast Castle. She arrived at Demerara on 7 June 1798. She arrived with 313 slaves and she landed 49 at Demerara. She then sailed to St Vincent, where she arrived on 26 June, and landed the remaining 264. She returned to Bristol on 18 September.

While outward bound African Queen lost two boats and five men in a storm near Trinidad. In April 1800 she stopped at Rio de Janeiro to get sailors, and wood to replace the lost boats.

Formal campaign announcements play an important role in United States presidential elections, particularly in shaping the start of a campaign season. They became more significant with the introduction of presidential primaries (as opposed to state caucuses) in the early 20th century. The expression to \\"throw one's hat in the ring\\", describing a challenger in boxing, was popularized by the Theodore Roosevelt 1912 presidential campaign. There has been a trend of announcements coming earlier, and even being preceded by an invisible primary phase and often as a first public step by an exploratory committee. A pledge to not run, the opposite of a campaign announcement, is known as a Shermanesque statement. Factors The timing of announcements has to balance aspects of first-mover advantage, name recognition, political momentum, and campaign fundraising for early or late entrants. Frontrunners generally have more reason to delay announcing. Financial rules from the Federal Elections Commission also disincentivize candidates from clearly stating their intentions early. Notable late outsider efforts include the Robert F. Kennedy 1968 presidential campaign and the Jesse Jackson 1984 presidential campaign. Presidential announcements took new social media political forms in the 2012 and 2016 campaigns. The ambiguity of waiting for formal announcements for US elections in general has been criticized. The Ross Perot 1992 presidential campaign had been de facto active as an independent campaign with a conditional announcement statement on Larry King Live (a talk show first), before the candidate withdrew, and then re-entered and formally announced only a month before the election. Sometimes an announcement will be delayed until considerably after the primary campaign has been underway. Examples include the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign and the Pete Buttigieg 2020 presidential campaign. In 2020, Congressman Justin Amash formed an exploratory committee but decided not to run as an Independent. The John Delaney 2020 presidential campaign announcement on July 28, 2017, is thought to be the earliest by a serious candidate for at least 45 years.

Moritz v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 469 F.2d 466 (1972), was a case before the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in which the Court held that discrimination on the basis of sex constitutes a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. Charles Moritz had claimed a tax deduction for the cost of a caregiver for his invalid mother and the Internal Revenue Service had denied the deduction. The law specifically allowed such a deduction, but only for women and formerly married men, which Moritz was not. The United States Tax Court agreed with the IRS's decision to deny the deduction, but on appeal the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that decision, holding that the tax code conflicted with the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution and extending the caregiver deduction to never-married men. Background =Section 214= During the 1968 tax year, Section 214 of the Internal Revenue Code provided that certain taxpayers could claim a tax deduction for expenses relating to the care of the taxpayer's dependent: > Sec. 214. Expenses for care of certain dependents (a) General rule.-There > shall be allowed as a deduction expenses paid during the taxable year by a > taxpayer who is a woman or widower, or is a husband whose wife is > incapacitated or is institutionalized, for the care of one or more > dependents (as defined in subsection (d) (1)), but only if such care is for > the purpose of enabling the taxpayer to be gainfully employed. ... (d) > Definitions.-For purposes of this section- ... (2) Widower.-The term > 'widower' includes an unmarried individual who is legally separated from his > spouse under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance. Under the terms of the statute, only \\"a woman or widower, or is a husband whose wife is incapacitated or is institutionalized,\\" was eligible for the deduction. =Facts and prior history= In 1968, Charles Moritz, a never- married man, claimed a tax deduction under Section 214 for the salary of a caregiver he hired to care for his mother. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) disallowed the deduction on the grounds that Moritz was not a woman and had never been married, making him ineligible for the caregiver deduction. Moritz petitioned the United States Tax Court, asking the court to overrule the IRS and hold that he was entitled to the deduction. On October 22, 1970, the Tax Court denied his petition, holding that he was not covered by the statute and rejecting his argument that denial of the deduction was unconstitutional.Moritz v. Commissioner, 55 T.C. 113 (1970) Moritz appealed the Tax Court's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. On appeal, he was represented by Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her husband, Martin D. Ginsburg, aided by Melvin Wulf of the American Civil Liberties Union. They argued that Moritz would have been allowed the deduction if he were female and that there was no rational basis for the difference in treatment between men and women in this case. Therefore, they argued, the denial of the deduction constituted discrimination based on gender and an unconstitutional denial of equal protection in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. They also argued that the appropriate remedy was to allow unmarried men the deduction rather than strike down the entire Section 214, thereby eliminating the dependent care deduction for everyone. The government's response included a computer-generated listing of hundreds of laws that included sex-based criteria which might be at risk if the Section 214 restriction were struck down. Opinion of the Court In a unanimous opinion by Circuit Judge William Judson Holloway Jr., the court first rejected the government's claim that Moritz had not established that the care he gave was \\"for the purpose of enabling the taxpayer to be gainfully employed.\\" The government had argued that Moritz would not have been able to provide the care even if he was not working. The court ruled that earlier stipulations had established that purpose and that, anyway, the care being given was not so specialized that Moritz could not provide it. It next held that the classification by gender was \\"an invidious discrimination and invalid under due process principles. It is not one having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation dealing with the amelioration of burdens on the taxpayer,\\" citing Reed v. Reed. Finally the court agreed that \\"extending the coverage of the deduction provisions seems logical and proper, in view of their purpose and the broad separability clause in the act.\\"Moritz v. Commissioner, 469 F.2d 466 (10th Cir. 1972) Subsequent history In 1971, Section 214 was amended to allow all \\"individuals\\" to deduct dependent care expenses regardless of sex or marital history. However, the change was not made retroactive., ¬ß 210(a) (1971). Following the Tenth Circuit's decision, the Internal Revenue Service recommended \\"[t]hat a petition for writ of certiorari [a request that the Supreme Court hear an appeal from the case] not be filed\\", but the Department of Justice nonetheless petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari. On May 21, 1973, the Supreme Court denied the petition, declining to review the Tenth Circuit's decision.IRS Action on Decision 1978-19, 1977 AOD LEXIS 44 (November 11, 1977). This case was the first time any provision in the Internal Revenue Code was overturned as unconstitutional. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who represented Moritz before the 10th Circuit, was appointed an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States in 1993. The 2018 film On the Basis of Sex, based on Ginsburg's life and early career, focuses on Ginsburg's representation of Moritz in this case.

It was constructed as a mansion in 1858. In 1881, it opened as a hotel.  History =Palace= This building was originally constructed as a city palace in 1858 for William Thierry, baron Van Brienen van de Groote Lindt, a personal advisor of king William III who often stayed in The Hague. The baron purchased three houses located at the Lange Voorhout and the Vos in Tuinstraat and had them demolished. One of these buildings, which was towards the back of the current building, was home to the museum dedicated to King William II. On this newly combined lot, he commission the construction of a new palace by architect Arend Roodenburg for a total sum of 150.000 guilders. The baron wanted a palace in the political capitol of The Netherlands for throwing parties and receptions. The mansion featured a spacious inner court, stables, residences for private guests and servants, and a ballroom. Originally one could enter with a horse-drawn carriage through the main entrance and have the carriage turn around, ready for departure, in the still- existing rotunda, which is now used as a tea room. After the passing of the baron in 1863 the palace was inherited by his son Arnold, who found it too big for his needs and sold it a few years later. The palace became the property of hotelier Fran√ßois Paulez, who gifted it to his daughter Alegonda. Together with her husband Friedrich Wirtz she converted it into a hotel. Wirtz would become the first General Manager of the hotel. =Hotel= Grand Opening The palace underwent four years of renovations and conversions to be opened on May 1, 1881 by prince Frederik, uncle of the king William III. It was named after then-famous Hotel des Indes (des Indes meaning Of the Indies) in Batavia hoping to attract travellers from the Dutch East Indies. On the facade of the building, the family coat of arms was replaced by the coat of arms of Batavia. The hotel started of with 120 rooms and only one bathroom per floor, which was a luxury for its time. The hotel soon was reputed for its fine elegance. The start-up years saw many extravagant parties and exclusive banquets, but also a few harsh years. However, when in 1899 tsar Nicholas II of Russia initiated the first International Peace Conference of The Hague, the attendance of the many international leaders of governments and diplomats caused quite the upswing. In 1894, manager Wirtz took over the Oranjehotel in the Scheveningen district of The Hague. The Hotel des Indes was placed under a newly created public company, Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Hotel des Indes nv, and Christian Haller, who used to work at London's famous Savoy Hotel, became the new General Manager. It was him who managed to get Hotel des Indes to become the official hotel for the 1899 Hague Peace Conference after a long battle with other hotels in the city, which caused the hotel to become a famous \\"home away from home\\" for many international diplomats, royals, artists and scholars. Haller also invested heavily in innovation: by 1900 he had telephones, an intercom system connected to the front desk, bath tubs and washing stands featuring both hot and cold water installed in all rooms. In 1902, a hydraulic elevator was installed that ran on the pressure from the city's waterworks and architect Foek Kuipers was contracted to transform the inner court into a hall with a formal staircase and a large glass dome to cover the rotunda. Between World Wars The First World War was disastrous for business. By 1918, the hotel was in so much financial trouble that Haller decided to sell all the assets of the company. These were bought at the price of 1,25M guilders by the Nederlandsche Uitvoer Maatschappij, who planned to convert the hotel into an office building. This caused an outrage among citizens that wanted to keep the prestigious hotel. Notably due to pressure of mayor Patijn, the Dutch government was persuaded to take over the hotel. The transaction took place on May 2, 1919, for the then-spectacular price of 1.335.071 guilders and 19¬Ω cents. The government wanted a large building on stand by that could instantly be used as crisis offices. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs liked the idea of having a large luxury hotel at their disposal. Despite that the government would own this building for decades to come, it continued to be operated as a hotel and Haller's wife, Mrs. Haller-Rey, and her brother, Mr. Henry Rey, both Mon√©gasque. Mr. Rey was also Consul General of Monaco to The Hague and becomes sole director of the hotel in 1922. In 1925 the hotel innovates once more by offering a gigolo. In that time, it was simply a male dancer who would entertain unmarried female guests; only later the image of the gigolo changed to the more extreme version of entertainment. The 1930s started with some negative events. On January 23, 1931, ballerina Anna Pavlova died in her room (where now the reception area stands) from pneumonia. A salon on the ground floor was later renamed after her. A few months later, while hosting the celebrations for the 73rd birthday of Queen Mother Emma, the wiring for some of the lighting installed for the event had a short circuit and caused a fire that gutted the third floor and damaged the roof. Rey seized the opportunity during the reconstruction to add a fourth floor that was once planned but, up until then, never realized. The Great Depression eventually also affects the hotel and the government needs to chip in once more to keep the doors open. World War II When World War II breaks out, Henry Rey and his wife try to flee to England. Rey and his two children succeed, but his wife was killed by Dutch forces that mistakenly opened fire on the car near the harbour of Hoek van Holland. On May 1, 1940, the German ambassador, Julius von Zech-Burkersroda, and his staff were brought to the hotel as prisoners of war and were guarded for a full two weeks. On May 15, Henri Winkelman brought the news that The Netherlands had capitulated. During the rest of the war, the Hotel Des Indes was a popular meeting place for the German occupiers in The Hague and is the Dutch headquarters for the Wehrmacht High Command. Deputy Manager Van der Wert, who was working at the hotel from 1923 until 1968, ran the place in Rey's absence. Although Henri Rey died in England in 1942, his pigeon house on the roof of the hotel survives. Here the hotel management brought a small group of Jews to hide from prosecution during the Holocaust; they all survived the war. Post-WWII difficulties After the war, Jean Jacques Rey, the son of Henri Rey, moved to The Netherlands after leaving the RAF as a pilot and took over management of Hotel Des Indes in 1946. He also followed in his father's footsteps as Consul General of Monaco. He transformed the pigeon house in a room for his model trains which also figured a large flag of Monaco. The fifties and sixties see a lot of changes for the tourism industry. Travellers are looking for more modern accommodations and Hotel Des Indes sees their number of guests diminish. Rey did manage to re-establish a stable clientele with some innovative changes to the hotel, but it would not be enough. In 1971 the hotel announces that they would have to close their doors. Prime minister Biesheuvel, who was a regular dining guest, alongside other politicians, such as Norbert Schmelzer and Arnold Tilanus, would have a last official dinner with his ministers on October 27, 1971. The three gentlemen decided to contact their private networks to save the hotel. They convinced entrepreneur Julius Verwoerdt to take over the management. Verwoerdt buys the building back from the Dutch government for 1.380.000 guilders and contracts construction coordinator Altkemper for an intense renovation. Some notable changes are the old coal-burning stove that got removed from the kitchen, the replacement of the hardly-working central (steam) heating system, the replacement of all electric infrastructure, include wiring, the iconic central hall got rejuvenated and all rooms were renewed. In 1979 Verwoerdt sells all of his actions of his company (which has grown to be a small hotel empire, counting 13 hotels) to the hotel subsidiary of UK-based Bass Breweries, Crest Hotels. In the 70's and 80's, the hotel is the theatre of a series of tripartisan meetings to discuss then-controversial topics such as gay marriage, abortion and euthanasia, which were a taboo to discuss in parliament at the time. These meetings were later nicknamed The Des-Indes Deliberations and eventually led to the first \\"Purple\\" cabinet of the Netherlands.  The Era of Hotel Chains  In 1990, the Inter-Continental Group, which had already been entrusted with the management of the hotel since 1975, buys the all the assets of the hotel for 37,5M guilders, only to put it back up for sale a year later. A chairman of the company explains that the company worries it can't earn back the money they need to invest in the property, as the main clientele is made up of diplomats that are bound by strict budgets and so the company prefers to invest in the Amstel Hotel in Amsterdam, where the more-corporate clientele has less issues with higher room rates. The chain will continue to manage the hotel until 2000. In late 2002, Le M√©ridien Hotels & Resorts assumed management for the hotel. In 2004‚Äì2005 the hotel received a new major renovation worth ‚Ç¨28M. The new interior was designed by the French interior architect Jacques Garcia. Another floor was added, a few meters set back from the facade, and the white facade is painted yellow. After Le M√©ridien was acquired by Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, the hotel re-opened in November 2005 under the banner of The Luxury Collection. In 2015, the hotel was sold to the Canadian Westmont Hospitality Group, which also owns the Bel Air Hotel in The Hague. In December 2018, the hotel announced that it ended its management contract with Starwood, which had merged with Marriott International a few years earlier. The hotel has become part of the smaller The Leading Hotels of the World chain of luxury hotels.

The leaves are hairy, linear to narrow lance- shaped, usually long, wide, mostly smooth on the upper surface and have a raised midvein on the lower surface. The flowers are arranged singly in upper leaf axils with leaf-like bracts and leafy, narrow lance-shaped bracteoles long at their base. The sepals are joined for less than half their length to form a bell-shaped tube with five lance-shaped, hairy lobes long. The five petals are off-white, long and joined to form a bell-like tube with five lobes on the end. The two upper lobes have dark purple streaks and are long and smaller than the lower lobes. The lower middle lobe is larger than the others. The outer part of the petal tube and lobes are hairy and there is a dense hairy ring below the stamens. The four stamens extend slightly beyond the end of the tube, the lower pair slightly longer than the other one. Flowering occurs mainly from February to June and is followed by an oval-shaped, slightly wrinkled fruit long and about wide. Taxonomy and naming Pityrodia puberula was first formally described in 1979 by Ahmad Abid Munir from a specimen collected near Mount Cahill in Arnhem Land. The description was published in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens. Distribution This pityrodia occurs in Arnhem Land including in the Kakadu National Park and Nitmiluk National Park .

Early life He was the son of Josiah Dwight Ripley and Julia Elizabeth (n√©e Dillon) Ripley. After his father's death, his mother remarried to Gilman Smith Moulton on March 1, 1894. His younger brothers were Harry Dillon Ripley and Louis Arthur Dillon Ripley, the father of Julie Ripley Forman (founder of the Forman School), and Sidney Dillon Ripley II, an ornithologist who served as Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and married Mary Livingston of the prominent Livingston family. His paternal grandfather was Sidney Dillon, the financier and builder of the Union Pacific Railroad who served as its first president. Following his grandfather's death, who left an estate valued at $6,000,000, he received bequests giving him an annual income of $60,000. Dillon came \\"from several Colonial families of Massachusetts and Connecticut. His American ancestor was William Ripley, who, with his wife, two sons and two daughters, came in one of the earliest companies of Colonists from Hingham, Norfolk County, England, and settled in Hingham, Massachusetts in 1638.\\" Career Beginning in 1885, Ripley worked for The Equitable Life Assurance Society, eventually serving as the corporate treasurer and a director for 13 years. He also served as a director of the First National Bank of Hemstead, L.I., the Manganese Steele Safe Company, the Mercantile Trust Company, the Mount Morris Bank, and the Taylor Iron and Steel Company. =Society life= In 1892, Ripley and his wife were both included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. He was a member of the Meadow Brook Hunt Club, the Metropolitan Club, the Chamber of Commerce, the New York Zoological Society, the New York Mycological Society, the Coney Island Jockey Club, the University Club, the Lawyers' Club, the Racquet Club, the Country Club, the South Side Sportsmen's Club, the Rockaway Hunting Club, the Automobile Club and the Turf and Field Clubs. =Residences= East 79th Street, designed by Warren & Wetmore. The Ripley's had a 48-room country home in Hempstead on Long Island (which is today across from Hofstra University at California and Fulton Avenues), known as \\"Crossways.\\" In 1901, Ripley had commissioned Warren & Wetmore them a 35-wide mansion in New York's Upper East Side at 16 East 79th Street. The five-story brick-and-limestone Georgian home, that featured a columned portico and two-step porch, was completed shortly before his death in 1905. In 1912, his widow sold their New York City residence, which was described by The New York Times as the \\"dwelling occupies a plot 35 by 102.2 feet in the choicest upper Fifth Avenue residential section\\", for $400,000. After she sold the residence, she moved to 101 East 72nd Street.  Personal life  On October 14, 1885, Ripley was married to Mary Baldwin Hyde (1867‚Äì1938). Mary was the daughter of Henry Baldwin Hyde, the founder of Equitable Life Assurance, and Annie (n√©e Fitch) Hyde, and the sister of James Hazen Hyde. Together, they were the parents of: * Annah Dillon Ripley (1886‚Äì1963), who married Count Pierre Joseph de Viel Castel (1875‚Äì1950), in 1910. They lived at 4 Avenue Marceau in Paris. * Henry Baldwin Hyde Ripley (‚Äì1959), who married Lesley Frederica Pearson, daughter of Commander Frederick Pearson and grand-niece of James Cook Ayer, in 1919. * Sidney Dillon Ripley Jr. (1891‚Äì1970), a prominent real‚Äêestate broker who married Betsy Ann Sherry. * James Hazen Ripley (‚Äì1977), who married Marguerite Doubleday (1901‚Äì1932) in 1925. After his first wife's death, he remarried to Gladys Livermore in 1934. In 1895, Ripley and James Lorillard Kernochan (son of James Powell Kernochan) were arrested in Hempstead for playing golf, on a Sunday, on the greens opposite the clubhouse at the Meadow Brook Hunt Club. In 1899, he urged his brother, Harry Dillon Ripley, to take charge of his financial affairs after Hyde had run into debt of $100,000.

The poem belongs among Roethke's series of \\"Greenhouse Poems\\" the first section of The Lost Son, a sequence hailed as \\"one of the permanent achievements of modern poetry\\" and marked as the point of Roethke's metamorphosis from a minor poet into one of \\"the first importance\\", into the poet James Dickey would regard among the greatest of any in American history. Roethke grew up in Saginaw, Michigan, where his father, Otto, owned a 25-acre greenhouse. Roethke, in his letters, described the greenhouse as his \\"symbol for the whole of life, a womb, a heaven-on-earth\\". Roethke's father died when Roethke was fourteen, the same year his uncle committed suicide, a circumstance which looms behind Roethke's conception of the greenhouse. Within a greenhouse, the root cellar functions to keep roots alive, allowing them to grow in this underground structure. Roethke vividly portrays the root cellar in \\"a violent inferno of creation\\".  Poem  \\"Root Cellar\\" saw publication before The Lost Son, in the November 1943 issue of Poetry, under the title \\"Florist's Root Cellar\\". Generally, discourse and anthologies use the later The Lost Son title, \\"Root Cellar\\".  Text  Nothing would sleep in that cellar, dank as a ditch, Bulbs broke out of boxes hunting for chinks in the dark, Shoots dangled and drooped, Lolling obscenely from mildewed crates, Hung down long yellow evil necks, like tropical snakes. And what a congress of stinks!- Roots ripe as old bait, Pulpy stems, rank, silo-rich, Leaf-mold, manure, lime, piled against slippery planks. Nothing would give up life: Even the dirt kept breathing a small breath.  Structure  In eleven lines of free verse, \\"Root Cellar\\" consists almost in its entirety of images of the root cellar. The poem highlights the \\"dank\\" humidity of its setting and engages with a range of the reader's senses. The verse abounds with dynamic visual imagery of the roots, bulbs, and stems practically growing before the eyes of the speaker. The olfactory imagery of the cellar's rankness, presented largely in a litany following the sixth line, blends with the tactile nature of the \\"slippery planks\\" in the ninth line. Strong stresses and spondees, emphasized by consistent alliteration and slant rhymes, evince the same action and vitality in language that the speaker of the poem perceives in the vegetation of the cellar. Roethke leverages the free verse form to achieve an extreme \\"manipulation of vowel and consonant\\" sounds. The \\"parallel clauses\\" of the first and tenth lines, both beginning \\"Nothing would,\\" create a frame for the poem. This frame structure makes an \\"etymological pun\\" on the word cellar, deriving from the Latin cella, broadly meaning \\"room,\\" thus mirroring the setting of the poem in its construction as a poem of containment. Cella is also the root also for \\"cell,\\" \\"the unit of life and growth.\\" Roethke's metaphors exist \\"both tenor and vehicle\\" in the realm of the concrete and the natural. From this physical world, the poem asks the reader to draw out the abstractions themselves, refusing to supply much in the way of interpretation within its verse. This dynamic creates a relationship between the reader and the poem of almost equal parts, inviting the reader to \\"join in the act of creation\\" by synthesizing an individual meaning on the part of the reader within the world of the poem. This experience of living in the imagery of the poem, of stepping into the root cellar and contemplating its intricacies, mirrors the boyhood of Roethke in his father's greenhouse.  Themes  In reflection, Roethke described the greenhouse as \\"both heaven and hell\\".Roethke, Theodore (30 July 1953). \\"An American Poet Introduces Himself And His Poems\\". BBC Broadcast. The imagery of \\"Root Cellar\\", with adjectives such as \\"obscenely\\" and \\"evil\\" in lines four and five, complicate the fecund nature of the greenhouse, oscillating \\"between the extremes of grave and nest\\". There seems to exist the notion of \\"danger and uncertain sexual forces\\", making \\"the procreative\\" threatening. The speaker wrestles with the unrelenting impulse of the vegetation to persist in living. The sheer force with which the life of the root cellar endures becomes \\"terrifying and perverse\\", forcing the reader to confront the \\"complexity and trauma of survival in the aftermath of birth\\". Perhaps, the meaning in this poem rests entirely within its verbs, the \\"energy\\" the poem conveys its merit, within its \\"chaos of aimless and bewildering multiplicity\\". This energy filters through and is reflected by the reader, with whom the task of interpreting the poem's imagistic action lies.  Critical response  \\"Root Cellar\\", among the other \\"Greenhouse Poems\\", earned considerable critical praise. As Blessing establishes, \\"almost everyone agrees\\" that the greenhouse poems \\"contain some of the finest poems that Roethke ever wrote\\". However, as these poems leave the possibility for interpretation largely wide open, critics have come to a range of conclusions as to how \\"Root Cellar\\" and the other greenhouse poems should be considered. Some critics, such as Wolff in his short article on \\"Root Cellar\\", project biographical information about Roethke onto the verse, perceiving the \\"rejected child's need for parental love\\" embedded within the poem. Karl Malkoff argues that the implications of the greenhouse poems are \\"hardly dependent upon extra-literary references\\". Richard Blessing claims the critical difficulty of interpreting the greenhouse poems derives from the fact that they are \\"too simple\\", that \\"critical apparatus is not designed for a primitive, descriptive poetry, a poetry with few tropes, no allusions, a clear vocabulary and syntax, and almost no abstractions.\\"  References  Category:1948 poems Category:American poems ","title":"Root Cellar (poem)"},{"id":"59733828","text":"Cadet Peak is a 7,186 ft (2,190 m) mountain summit near the western edge of the North Cascades, in Snohomish County of Washington state. The peak is located southeast of Barlow Pass along the Mountain Loop Highway, and two miles east of the historic Monte Cristo area. It is situated within the Henry M. Jackson Wilderness, on land administered by the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The mountain was originally called Foggy Peak, for the Foggy Mine claim on the mountain's north slope, but the name was changed in 1896 to its present name, and the Foggy Peak name was transferred to the peak immediately northwest of Cadet.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Back in the old mining days, the long sub-range stretching from Cadet Peak to Sheep Mountain was known as Pride of the Mountains Range. Cadet's nearest higher neighbor is Kyes Peak, to the south-southeast. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Sauk River. Climate Cadet Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Cadet Peak, west aspect The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Her body was found three weeks later in a creek bed in nearby Morgan County. One of Utah's most notorious cold cases, Rachael's murder ultimately proved a catalyst to establish the \\"Rachael Alert\\" child abduction alert system, which remained in use in the state of Utah until 2003, when the state adopted the national AMBER alert child abduction emergency alert system. The abduction and murder of Rachael Runyan was a factor in the 1983 passage of the US Congressional Missing Children's Act, which mandated an allocation of additional resources for the investigation of ongoing missing children cases. In 2017, the Rachael Runyan Missing and Exploited Children's Day was signed into legislation in Utah. The purpose of the annual observance is to raise public awareness of missing and exploited children within the state; the annual awareness date is August 26, the date of Rachael's abduction. Runyan's abduction and murder remain unsolved. Background Rachael Marie Runyan was born on June 23, 1979, in Weber County, Utah, the second child and only daughter of Jeff and Elaine Runyan. She had an older brother, Justin, and a younger brother, Nathan. The Runyan family had moved to Sunset from Tennessee just before Rachael's birth; her mother would later recall she and her husband had believed Sunset‚Äîthen a community of 6,000 inhabitants ‚Äîwould be a \\"wonderful and safe place\\" to raise their children. Rachael was a child beauty queen, having been crowned \\"Little Miss Sunset\\" the year before her murder. She has been described by her mother as a well-behaved child who, often being too young to participate in playground games with Justin and other children, was content to simply sit aside and suck her thumb watching the other children play. This habit had led to her mother occasionally teasing Rachael that she would become \\"bucktoothed\\" as an adult, to which Rachael would simply giggle. Despite the sense of security Jeff and Elaine Runyan felt within the community of Sunset, both parents repeatedly warned their children of the dangers of trusting anybody they did not know who attempted to lure them from their home or any safe environment. The family lived in a modest home adjacent to the Doxey Elementary School playground. A park the three children were fond of in which they regularly played, Mitchell Park, was also near their home. In the summer of 1982, Jeff and Elaine Runyan installed a gate in their backyard fence, so the family could easily access this playground. Abduction In the late morning of August 26, 1982, Rachael Runyan and her five-year-old brother Justin asked their mother if they and their younger brother Nathan, aged 18 months, could play in the playground of Doxey Elementary School. Although Elaine Runyan had never allowed her children to play unsupervised anywhere outside the family home, because she was preparing lunch for her children when they made the request, and the school playground was just from her home, well within sight of her kitchen window, she agreed to it. Nonetheless, Runyan looked repeatedly out the kitchen window and conversed with her children as she prepared the meal. When she called her children to lunch at approximately 12:55 p.m., only Nathan and Justin returned home. Justin blurted out to her that Rachael had been taken from the park by force moments before by a young black man who had initially offered to buy her ice cream and bubble gum at a nearby supermarket. According to Justin, the man had approached them as they played in the sandpit, attempting to lure the siblings into his car with an offer to purchase candy for the trio. When they were close to the man's car, Rachael told him she liked bubble gum-flavored ice cream. The man claimed to have this flavor of ice cream in his car. Justin said when he warned Rachael not to accompany the man any further, she began to turn and walk away from him. In response, he simply picked Rachael up and placed her over his shoulder before bundling her, screaming, into his car as Justin stood frozen in fear with Nathan standing by his side. Elaine rushed to the supermarket the kidnapper had mentioned, repeatedly asking staff and shoppers: \\"Have you seen a little blond girl? A 3-year-old with a black man?\\" Nobody she encountered had seen her child. Approximately 20 minutes after her daughter's disappearance, Elaine reported Rachael's abduction to the Sunset Police Department. =Investigation= Immediately upon learning of Rachael's abduction, the Sunset Police Department set up roadblocks in and around the city. This tactic failed to help police apprehend the suspect or to recover Rachael. In the hours following her abduction, a task force consisting of ten law enforcement investigators was formed to investigate the child's disappearance. These investigators were recruited from several Utah counties and supervised by Sheriff Brant Johnston. Both Justin Runyan, and a 10-year- old child who had also been approached by the man at the playground, described him to investigators as being a light-complexioned African-American, aged between 30 and 35 years old, tall, with a medium build, an afro-style haircut and a handlebar mustache. He drove an older model four-door dark-blue car with wood-grain stripes along the sides. The man had been at Mitchell Park, talking to various children and drinking coffee for a minimum of 15 minutes before abducting Rachael. Investigators also discovered this individual had played with the three Runyan children for several minutes before they had accompanied him partway to his vehicle. Although eyewitness memory enabled police to obtain an accurate physical description of the child's abductor from which they were able to construct a detailed composite drawing, the only witnesses to Rachael's abduction had been the three children. No CCTV had captured her abduction from the school grounds. As such, beyond police and media appeals, subsequent law enforcement efforts were effectively limited to procedures like forensic searches of the crime scene and house-to-house inquiries in the hours and days after the event. Public appeals for information about Rachael's disappearance did lead to investigators receiving multiple leads both in relation to the whereabouts of the child and the possible identity of her abductor. Although all leads were vigorously pursued they ultimately proved fruitless. =Family efforts and media appeals= With assistance from an assembled neighborhood committee (many of whom donated money to an improvised family search effort), the Runyan family began its own efforts to search for their daughter. Both the family and neighborhood volunteers had limited means and methods for the search at their disposal, although a nationwide distribution of flyers displaying Rachael's picture was organized. With the assistance of friends and neighbors, the Runyan family searched local neighborhoods and distributed thousands of missing person posters and flyers alerting the public to Rachael's disappearance. Within three weeks, this initiative had cost the family $10,000 in postage expenses alone. One week after Rachael's abduction, her parents flew to New York to attend a press conference intended to maintain the extensive publicity surrounding their daughter's disappearance. At this press conference, Jeff Runyan said: \\"I feel [the abductor] is without conscience, and my plea is for someone who knows him to come forward and sell him out.\\" Acknowledging the possibility Rachael might have been sold following her abduction, Elaine Runyan urged all parents planning on adopting a little girl in the near future to ensure the child was not Rachael. On September 3, Rachael's parents appeared on the Today show to continue to publicize of Rachael's disappearance. They offered a $20,000 reward raised largely through donations from concerned citizens in their community. The city of Sunset also pledged an additional $20,000 for the child's safe return. Discovery At 5:00 p.m. on September 19, a family traveling on a mountain road in Mountain Green, Utah (approximately from Sunset) stopped their vehicle at a turnout close to Trapper's Loop Road to let their children play at a nearby stream and throw rocks into the water. Close to a pile of brush, the children observed what they initially believed was a doll, partly covered in shrubbery floating at the edge of the stream. On closer inspection, the children realized the doll was actually the nude body of a female toddler with her hands bound behind her back. Rachael's relatives were able to offer tentative identification of her body from a chipped tooth and piercings in her ears. Due to the advanced state of the body's decomposition, the precise cause of Rachael's death was never established. The coroner was unable to exclude smothering as the cause of death. =Funeral= Shortly after the formal identification of their daughter, Jeff and Elaine Runyan held Rachael's funeral service at the Sunset Stake Center. Over 300 mourners were in attendance. Rachael was laid to rest in Washington Heights Memorial Park in the city of Ogden, Utah. She was buried in a white casket adorned with her photograph, a single pink rosebud, and one of her favorite Raggedy Ann dolls. Rachael's gravestone is inscribed with the words: \\"She brought a nation to its knees.\\" Federal impact The abduction and murder of Rachael Runyan proved to be a major factor in the October 1982 passage of a federal law allowing the parents of missing children access to a clearinghouse administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which would obtain and file records of the fingerprints and blood types of more than 300,000 Utah children. As a result of this abduction and murder, the state of Utah also formally implemented the \\"Rachael Alert\\" child abduction alert system in April 2002. It was designed to alert residents statewide of active child abduction and missing children cases. Once law enforcement personnel verified the authenticity of a child abduction case, a \\"Rachael Alert\\" form was faxed to all television and radio networks for immediate and high-priority statewide broadcast. The criteria to be met in these cases Included: the missing child was a minor or mentally handicapped; that they were in imminent danger; that the disappearance was not a runaway situation; and that law enforcement had a complete and accurate physical description of the missing child. The \\"Rachael Alert\\" system was only used in the June 2002 abduction of Elizabeth Smart and the January 2003 abduction of 3-month-old Nicholas Triplett; both children were ultimately found alive. In the wake of Elizabeth Smart's subsequent safe recovery, 41 states implemented the AMBER Alert child abduction alert system. Utah replaced the \\"Rachael Alert\\" system with the AMBER Alert system in April 2003‚Äîprimarily to conform with nationwide standards. The AMBER Alert system is now tested twice a year in Utah‚Äîon January 13 and on the anniversary of Rachael's abduction, August 26. Rachael's murder was also a factor in the passing of the Missing Children's Act, which places descriptions of missing children in the FBI's National Crime Information Computer database. Ongoing investigation =Reopening of case= Although Rachael's murder is an unsolved case, Lieutenant Phil Olmstead, who first answered Elaine Runyan's frantic call for assistance following her daughter's abduction, continually assured the Runyan family of the Sunset Police Department's determination to find Rachael's murderer or murderers. The investigation into her murder was officially reopened by the Sunset Police Department in 2007. Police continue working closely with the Utah Attorney General's office in their efforts to apprehend and convict the perpetrator(s). A reward of $58,000 is available should any information leading to the arrest and subsequent conviction of the person or persons responsible be provided to authorities. Hopes for the identification of the perpetrator rest primarily on notable advances in forensic technology in the years since 1982. As a means to this end, investigators have not ruled out the possibility of exhuming Rachael's body to retrieve further forensic evidence. DNA testing conducted on items found near Rachael's body in 2007 yielded tentative results, although they have not helped advance the investigation. Rachael's family has never given up hope her killer will be found. =Suspects= In 2012, investigators announced that a prison inmate in Pennsylvania who had been a resident of Sunset in 1982 was under active investigation. Although no formal charges have been filed against this individual, he is considered a possible suspect in Rachael's abduction and murder. Another potential is a man with a criminal record who is believed to live in New Mexico. Sunset Police Chief Ken Eborn has said that evidence supports the potential guilt of this suspect exists, but it is insufficient for police to make a formal arrest. Furthermore, Eborn has said he is convinced that witnesses or individuals with knowledge of the man's guilt are reluctant to come forward to authorities‚Äîpossibly because of death threats he has made against them. Advocacy and legacy Following her daughter's abduction and murder, Elaine Runyan-Simmons channeled her grief into action, becoming an outspoken advocate in a national movement to raise awareness of issues regarding child safety, child abduction, and the legislated procedures regarding their recovery. Runyan-Simmons has frequently offered emotional support, guidance and advice to parents undergoing a similar experience to her family's ordeal. Regarding her ongoing commitment to the perpetuation and expansion of Utah's \\"Rachael Alert\\" child abduction alert system (which was subsumed under the nationwide AMBER alert system in 2003), Runyan-Simmons has said that being a voice in this field of advocacy is not a choice she would have made had Rachael not been abducted and murdered: the events of August and September 1982 left her with little choice in this matter. In 2013, Runyan- Simmons stated: \\"It's a legacy I leave for my daughter. If there was something in place like this [in 1982], maybe we'd still have her.\\" In May 2016, the park where Rachael was abducted was renamed Rachael Runyan Memorial Park. It was formally dedicated to Rachael's memory on August 26; a memorial stone bearing an image of the girl, a brief summary of her story, and the park's name stands within its grounds. The inscription on the stone reads: \\"In honor of Rachael Marie Runyan, June 23, 1979 - August 26, 1982. Abducted from Doxey Elementary Playground August 26, 1982.\\" The Rachael Runyan Missing and Exploited Children's Day was signed into legislation in Utah in March 2017. The stated aim of this annual observance is to encourage individuals in Utah to prioritize child safety. The bill was inspired by Rachael Runyan, and has been described as a \\"catalyst for the development of better responses to (child) abduction\\" within Utah. In instances where an AMBER Alert is implemented and the missing child is subsequently found safe and well, a \\"Rachael Runyan Award\\" is presented to the individual who either locates the missing child or initially alerted authorities to his or her abduction.

A son of the governor of Iraq, Ziyad ibn Abihi, Abbad served as a governor of Sijistan between 673 and 681 under caliphs Mu'awiya I () and Yazid I (). He led a contingent in the army of Caliph Marwan I () at the Battle of Marj Rahit and afterward fought against loyalists of al-Mukhtar al-Thaqafi during the reign of Caliph Abd al-Malik (). He later served at the court of the latter's son and successor, Caliph al- Walid I (), and played a role in the succession intrigues between al-Walid's son Abd al-Aziz and the caliph's brother, Sulayman. Governor of Sijistan Abbad was the son of Ziyad ibn Abihi, the Umayyad governor of Iraq, and a brother of Ziyad's successor Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, with whom he had a close relationship. The Umayyad caliph Mu'awiya I () appointed Abbad governor of the eastern province of Sijistan (Sistan) in 673, and he was reconfirmed in the post by Mu'awiya's son and successor Yazid I (). While the historian Muhammad Abdulhayy Shaban notes that Sijistan remained stable under Abbad's rule with no record of rebellions in the province or military expeditions originating from there, the historian K. V. Zetterst√©en asserts that Abbad was an active participant in the eastward expansion of the Caliphate and credited him with leading the conquest of Kandahar. Starting in 674 Abbad patronized a well- known poet in his entourage, Ibn Mufarrigh al-Himyari (d. 688), who played the role of Abbad's panegyrist. As Abbad became occupied with his post, he stopped tending to Ibn Muffarigh and his poems, causing the poet to compose satirical verses against Abbad and his father. Abbad detained him for a short period, but Ibn Muffarigh continued to insult his erstwhile patron's family in verse after he was released. He was captured and humiliated in public by Ubayd Allah in Basra and sent back to Abbad who kept jailed him until he was released by the caliph's intervention in 680. During Abbad's governorship of Sijistan, Ubayd Allah served as governor in Iraq and their brother Abd al-Rahman served as governor of Khurasan. Abbad was replaced in 681 when Yazid put Khurasan and Sijistan under the authority of Abbad's brother, Salm, who in turn appointed another brother, Yazid, as his deputy in the province. This chronology, according to the 8th-century historian Umar ibn Shabba is disputed by the information in Tarikh-i Sistan and 9th-century historian al-Yaqubi, which holds that Ubayd Allah appointed Yazid before 681. In any case, Ubayd Allah informed Abbad of the developments, and in reaction to his dismissal, Abbad divvied up the funds of Sijistan's treasuries among his slaves and Arab troops before departing the province. On his way back to report to Caliph Yazid in Damascus, Abbad avoided encountering Salm when passing through the vicinity of Jiroft in Kirman. In response to Yazid's inquiry regarding the treasury sums Abbad was expected to bring the caliph, he stated that he was obliged to pay the large number of troops under his authority as would be expected of him, in such a critical frontier region as Sijistan. Later career and death Following the collapse of Umayyad authority in the caliphate's eastern provinces in the aftermath of Caliph Yazid's death, Abbad relocated with 2,000 of his mawƒÅlƒ´ (non-Arab, Muslim freedmen or clients) to Syria where they fought alongside the army of the Umayyad caliph Marwan I at the Battle of Marj Rahit in 684. In contrast, Zetterst√©en claims Abbad's contingent at Marj Rahit consisted of his own kinsmen. Following the decisive Umayyad victory in the battle, Abbad sought to retire to the north Arabian oasis town of Dumat al- Jandal, but was dispatched by Caliph Abd al-Malik to confront a commander of the Kufa-based, pro-Alid rebel leader al-Mukhtar al-Thaqafi at some point prior to 687. Abbad later advised Caliph al-Walid I () when the latter unsuccessfully attempted to replace the caliph's brother Sulayman in the line of succession with al-Walid's son Abd al-Aziz. Though Zetterst√©en claims Abbad's date of death is not known, the historians I. K. A. Howard and Khurshid Ahmad Fariq state Abbad died in 718/19.
