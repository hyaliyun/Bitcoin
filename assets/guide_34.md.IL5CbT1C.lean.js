He is credited with Sanas Cormaic (Cormac's Glossary). Lexicography evolved in order to serve one of two needs i.e. in order to explain in a simple way difficult words and expressions or in order to explain the words and expressions of one language in another. In this case we can trace the tradition of lexicography in Irish back to the 8th century.  W√ºrzburg  Around 750 A.D. an anonymous Irish student studying in W√ºrzburg in Germany, wrote down explanations in his native tongue on the Latin text of the Epistles of Saint Paul as an aid to help him understand the Latin. The text and explanations still survive in W√ºrzburg. This is the earliest known attempt at bilingual lexicography in Irish. Lexicography of various kinds has been practised in Irish from that time down to our own day ‚Äì a journey of about 1,250 years.  Cormac  The first dictionaries compiled in Irish independent of an accompanying text are described as Glossaries. It is most likely that these were put together from glosses already appended to other texts. Sanas Cormaic (Cormac's Glossary) is the most famous of these and was compiled over one thousand years ago. It was compiled by Cormac Mac Cuileann√°in, the Bishop of Cashel and king of Munster, who died in 908. It is an encyclopaedic dictionary containing simple synonymous explanations in Irish or Latin of the headwords. In some cases he attempts to give the etymology of the words and in others he concentrates on an encyclopaedic entry. It is held to be the first linguistic dictionary in any of the non-classical languages of Europe.  √ì Cl√©irigh  M√≠che√°l √ì Cl√©irigh was a Franciscan and head of the Four Masters. He compiled another famous glossary called ‚ÄòSanas√°n Mhich√≠l U√≠ Chl√©irigh‚Äô (Michael O‚ÄôClery's Glossary). This glossary was printed in 1643 during the author's lifetime. These two glossaries and others are valuable for the etymological and encyclopaedic information contained in them. They are of equal value for their explanations of difficult words and because they contain words for which there is no evidence to be had apart from the spoken language of the present day.  Plunkett  In 1662 Richard Plunkett, a Franciscan living in Trim, Co. Meath, finished the first great bilingual dictionary containing the Irish language, his Latin-Irish Dictionary. The manuscript was never published and is now held in Marsh's Library in Dublin. Despite this fact, subsequent lexicographers made copious use of this work.de Bhaldraithe, T. 1987. ‚ÄòAn Pluinc√©adach: Ceannr√≥da√≠ Focl√≥ireachta.‚Äô Teangeolas 22: 19-26. Edward Lhwyd, Welsh lexicographer considered to be \\"the first Celtic scholar\\"  18th century  Edward Lhuyd, a Welsh speaker was one of the first to make good use of Plunkett's dictionary, in the dictionary of multilingual lists (encompassing the Celtic languages, Latin and English) which he published in 1707. During the 18th century two major English-Irish dictionaries and two Irish-English dictionaries were compiled.

MacAdam was a business man from Belfast, a Protestant and Irish revivalist.  20th century  P. S. Dinneen's dictionary Focl√≥ir Gaedhilge agus B√©arla, 1904 The 20th century witnessed the compilation of the first major Irish-Irish dictionary for centuries: Croidhe Cainnte Chiarraighe, by Se√°n √ìg Mac Murchadha Caomh√°nach (aka Se√°n a' Ch√≥ta). Although originally intended to comprise mainly words particular to the Dingle dialect of Irish, it quickly outgrew its specification, swelling to over 60,000 headwords and over 2.2 million words in total. While this greatly added to its usefulness as a comprehensive dictionary for speakers of the Irish language, in a sad irony it was also the costs associated with this size that eventually resulted in its not being published during Se√°n a' Ch√≥ta's lifetime. It was over seventy five years after its completion before it was made accessible by the general public thanks to the work of Dr Tracey N√≠ Mhaonaigh of Maynooth University, who transcribed it. During the 20th century four English-Irish dictionaries were published and three major Irish-English dictionaries.

A considerable number of terminological dictionaries, dictionaries relating to specific dialects, dictionaries for school use and pocket dictionaries were also published in the last century. Two dictionaries were also produced containing Irish and a language other than English for the first time since Plunkett's dictionary in the 17th century.

Meanwhile, of the other living Celtic languages the only one without an Irish dictionary is now Cornish thanks to the work of Kevin Scannell in creating dictionaries for the other Gaelic languages and of Joe Mitchell who has created a Welsh-Irish dictionary.

The internet has notably become a far greater medium for dictionaries since the turn of the century. √ì D√≥naill and de Bhaldraithe's bilingual dictionaries and the monolingual Focl√≥ir Beag can be searched for free online and Foras na Gaeilge's New English-Irish Dictionary is available exclusively electronically, as is the national terminology database provided by Fiontar in DCU. Intergaelic, a resource for speakers of Gaelic languages is provided by Kevin Scannell and Michal Boleslav Mƒõchura. The Royal Irish Academy also republished their comprehensive dictionary of early Irish online as the eDIL and work is ongoing on a comprehensive historical dictionary of Irish covering the period 1600-2000. Those great lexicographers who practiced lexicography in Irish were for the most part learned men who had a particular love for Irish. The precise methodologies employed by most of them remain unknown to us. They had no hesitancy, however, in borrowing from dictionaries that already existed. This point has been skillfully shown with no little humour in many articles written by one of the great lexicographers of the 20th century, Tom√°s de Bhaldraithe. In general their research and use of pre-existing sources greatly increased the value and scope of their work. They sometimes erred in selection of specific word versions which they gleaned from their sources, however. On other occasions one cannot be sure that it is not without a degree of humour that they chose to include certain comical versions. It is not clear whether ignorance or wit was responsible for the following examples from some of the aforementioned works ‚Äì ‚Äúgiolla earbuill, a page or train-bearer‚Äù; ‚Äúlachaim, I duck or dive‚Äù; ‚Äúcalaoiseach, a juggler‚Äù; ‚Äúbol, a poet; a cow‚Äù. When in future appointing a dictionary editor perhaps the job description should state that a ‚Äúsiollaire‚Äù is required ‚Äì ‚Äúsiollaire, a scanner of every word, a carper, a dictator; a beater, striker, smiter, a dexterous harper also a good singer; siollaire mn√°, a strong comely woman‚Äù ‚Äì those are the descriptions found in some of the dictionaries for a person deemed a ‚Äúsiollaire‚Äù. It will be interesting to note how the word ‚Äúsiollaire will be employed by those lexicographers who come after us. In any case the journey of over one thousand two hundred years travelled by Irish lexicography from the glossist of W√ºrzburg to the new Foras na Gaeilge dictionary is one of which we can be justifiably proud.De Bhaldraithe, T. 1980. ‚ÄòFocl√≥ir√≠ agus focl√≥ireacht na Gaeilge‚Äô, The Maynooth Review 6.1.:3-15.

Her identity has never been successfully established. Her case has been the subject of extensive efforts by investigators and has been highlighted as inspiring other work to solve cold cases of unidentified murder victims. Discovery At approximately 9:20 p.m. on October 5, 1980, the nude body of a white adolescent or young woman between 13 and 25 years old (most likely 17‚Äì18 years old) was found with blunt force trauma including multiple wounds to the back of the head (believed to be from a roofing hammer or framing hammer), signs of injury to the face, and seven puncture-type stab wounds on the upper left area of her back. One of her lower teeth had been knocked out in the attack. Her body was found just south of State Route 146, near the Arroyo Grande wash, where the I-215 Beltway is currently. She had been placed in a position described as \\"posed, basically\\" and was face-down. The body was discovered by two brothers who were driving on a dirt road, one of whom was an off-duty police officer. The cause of death was identified as an unknown two-pronged instrument with prongs around three inches long that was used to stab the victim. The body appeared to have been washed, and a piece of yellow or orange shower curtain was nearby. Her hair was a natural brownish blond, red, or strawberry blond color at shoulder- length (about 11 inches long). She was around five feet two inches tall and weighed between 98 and 110 pounds. She still had her wisdom teeth (which were impacted) and had a visible gap between two of her upper-right teeth, possibly occurring postmortem. Additionally, one of her teeth was treated with a \\"suture\\" in order to straighten it. There is also the possibility she had fractured her jaw in the past. She had pierced ears and her nails were painted silver. The victim had dental fillings in some of her teeth, showing that she had seen a dentist. Her eyes were a hazel or blue color (some sources say green) and she had a small (about ‚Ä≥√ó‚Ä≥), crude, apparently amateur tattoo of an \\"S\\" on the inside of her right forearm, made with blue ink. The tattoo appeared to have been \\"inked\\" not long before she died. She had a vaccination scar on her left bicep. It was determined that she had probably died the day before her body was discovered. The victim also had undergone an unusual \\"suture procedure\\" to straighten one of her teeth, which led investigators to believe she was not impoverished. The police officer who discovered her body donated money for burial of the body, regularly visits the burial site with his wife, and leaves flowers in her memory. Investigation Additional rendering of the victim Investigators made extensive efforts to try to identify the body of the young woman. The victim's fingerprints were taken and her dental characteristics were recorded, but could not be matched to anyone. Eventually, the victim's DNA profile was developed by the University of North Texas and was entered into national databases, which failed to turn up her identity. Several television shows broadcast information about the case in the hope of generating leads, none of which led to her identification or the apprehension of her killer or killers. Forensic facial reconstructions were created to provide a likeness of the Jane Doe, which were hoped to enable recognition by those that may have known her. The body has been exhumed at least four times for further investigations ‚Äì in 2002, 2003, 2009, and 2016. In 2003, her body was exhumed after authorities followed clues to a missing girl from California, who was eventually ruled out by DNA analysis. To date, 20 missing people have been excluded as potential identities for the victim. The former coroner for Clark County when the victim's body was found has worked with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children to help with the case. In a video released in October 2015, he said \\"someone is missing their little girl ‚Äì someone knows who she is ‚Äì someone needs to come forward and help us\\", saying that he hoped the reconstructions created of the victim would trigger recognition. He said this victim's case was an impetus for the local department to develop a \\"cold case unit\\" for its unsolved cases. \\"She is the case that started it all for us,\\" he said. The officer who found the body described similar feelings about the case. In June 2015, \\"Arroyo Grande\\" Jane Doe's case was officially reopened by investigators. On October 5, 2015, the 35th anniversary of her discovery, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children released two new reconstructions, one frontal view of the face and the other as the profile. The new image replaced a version that the organization had created.

The Battle occurred near Pumpkin Creek, a tributary of Toungue River, in Montana Territory, in present-day Montana, United States.  Background  Early in 1880, the Lakota began warring along the Yellowstone River near Fort Keogh. On February 3, Hunkpapa Lakota fought with Gros Ventres, and 15 Lakota Sioux attacked three hay cutters on the Powder River, killing one, and mortally wounding another. The surviving worker reported the incident to Fort Keogh, and Sergeant Thaddeus B. Glover, Corporal Edwards, Private Charles W. Gurnsey, Private George E. Douglass, and four other soldiers of Company B, 2nd United States Cavalry Regiment, and seven Indian scouts were ordered out on February 5, in search of the Lakota responsible. The battle On February 7, 1880, after a pursuit of about , the small detachment of 15 soldiers and Indian scouts under Sergeant Glover located a group of six Lakota Sioux Warriors near Pumpkin Creek. The temperature read 56 degrees Fahrenheit below zero. The soldiers and scouts quietly surrounded the warriors who were in a rock formation. Private George E. Douglass exposed himself too far over the edge of a ridge and was immediately spotted by a warrior who fired, killing him instantly. Both sides then fired shots at each other, and one Sioux warrior was killed, and two were wounded. Private Charles W. Gurnsey of Glover's detachment was wounded. The engagement was decided when Company F, of the 5th United States Infantry Regiment under the command of Captain Simon Snyder arrived the next morning from Fort Keogh. With the now much larger force of over sixty United States soldiers, the four remaining Lakota warriors surrendered.

It was the first time that Glasgow hosted the games, and the third time it was hosted in Scotland after Edinburgh hosted in 1970 and 1986. A total of 4,947 athletes from 71 Commonwealth Games Associations (CGAs) competed in 261 events in 17 sports. Athletes from 37 participating CGAs won at least one medal; athletes from 21 CGAs won at least one gold medal. England led the medal table for the first time since 1986, winning 58 golds and 174 medals overall. Australia came second, after leading the medal table for the last six consecutive games, while Canada came third. Hosts Scotland enjoyed their best- ever performance by finishing in fourth place with a record 19 gold medals and 53 overall. Kiribati won its first-ever Commonwealth Games medal, a gold in the men's 105 kg weightlifting competition. Grenada won its first Commonwealth Games gold medal in the men's 400 metres. South African swimmer Chad le Clos won the most medals, a total of seven including two gold, one silver and four bronze. Canadian rhythmic gymnast Patricia Bezzoubenko won the most gold medals with five in addition to a bronze medal.  Medal table  The ranking in this table is consistent with International Olympic Committee convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a \\"nation\\" is an entity represented by a Commonwealth Games Association). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their three-letter country code. Two bronze medals were awarded in boxing, judo and wrestling, except for Women's freestyle 75 kg as only five competitors were entered in the event. Additionally, two bronze medals were awarded in the men's 100 m backstroke and women's pole vault as a result of a tie between two athletes. No bronze medal was awarded in the men's synchronized 10 metre platform as only four teams competed in the event. Therefore, the total number of bronze medals is greater than the total number of gold or silver medals. Changes in medal standings =Weightlifting= The women's 53 kg competition was originally won by 16-year-old Chika Amalaha of Nigeria. Following a failed doping test, Amalaha was stripped of her medal and placement, and the medals were redistributed. Dika Toua of Papua New Guinea was awarded the gold, Santoshi Matsa of India, silver and Swati Singh, also of India, bronze.

IV. was professor of fashion at London's Royal College of Art, a position she held from 1956 to 1968. She was a key figure in enabling fashion to be accepted as a valid academic subject in Britain. Described by her daughter Virginia as a \\"style icon\\", she died aged 60 after several suicide attempts and having suffered medical complications caused by alcoholism. Early life and career Janey Ironside was born Janey Acheson. Her father was an important figure in the Indian Civil Service. She was sent to school in Winchester, England. This was followed by courses in dress making at the Central School of Arts & Crafts in London in the 1930s. During World War Two, Ironside lived in Leamington Spa and would visit evacuees recovering in a nearby convalescent home. She produced over forty pencil and watercolour studies of the children in the home and a number of these works were presented to the Imperial War Museum in 1981. She advertised her services as a \\"designer dressmaker\\" in Vogue and her customers included debutants and fashion editors. Her work was mainly made-to-order evening wear and wedding dresses, but by 1952 she had designed a full collection for a large retailer. In 1949, Ironside taught at the private Fashion School in Ennismore Gardens, Kensington, next to the Royal College of Art. Style Ironside's personal style was based on Christian Dior's maxim that \\"to please a man, or to stop a show, use black, white and scarlet.\\" She wore mainly dark colours with red lipstick, which set off her pale skin and dark hair. Her fashions were influenced by Paris and Dior's New Look but on the cheap using the materials she could find. Due to post World War II rationing she bought material intended for blackout curtains to make outfits. Royal College of Art In 1956, at Robin Darwin's urging, Ironside was appointed as the Royal College of Art's professor of fashion, a post she was to hold until 1968. She replaced Madge Garland, whose assistant she had once been, in the post.Last-Year Reads: Janey Last-Year Girl, 2012. Retrieved 23 July 2014. The appointment came just as British fashion was about to enter its \\"youthquake\\" phase. According to Elizabeth Wilson, Ironside attributed this phenomenon to a combination of British eccentricity and the Welfare State and educational grants which allowed people with talent that would once have been wasted to go to college. Angela McRobbie described Ironside, along with Muriel Pemberton, as the key figures in enabling fashion to attain academic respectability in Britain. Ironside's students included Bill Gibb, Ossie Clark, Zandra Rhodes, Moya Bowler, Janice Wainwright, Sally Tuffin and Marion Foale. She introduced a menswear course and was laughed at when she said she thought Mick Jagger stylish. Antony Price, a student on the menswear course, went on to create the suited look favoured by Bryan Ferry and others. When the College was given the power to award degrees, however, her School of Fashion was excluded. After Ironside lost her post in 1968, according to her daughter in her book Janey and Me, there followed a downward spiral of alcohol abuse and depression. In 1968, Ironside produced A Fashion Alphabet which was notable for its pithy aphorisms, such as \\"necklines always make headlines.\\" More seriously, the book expounded Ironside's view that \\"fashion in clothing is one of the great living arts of civilisation\\", listing 49 types of collars and 22 types of sleeves for instance.Last-Year Reads: A Fashion Alphabet Last-Year Girl, 2012. Retrieved 23 July 2014. Personal life In 1939, she married Christopher Ironside (1913‚Äì1992), the artist and coin designer. They had one daughter, the journalist and novelist Virginia Ironside (born 1944). The marriage was dissolved in 1961, and he remarried later that year. She wrote an autobiography Janey which The Times described as illuminating \\"a great deal more than the world of fashion\\". Death Ironside made several suicide attempts and suffered serious medical complications from alcoholism including cirrhosis of the liver. When she eventually died on 6 April 1979, it was November before a short obituary appeared in The Times. It paid tribute to her eye for colour, her skills as an educator and her \\"green thumb\\" which allowed her students to flourish, but made no mention of the later, troubled, period of her life.

He was born at Castle Bromwich, Birmingham and died at Uley, Gloucestershire. Cricket career Kempson was a right-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm round-arm medium-pace bowler. His first match that is now considered to have been first-class was the 1851 University Match between Cambridge University and Oxford when he played as a lower-order batsman and scored 48 in the only Cambridge innings: this remained his highest first-class score. He did not bowl in that game but by the time of his next match in 1852, against the Cambridge Town Club, he was batting further up the order (though less successfully) and opening the bowling, taking six first innings in a very low- scoring match, though the detailed analysis is not available. 1853 was Kempson's best season as a bowler: he took 38 wickets in just five matches. They included six wickets in each innings for Cambridge University against Marylebone Cricket Club. He had limited success in his second University Match against Oxford, but was then picked for the Gentlemen against the Players, where, in a rare victory for the amateurs by 60 runs, he bowled unchanged through both Players' innings with Sir Frederick Bathurst, 24 years his senior, and took nine wickets to Bathurst's 11. His next first-class cricket came in two matches for Cambridge University in 1856 in which he took 21 wickets in all, including his best figures of seven wickets in an innings against MCC, though the full analysis is not known. Beyond this, he played no more first-class cricket except for a single game for MCC in 1865 when he took no wickets, scored no runs and was absent for the second innings. Career outside cricket The son of the vicar of Castle Bromwich, Matthews Kempson was educated at Cheltenham College as one of its first pupils when it opened in 1841 and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. At Cheltenham, he was captain of the cricket team for three years and was remembered, 100 years after he went there, for having dispatched the bowling of an All-England player out of the college grounds and into the road outside. After graduation, Kempson went to India as a teacher; from 1858 he was headmaster of the Government College at Bareilly and then an Inspector of Schools in Agra. From 1862 to 1878 he was \\"director of public instruction\\" in the North West Provinces before returning to England where he was a teacher of Indian history and oriental languages at Cambridge University. He published books on the Hindustani language and translations of Hindustani works. He does not appear to have been related to William Kempson, his near contemporary who also played first-class cricket for Cambridge University and amateur sides in the mid 1850s.

Prelude On 20 October 1945, Allied troops under the command of Brigadier Bethell landed in Semarang to disarm Japanese troops and liberate POWs still detained in concentration camps in Central Java. Initially, the troops were welcomed in the area, with Central Java's governor Wongsonegoro agreeing to provide them with food and other necessities in return for the Allies' promise to respect Indonesia's sovereignty and independence. The Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA) were also in Semarang, and welcomed the British presence. However, when Allied and NICA troops began freeing and arming freed Dutch POWs in Ambarawa and Magelang, many locals were angered. Relations were further ruined when the Allies began disarming members of the Indonesian Army. Indonesian troops under the command of Lieutenant Colonel M. Sarbini began besieging Allied troops stationed in Magelang in reprisal for their attempted disarmament. Indonesian president Sukarno intervened in the situation to calm tensions, and the Allies secretly left Magelang to their stronghold in Ambarawa. Sarbini's regiment followed the Allies in pursuit, and was later joined by other Indonesian troops from Ambarawa, Suruh, and Surakarta. Allied troops were later driven out of the nearby village of Jambu by the combined force of the Indonesian Army. At the village of Ngipik, Allied troops were once again forced to retreat by the Indonesian Army, after attempting to establish control over two villages around Ambarawa. Indonesian troops under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Isdiman tried to free the two villages, but Isdiman was killed in action before reinforcements arrived. Commander of Division V Banyumas, Colonel Soedirman, vowed to avenge Isdiman's death and called in reinforcements to besiege Allied positions in Central Java. On the morning of 23 November 1945, Indonesian troops began firing on Allied troops stationed in Ambarawa. A counterattack by the Allies forced the Indonesian Army to retreat to the village of Bedono. Battle On 11 December 1945, Soedirman held a meeting with various commanders of the Indonesian Army. The next day at 4:30 AM, the Indonesian Army launched an assault on the Allies in Ambarawa. Indonesian artillery pounded Allied positions, which were later overrun by infantry. When the Semarang-Ambarawa highway was captured by Indonesian troops, Soedirman immediately ordered his forces to cut off the supply routes of the remaining Allied troops by using a pincer maneuver. The battle ended four days later on 15 December 1945, when Indonesia succeeded in regaining control over Ambarawa and the Allies retreated to Semarang. Aftermath The Palagan Ambarawa Monument in Ambarawa was erected in memory of the battle. The battle's anniversary is also celebrated on Juang Kartika Day.

According to The Independent, she \\"invented art-school training in fashion in Britain\\". Early life Muriel Alice Pemberton was born in Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent, on 8 September 1909, or 8 September 1910. The daughter of Thomas Henry Pemberton, who was a skilled amateur painter as well as a photographic innovator, inventing a one-camera stereoscopic process. Her mother, Alice Pemberton, n√©e Smith, retired from a career as a professional singer upon marriage and she was also a gifted designer and needlewoman. At the age of fifteen, she was the youngest student at the local Burslem School of Art. In 1928, she obtained a scholarship as well as a major award to attend the School of Painting at London's Royal College of Art. In 1931, she was awarded the RCA's first ever Diploma in Fashion. Pemberton persuaded the head of the school of design, Professor Ernest William Tristram, to introduce such a course, and he asked her to draft the curriculum. According to the ODNB, > She proposed a combination of direct contact, sketching, and analysing with > an actual couturier, learning the basic skills of cutting and sewing with a > professional, and supplementing this with academic studies in the history of > fashion and design at museums such as the Victoria and Albert. Career Following graduation in 1931, Pemberton was immediately employed to teach fashion drawing two days a week at St Martin's School of Art. Over time, she was able to expand this role and became head of the UK's first Faculty of Fashion and Design. The curriculum was much as she had originally proposed to Tristram. Even before the war, Pemberton's innovative approach to teaching fashion and giving it a proper place in the art college curriculum had attracted international attention. Her methods were widely copied, with teachers visiting from all over the globe to study her approach. Her students included Katharine Hamnett, Bruce Oldfield, Bill Gibb and Bjorn Lanberg. In 1993, John Russell Taylor published a biography of her life. Personal life In 1941, she married John Hadley Rowe (died 1975). Pemberton died at 56 Vale Road, St Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex, on 30 July 1993.

It produces wine in partnership with TV celebrities Graham Norton and Sarah Jessica Parker, and aims to appeal to casual wine drinkers by avoiding the sort of marketing its founders perceive is too pompous or flowery. Invivo wines have won several awards and trophies in various international wine competitions, and its unorthodox approach to fund-raising and marketing won it the 2009 New Zealand Innovation in Wine Marketing Trophy.  Wines and other products  Invivo Wines has two main brands: the Invivo brand produces New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, from the Marlborough and Central Otago regions, including a higher tier range with a Michelle's label. The Graham Norton's Own brand produces New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, a ros√© based on Pinot Noir, a South Australian Shiraz, an Italian DOC Prosecco, and an Irish Gin in the London Dry style. In 2019 Invivo entered a partnership with Sarah Jessica Parker to produce the Invivo X range, including a Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc and a Proven√ßal ros√©. Previously, Invivo also produced Belle, a label for low calorie, low alcohol Sauvignon Blanc and Ros√© wines at 9% ABV, and a Scarlett's Spritzer range of sparkling natural fruit-infused drinks.  History  Invivo began in 2007 as an idea between old school friends, winemaker Rob Cameron and Tim Lightbourne. Invivo discovered chat-show star Graham Norton was a fan of their Sauvignon Blanc and sent him some of theirs to try. As a result, Invivo and Norton began working together on a \\"Graham Norton's Own\\" branded range of wines, starting with a 2015 Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. Invivo winemakers and Norton meet each year to blend the next vintage of the range, subsequently expanded to include other varietals. Norton is also a minor shareholder of Invivo Wines. In March 2015, Invivo became the first New Zealand company to raise NZD $2 million of equity crowdfunding, the maximum amount allowed under New Zealand regulations, raised through the Snowball Effect platform. By 2018, Invivo became the largest equity crowdfunded company in the Southern Hemisphere having raised NZD $4.4 million.

This shadowy goddess is attested in the Poetic Edda poem Lokasenna, recorded in the 13th century by an unknown source, and the Heimskringla book Ynglinga saga, a euhemerized account of the Norse gods composed by Snorri Sturluson also in the 13th century but based on earlier traditional material. The figure receives no further mention in Old Norse texts. The situation is further complicated in that narratives describing the birth of Freyr and Freyja contradictorily cite the birth of the siblings occurring either after or before Nj√∂r√∞r left Vanaheimr to live among the √Üsir. In addition, Freyr is referred to as the \\"son\\" of Nj√∂r√∞r and the goddess Ska√∞i in the Poetic Edda poem Sk√≠rnism√°l. In his 1 CE work Germania, Tacitus describes rituals surrounding a deity by the name of Nerthus, a theonym that is etymologically ancestral to Old Norse Nj√∂r√∞r. However, the figure described by Tacitus is female. Based on this scholars have suggested a Proto-Germanic hermaphroditic deity or a gender aspectual pair (similar to Freyja and Freyr), identified the obscure Old Norse goddess name Nj√∂run as a potential name for the otherwise unnamed goddess, and in some cases identified a potential reflex of a narrative about Nj√∂r√∞r and his sister-wife in Saxo Grammaticus's 12th-century work Gesta Danorum. Textual background In a euhemerized account of the gods in Ynglinga saga chapter 4, Snorri Sturluson characterizes Freyr and Freyja as the offspring of Nj√∂r√∞r by his unnamed sister, to whom he was married by Vanic custom: > {| | Old Norse :√û√° er Nj«´r√∞r var me√∞ V«´num, √æ√° haf√∞i hann √°tta systur s√≠na, > √æv√≠ at √æat v√°ru √æar l«´g; v√°ru √æeira b«´rn Freyr ok Freyja.Ynglinga saga ch. > 4, ed. Finnur J√≥nsson. | Lee M. Hollander translation (1992) :While Njorth > lived with the Vanir he had his sister as wife, because that was the custom > among them. Their children were Frey and Freya.Snorri Sturluson, The Saga of > the Ynglings in Heimskringla: History of the Kings of Norway, tr. Lee M. > Hollander, The American-Scandinavian Foundation, 1964, repr. Austin: > University of Texas, 1992, , pp. 6-50, p. 8. | |} In the Eddic poem Lokasenna, Loki also states that Nj√∂r√∞r had Freyr by his sister: > {| | Old Norse :vi√∞ systor √æinni :gaztu sl√≠kan m«´g | Ursula Dronke > translation (1997) :on your sister :you begot such a sonLokasenna verse 36, > ed. and tr. Ursula Dronke, The Poetic Edda Volume II: Mythological Poems, > Oxford: Oxford/Clarendon, 1997, repr. 2001, , p. 341. | |} In contrast, in the Gylfaginning section of his Prose Edda, after telling the story of Nj√∂r√∞r's unhappy marriage to Ska√∞i that occurred after he came to live among the √Üsir, Snorri states that Freyr and Freyja were born after that; Freyr is also presented as the son of Nj√∂r√∞r and Ska√∞i in the Eddic poem Sk√≠rnism√°l.Gylfaginning ch. 13 (24): \\"Nj«´r√∞r √≠ N√≥at√∫num gat s√≠√∞an tvau b«´rn. H√©t sonr Freyr en d√≥ttir Freyja.\\" In Sk√≠rnism√°l Ska√∞i calls Freyr \\"our boy\\" (okkarr m«´gr: \\"okkarn m√°la m«´g\\", verse 1, line 3) and Sk√≠rnir responds referring to him as \\"son of you two\\" (ykkarr s√≥nr: \\"at ykrom syni\\", verse 2, line 2); Dronke, p. 376. However, in Ynglinga saga Freyr, and presumably Freyja, accompanies Nj√∂r√∞r when he comes to live with the √Üsir as a hostage after the √Üsir‚ÄìVanir War;Ynglinga saga, ch. 4. and Lokasenna alludes to Freyja having been \\"surprised\\" in Vanic incest with her brother.Lokasenna verse 32, Dronke, p. 340. Scholarly interpretation Scholars since Jacob Grimm have regarded the chronology in Ynglinga saga as more likely to be original and taken Freyr and Freyja as having been therefore born to Nj√∂r√∞r by an unmentioned Vanic wife.Jacob Grimm, Teutonic Mythology, 4th ed. tr. James Steven Stallybrass, Volume 1 London: George Bell, 1882, , note 1, p. 219: \\"Ni√∂r√∞r and Nerthus were brother and sister, and joint parents of Freyr and Freyja\\".E. O. G. Turville-Petre, Myth and Religion of the North: The Religion of Ancient Scandinavia, History of Religion, London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1964, , p. 162, note 2, p. 306. Jan de Vries suggested a remnant of ancient Indo-European custom.Jan de Vries, Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte Volume II Die G√∂tter--Vorstellungen √ºber den Kosmos--der Untergang des Heidentums, Grundri√ü der germanischen Philologie 12/II, 2nd ed. Berlin: de Gruyter, 1957, repr. as 3rd ed., 1970, , pp. 174-75, note 1, p. 175 . Since Nerthus in Tacitus' late-1st century Germania is an earth goddess, terra mater (mother earth), but her name is etymologically identical to his, the suggestion is that there was originally a hermaphroditic deity, or more likely that they were a married twin pair, parallel to Freyr and Freyja.Rudolf Simek, Dictionary of Northern Mythology, tr. Angela Hall, Cambridge / Rochester, New York: Brewer, 1993, repr. 2000, , p. 234. Georges Dum√©zil pointed out that in Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum, the hero Hadingus' life closely parallels Nj√∂r√∞r's, including a relationship with his foster-sister Harthgrepa followed by marriage to a princess who chooses him by his feet, as Ska√∞i does in Gylfaginning.Georges Dum√©zil, From Myth to Fiction: The Saga of Hadingus, tr. Derek Coltman, Chicago: University of Chicago, 1973, , p. 50-61. Grimm suggested that Freyja was thought of as the daughter of the female Nerthus and Freyr as the son of the male Nj√∂r√∞r.Grimm, p. 217. It is possible that the goddess' name survives in the uncharacterized Nj√∂run who appears in some skaldic kennings and in the Nafna√æulur that were later appended to the Prose Edda; other divine pairs with similarly differentiated names in the Old Norse corpus are Ullr and Ullin and Fj√∂rgyn and Fj√∂rgynn, and the Old High German Phol and Volla may also be a pair.Joseph S. Hopkins, \\"Goddesses Unknown I: Nj«´run and the Sister-Wife of Nj«´r√∞r\\", RMN Newsletter 5 (2012) 39-44; note 5, p. 43.

Route description  The route begins at PTH 2 south of Wawanesa, and terminates at the Trans-Canada Highway just north of Douglas. PR 340 is the main road that serves CFB Shilo. The route is paved at the northern and southern ends of the route, with a large gravel section connecting CFB Shilo with Treesbank.  History  PR 340 was originally a much longer provincial road in comparison to its current distance. In the early 1990s, the Manitoba government decommissioned a number of provincial secondary roads and returned the maintenance of these roads back to the rural municipalities. The section of the original PR 340 between Treesbank and Belmont was included in this decommissioning. Prior to this, PR 340 started at PTH 3 near Holmfield. From this point, it traveled north, meeting PTH 23 just south of Belmont. From Belmont, PR 340 continued north, with small jaunts eastward, before meeting PTH 2 west of Glenboro. The two highways would run in a short westbound concurrence before PR 340 left the concurrence and continued north through the community of Stockton. Once it passed Stockton, PR 340 gradually turned west towards Treesbank where it turned north once again. The highway rejoined its current configuration just north of the community after a short crossing over the Assiniboine River at Treesbank Ferry. After the decommissioning of the original route, the section of PR 340 between PTH 3 and PTH 23 was redesignated as PR 458. As well, a small section around Treesbank was redesignated as PR 530, and PR 340 was reconfigured on to a road previously designated as PR 344. It is the stretch it travels on through Wawanesa (where it meets the current PR 344) to its current southern terminus with PTH 2. The sections of the original route that were not redesignated are now maintained by the Rural Municipalities of Oakland, South Cypress, and Strathcona. The original length of PR 340 was .

The evolutionary history of these forms is unknown, though hypotheses exist. comb shaped organism Pectinifrons  Discovery of Ediacaran fossils in the Avalon Peninsula  Cast of the holotype of Charnia masoni In the summer of 1967, Shiva Balak Misra, an Indian graduate student (1966‚Äì69) at Newfoundland's Memorial University discovered a rich assemblage of imprints of soft bodied organisms on the surface of large rock slabs, while mapping the Conception Group of Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland near Cape Race, at a place called Mistaken Point. These unusual impressions of previously unknown soft-bodied sea animals on the surfaces of argillites (mudstone) included coelenterates and other metazoa of the Ediacarian period, 575 to 560 million years ago. These fossils are records of the oldest known complex life forms that existed anywhere on Earth. Misra was the first to prepare and present a systematic geological map of the region, to classify and describe the rock sequence of the area and to work out the depositional history of the rocks. The description of the fossil assemblage together with their mode of occurrence, the cause of sudden death, ecological conditions and chronological position form part of Misra's detailed thesis submitted for the degree of Master of Science. The discovery was reported in a 1968 letter to Nature. Misra described the Mistaken Point fauna in detail in 1969, in a paper published in the Bulletin of the Geological Society of America. He sorted the fossil assemblage into five groups, namely spindle-shaped, leaf-shaped, round lobate, dendrite like, and radiating. Each group was defined in terms of distribution and form, sub-categories and biological affinity. The geological environment of the fossil-bearing rocks and the ecology of the animals that lived and died in the Conception Sea were described by Misra in two of his subsequent papers published in the Bulletin of the Geological Society of America in 1971 and in the Journal of the Geological Society of India in 1981. Mistaken Point Ecological Reserve is a 5.7-square kilometer area of the coast that protects the fossils.

Founded as a weekly newspaper in 1840, it was acquired by the then-independent local publisher Patuxent Publishing Company in 1978, along with other local papers. The Howard County Times is currently a unit of the Baltimore Sun Media Group and maintains its online news page on The Baltimore Sun website. The Howard County Times website and social media pages provide news items from the Times as well as several other local area newspapers and magazines, including the Columbia Flier, the Laurel Leader, and Howard magazine. History The Howard County Times was founded on 17 March 1840, in Ellicott City, the major town along the upper branches of the Patapsco River (and future county seat) of Howard County, Maryland, just west of Baltimore, the major city and port of Maryland, when Edward Waite and Matthew Fields purchased the Howard Free Press. The name changed again to the Howard District Press (When the county was briefly known as the Western or Howard District of neighboring older Anne Arundel County). The name changed again to The Howard Gazette just prior to the American Civil War. In 1869, the Howard County Times was created with the merger of the Howard County Record, founded by John R. Brown. In 1882, Edwin Warfield, (1848-1920), later Governor of Maryland at the turn of the 19th Century (and future banker and founder/publisher of The Daily Record, a legal/business/finance newspaper (published Monday‚ÄìFriday) in Baltimore purchased the paper while running for office. In 1920, the paper was owned by Judge James A. Clark, Sr., Paul Talbot and Paul G. (\\"Pete\\") Stromberg, (1892-1952), took over as editor. Paul \\"Pete\\" Stromberg became a state senator and editor of The Sun, a major daily newspaper in Baltimore. Which coincidentally, decades later would see The Sunpapers, along with its later syndicate chain owner, the Tribune Company (of the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times), would in turn absorb the Howard County Times in a later merger with its last independent publisher, the Patuxent Publishing Company of Columbia, Maryland. In 1940, Stromberg took control of the Maryland Printing and Publishing Company which gave him sole ownership of the Howard County paper. Stromberg in turn created or purchased over the next few post-war years, 11 new local papers in the suburban (Baltimore County) or outlying Baltimore City communities/neighborhoods ringing around Baltimore, naming his syndicate as the \\"Stromberg Newspapers\\" and employed his nephew Charles L Gerwig as editor. Some of these were the Arbutus Times, Catonsville Times, Owings Mills Times, Towson Times, The Jeffersonian, Northeast Record, Northeast Booster, [North] Baltimore Messenger (Baltimore City) and the Laurel Leader (Anne Arundel County/Prince George's County). Stromberg's editorial influence helped his brother-in-law Norman E. Moxley become a member of the Howard County Board of County Commissioners in 1949, Edgar Russell Moxley to become County Police Chief, his daughter Doris Thompson to become chairman of the planning commission and Robert Moxley, a prominent land developer purchasing land for the Rouse Company of famous nationally known mall developer James Rouse, (1914-1996). In 1965, The Columbia Times was created as a spin-off newspaper. Stromberg's daughter Doris Stromberg Thompson took over as editor from 1966 to 1978. =Acquisition by Patuxent Publishing= The Columbia Flier was established in 1969, just two years after Rouse began development of Columbia was formed a coupon flier for the new development of Columbia. As the new town grew, owner Zeke Orlinsky's paper served a larger market than the Times, eventually purchasing the newer paper. Editor Tom Graham would use the paper to encourage the growth of Columbia promoting political candidates that supported the project. In 1978, Rouse Company Architect Robert Moon designed a new headquarters for the Patuxent Publishing Company in a modernistic building at 10750 Little Patuxent Parkway leading into central Columbia. Moon's wife, worked at the firm as well, becoming editor of the Columbia Flier and then general manager of Patuxent Publishing. The Baltimore Sun media group purchased Patuxent Publishing Company, including the Howard County Times and Columbia Flier, integrating the local papers. The Columbia Flier building was put up for sale, but no tenants were signed on for over three years. In 2014, Former Baltimore Sun editor, and now Public relations director for Howard County David Nitkin announced that the County Executive Ken Ulman directed the purchase of the Flier building by the County for $2.8 million. County Councilperson, Mary Kay Sigaty announced the building where her husband Tom Graham used to work as an editor would be rebuilt as a replacement headquarters for the county's Economic Development Authority and the Maryland Center for Entrepreneurship. The Howard County Times has since been integrated as a unit of the newly organized local publisher Baltimore Sun Media Group under the former Times Mirror Group of the Los Angeles Times, and later under the purchase of the Tribune Company syndicate of the Chicago Tribune.

The format comprised a dramatised horror story of approximately half an hour in length, introduced by a character known as the Man in Black. The plays themselves were a mixture of classic horror stories by writers such as Edgar Allan Poe, M. R. James and W. W. Jacobs, and commissioned stories by new or established writers. Many of the stories in the early series were written or adapted by John Dickson Carr. Appointment with Fear (1943-1955 and 1976) Appointment with Fear ran for nine series between 1943 and 1955, initially on the BBC Home Service and from September 1945 on the Light Programme. The Man in Black was played by the British character actor Valentine Dyall, except in the second series where he was portrayed by Dyall's father Franklin Dyall.

It states that if is a closed subgroup of a Lie group , then is an embedded Lie group with the smooth structure (and hence the group topology) agreeing with the embedding. Theorem 20.10. Lee states and proves this theorem in all generality. Theorem 1, Section 2.7 Rossmann states the theorem for linear groups. The statement is that there is an open subset such that is an analytic bijection onto an open neighborhood of in . For linear groups, Hall proves a similar result in Corollary 3.45. One of several results known as Cartan's theorem, it was first published in 1930 by √âlie Cartan, See ¬ß 26. who was inspired by John von Neumann's 1929 proof of a special case for groups of linear transformations.; .  Overview Let G be a Lie group with Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}. Now let H be an arbitrary closed subgroup of G. Our goal is to show that H is a smooth embedded submanifold of G. Our first step is to identify something that could be the Lie algebra of H, that is, the tangent space of H at the identity. The challenge is that H is not assumed to have any smoothness and therefore it is not clear how one may define its tangent space. To proceed, we define the \\"Lie algebra\\" \\\\mathfrak{h} of H by the formula :\\\\mathfrak{h}=\\\\\\\\{ X\\\\mid e^{tX}\\\\in H,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\forall t\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\\\\\}. It is not difficult to show that \\\\mathfrak{h} is a Lie subalgebra of \\\\mathfrak{g}. Theorem 3.20 In particular, \\\\mathfrak{h} is a subspace of \\\\mathfrak{g}, which we might hope could be the tangent space of H at the identity. For this idea to work, however, we need to know that \\\\mathfrak{h} is big enough to capture some interesting information about H. If, for example, H were some large subgroup of G but \\\\mathfrak{h} turned out to be zero, \\\\mathfrak{h} would not be helpful to us. The key step, then, is to show that \\\\mathfrak{h} actually captures all the elements of H that are sufficiently close to the identity. That is to say, we need to show that the following critical lemma holds: :Lemma: Take a small neighborhood U of the origin in \\\\mathfrak{g} such that the exponential map sends U diffeomorphically onto some neighborhood V of the identity in G, and let \\\\log:V\\\\rightarrow U be the inverse of the exponential map. Then there is some smaller neighborhood W\\\\subset V such that if h belongs to W\\\\cap H, then \\\\log(h) belongs to \\\\mathfrak{h}. Theorem 3.42 Once this has been established, one can use exponential coordinates on W, that is, writing each g\\\\in W (not necessarily in H) as g=e^X for X=\\\\log(g). In these coordinates, the lemma says that X corresponds to a point in H precisely if X belongs to \\\\mathfrak{h}\\\\subset\\\\mathfrak{g}. That is to say, in exponential coordinates near the identity, H looks like \\\\mathfrak{h}\\\\subset\\\\mathfrak{g}. Since \\\\mathfrak{h} is just a subspace of \\\\mathfrak{g}, this means that \\\\mathfrak{h}\\\\subset\\\\mathfrak{g} is just like \\\\mathbb{R}^k\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^n, with k=\\\\dim(\\\\mathfrak{h}) and n=\\\\dim(\\\\mathfrak{g}). Thus, we have exhibited a \\"slice coordinate system\\" in which H\\\\subset G looks locally like \\\\mathbb{R}^k\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^n, which is the condition for an embedded submanifold. Chapter 5 It is worth noting that Rossmann shows that for any subgroup H of G (not necessarily closed), the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{h} of H is a Lie subalgebra of \\\\mathfrak{g}. Chapter 2, Proposition 1 and Corollary 7 Rossmann then goes on to introduce coordinates Section 2.3 on H that make the identity component of H into a Lie group. It is important to note, however, that the topology on H coming from these coordinates is not the subset topology. That it so say, the identity component of H is an immersed submanifold of G but not an embedded submanifold. In particular, the lemma stated above does not hold if H is not closed. Example of a non-closed subgroup The torus . Imagine a bent helix laid out on the surface picturing . If in lowest terms, the helix will close up on itself at after rotations in and q rotations in . If is irrational, the helix winds indefinitely. For an example of a subgroup that is not an embedded Lie subgroup, consider the torus and an \\"irrational winding of the torus\\". :G = \\\\mathbb{T}^2 = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\left .\\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix}e^{2\\\\pi i\\\\theta} & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\0 & e^{2\\\\pi i\\\\phi} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right)\\\\right| \\\\theta, \\\\phi \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, and its subgroup :H = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\left .\\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix}e^{2\\\\pi i\\\\theta} & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\0 & e^{2\\\\pi ia\\\\theta}\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right) \\\\right| \\\\theta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\text{with Lie algebra } \\\\mathfrak{h} = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\left .\\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix} i\\\\theta & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\0 & ia\\\\theta\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right)\\\\right| \\\\theta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, with irrational. Then is dense in and hence not closed. Example 7.3 In the relative topology, a small open subset of is composed of infinitely many almost parallel line segments on the surface of the torus. This means that is not locally path connected. In the group topology, the small open sets are single line segments on the surface of the torus and is locally path connected. The example shows that for some groups one can find points in an arbitrarily small neighborhood in the relative topology of the identity that are exponentials of elements of , yet they cannot be connected to the identity with a path staying in . See comment to Corollary 5, Section 2.2. The group is not a Lie group. While the map is an analytic bijection, its inverse is not continuous. That is, if corresponds to a small open interval , there is no open with due to the appearance of the sets . However, with the group topology , is a Lie group. With this topology the injection is an analytic injective immersion, but not a homeomorphism, hence not an embedding. There are also examples of groups for which one can find points in an arbitrarily small neighborhood (in the relative topology) of the identity that are not exponentials of elements of . For closed subgroups this is not the case as the proof below of the theorem shows.  Applications  Because of the conclusion of the theorem, some authors chose to define linear Lie groups or matrix Lie groups as closed subgroups of or .E.g. . See definition in Chapter 1. In this setting, one proves that every element of the group sufficiently close to the identity is the exponential of an element of the Lie algebra. Theorem 3.42 (The proof is practically identical to the proof of the closed subgroup theorem presented below.) It follows every closed subgroup is an embedded submanifold of Corollary 3.45 The homogeneous space construction theorem states :If is a closed Lie subgroup, then , the left coset space, has a unique real-analytic manifold structure such that the quotient map is an analytic submersion. The left action given by turns into a homogeneous -space. The closed subgroup theorem now simplifies the hypotheses considerably, a priori widening the class of homogeneous spaces. Every closed subgroup yields a homogeneous space. In a similar way, the closed subgroup theorem simplifies the hypothesis in the following theorem. :If is a set with transitive group action and the isotropy group or stabilizer of a point is a closed Lie subgroup, then has a unique smooth manifold structure such that the action is smooth. Conditions for being closed A few sufficient conditions for being closed, hence an embedded Lie group, is given below. *All classical groups are closed in , where , or , the quaternions. *A subgroup that is locally closed is closed. Problem 1. Section 2.7 A subgroup is locally closed if every point has a neighborhood in such that is closed in . *If }, where is a compact group and is a closed set, then is closed. Problem 3. Section 2.7 *If is a Lie subalgebra such that for no , then , the group generated by , is closed in . Problem 4. Section 2.7 *If , then the one-parameter subgroup generated by is not closed if and only if is similar over to a diagonal matrix with two entries of irrational ratio. Problem 5. Section 2.7 *Let be a Lie subalgebra. If there is a simply connected compact group K with isomorphic to , then is closed in . The result follows from Theorem 5.6 *If G is simply connected and is an ideal, then the connected Lie subgroup with Lie algebra is closed. Exercise 14 in Chapter 3  Converse  An embedded Lie subgroup is closed Corollary 15.30. so a subgroup is an embedded Lie subgroup if and only if it is closed. Equivalently, is an embedded Lie subgroup if and only if its group topology equals its relative topology. Problem 2. Section 2.7.  Proof  John von Neumann in 1929 proved the theorem in the case of matrix groups as given here. He was prominent in many areas, including quantum mechanics, set theory and the foundations of mathematics. The proof is given for matrix groups with for concreteness and relative simplicity, since matrices and their exponential mapping are easier concepts than in the general case. Historically, this case was proven first, by John von Neumann in 1929, and inspired Cartan to prove the full closed subgroup theorem in 1930. The proof for general is formally identical,See for instance Chapter 21 except that elements of the Lie algebra are left invariant vector fields on and the exponential mapping is the time one flow of the vector field. If with closed in , then is closed in , so the specialization to instead of arbitrary matters little. =Proof of the key lemma= We begin by establishing the key lemma stated in the \\"overview\\" section above. Endow with an inner product (e.g., the Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt inner product), and let be the Lie algebra of defined as }. Let }, the orthogonal complement of . Then decomposes as the direct sum , so each is uniquely expressed as with . Define a map by . Expand the exponentials, :\\\\Phi(S,T) = e^{tS}e^{tT} = I + tS + tT + O(t^2), and the pushforward or differential at , is seen to be , i.e. , the identity. The hypothesis of the inverse function theorem is satisfied with analytic, and thus there are open sets with and such that is a real-analytic bijection from to with analytic inverse. It remains to show that and contain open sets and such that the conclusion of the theorem holds. Consider a countable neighborhood basis at , linearly ordered by reverse inclusion with .For this one can choose open balls, for some large enough such that . Here the metric obtained from the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product is used. Suppose for the purpose of obtaining a contradiction that for all , contains an element that is not on the form . Then, since is a bijection on the , there is a unique sequence , with and such that converging to because is a neighborhood basis, with . Since and , as well. Normalize the sequence in , . It takes its values in the unit sphere in and since it is compact, there is a convergent subsequence converging to . By problem 17G, s is sequentially compact, meaning every sequence has a convergent subsequence. The index henceforth refers to this subsequence. It will be shown that . Fix and choose a sequence of integers such that as . For example, such that will do, as ‚Üí 0. Then :(e^{S_i})^{m_i} = e^{m_iS_i} = e^{m_i\\\\|S_i\\\\| Y_i} \\\\rightarrow e^{t Y}. Since is a group, the left hand side is in for all . Since is closed, , Corollary 10.5. hence . This is a contradiction. Hence, for some the sets and satisfy and the exponential restricted to the open set is in analytic bijection with the open set . This proves the lemma. =Proof of the theorem= For , the image in of under form a neighborhood basis at . This is, by the way it is constructed, a neighborhood basis both in the group topology and the relative topology. Since multiplication in is analytic, the left and right translates of this neighborhood basis by a group element gives a neighborhood basis at . These bases restricted to gives neighborhood bases at all . The topology generated by these bases is the relative topology. The conclusion is that the relative topology is the same as the group topology. Next, construct coordinate charts on . First define . This is an analytic bijection with analytic inverse. Furthermore, if , then . By fixing a basis for and identifying with , then in these coordinates , where is the dimension of . This shows that is a slice chart. By translating the charts obtained from the countable neighborhood basis used above one obtains slice charts around every point in . This shows that is an embedded submanifold of . Moreover, multiplication , and inversion in are analytic since these operations are analytic in and restriction to a submanifold (embedded or immersed) with the relative topology again yield analytic operations and . Proposition 8.22. But since is embedded, and are analytic as well. Corollary 8.25.  See also  *Inverse function theorem *Lie correspondence  Notes   References  *.

The rivalry between these two schools, located about apart, dates to their first meeting in 1896. They are founding members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC), and are currently members of the SEC's Eastern Division with a total of 92 meetings. This rivalry is Kentucky's second longest behind Tennessee and Vanderbilt's third behind Ole Miss and Tennessee. Kentucky leads the series 46‚Äì42‚Äì4.College Football Data Warehouse, Kentucky vs Vanderbilt. Retrieved July 15, 2014. 38 of the 92 games have been decided by 7 points or less. Kentucky has shut out Vanderbilt 6 times, while Vanderbilt has shut out Kentucky 15 times, 10 of which were from 1896 to 1920. The rivalry is one of the most evenly matched in the SEC, like the Kentucky‚ÄìMississippi State football rivalry. History =First game (1896)= The first game between Vanderbilt and Kentucky (then known as Kentucky State) was played in Nashville on October 10, 1896. Vanderbilt won the first game, 6‚Äì0, with Vanderbilt's captain and fullback, Connel, making a touchdown and kicking the goal after touchdown. =Early dominance by Vanderbilt= Vanderbilt dominated the series in the early years of competition. Between 1896 and 1938, the programs played 17 games. Vanderbilt won 16 of those games, the only exception being a scoreless tie in 1919. In 1916, the dedication for Stoll Field was celebrated during the Kentucky-Vanderbilt game. In 1921, after being shut out by Vanderbilt in 11 consecutive games, Kentucky scored two touchdowns but lost by a 21‚Äì14 score. =Kentucky's first victory (1939)= On October 7, 1939, Kentucky won its first game in the series, defeating Vanderbilt by a 21-13 score before a crowd of 10,000 in Nashville. The Wildcats were led by the passing and running of sophomore Ermal Allen. Kentucky quarterback Joe Shepherd also intercepted a Vanderbilt pass and returned it 70 yards for a touchdown. =Kentucky dominates in the Bryant years= In 1946, Bear Bryant took over as Kentucky's head football coach. In his first season, the Wildcats defeated the Commodores by a 10‚Äì7 score. Bryant led his team to its second consecutive victory in 1947, this time by a 14‚Äì0 score. After a four-year hiatus in the rivalry from 1949 to 1952, the rivalry resumed in 1953 with Kentucky winning by a 40‚Äì14 score. Bryant left Kentucky after the 1953 season. =Collier years= Blanton Collier took over as Kentucky's head coach in 1954. He remained in that position through the 1961 season and compiled a 4‚Äì3‚Äì1 record against Vanderbilt. =Bradshaw years= Charlie Bradshaw served as Kentucky's head football coach from 1962 to 1968.

Context: Battle of At Tiri On 6 April, clashes between UNIFIL peacekeepers and the South Lebanon Army (an Israeli-backed Christian militia) at At Tiri began, when the SLA attacked Irish troops based in the village. The Irish soldiers held their ground and called in Dutch and Fijian peacekeepers as reinforcements. The battle ended on 12 April when the Dutch contingent employed TOW missiles against the SLA. During the battle, two UNIFIL peacekeepers were killed: Stephen Griffin, a 21-year-old Private from the 46th Irish Battalion (and a native of Rahoon in County Galway), and Sevati Sovonaivalu of the Fijian Army. One SLA soldier, 19-year old Massoud Bazzi, was also killed. Following the battle, Major Saad Haddad of the SLA gave an ultimatum to UNIFIL to either compensate the family of Massoud Bazzi or to produce the bodies of the two deceased UN soldiers. Deaths of Privates Barrett and Smallhorne On 18 April, a UNIFIL party set out to a UN post near the Israeli border to provide supplies. The party consisted of three Irish soldiers (Private John O'Mahony (from Killarney), Private Thomas Barrett (from Cork), and Private Derek Smallhorne (from Dublin)), an American officer named Harry Klein, a French officer named Patrick Vincent, and two journalists. They were intercepted by the SLA and taken prisoners. The US officer, Harry Klein, later noted that the operation was not properly planned and should have been coordinated with militia leaders and the Israelis. He added that helicopters could have been used instead to resupply the post. The convoy also went ahead without an escort, and everyone except for two of the Irish soldiers was unarmed. Klein ordered it to continue even after warning signs became apparent along the route when it passed through a normally busy militia checkpoint. Ultimately, it was intercepted by the militia, who brought the convoy's occupants to a derelict schoolhouse before removing the Irish peace-keepers. The party was taken to a school building and held in a bathroom, where they were interrogated. The SLA men asked all of the captives their nationalities, and singled out the three Irishmen. One of the SLA men [Mahmoud] began talking about his late brother [Massoud]. According to O'Mahony the man talking about his brother, who he would later identify as Mahmoud Bazzi, and another man escorted them down a flight of stairs, where Bazzi shot him and left him there. Although badly wounded, O'Mahony survived. Barrett and Smallhorne escaped the building when the shooting began, but were recaptured by SLA men outside. The remaining members of the party left the building, with Klein carrying the wounded O'Mahony to a vehicle. One of the journalists claimed he saw Barrett and Smallhorne in the back of a car that was speeding away. Barrett and Smallhorne were later found dead nearby. They had been shot dead and their bodies showed signs of torture. Trial Mahmoud Bazzi, the brother of Massoud Bazzi, who had been killed in Battle of At Tiri, who was also member of the SLA, is the primary suspect in the murders. Shortly after the incident, he openly admitted to killing Barrett and Smallhorne on Lebanese television and claimed he did so to avenge his brother, but later retracted his statements, claiming his commander had forced him. In 1994, he was granted asylum in the United States, and worked as an ice cream vendor in Dearborn, Michigan. U.S. authorities interviewed one of the journalists involved and O'Mahony, and expressed their willingness to testify against Bazzi, but claimed that they did not hear anything more from the authorities for years. Bazzi was also interviewed by officials. In 2013, he applied for U.S. citizenship, but the application stalled when the investigation picked up. In July 2014, Bazzi was arrested for \\"administrative immigration violations\\" by US federal agents at his Dearborn home. He was alleged to have entered the United States on a false passport. Friends and relatives of Privates Barrett and Smallhorne had been seeking his deportation to Lebanon to face war crimes charges. In August 2014, Bazzi confessed to immigration fraud and agreed to be deported to Lebanon. In late 2015, Mahmoud Bazzi was arrested and put on trial before a Beirut military court with a seven-judge panel. John O'Mahony gave evidence during the trial, and positively identified Bazzi as the man who shot him and led Barrett and Smallhorne away. He was protected at all times by a Close Protection Team from the Irish Army Ranger Wing. The trial was adjourned until April 2016, and on 8 September 2016 was further adjourned. In 2018 it was reported that Bazzi had been found guilty in a Lebanese military court of \\"collaboration with Israel\\" and sentenced to 5 years \\"hard labour\\". A hearing on the murder charges was due to occur in late June 2018.

It was deposited in a lacustrine environment and includes fossils of fish and land plants, as well as trace fossils. It also includes significant deposits of oil shale. The oil shale beds are the source rocks for the petroleum and natural gas that has been produced from Albert Formation reservoirs at the Stoney Creek and McCully fields. In addition, the solid asphalt-like hydrocarbon albertite was mined from the Albert Formation at Albert Mines between 1854 and 1884. Lithology and mineralogy The Albert Formation includes sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, and oil shale, with minor limestone and conglomerate. The oil shale beds are primarily kerogen-rich calcareous to dolomitic marlstones, clay marlstones, and laminated marlstones.Macauley, G., Ball, F.D. and Powell, T.G. 1984. A review of the Carboniferous Albert Formation oil shales of New Brunswick. Bulletin of Canadian Petroleum Geology, vol. 32, no. 1, p. 27-37. The formation also includes local deposits of the evaporite minerals halite (rock salt), gypsum, anhydrite, and glauberite. The solid hydrocarbon albertite occurs as veins filling fissures in some of the beds, and is derived from the hydrocarbons in the oil shales. Environment of deposition The Albert Formation has been interpreted as a composite alluvial fan, fluvial-deltaic, and lacustrine sequence. The coarser-grained lithologies are nearshore deposits, while the finer-grained rocks, including the oil shale beds, are an offshore, deeper-water assemblage. Fossils of whole fish preserved in the laminated oil shales indicate very low energy, anoxic conditions.

The business evolved into a multi-disciplined business with contract building, speculative house building and land development activities.http://eckomedia.com.au/56/wincrest-homes-knock-down-rebuild/ In 2005, Wincrest Homes started a home building business in Melbourne, Australia. In 2009, with the effects of the Global Financial Crisis, land was difficult to sell and the Melbourne side of the business proved to be unprofitable. The combination of factors led to the directors making the decision to restructure the business to enable the Sydney contract building business to continue. All other activities outside of this were stopped. This strategy was successful and today Wincrest Homes continues to build contract homes.  Projects  The Hunterford Estate The Hunterford estate,http://www.hunterfordestate.org.au/ situated off Pennant Hills Road at Oatlands, New South WalesElmswood was a joint venture between Landcom and St Hillier's and involved 3 builders constructing approximately 150 dwellings to conform to strict design guidelines. With the assistance of Arcoessence Architects, Wincrest Homes designed and built a range of housing types including terraces with rear lane garage access, duplexes and triplexes, courtyard homes on 300m2 lots with rear garage access, as well as split level designs on traditional manor lots. All homes were completed in the arts and crafts architectural style. The project won the 2003 Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) Premiers Award and the National UDIA award for marketing and the Premiers award in the 2003 Australian Institute of Architects NSW annual awards. Honeysuckle Development Linwood Village This innovative development is situated in the precinct of Newcastle's harbour, which is being redeveloped by the Honeysuckle Development Corporation. A multi-builder approach was adopted by the developer with Wincrest Homes building a major proportion of the dwellings. The development consisted of super lots of terrace with rear lane access to garages. Individual terrace lots varied in width from 4.5 metres to 6.5 metres. A total of 56 terraces in four stages have been completed. Linwood Shores Wincrest Homes were selected as the sole builder to complete the remainder of the project. Construction includes 49 Terrace dwellings with separate garages. There are also 15 Mews Apartments constructed above some of the garages which are strata titled separate from the main dwelling.

Life He was the only child of the Dachau shoemaker and founding member of the Dachau choir, the Liedertafel, Alois Fleischmann (1844‚Äì1914) and of Magdalena n√©e Deger (1846‚Äì1928). From 1887‚Äì1894 he attended the Dachau primary school for boys. He was given private classes in music, music theory and Latin and in 1896 he was admitted to the preparatory two-year course at the Royal Academy of Music in Munich. Having passed the entrance examination, he studied there from 1898‚Äì1901 taking the subjects organ, conducting and, with Josef Rheinberger, composition. He graduated with first class honours in all subjects. In January 1902 he was appointed organist and choirmaster to the parish church of St. Jakob in Dachau. There he founded a choir school and a school of music, in which children could learn music and purchase instruments at minimal cost. With the support of musician friends in Munich and members of the artists‚Äô colony of Dachau (Hans von Hayek, Adolf H√∂lzel, August Pfaltz, Hermann Stockmann) he worked to revive the local tradition of Christmas children‚Äôs festivals, composing the music for a nativity play every year from 1903‚Äì1906. In 1905 he produced his Die Nacht der Wunder [The Night of Wonders] based on a text by Selma Lagerl√∂f, with stage design and costumes by von Hayek, Pfaltz and Stockmann. The Dachau orchestral musicians (including Adolf H√∂lzel) were augmented by members of the Munich court orchestra and choir.Joseph P. Cunningham, Ruth Fleischmann, S√©amas de Barra: Aloys Fleischmann (1880-1964) Immigrant Musician in Ireland, Cork University Press 2010, pp. 11‚Äì45.

Her parents had emigrated from Dachau to Cork in 1879, where her father, Hans Conrad Swertz, became organist and choirmaster at the Catholic Cathedral of St Mary and St Anne. In 1906, Fleischmann was appointed to his father-in-law‚Äôs post in Cork; he worked there until 1961, when his health failed.On Hans-Conrad Swertz see the Cathedral of St. Mary and St. Anne website . Being a subject of Kaiser Wilhelm II, Aloys Fleischmann was declared an enemy alien by the British Government during the First World War and was interned on 4 January 1916, at first in Oldcastle, County Meath and from 1918 on the Isle of Man, from where he was deported to the Weimar Republic in 1919. Not until September 1920 was he permitted to return to Ireland. In the independent Irish Free State, he took on new responsibilities in addition to his work at the cathedral. From 1920‚Äì58 he taught singing and piano at the seminary of the diocese of Cork, St Finbarr‚Äôs College Farranferris; from 1922‚Äì37 he was professor of harmony and choral singing at the Cork School of Music.Joseph P.

Life History Female beetles locate fan palms and tunnel into the crowns, and are followed into the tunnels by males. Mating occurs in the tunnels, which can be up to ten inches deep. Mated females deposit eggs in the tunnels, and they hatch within several days. The grubs feed for one to several years, tunneling as they feed, before maturing and metamorphosing into adult beetles. Individual adults live about two weeks, and do not feed as adults; though they are quite large (approx. 5 cm, or 2 in.), all the nutrition needed is acquired by the larvae.

The operator is AKA, the extended-stay hotel brand owned by Korman Communities. AKA White House opened in 2005. About the hotel =The Metropolitan Building= 1710 H Street NW was constructed in 1958. Originally known as the Metropolitan Building, it was considered one of the finest Modern architecture structures in the city. It was occupied for many years by the Bell Atlantic subsidiary of AT&T;, which purchased the building in 1967. The building was shuttered in 1990, and some time after 1997 to H Street Associates, a consortium of developers. =Conversion to AKA White House= In May 2004, H Street Associates proposed converting the building into condominiums. Later that year, however, the property was purchased by Korman Communities, a fourth-generation family-owned real estate development company. Korman Communities intended to create a mix of standard long-term-contract apartments and short-term extended-stay hotel units. But the leasing of extended-stay units was so popular that the company decided to convert all units to extended-stay hotel rooms. Korman Communities gave control over the property to AKA, its extend-stay hotel brand. AKA invested $50 million to transform the office building into luxury extended-stay hotel rooms. =Hotel rooms and amenities= As constructed in 2005, the AKA White House had 141 rooms. Units featured brushed stainless steel fixtures, dark wood parquet floors, and marble countertops in the kitchen. Kitchens were fully outfitted with refrigerator, oven, stove, microwave oven, dishwasher, toaster, coffee maker, and a complete set of cookware. Each unit was outfitted with a large, flat- screen television and DVD player in the living room and each bedroom; a stereo system in the living room; high-speed Internet access in the living room, dining room, and each bedroom; and a front-loading washer and dryer. All units featured an open floor plan and high ceilings. Most of the units were one- and two-bedroom apartments. The top four units, however, were penthouse suites, which featured higher ceilings, a balcony complete with table and chairs, and a private elevator. AKA White House also featured a business center (with conference room), fitness center, day spa, and rooftop deck with a retractable canopy. A cafe, Heidi's Brooklyn Deli, originally existed on the first (street) floor. Hotel amenities included a concierge and daily or weekly maid service, but no room service (although a continental breakfast was offered on weekdays). Prices for AKA White House in 2005 were $165 ($ in dollars) a day for a one-bedroom unit to $595 ($ in dollars) to $895 ($ in dollars) a day for penthouse suites. AKA White House requires a minimum stay of 30 days, with 15 days notice before a guest moves out. Most guests two to three months, although some stay as long as a year. Many companies rent units on long-term contracts. 2011 renovation AKA White House spent about $2.5 million to renovate its ground floor in 2011. The floor underwent a build-out that created a lobby. Heidi's Brooklyn Deli vacated as a tenant, and the space converted into a new lounge area. An espresso bar, cafe, and bar were added to the lounge. The espresso bar and cocktail bar opened in early December 2011, and the lounge bgan serving light food in 2012. References Category:Modernist architecture in Washington, D.C.

Located in McLean, it is bordered by Virginia State Route 193 to its south, Interstate 495 to its east and the Potomac River to its north. It encompasses of woodland with its namesake, Scott's Run, flowing through its west side. Scott's Run originates in nearby Tysons Corner and enters the Potomac on the northwest side of the preserve. The preserve is noted for including eastern hemlocks among its plant life, which are rare for the area. It is a popular destination for recreation and hiking and is operated by the Fairfax County Park Authority. History The confluence of Scott's Run with the Potomac River Before the property was owned by Fairfax County, it belonged Edward B. Burling, a co-founder of the Covington & Burling law firm. During the 1920s Burling purchased the land for $200 an acre and built a cabin on the north side. He used the property for relaxation and informal business meetings. After Burling's death in October 1966, his descendants sold the property to Miller & Smith Associates (MSA) to avoid its tax burdens. MSA planned to build 309 luxury homes on what was known as the \\"Burling Tract\\". Plans also included leaving 52 percent of the land relatively untouched. When Elizabeth Miles Cooke, who lived next to the tract, noticed it was slated for development, she help organize an opposition. After a lengthy debate between citizens, the Virginia Governor, several U.S. senators, developers, and local organizations, voters opted to raise their taxes in a referendum on July 14, 1970. The measure would secure $1.5 million in order to help purchase the land. An additional $1.5 million in funding was provided by the Department of the Interior and $0.6 million from state and local governments.

(often referred to as Treats, Treats!, Treats Magazine or Treats! Magazine) is an American limited-edition erotica and fine arts magazine that is primarily available by subscription. The magazine, which debuted in 2011, is described as a quarterly although it was initially only published twice a year. Content treats! describes itself as \\"a limited edition, fine art print & digital publication available only by subscription & sold at news- stands, book stores & worldwide.\\" The literary content of the magazine has been described as \\"left-of-center\\" by Daily Beast. The magazine, which is based in Los Angeles, is described by USA Today, The Huffington Post, and The New York Times as an artistic erotica magazine. Adam Tschorn of the Los Angeles Times noted that his \\"copilot\\" felt that the magazine's nude photography was \\"virtually indistinguishable\\" from Playboy despite the \\"fine arts quarterly\\" billing. Publication history Steve Shaw, the magazine's publisher, has a background in celebrity glamour photography for Maxim, FHM, Playboy, and British Esquire. He states that he had become irritated with shooting restrictions such as \\"three quarters of one side of a boob... You can only show one inch down from the bum crack...\\" and with uncooperative subjects. Thus, he says, he created his own magazine with what Daily Beast described as \\"female full-frontal nudity, luxe-y aesthetic, and [an] underpinning of fashion-world credibility\\" that has gotten \\"influential tastemakers and industry icons\\" to take notice. According to Shaw, treats! was founded to present content that was too risqu√© for magazines such as Vogue, Elle and InStyle. Shaw's nickname for photos that could not be used because they pushed the borders too far was \\"treats\\", and he decided to use the nickname as the title for the magazine. The magazine presents images that have not been airbrushed or photographically retouched. Shaw's initial investment for his magazine was $600,000. Editorial offices are at La Brea Avenue in Los Angeles. Shaw served as editor-in-chief and publisher; Rob Hill was editor; Eric Roinestad was art director and Rebecca Black was director of photography. Shaw publishes the magazine independently with a staff of three people. Hill had previously been editor of Hollywood Life magazine. Shaw and the magazine throw an annual Halloween \\"Trick or Treats\\" party. Tony Duran photo of Irene Lambers and Cassy Gerasimova|left The launch party for the magazine was held on February 24, 2011 at the James Goldstein residence as an Oscars-week party before the 83rd Academy Awards. Issue 1 of the magazine, which had no advertisements, debuted with a cover photo of models Irene Lambers and Cassy Gerasimova photographed by Tony Duran that was described by Business Wire as \\"edgy, scintillating and elegant\\". The issue featured the classic picture of Raquel Welch on the cross taken by Terry O'Neill. Articles in the premier include features on Jason Statham and Shepard Fairey. Five thousand copies were printed of the debut issue, and 10,000 for issue 2. Its launch was recognised with a \\"best new launch\\" award of 2011 by the Media Industry Newsletter (MIN). The magazine debuted prices of $20 at the newsstand price, $65 for an annual subscription price and $15 for a download. With the fourth issue the newsstand price changed to $30. In 2012, the magazine added an online gallery that sold prints of the magazine's content at prices ranging from $395 to $3,995--depending on size and framing. Emily Ratajkowski posed for several of the early issues. She states that her appearance on the March 2012 issue 3 cover is what brought her two unsolicited high-profile music video modeling roles (Robin Thicke, T.I., and Pharrell Williams' \\"Blurred Lines\\" and Maroon 5's \\"Love Somebody\\"). Thicke had seen the treats! magazine black-and-white cover and convinced director Diane Martel to cast her in the \\"Blurred Lines\\" music video. Within the first year of its launch photographers, including Brett Ratner, were volunteering to shoot for the magazine. As of 2014, Duran, Mark Seliger, Ben Watts, Josh Ryan and Bob Carlos Clarke are among the photographers who have been featured in the magazine. The cover of the seventh issue of treats!, which was published in April 2014, featured Dylan Penn, daughter of Sean Penn and Robin Wright, nude, albeit with a Fendi bag strategically placed in front of her groin, with similar placements used in her interior pictorial. Penn was photographed by Duran. According to an E! Online report on March 5, 2014, Penn had declined a $150,000 offer to pose for the cover of Playboy. The eighth issue (featuring Lydia Hearst on the cover) was released in February 2015.  Legal  In 2018, the owner and publisher, Steve Shaw, was sued by the Winklevoss twins who alleged Shaw mismanaged $1.3 million that they had invested in the magazine. By turn, Shaw alleges the Winklevoss twins used the magazine to \\"advance their sleazy agenda,\\" and that no funds were mismanaged. Shaw further alleged that the Winklevoss' \\"promise to publicly announce their investment in Treats! and use their brand to grow the company induced Shaw and Treats! to perform personal and professional favors for them.\\" This counterclaim was dismissed by the Chancery Court. This decision was the subject of an article on the Laches Defence in the National Law Review on March 27, 2019. Format The magazine offers both print and digital subscriptions and has back issues available for sale in both formats. It sells high quality fine art prints from its photo collection for several hundreds of dollars per print. Although it claims to be a quarterly magazine, treats has published just two issues per year for each calendar year of its existence to date: 2011, 2012, and 2013. One issue was published in 2014. The print editions are produced in oversized format on 70 lb. matte stock. The magazine is also available digitally in several formats such as on Zinio for iPad and as a mobile phone app as well as via the official website, a blog, and various social media websites.

The Spanish general quickly massed his troops and assaulted the French center, forcing it to withdraw. B√†scara is located north of Girona, Spain.

However, subsequent operations were not successful and P√©rignon was replaced by Sch√©rer. The French government ordered the army to stand on the defensive.

It follows Ana Eberling, the protagonist, as she attempts to solve the mystery of her father's disappearance. As the plot unfolds, Ana discovers a dark family history and a powerful technology that has been hidden from the public for generations. Perils of Man was acclaimed by critics for its graphic design. Touch Arcade stated it was ‚ÄúA powerful set up for a storyline, it highlights on the emotions of grief, loss and fear, and does so incredibly well. It‚Äôs definitely worth experiencing one of the finest looking games to grace the iPad in some time.‚Äù The game contains elements of steampunk fiction and the art style has been likened to that of Tim Burton. Chapter 1 of the game was released for free on Apple's App Store in April 2014. The full game has been released in 2015 and it is available for Mac and PC on the Apple's App Store and Steam.  Gameplay  Perils of Man is a third-person, touch-driven, stylized adventure game in which the player must solve various puzzles and follow certain procedures in order for the story line to proceed. As a pure point-and-click adventure game, Perils of Man follows the guidelines first introduced by LucasArts. It is impossible to die or to get stuck at any moment in the game, which allows the user to fully immerse him/herself in Perils of mans universe without the fear of making a mistake or the constant need of saving the game.  Plot  In the game, the player controls the actions of Swiss teenager Ana Eberling, who receives a gift from her father on her 16th birthday. Since her father had disappeared over 10 years ago, she takes this as a sign that he must still be alive despite the fact that her mother Nadia claims to have seen his ghost. Ana vows to get to the bottom of the mystery and starts by exploring the old family mansion in Zurich where she soon discovers a secret laboratory hidden in the basement. Here she befriends a mechanical bird, Darwin, who joins her adventure. After she discovers a strange set of goggles that let her see through time, she is catapulted on an adventure to sites in history that are doomed to catastrophe.  Development  The game was produced in Zurich, Switzerland, and involved a distributed production team of more than 60 people. The game was developed in Unity for mobile devices. The project was sponsored by Swiss reinsurer Swiss Re as part of their 150-year anniversary.  Reception  Perils of Man chapter 1 was generally well received and won the SGDA Award 2014 for Best Swiss Video Game of the year and an EDI shortlist award in 2013. Based on 4 reviews, Metacritic gave the game an aggregate score of 75% (\\"generally favorable reviews\\"). Gamers Sphere said ‚ÄúPerils of Man sets new standards for the point-and-click genre. I never felt like I solved a puzzle or completed a task for no reason, like I do in some adventure games. Each challenge felt naturally placed and seemed to affect the game just as it should.‚Äù Expert Reviews called it ‚ÄúHauntingly atmospheric. Adeptly touching on sensitive psychological territory‚Äù, while Just Adventure said ‚ÄúThe quality of production is clearly evident from the opening moments. Exploring the richly detailed doll-house environments, and being drawn into the somewhat nutty family history of the Eberlings and their secret invention will certainly leave you wanting more.‚Äù  References   External links  * Perils of Man website * Perils of Man Facebook Page * IF Games website Category:2014 video games Category:Adventure games Category:IOS games Category:Point-and-click adventure games Category:Steampunk video games Category:Video games developed in Switzerland Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games set in Europe Category:Windows games ","title":"Perils of Man"},{"id":"43311858","text":"Dean Towers (born 4 May 1990) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for the Sydney Swans in the Australian Football League (AFL).

He was also the head coach of the freshman football squad for his alma mater. Career Harry Cleverly came to Boston University in the 1930s, joining the ice hockey squad in 1935 and playing two seasons for the Terriers before graduating in 1937. Cleverly joined the staff of his former coach, Wayland Vaughan, as an assistant as well as joining the military before Boston University offered him the top job for both the ice hockey and baseball programs after World War II. The reconstituted ice hockey program played only 3 games in 1945-46 before returning to a more normal schedule the following season. While the Terriers had played well prior to his installation, it wasn't until Cleverly was in charge that Boston University became a power in ice hockey. In his first three full seasons Cleverly got the Terriers to post school records in both wins and winning percentage and with the program firing on all cylinders the Athletic Department made the move to shift the team from a club sport to a Division I squad. Beginning in 1949‚Äì50 Cleverly set the Terriers up to compete with the other national powers, making the recently created NCAA tournament the first chance they had. The Terriers downed Michigan in the semifinal but were unable to overcome a monstrous 10-goal third period by Colorado College in the national final. Cleverly continued coaching BU to a high level, reaching the tournament three more times, but was unable to get them back to the title game. Cleverly remained as the Terriers coach until 1962, staying on just long enough to see them be a founding member of ECAC Hockey before he resigned from his positions on both the hockey and baseball teams. After leaving BU Cleverly agreed to coach a newly created ice hockey program at Babson College for the 1965-66 season before turning it over to his successor Dave Coleman. Tragedy struck two years later when Cleverly was killed in a car accident in Vermont. During his tenure as ice hockey coach Cleverly was awarded with the Spencer Penrose Award in 1958 and inducted into the Boston University Athletic Hall of Fame the following year.

When energy demand is high, the water is released back down to the lower reservoir but the pump turbines that pumped the water up now reverse mode and serve as generators to produce electricity. The process is repeated as necessary and the plant serves as a peaking power plant. The lower reservoir is created by a tall circular dam. It holds up to of water. The upper reservoir is created by an tall and long concrete-face rock-fill dam. It can withhold up to of water. Water from the upper reservoir is sent to the underground power station down near the lower reservoir through headrace/penstock pipes. The drop in elevation between the upper and lower reservoir affords a hydraulic head (water drop) of .

It is tasked with the monitoring of potentially subversive domestic activities. Prior to 2005, it was known as the Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire (DST). History The DST emerged from the CAB1, the counter-subversion unit or political police department of the DGSN (Direction G√©n√©ral de Surveillance du T√©rritoire), which is the state police body of Morocco that was created in May 1956. In May 1956, the CAB1 began as the 7th arrondissement of the Police in Derb Baladia, Casablanca, and was headed by Houssine Seghir, a plumber in Mers-Sultan and ex-member of a Casablanca-based resistance movement. At the time the DGSN was directed by Mohammed Laghzioui, a prominent member of the Istiqlal party. After Laghzioui left the DGSN, the CAB1 was formed under Mohammed Oufkir with consultancy from French and American intelligence technicians. After the international outrage that followed the assassination of Mehdi Ben Barka, the CAB1 was formally dissolved in October 1967. However it continued to exist as a secret unit of the DGSN. In 1973, the DST was officially created and Ahmed Dlimi became its director. The Benbarka affair The CAB1 was implicated in the abduction of political opponent Mehdi Ben Barka in France. Ahmed Boukhari, a former agent of the CAB1, revealed that the operation was masterminded by Mohammed Achaachi, Ahmed Dlimi, Mohammed Oufkir and executed with the collaboration of corrupt French policemen and some French gangsters. Human rights violations The DST is mired in many torture allegations and scandals. As early as 2002 it operated the Temara interrogation centre, a black site for extraordinary renditions and interrogations on behalf of the United States. After the 2003 Casablanca bombings, the DST became involved in controversial interrogation methods to obtain confessions from suspects. After the 2011 Arab spring protest the secret detention centre is said to have been relocated to the Ain Aouda secret prison. Additionally, it has been revealed that the United States paid Morocco USD $20 million to build a secret detention centre sometime in 2004‚Äì2006. In 2010, Zakaria Moumni a former Moroccan Thai boxing champion, was arrested upon entering Morocco and was abducted by DST agents. He later revealed that he was tortured and then imprisoned on trumped-up charges, on instructions from Mounir Majidi (the secretary of king Mohammed VI) and the head of the DST Abdellatif Hammouchi. In the same year Ali Aarras, a Belgian citizen, was extradited to Morocco from Spain where he was cleared of terrorism charges because of lack of evidence. After his extradition to Morocco and subsequent trial, he was condemned by judge Abdelkader Chentouf to 10-years in prison. The sentence was based on confessions, which according to Ali Aarras were obtained under torture. In February 2014, the director of the DGST Abdellatif Hammouchi, while on an official visit to France, was summoned by a French judge to answer for torture allegations in various cases, including the case of Zakaria Moumni and the Gdeim Izik protest camp suspects. This caused a diplomatic incident and vivid protestations from the Moroccan state apparatus who responded by suspending judicial cooperation accords with France. And announced that it will sue the plaintiffs for libel. However, the Moroccan Ministry of the Interior retracted all its lawsuits in France just days after filing them.

It was originally raised at Krasnoyarsk in 1939 as a motor rifle division until the following year when it was reorganized as a standard Red Army rifle division, and served for the duration of the Great Patriotic War in that role. It saw very limited service in the Winter War against Finland. Following the German invasion in 1941 the first two formations of the division distinguished themselves on the battlefield, and were raised to the status of Guards Rifle divisions: the 17th Guards following the Battle of Moscow; and the 54th Guards for its successes in Operation Uranus. The division was formed for a third time in early 1943 and served for the duration of the war in the north-central sectors of the front, taking part in the offensive that drove the Nazi forces out of the Baltic States and winning a decoration for the liberation of Riga. The division was moved to the Odessa Military District soon after the end of the war, and was disbanded in the next few months.  1st Formation  The division was organized at Krasnoyarsk in the Siberian Military District in 1939 as a motor rifle division, as part of the pre-war expansion of the Red Army.Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Legions\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed Before June 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. VIII, Nafziger, 1996, p. 60 It was moved to the Finnish front from January to March, 1940, but only its artillery took part in the fighting. After returning to the Siberian Military District it was reorganized as a regular rifle division in April. As of June 22, 1941, it comprised: * 365th Rifle Regiment * 421st Rifle Regiment * 634th Rifle Regiment * 349th Light Artillery Regiment * 224th Sapper Battalion * 143rd Reconnaissance CompanySharp, \\"Red Legions\\", p. 60 Maj. Gen. Aleksandr Dmitrievich Berezin commanded the division through the existence of this formation. Following the onset of Barbarossa the division was rushed to the front, being assigned to 24th Army and then 31st Army in Reserve Front in August, 1941. Unlike the newer divisions being formed at that time, the 119th had the pre-war organization and as of September 20 was actually over strength, with 1,142 officers, 14,804 NCOs and men, 13 tankettes, 4 armored cars, 166 heavy machine guns, 408 light machine guns, 54 45mm antitank guns, 85 artillery pieces, 109 mortars and 4 antiaircraft guns.Jack Radey and Charles Sharp, The Defense of Moscow 1941 - The Northern Flank, Pen & Sword Books Ltd., Barnsley, UK, 2012, p. 17 With the launch of the German Operation Typhoon, the division was involved in heavy fighting west of Rzhev in the first week of October. On October 6 the 365th Rifle Regiment was transferred to the 18th Rifle Division, which had escaped from encirclement with significant casualties. In exchange the 119th received the 920th Rifle Regiment from the 247th Rifle Division, a unit made up from a cadre of NKVD troops. At about this time the division was transferred to 29th Army, in Kalinin Front, and after the battle for Kalinin, back to 31st Army.Radey and Sharp, Defense of Moscow, p. 17 By late November, even after this heavy fighting, the division still had a strength of 7,200 men, higher than average for Kalinin and Western Fronts at this time.Sharp, \\"Red Legions\\", p. 60 The men and women of the division fought well during the rest of the Battle of Moscow, and in the following counteroffensive. Beginning on January 8, 1942, 31st Army took part in the Sychevka-Vyasma Offensive Operation, which was planned \\"to encircle, and then capture or destroy the enemy's entire Mozhaisk - Gzhatsk - Vyasma grouping\\",Svetlana Gerasimova, The Rzhev Slaughterhouse, ed. & trans. S. Britton, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2013, pp. 26-27 that is, what later became known as the Rzhev salient. The 119th was one of the spearheads of this thrust behind the German lines, reaching the area near Bely by mid-January. The division was recognized for its achievements in this counteroffensive on March 17th when it became the 17th Guards Rifle Division.Sharp, \\"Red Legions\\", p. 60  2nd Formation  A new 119th Rifle Division was formed on April 21, 1942, in the Kalinin Oblast of the Moscow Military District, based on the 51st Rifle Brigade.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, Nafziger, 1996, p. 44 =51st Rifle Brigade= This brigade began forming in October 1941,Dunn, Jr., states it was in September; Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 83 from military students and training units in the Volga Military District. It was moved west in December and was assigned to the reserves of Northwestern Front. It was then moved to the 4th Shock Army, and it was one of the second echelon units of that army when the Toropets- Kholm Offensive began on January 9, 1942. Through the rest of the winter the brigade fought in 4th Shock, deep in the Toropets salient behind the German- held Rzhev salient, until it was pulled out in April and sent back to Kalinin.Sharp, \\"Red Volunteers\\", Soviet Militia Units, Rifle and Ski Brigades 1941 - 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. XI, Nafziger, 1996, pp. 33-34 =1942 Campaign= The new division's order of battle remained the same as that of the first formation, except the 349th was now a standard divisional artillery regiment. Col. Ivan Yakovlevich Kulagin was appointed to command on the day the division formed. The 51st Brigade was a well-experienced unit so the new division needed only about three months to form up and train. It remained in the Moscow defenses until July when it was moved south to join 3rd Tank Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. On August 30, still in reserve, it was reassigned to 5th Tank Army,David M. Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, p. 456 fighting in Bryansk Front during the autumn.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 44 During October, the 5th Tank Army was moved to Southwestern Front,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 214 under the command of Lt. Gen. N. F. Vatutin. At this time the 119th was noted as having 50 percent Russian personnel, with the remaining half being primarily Ukrainian and Asian.Glantz, Colossus Reborn, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, p. 592 On November 19, the opening day of Operation Uranus, the division was deep within the Red Army's Serafimovich bridgehead across the Don River, at the village of Kalmykovskii, facing the Romanian 14th Infantry Division. At 0730 hrs., 3,500 guns, mortars and rocket launchers opened an 80-minute preparation along the penetration sectors of Southwestern and Don Fronts. Before this was completed, forward elements of the 119th, supported by sappers, pushed to within 200 - 300 metres of the forward edge of the Romanian defenses. Before the artillery was finished, the infantry assault began.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book One, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2014, pp. 186, 194-95, 198-99 Operation Uranus Together the four rifle divisions in the bridgehead were backed by 138 tanks. On the 119th's left the 50th Guards and its supporting armor tore a gaping hole in the defenses on the left flank of Romanian 5th Infantry Division by 1100 hrs.; this leveraged the 119th's thrust due south, with all three rifle regiments in the first echelon, smashing the enemy's first defensive positions and approaching the village of Blinovskii by the same hour. This was an advance of 2-3km, less than anticipated in the offensive plan. By noon the division had helped to crack open the lines held by Romanian II Army Corps sufficiently to create an opening for the armor of 5th Tank to exploit. 1st Tank Corps deployed its three tank brigades in a line and at 1400 hrs. began advancing through the 119th and the adjacent 154th Rifle Division, (which was re-designated as the 47th Guards Rifle Division the next day.Sharp, \\"Red Legions\\", p. 76) in an attack that obliterated the remaining defenses of the Romanian 14th Infantry; the surviving Romanian troops caught \\"tank fright\\" and were routed. Later in the afternoon, the 634th Rifle Regiment cooperated with roughly 45 vehicles of 26th Tank Corps' 157th Tank Brigade to destroy the Romanian 14th's remaining strongpoint at Klinovoi, after which the armor continued to advance up to 22km against light resistance. The remainder of the division made slower progress.Glantz, Endgame, Book One, pp. 201-03, 208-15 On November 20, Colonel Kulagin left command of the division; he would take command of the 35th Guards Rifle Division a few weeks later.http://www.generals.dk/general/Kulagin/Ivan_Iakovlevich/Soviet_Union.html He was replaced the following day by Col. Mikhail Matveevich Danilov, who had been the commander of the 437th Rifle Regiment of 154th Rifle Division, and would hold command for the duration of this formation.Glantz identifies Danilov as commander on November 21, but continues to refer to Kulagin as late as November 29. Endgame, Book One, pp. 277, 481 During the day most of the 119th continued to support the 157th Tank Brigade to overcome or bypass Romanian strongpoints and other obstacles, with the goal of reaching the towns of Zhirkovskii and Perelazovskii deep in the enemy rear, while the 365th Rifle Regiment, along with the 50th Guards and supporting armor, fought to contain Romanian forces being encircled east of the Tsaritsa River. The 365th seized Hill 208.0, then pushed on eastward with the tanks to the west bank of the river by midday, beginning the process of encircling the 1st Romanian Armored Division and other Romanian forces to the east. The Romanian tanks attempted to break out southwest to link up with German XXXXVIII Panzer Corps, but were unsuccessful, and lost 25 vehicles in the process.Glantz, Endgame, Book One, pp. 231-33, 235, 244 The following day, Colonel Danilov \\"castled\\" his regiments southwards along the Tsaritsa, then attacked eastwards against the remnants of the Romanian armor, advancing up to 5km. The goal was to link up with the 277th Rifle Division of 21st Army and complete the encirclement of the remaining eastern forces of Romanian Third Army, now known as Group Lascar. At 2000 hrs. the leading elements of the two rifle divisions joined hands west of Verkhne-Cherenskii, completing the first major encirclement of Axis forces in Operation Uranus. Early on November 22 the division joined with the 50th Guards, 216th Tank Brigade, and one regiment of the 346th Rifle Division to attack Group Lascar's defenses along and east of the Tsaritsa. The division attacked eastward and northeastward, captured Korotkovskii, and then got into a fight to capture Zhirkovskii against strong resistance. At this point the 1st Romanian Armored made an attempt to break out of the pocket, with roughly 20 R-2 tanks and 220 trucks and other vehicles. This force pushed through the 119th's defenses, after which it fought a running battle with Soviet cavalry and tanks to the rear. The division's forces ignored the breakout as best they could, before lunging with the 50th Guards east towards the town of Golovskii, 10km to the east, which was the headquarters of Group Lascar. While the Romanian group made plans to break out, in defiance of orders from the German high command, the two Soviet divisions engaged the Romanian 6th Infantry Division in a running fight that lasted from 1600 to 2100 hrs., while Group Lascar was also being severely pressed by 21st Army. Golovskii fell to 50th Guards at 2100 hrs., completely disrupting the Romanian command.Glantz, Endgame, Book One, pp. 277-79, 306, 309-11 November 23 saw the rifle forces of 5th Tank Army attempting to destroy the encircled Romanian group. The 119th captured the Romanian strongpoint at Zhirkovskii early in the morning, then dispatched one of its rifle regiments southward to intercept a Romanian column from escaping, while the remaining regiments drove eastwards into the center of the shrinking pocket. These captured Verkhne-Cherenskii at 1400 hrs. and linked up with the 333rd Rifle Division of 21st Army. At the same time, the left-flank regiment joined hands with that Army's 96th and 63rd Rifle Divisions, further sub-dividing the pocket. Overnight many Romanians were taken prisoner, including General Lascar. It fell to Brig. Gen. Trajan Stanescu, Lascar's deputy, to seek a formal surrender of Third Army, which went into effect at 0230 hrs. on November 24th. The remaining Romanians surrendered over the next 12 hours, a total of 27,000 officers and men, including 5,000 from the escaping column intercepted by the regiment of the 119th and other Soviet forces. Following this, the division got a brief rest while it prepared to exploit to the Oblivskaya area on the Chir River.Glantz, Endgame, Book One, pp. 346-47, 393-94 Battle for Surovikino On November 25 the 119th was tasked with the liberation of Surovikino, relieving 1st Tank Corps, and then with a drive across the lower Chir. This town proved a tough nut to crack, and the German defenders were still holding out in the evening of November 27, when the division was joined by the 333rd Rifle. 24 hours later Surovikino continued to hold out. On the morning of the 30th the division penetrated into the town's northern outskirts, where it entered into street fighting with the defenders of composite Group Schmidt, while the 333rd carved out a bridgehead over the Chir to the east.Glantz, Endgame, Book One, pp. 426-47, 475, 478, 481 The fighting for Surovikino continued through the first three days of December, while 5th Tank Army prepared for a new offensive towards Tormosin, based from the 333rd's bridgehead. The goal of the offensive was to disrupt any German offensive from the lower Chir to relieve their forces surrounded at Stalingrad; the 119th's goal was to complete the liberation of Surovikino and then to attack across the river with two regiments, along with two regiments of the 321st Rifle Division. When the offensive began on December 9, the advance battalions of the two divisions encountered intense small arms and artillery fire from a very mixed group of Axis forces that forced them to go to ground. The full offensive was then postponed to the next day.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book Two, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2014, pp. 42, 46-47, 60-62 The sporadic fighting for Surovikino continued over the next several days. Finally, owing to the expansion of Soviet bridgeheads over the Chir to the east and west, despite the well-known efforts of 11th Panzer Division to throw them back, the German position in the town became untenable, and it was evacuated overnight on December 14-15, with the 119th taking possession. As a result of this success and those earlier in the campaign, the division was one of the first of the Stalingrad divisions raised to Guards status, becoming the 54th Guards Rifle Division on December 16.Glantz, Endgame, Book Two, pp. 68, 71, 83, 247Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", pp. 44-45  3rd Formation  The final 119th Rifle Division began forming at Aleksin in the Moscow Military District, based on the 161st Rifle Brigade, in March 1943. =161st Rifle Brigade= This rifle brigade was formed in February - March 1942 in the Moscow Military District.Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys, p. 109 It was immediately assigned to the Moscow Defence Zone. In April it was moved to the 11th Army in Northwestern Front, on the north flank of the Soviet forces besieging the Demyansk Pocket. It was moved to 34th Army during this battle, and was there when the German forces evacuated in February 1943. Following this, the brigade became part of the 12th Guards Rifle Corps in the 27th Army in the area of Staraya Russa. In April the brigade was moved back to the Moscow Military District for rebuilding.Sharp, \\"Red Volunteers\\", p. 69 =Into Belarus and the Baltic States= The division completed forming on April 19, when it was assigned to 3rd Reserve Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. The order of battle remained the same as that of the second formation. It was under the command of Col. Ivan Dmitrievich Panov, but he was replaced on July 27 by Maj. Gen. Iosif Ivanovich Khorun. The division was assigned to 21st Army in Western Front before the Smolensk Offensive Operation in August, and two months later reassigned to 60th Rifle Corps in Kalinin Front reserves.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 26, 37 Shortly thereafter this Front was renamed 1st Baltic, and the division and its corps became part of 4th Shock Army.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 45 4th Shock began a new offensive on November 2 in the directions of Polotsk and Vitebsk. 60th Corps, supported by the 143rd Tank Brigade, struck the defenses of the 87th Infantry Division and the much-depleted 2nd Luftwaffe Field Division on a 10km-wide front centered 16km south of Nevel. By November 6 the Corps had penetrated the enemy defenses to a depth of about 10km, at which point the 2nd Guards Rifle Corps was committed into the sector from the second echelon, with the mission \\"to widen the mouth to the south and destroy the defending enemy\\". Once a breakthrough was achieved, 4th Shock regrouped its forces to exploit; the 119th and the 357th Rifle Divisions were sent southwestwards towards Polotsk. Third Panzer Army's IX Army Corps scrambled to assemble several small combat groups to block the advance in this direction. By November 20 the division was on both sides of the Nevel - Polotsk railway in the area near Dretun, just 26km short of its objective, brought to a halt by an unexpected thaw and the resistance of German Group von Gottberg and the 211th Infantry Division. Due to the extended front held by 4th Shock, 60th Corps held these general positions into the new year.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 130-33, 140, 217, 280 In February 1944, the 119th was moved to 83rd Rifle Corps, where it remained for the duration of the war. Apart from a short reassignment to 1st Shock Army in March, the division was in 4th Shock Army until January 1945.

By the beginning of August 4th Shock had reached the eastern outskirts of Daugavpils in Latvia. The advance continued until by mid-September it had arrived in the area of Bir≈æai in northern Lithuania.The Gamers, Baltic Gap, Multi-Man Publishing, Inc., Millersville, MD, 2009, pp. 9, 22, 29 The 119th's final change of command took place on October 18, when Colonel Toropchin was replaced by Col. Mikhail Lavrentevich Dudarenko. On October 22, the division was awarded the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Class, for its services in the liberation of Riga.

Doon was settled around 1800 by Mennonite Germans from Pennsylvania, and after 1830 by Scottish immigrants. The area is located at the confluence of Schneider Creek and the Grand River. The post office was opened in 1845. A large flour mill, oatmill mill, distillery and sawmill were built on the Doon River over the following years. The Perine brothers established extensive linen works and flax mills near the settlement. By 1870, there was a single church, Presbyterian, a variety of tradesmen and a population of 200.http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/001075/f2/e010780571_p2.pdf Although never large, at one time it was a bustling community with sawmills, a rope factory and other businesses. It is known as the lifetime home of landscape artist Homer Watson. It is now a suburb of Kitchener, Ontario, home to the Doon Heritage Village and the main campus of Conestoga College. Origins Doon was established in a forested area around Schneider Creek where it enters the Grand River from the south. Richard Beasley sold of this land to John Biehn Sr. of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, in 1800. Biehn's relatives bought portions of this land, and started to clear it for farming, His son John Biehn Jr. built a sawmill in what became Doon, and Frederic Beck also ran a sawmill in the area. Most of the early settlers were German Mennonite farmers from Pennsylvania. By 1869, the population was 200 and the settlement had a station on the Grand Trunk Railway.https://books.google.ca/books?id=z6wOAAAAYAAJ, page 132 Growth In the 1830s the Ferrie family moved to the area, where they established several businesses in what is now Lower Doon including a distillery, tavern, general store, saw mill, cooperage, blacksmith shop and kiln. They also built workers' houses. Adam Ferrie Jr. gave Doon its name after Loch Doon and the River Doon in Ayrshire, Scotland. From this time most of the settlers were artisans, millers and brick makers of Scottish and English background. Doon Mills, driven by water, was fully operational in 1839, grinding oatmeal, flour, and barley for the local population. The population of Doon in 1855 was 200. The hamlets to the west, about a mile further up Schneider Creek, were originally called Oregon and Tow Town. They later merged and were called Upper Doon. James Watson, grandfather of the painter Homer Watson, set up a sawmill, carding and fulling mill and a pail factory in Oregon. John Tilt had a small sawmill and an enterprise for clay brick and tile manufacture, also in Oregon. In Tow Town, Moses and Joseph Perine established a sawmill and a flax mill that made rope and twine, the first in Canada of this nature. The Doon Twine and Cordage factory opened in 1856 making products from locally-grown flax and hemp. Products included tying twines, plow lines, halter ropes, clothes lines and broom twine. Farmers were later banned from growing hemp because of its cannabis content. There was also a decline in local production of flax, so the factory had to import both of these raw materials. Doon, Ontario railway station and freight shed A railroad station opened around 1867. It was on the Galt-Elmira branch of the Grand Trunk Railway. A daily service called the Dutch Mail took freight and passengers between Doon and Berlin (later renamed Kitchener). New businesses served the growing population. By the early 1890s there was a post office, grocer and baker, two tailors, a cooper, blacksmith, shoemaker, wagon maker, bridge builder and scissors manufacturer. By the end of the 19th century visitors could stay in the Red Lion Inn, Doon Hotel or the Bush Inn, all respectable establishments. A non-denominational Sunday School was founded in 1848. In 1854 the Doon Presbyterian Church was opened on land donated by Robert Ferrie and built with his financial assistance. A Methodist church was built in 1868 on a site donated by William Allen. The Bonnie Doon School was the first public school, opened in 1878 with one room, and extended to two rooms within ten years as the student population grew. The school burned down and was replaced in 1956. The Christadelphians built a church on Old Mill Road, formerly Richmond Street, in 1880. In 1889 it was clad in red brick. The church was used until 1916. The building was closed until 1936, then used as a residence until 1971. It was torn down in 1981. Notable residents On the Grand River at Doon by Homer Watson (1880) Moses Springer (1824‚Äì1898) was born in Doon on 31 August 1824. In 1834 he and his ten siblings were orphaned when their parents died in a cholera epidemic.

He was reeve of the village of Waterloo three times between 1857 and 1875, and represented the North Waterloo riding in the Ontario Legislature from 1867 to 1881. Homer Watson (1855‚Äì1936) was a self-taught painter who devoted most of his life to painting landscapes of the country of Doon in a combination of romantic and realistic styles. Oscar Wilde called Watson \\"the Canadian Constable\\". A field stone house, built in 1835, that lies south of the village was Watson's house from 1881 until his death in 1936. Homer's sister Phoebe Amelia Watson moved into Homer's house after his wife Roxanna died in 1918. She became curator of the Homer Watson Art Gallery in Doon, and held this post until her death on 22 October 1947. Hartman Krug (1853‚Äì1933) was born in New Dundee and followed his father's profession as a fine furniture maker. He moved to Berlin and founded the H. Krug Furniture Company in the 1887. In 1912 Krug became the majority shareholder in Doon Twine and Cordage Company, which was renamed Doon Twines Ltd. The company began manufacturing cordage with jute, manila, hemp and sisal. To accommodate growth and reduce transportation costs, in 1916 the operation was moved from Doon to a larger factory in Kitchener. Beniah Bowman (1886‚Äì1941) was born in Waterloo county into a United Empire Loyalist family. He was educated in the Doon and Hespeler public schools. In 1911 he became a farmer on Manitoulin Island. Bowman was a member of the Ontario Legislature from 1918 to 1926, and was Ontario Minister of Lands and Forests from 1919 to 1923.

Recent years Conestoga College Doon campus from Homer Watson Blvd. The population of Doon dropped sharply after the Doon Twines company relocated to Berlin, now Kitchener, during World War I. There are now only a few small businesses in Doon, which has become a suburb for commuters to Kitchener and Cambridge. After Phoebe Watson died the Watson house was home to the Doon School of Fine Arts from 1948 to 1966. The house, a substantial building in Scottish Gothic Vertical style that was built in 1834 by Adam Ferrie, was purchased by the City of Kitchener in 1981 and opened to the public as a historic building and art gallery. The Homer Watson Memorial Park lies next to the village. Doon contains the Doon Heritage Village, which covers and reconstructs a view of life in the region in 1914, on the eve of World War I. There are period buildings, farm animals and interpreters dressed in period clothes. The Waterloo Region Museum is at the entrance to the village. The former house of Peter McArthur was transported to the village from its original location on land owned by the McArthur family near Appin, Ontario in Ekfrid Township. Hugh C. Elliott (1899-1995), who had served in 1918‚Äì19 with the Canadian Engineers in Vladivostok, Siberia, was a charter director of the Doon Pioneer Village. Conestoga College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning is a polytechnic established in 1967. The original campus of Conestoga College, and the largest, is located in Doon by the Highway 401 / Homer Watson Blvd. interchange. The campus holds the college's main administrative offices. There are residences for full-time students next to the campus. A 3-storey wing for the School of Health and Life Sciences opened in August 2011.

Soon after the start of the fourth quarter, Jess Neely intercepted a pass, weaving for a return of 25 yards to Georgia's 40-yard line before being brought down by Jim Reynolds. Two long pass attempts failed, and Thomas Ryan lined up to punt. Rupert Smith snuck in behind Ryan, and rushed to recover the 25-yard onside kick, jumping up to get the ball off the bounce among a hoard of Bulldogs, after they had let it bounce, including the outstretched arms of the Bulldogs' Hartley, and raced for a 15-yard touchdown. Rupert added his own extra point and the game ended as a tie, 7-7. Georgia would go on to beat both Alabama and Clemson handily in the following weeks, while the next week Vanderbilt handled Sewanee in the mud, giving both Vanderbilt and Georgia an equal right to the claim of a 1921 SIAA title. A freshman Lynn Bomar's play at the linebacker position was especially noted, \\"Georgia would have trampled Vanderbilt to atoms but for Lynn Bomar,\\" observed Nashville Tennessean sportswriter Blinkey Horn. It was said he stopped five Georgia touchdowns that day.Traughber, William L. Vanderbilt Football: Tales of Commodore Gridiron History. Charleston, SC: History, 2011. One source credits this as the first successful onside kick in the history of football.http://www.foxsports.com/college-football/story/nfl-cfb-alabama- crimson-tide-clemson-tigers-onside-kick-history-origin-011216 =1923: \\"Dixie's top team\\" licked by Commodores= On November 17, the Vanderbilt Commodores beat the Georgia Bulldogs at Dudley Field by a lopsided score of 35 to 7. Fred Russell would say this was when \\"the Gold and Black hit the season's peak.\\" Morgan Blake, sportswriter in the Atlanta Journal, wrote \\"No southern team has given the Georgia Bulldogs such a licking in a decade.\\" Georgia was labeled \\"Dixie's top team;\\" its only loss coming against traditional powerhouse Yale. Georgia's defense had previously shut out all its Southern Conference opponents, with no southern team crossing the Bulldogs' 20 or 25 yard line. Vanderbilt halfback Gil Reese would star in this game, including two punt returns for touchdowns and two more touchdowns on the ground. Reese ran for over 200 yards for the second week in a row, with 232 yards on his five largest plays and over 300 total yards. Former Vanderbilt coach Wallace Wade, who was at the game scouting Georgia, said the Commodores that day were \\"the smartest I ever saw.\\" =1924: Lynn Bomar injured= Hall of famer Lynn Bomar suffered a career ending injury against Georgia. 1924 brought the first victory for Georgia over Vanderbilt in twenty-seven \\"long years,\\" having failed to win the last seven matches. The Commodores did well in the first quarter, but never threatened again after that. Georgia had 12 first downs to Vandy's 7, and the Bulldogs gained 284 yards to the Commodores' 128. The furthest the Commodores penetrated was to Georgia's 31-yard line. Thrice the Bulldogs got to within Vanderbilt's 10-yard line, but all three times the Vanderbilt defense stiffened and prevented a score. Bulldog quarterback \\"Scrappy\\" Moore made the 32-yard drop-kick which broke the scoreless tie in the fourth quarter. It was the last field goal kicked by a Bulldog until seventeen years later when Frank Sinkwich did so against Florida with a broken jaw in 1941. 1923 consensus All-American Lynn Bomar suffered an injury this day which would tragically end his career with Vanderbilt football. A kick to the chin from a cleat gave him a severe brain hemorrhage, leaving him with half of his body paralyzed for two days. It was figured he would never play football again. \\"Not a player on the team could talk of Bomar's injury without tears coming to his eyes.\\" The next year, he would defy the odds and play professional football in the inaugural season for the New York Giants, leaving after 1926 from a different injury.

It debuted on ABC on January 13, 1986. The movie, originally intended as a feature film, was written and directed by Jeffrey Bloom. He wrote the script in outrage over the mass murder during the robbery of a Los Angeles Bob's Big Boy restaurant in 1980. At the network's request, Bloom revised his original script to increase anti-gun viewpoints in the story. Plot Christopher Wells is a District Attorney, in fictional St. Lawrence, Kansas. One evening, his wife, Angela, and daughter Katie, are among several people shot to death in a robbery by two ex-cons. Wells, previously opposed to handguns, then pushes for mass arming of his town's citizens for self defense, while his best friend, police officer Mike Trainor, and Angela's friend Alicia remain opposed. Nonetheless, Wells' proposal passes and the movie explores Bloom's visions of an armed public.

The town was founded in the 1820s as a trade center along the road between Huntsville and Winchester, Tennessee. The town incorporated in 1837, and had grown to around 500 residents by the 1850s. Although much of the town was destroyed in the Civil War, some antebellum structures survive, including Classical Revival houses built in 1854 and 1860, and the Whitman-Cobb House built circa 1861. After the war, the town rebuilt, and a dam was constructed across Mountain Fork Creek to power various mills; it was rebuilt in 1913. The New Market Presbyterian Church built their first building in 1852, which was destroyed in the war. Its second building, constructed in 1884, was destroyed in a tornado in 1885; the current Gothic Revival building was completed in 1888. An Akron Plan New Market United Methodist Church was built in 1923. Many commercial buildings that were constructed in the early 1900s were destroyed in a fire in 1925.

This route was a combination of the old routes 11 and 99. Operated by the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA), it is the agency's first rapid bus route, and the second such system to open in New England (after the MBTA Silver Line). After several years of planning and construction, R-Line service began on June 21, 2014. Operations R-Line buses run in mixed traffic and have branding distinct from the rest of the RIPTA system. The R-Line is branded as \\"Rapid Bus\\" rather than true bus rapid transit because it operates in mixed traffic rather than on fully dedicated lanes. However, the service incorporates other BRT elements including high-frequency limited-stop service, transit signal priority, queue jumps, and upgraded bus shelters, as well as branding separate from RIPTA's local bus system. The service combines the former 11 and 99 local bus routes, which were the two busiest in Rhode Island. It was conceived as an inexpensive way to improve service on the two busy routes. The R-Line runs on 10-minute headways during the day, 20 minutes at night, and 15-20 minutes on weekends. Service runs from 5:00 am to 1:00 am on weekdays and Saturdays, and 6:30 am to midnight on Sundays. The line has 56 stops, largely placed in pairs on opposite sides of the street (except for the terminal loops). 25 have \\"wayfinding tokens\\" with systems for future audio announcements, while the remainder have enhanced bus stop signs. Under a program titled The Artists Of The R-Line, local artists were selected to design wall panels and seating at 17 of the line's bus stops. History RIPTA was created by the state in 1964 to take over the bus routes of the United Transit Company, the descendant of the former Rhode Island Company streetcar system. The agency inherited a system of Providence-based local routes with rapidly falling ridership; over the next half-century RIPTA expanded service to cover more of the state. However, many of the local routes suffered from slow speeds and routes that followed former streetcar services rather than newer development. In 2013, RIPTA released plans for major service changes, including the removal of some bus stops and a focusing of resources on higher-demand routes, designed to modernize their system under a constant budget. The report proposed rapid bus service on a combination of the 11 and 99 routes, as well as a long-planned extension of other services to South Attleboro station. Transit signal priority construction began in February 2013 and was largely complete by the end of the year, with minor adjustments lasting until April 2014. Passenger amenities including shelters were installed in May and June 2014. Service on the 11 and 99 continued normally during construction. R-Line service began on June 21, 2014 along with implementation of much of the 2013 plan. A new route, 98 Pawtucket Ave, began operations the same day to maintain service on Pawtucket Avenue southwest of downtown Pawtucket, which the 99 had traveled on but the R-Line does not. The 98 was later merged with the 71 Broad Street route to form the 71 Broad Street / Pawtucket Avenue route. =Future expansion= RIPTA plans to convert other high-ridership local routes into rapid bus routes; the 20, 27, and 56 routes will be given priority for conversion.

She was the oldest active athlete. She is the current holder of the masters world record in numerous events including the W85 Triple Jump, W100 Shot Put, Discus, Hammer Throw, Weight Throw and Javelin Throw and was the oldest competitor to complete a Throws Pentathlon and thus holds the record in that event. In younger age divisions, she held many more records that have been surpassed. Her famous quote for longevity: She was the mother of Australian Olympic jumper and pentathlete Helen Frith, who under her married name of Searle is also a multiple masters world record holder. Early life Ruth Pursehouse was born in Goulburn, New South Wales. She attended Goulburn High School, a NSW selective school, and was originally planning on becoming a solicitor. She won the state title in the 100 yard dash at the Sydney Cricket Ground and played field hockey as a girl. It was on a hockey trip to Dubbo that she met her future husband Ray Frith. They were married in 1933. She became active in sports administration as a young girl. Sports athlete An accomplished musician with the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, she served as the student representative to the Sports Union for Athletics. After playing with the Gouldburn Hockey Club, she served on the team committee. Her husband's work as a civil engineer took them to Darwin where she was Secretary of the Darwin Golf Club.

In 1998, he completed the flight-testing of the first certified whole-plane parachute recovery system, which is credited with saving over 150 lives as standard equipment on Cirrus Aircraft's line of single-engine light aircraft. In 1999, Anderson died in a plane crash near the Duluth International Airport while conducting tests of the first production model Cirrus SR20. He was posthumously inducted into the Minnesota Aviation Hall of Fame in 2010 for his contributions to the development and advancement of aviation in the state. The Scott D. Anderson Leadership Foundation was created in his honor. Early years and education Scott Anderson and his family moved to Duluth, Minnesota when he was six years old. He graduated from Duluth East High School as a star football player and went on to attend the University of Minnesota. As an undergraduate engineering student-intern and a member of Minnesota Power's Research and Development team, Anderson earned recognition as co-inventor on a U.S. patent. He continued his college career later at Stanford University, where he led an undergraduate team to build a two-person submarine. Anderson graduated from Stanford with degrees in mechanical engineering and history. Career In 1987, the summer after graduating college, he and his friend Steve Baker planned a marathon canoe trip from Duluth to York Factory on the Hudson Bay. After completing the 1,700-mile-long exploit, Anderson wrote his first book, Distant Fires, published in 1990, an autobiographical adventure story based on his experiences during the journey. Distant Fires was widely received by the local community at the time of its release‚Äîthe Duluth News Tribune describing it as a marvelous \\"voyage of discovery\\"‚Äîand went on to win the American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults Award in 1991. Anderson was known to have been a talented saxophonist, playing for multiple jazz bands around Duluth in the late '80s and early '90s. He then moved from the United States to Salzburg, Austria to play professional American football, before returning to become a pilot flying F-16s for the Air National Guard and flight instructing with Duluth's 179th Fighter Squadron. His second publication, and first novel, Unknown Rider (1995), was a fictional manifestation of his experience achieving the title \\"Fighter Pilot\\". He summed up his writing process saying, \\"When I was training to fly the F-16 at Kingsley Field in Oregon, each evening, after a day of flying fighters, I sat down and typed a little bit of this book‚Ä¶ All I had to do was invent a few characters, put them in an airplane, and make them the heroes of the stories that filled the air.\\" =Cirrus Aircraft= 1998 photo series showing the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS) in action during an SR20 flight-test over the southern California desert, Scott Anderson piloting In 1996, Anderson's career path led him to Cirrus Design (now called Cirrus Aircraft), a newly Duluth-landed general aviation startup founded by two brothers, Alan and Dale Klapmeier, hailing from a rural southern Wisconsin farm. He was named Director of Flight Operations along with Chief Test Pilot for the company, contributing his efforts to the early developmental stages of the Cirrus SR20 single-engine four-seat composite aircraft. In addition to all-composite construction, the SR20 introduced the light aircraft manufacturing industry to a number of innovative new designs, including a single power-lever that adjusts both throttle and propeller RPM, a side-yoke flight control system, a spin-resistant wing design, and a large LCD screen for the avionics. In 1997, Anderson became the lead test pilot on a ground breaking safety innovation by Ballistic Recovery Systems and Cirrus Aircraft. The feature was titled the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS), and acted as a parachute recovery device installed on the SR20 that was designed to lower the entire aircraft safely to the ground after a loss of control or structural failure. Anderson worked closest on the project with fellow Cirrus test pilot Gary Black, who also formerly flew jets for the military, as well as the company's Chief Engineer, Paul Johnston, who played a crucial role in the design process of the CAP system. CAPS testing began by the summer of 1998. The Cirrus team went out to the high desert of California where Anderson would make the first flight. He deployed the parachute multiple times during dives and spins, to simulate recovery after a midair collision or after spatial disorientation, and from level flight to resemble engine failure. At this time Cirrus only had two SR20 prototypes, so in order to test the parachute repeatedly Anderson would restart the engine mid-air while descending under the parachute, cut the chute loose and land the plane normally for it to be tested again (ground- impact testing took place with a mockup that would be dropped at the calculated descent-velocity and measured based on sustained damage to the fuselage). Anderson successfully made all seven of the company's in-flight test deployments of CAPS. The SR20 became FAA approved and typed certified in October 1998, making Anderson the first pilot in history to successfully test a certified aircraft equipped with a ballistic parachute. Death The following year, on 23 March 1999, Anderson died while putting the first production SR20 through experimental test flights before it went on sale. The purpose of the flight was to perform routine torture-test maneuvers and assess changes to the aileron if there were any issues. The incident occurred after the plane's aileron had jammed. Anderson was about 4 nautical miles out from the Duluth International Airport at the start of the flight when he radioed the control tower that he was returning due to a problem. At about 1.5 nautical miles from the airport, he declared an emergency. Less than 400 meters out, Anderson crashed into a vacant exercise yard on the federal prison grounds located off the airport‚Äôs south side. He died later that day in the hospital at age 33. The plane Anderson was flying had not yet been equipped with the standard CAPS that would come on every aircraft. Due to Cirrus being in very early production phase, the company was 10 days away from receiving production model chute systems at the time of Anderson's death. Cirrus has never test-flown an aircraft without a parachute since. =Posthumous recognition= Duluth's Leif Erickson Park, detailing a passage from his 1990 book Distant Fires 18-term Minnesota Congressman Jim Oberstar paid tribute to Anderson shortly after his death, calling him a \\"hero\\" and a \\"pioneer in general aviation\\". Oberstar went on saying, \\"Scott made a profound difference to the State of Minnesota and to the national aviation community\\". Cirrus Aircraft co-founder and former CEO Dale Klapmeier spoke at Anderson's induction into the Minnesota Aviation Hall of Fame on 24 April 2010, stating, \\"Scott was an exemplary pilot and person. During his tenure at Cirrus, he made considerable contributions to the company, the industry, and aviation safety that many people still benefit from today‚Ä¶ To date, 17 CAPS deployments have saved 35 lives due to Scott's pioneering work.\\" Anderson has been referenced multiple times in national articles and columns such as The Atlantic and The New York Times Magazine by journalist, author and former speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter, James Fallows, who in a 2007 article called him a \\"Renaissance man\\" and \\"beloved, charismatic figure in Duluth\\". Anderson was also a supporting theme in Fallows' 2001 book, Free Flight: Inventing the Future of Travel. =Legacy= In the months following his death, Cirrus continued on to redesign the aileron in order to prevent the problem that killed Anderson, and sold their first SR20 in July 1999. The SR20's successor, the Cirrus SR22, became the world's best-selling general aviation airplane in 2003 and has held the title every year since, with a combined overall production of more than 7,000 examples from 1999‚Äì2018. As of December 18, 2018, there have been 98 CAPS deployments saving 170 lives. The Scott D. Anderson Leadership Foundation (SALF) was established in late 1999 and is a fund of the Duluth Superior Area Community Foundation. It allows a group of high school students each year to receive scholarships dedicated to the delivery of high-quality, value-based leadership training. Anderson is memorialized by the \\"ANDOE\\" waypoint for the outer marker on ILS runway 27 approaching Duluth International Airport. Personal life Anderson was a practicing Christian throughout the entirety of his life. On the SALF organization's website, it lists several of its \\"Guided Values and Principles\\", focusing mostly on promotion towards the common good, community, affirming the dignity of individuals, encouraging creativity, mentorship, pursuing goals, and strengthening one's character, stating: He is survived today by his wife Laurie, their son Evan (born 1999), his siblings Catherine and Todd, and parents Paul and Carol. Scott's father Paul Anderson serves as the president of SALF. The Anderson family resides in Duluth, Minnesota.

Their given names are James John Castrission (born 14 March 1982) and Justin Roderick Jones (born 20 June 1983). In 2008 they kayaked 3318 km across the Tasman Sea from Australia to New Zealand, becoming the first to do so. On 26 January 2012, Castrission and Jones completed the first unsupported polar expedition from the edge of Antarctica to the South Pole and back without mechanical assistance. After 89 days they made it back to the coast, having skied 2275 km while towing sleds full of supplies. They arrived alongside Aleksander Gamme who had waited for them so they could all finish together. Early life Castrission was born in Sydney, the eldest of three children to parents John and Vivienne. Both sets of grandparents migrated to Australia from Greece after WWII. He was educated at Knox Grammar School and then attended The University of Sydney where he undertook a Bachelor of Commerce (Finance & Accounting). He is married to his wife Mia and has a son. They reside in the Blackheath, Blue Mountains. Jones was born 20 June 1983 the youngest of three children to parents Rod and Chintra Jones. He lived in Indonesia until he was 11, before attending boarding school at The Kings School Sydney. He later moved to Knox Grammar School. Jones completed his tertiary education at The University of New South Wales where he studied a Bachelor of Science (Honors Physiology). He currently resides in Sydney with his fianc√© Lauren. Castrission and Jones met when they were 15 and 16 respectively. Castrission 's family was Jones's home family in Sydney, assigned to him while he attended boarding school. They became friends, sharing a common love of the outdoors. They participated in cadets together and upon leaving school, they began attempting a number of bushwalks and kayak expeditions together, while working separately in various roles. Castrission worked at Deloitte as an accountant, then management Consultant (2003‚Äì2007). Jones worked as a research assistance in a science laboratory (2004‚Äì 2007) and various pubs in Sydney. In 2007, Castrission and Jones decided to work full- time on their plans to kayak across the Tasman Sea. Since then, they have published books, filmed documentaries and given public speaking seminars based on their frequent expeditions. Endurance events =Crossing the Ditch= As Cas & Jonesy they became the first people to cross the Tasman Sea from Australia to New Zealand in a kayak. They set off from Forster, New South Wales on 13 November 2007 and arrived at Ngamotu Beach in New Plymouth, New Zealand on 13 January 2008, taking a total of 60 days, 20 hours and 50 minutes for crossing. Cas and Jonesy travelled in a double kayak named Lot 41, custom designed by Rob Feloy. They transmitted podcasts and photographs during the trip. =Crossing the Ice= On 26 January 2012, Cas & Jonesy succeeded in skiing from the edge of Antarctica to the South Pole and back without assistance. It took 89 days and 2275 km of skiing, in what was the longest unsupported polar expedition of all time (the pair also finished along with Norwegian adventurer Aleksander Gamme, who had waited for them). Pulling everything they needed on a sled behind them and facing temperatures as low as ‚Äì 40 C, they endured frostbite, crevasses, equipment failure and food deprivation. The pair had almost no skiing experience before their expedition and spent months researching and consulting with experts from all over the world. They trained in the Arctic and in New Zealand, acclimatizing themselves to the extreme cold they would experience during the adventure. The Australian adventurers are the youngest team to ever reach the South Pole. =Okefenokee Swamp= In 2013, Cas and Jonesy completed the world's first on-foot segment crossing of the Okefenokee swamp, the largest blackwater swamp in North America. The pair were filming a pilot for National Geographic titled \\"Surviving Wild America\\", in which they retraced a 9-mile trail that had not been used in 40 years. They slept in hammocks above the swamp, travelled in blow up rafts and experienced numerous encounters with alligators, cotton mouth snakes and black bears =Bass Strait= The pair completed an unsupported Eastern route crossing in 9 days, travelling 340 km by kayak in 2006. The Bass Strait is the sea strait which separates Tasmania from the Australian mainland. =Murray River= Cas & Jonesy completed the world's first traverse of the Murray River, Australia's longest river, by kayak. They spent 49 days in 2001 and 2002 travelling a total of 2,560 km, raising $9,500 for the annual fundraiser Kayak for Kids. Media Published in January 2010, the book Crossing the Ditch tells the story of Cas and Jonesy's adventure across the Tasman, paddling more than 2000 km kayak from Australia to New Zealand. Extreme South was written by Castrission following the couple's South Pole excursion and was published in July 2012. In the documentary Crossing The Ditch (aka 62 Days at Sea), Jones uses footage recorded during Cas and Jonesy's crossing of the Tasman Sea to tell the story of their kayak journey from Australia to New Zealand. The documentary features interviews from both adventurers. In his second documentary, Crossing the Ice, Jones uses recorded footage and interviews to tell the story of the pair's journey over 1,140 km to the South Pole and back again, and the quest to become the first humans to achieve the feat unassisted. Charities Cas and Jonesy, under the Cultural Gifts Act, donated all the expedition equipment from their two major expeditions to museums in Sydney. In 2010 the Australian National Maritime Museum acquired and showcased equipment from their 'Crossing the Ditch' expedition, and as of 2018 it remains part of the collection. The Powerhouse Museum accepted the equipment from their 'Crossing the Ice' expedition, and as of 2018 items are on display in the Expeditions section.

The Hero: A Study in Tradition, Myth and Drama by Lord Raglan, Dover Publications, 1936 Otto Rank developed his concept of the \\"Mythic Hero\\" in his 1909 text, The Myth of the Birth of the Hero that was based on Freudian ideas. It includes a set of 12 traits that are commonly found in hero myth narratives. Lord Raglan developed his concept of the \\"Mythic Hero\\" as an archetype, based on a ritualistic interpretation of myth, in his 1936 book, The Hero, A Study in Tradition, Myth and Drama. It is a set of 22 common traits that he said were shared by many heroes in various cultures, myths and religions throughout history and around the world. Raglan argued that the higher the score, the more likely the figure's biography is mythical. Raglan did not categorically deny the historicity of the Heroes he looked at, rather it was their common biographies he considered as nonhistorical. The \\"Hero's Journey\\" (or monomyth) is a common story structure explored by anthropologists and mythologists. The concept of a standard narrative archetype of a monomythical \\"hero's quest\\" that was reputed to be pervasive across all cultures is controversial. The study of hero myths started in 1871 with anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor's observations of common patterns in plots of hero's journeys. Later on, others introduced various theories on hero myths such Otto Rank and his Freudian psychoanalytic approach to myth, Lord Raglan's unification of myth and rituals, and eventually hero myth pattern studies were popularized by Joseph Campbell, who was influenced by Carl Jung's view of myth, in his 1949 work The Hero with a Thousand Faces. It illustrates several uniting themes of hero stories that hold similar ideas of what a hero represents, despite vastly different cultures and beliefs. The monomyth or Hero's Journey consists of three separate stages including the Departure, Initiation, and Return. Within these stages there are several archetypes that the hero or heroine may follow including the call to adventure (which they may initially refuse), supernatural aid, proceeding down a road of trials, achieving a realization about themselves (or an apotheosis), and attaining the freedom to live through their quest or journey.Joseph Campbell in The Hero With a Thousand Faces Princeton University Press, 2004 [1949], 140, History =Otto Rank= Otto Rank, in 1909, developed a Hero pattern that was very much based on Oedipus' legend, followed Freudian psychoanalytic thought in that the pattern lingered on the Hero's relations with the parents and was limited to the first half of the life of the Hero: =Lord Raglan= Lord Raglan, in 1936, developed a 22-point myth-ritualist Hero archetype to account for common patterns across Indo-European cultures for Hero traditions, following myth- ritualists like James Frazer and S. H. Hooke: When Raglan's 22 point outline is used, a Hero's tradition is considered more likely to be mythical the more of these traits they hold (a point is added per trait). Raglan himself scored the following Heroes: Oedipus (21 or 22 points), Theseus (20 points), Romulus (18 points), Heracles (17 points), Perseus (18 points), Jason (15 points), Bellerophon (16 points), Pelops (13 points), Dionysos (19 points), Apollo (11 points), Zeus (15 points), Joseph (12 points), Moses (20 points), Elijah (9 points), Watu Gunung (18 points), Nyikang (14 points), Sigurd (11 points), Llew Llawgyffes (17 points), King Arthur (19 points), Robin Hood (13 points), and Alexander the Great (7 points). Interpretation and criticism  =Raglan and Rank= Folklorist Alan Dundes has noted that Raglan did not categorically deny the historicity of the Heroes he looked at, rather it was their common biographies he considered as nonhistorical. Furthermore, Dundes noted that Raglan himself had admitted that his choice of 22 incidents, as opposed to any other number of incidents, was arbitrarily chosen. Though Lord Raglan took stories about heroes as literal and even equated heroes with gods, Otto Rank took stories as symbolic. Folklorist Francis Utley claimed to have demonstrated serious flaws in using Raglan's list for determining mythical or historical nature of any person or account by applying them on definite historical people such as Abraham Lincoln. He claimed that Abraham Lincoln fit all of Lord Raglan's 22 points and that using Raglan's ideas would lead one to conclude that Lincoln was a mythical figure.Francis Lee Utley, ‚ÄúLincoln Wasn't There, or Lord Raglan's Hero,‚Äù CEA Chap Book (Washington, DC: College English Association, 1965;, supplement to The CEA Critic 22, June 1965) Another recent historical figure that fit the Hero pattern quite well was John F. Kennedy and William Wallace from the medieval period did as well. Classicist Thomas J. Sienkewicz did other rankings of numerous Heroes and among those that scored quite high were actual historical persons like Tsar Nicholas II (14), Mithridates VI of Pontus (22) Muhammad (17), Jesus (18), and Buddha (15). Fictional characters such as Harry Potter (8) scored lower. =Hero's Journey (Monomyth)= According to Robert Segal, \\"The theories of Rank, Campbell, and Raglan typify the array of analyses of hero myths.\\" For Otto Rank, the true subject of any hero myth was family relations, for Lord Raglan it was the physical world and the gods that controlled it, and for Joseph Campbell it was the mind. Both Rank and Campbell overlapped in views of myths as serving psychological functions and being primarily symbolic. According to Northup (2006), mainstream scholarship of comparative mythology since Campbell has moved away from \\"highly general and universal\\" categories in general.. This attitude is illustrated by e.g. Consentino (1998), who remarks \\"It is just as important to stress differences as similarities, to avoid creating a (Joseph) Campbell soup of myths that loses all local flavor.\\"\\"African Oral Narrative Traditions\\" in Foley, John Miles, ed., \\"Teaching Oral Traditions.\\" NY: Modern Language Association, 1998, p. 183 Similarly, Ellwood (1999) stated \\"A tendency to think in generic terms of people, races ... is undoubtedly the profoundest flaw in mythological thinking.\\"Ellwood, Robert, \\"The Politics of Myth: A Study of C.G. Jung, Mircea Eliade, and Joseph Campbell\\", SUNY Press, September 1999. Cf. p.x Others have found the categories Campbell works with so vague as to be meaningless, and lacking the support required of scholarly argument: Crespi (1990), writing in response to Campbell's filmed presentation of his modelAmerican Anthropologist, 92:4 (December 1990), p. 1104 characterized it as \\"... unsatisfying from a social science perspective. Campbell's ethnocentrism will raise objections, and his analytic level is so abstract and devoid of ethnographic context that myth loses the very meanings supposed to be embedded in the 'hero.'\\" In Sacred Narrative: Readings in the Theory of Myth (1984), editor Alan Dundes dismisses Campbell's work, characterizing him as a popularizer: \\"like most universalists, he is content to merely assert universality rather than bother to document it. [‚Ä¶] If Campbell's generalizations about myth are not substantiated, why should students consider his work?\\"Web.archive.org References External links * Lord' Raglan's Hero Pattern, Monmouth College Category:Heroes in mythology and legend ","title":"Rank‚ÄìRaglan mythotype"},{"id":"43312465","text":"The Divisions of British India were administrative units of the Government of the British Raj or Indian Empire.Imperial Gazetteer of India.

It is discussed in The Dream Frontier, a book by Mark Blechner, a neuro-psychoanalyst at the William Alanson White Institute. The fear involves suffering due to experiences with frightening dreams (nightmares and/or night terrors) or by negative events in the life affecting those dreams.Owczarski, W. (2017). The ritual of dream interpretation in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Dreaming, 27(4), 278-289. Some sufferers try to avoid sleep or falling asleep altogether. Those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), for instance, often re-experience their trauma in nightmares, so frequently that they attempt to avoid these painful symptoms through alcohol or other drugs. Sleep itself is feared for its capacity to bring on the repressed trauma. However, not all oneirophobia is strictly a function of post-traumatic stress disorder, as most dream content, and thus the fear of its manifestation, is related to the daily functions of the unconscious. In traditional Freudian thought, the dreamer channels their thoughts, feelings, desires and fears through dreams, but in a disguised and nonrational way. When these dreams are recalled and experienced as disturbing events- especially if they are of frequent recurrence- the dreamer may begin to develop anxiety over the expression of their unconscious..

The team currently competes in the third-tier Regional Basketball League (RKL). The club previously competed in the first-tier Lithuanian Basketball League (LKL) and second-tier National Basketball League (NKL).  History  The team was founded in 1989. In 1993, the club competed in the Lithuanian Basketball League (LKL), falling to BC Lavera in the quarterfinals. The team was led by Augenijus Va≈°kys, who averaged the highest number of points per game for that season ‚Äì 22.9. The next season, the team signed two Americans ‚Äì Patrick Jones and Tim Brooks. The team finished in seventh place in the group stage, upsetting ≈Ωalgiris Kaunas and Atletas Kaunas in the last few group stage games to secure a ticket to the LKL playoffs. However, the team again lost in the quarterfinals, this time to the star‚Äìstudded BC Atletas 2‚Äì1. Patrick Jones, who was second in the league in points per game with 24.4, left the team before the start of the 1995‚Äì1996 season. He was replaced by the Canadian sharpshooter Joey Vickery, who continued the Olimpas tradition of nearly leading the LKL in points per game with 21.7. After a successful run in the group stage, the team finally won the quarterfinal match and advanced to the semifinal, where it lost to ≈Ωalgiris in two close matches. The team also participated in the FIBA European Cup Second Qualifying Round that season, losing to Dynamo Moscow. The team opened a new chapter in its history the following season by merging with the LKKA champion BC Ma≈æeikiai and forming BC ≈Ωemaitijos Lokiai, or ≈Ωemaitijos Olimpas, as the team was known in the LKL.Olimpas achievement chronicles The team lost many of its leaders; Vickery and Brooks left the team, as well as head coach Rimantas Endrijaitis, who successfully coached Olimpas for two seasons. The team, however, acquired new talent: Latvian Olympian Igors Miglinieks, American center Willie B. Kelly, and former Ma≈æeikiai leader Darius Staugaitis. With those players at the helm, the team won the 1997 Koraƒá Cup qualifying round against Dinamo Tbilisi, but finished third in the preliminary round and did not advance further. Coaching changes in the middle of the season brought Valdemaras Chomiƒçius and Jeremiah Walker into the team, with the former serving as a playing coach. Chomiƒçius' team made it to the LKL finals for the first time in its history, where it lost to ≈Ωalgiris Kaunas in three games. Such success in the LKL guaranteed ≈Ωemaitijos Lokiai a spot in the FIBA European Cup for the 1997‚Äì1998 season. Although the team lost Miglinieks, Kelly, Walker and Staugaitis, it celebrated Brooks' return, who had spent the year playing in France. Brooks and Va≈°kys led the team in its efforts to advance to the second round of the European Cup; however, they were not enough as the team finished in fifth place in the group stage with 2 wins and 8 losses.FIBAEurope The team's performance in the LKL also waned; the team lost to Lietuvos rytas in the quarterfinals. In 1998, the team's name was changed back to Olimpas Plungƒó. Financial difficulties forced the team to forego participation in the LKL, and soon afterwards, the team disbanded. Olimpas was reestablished in 2011 and participated in the third-tier RKL. The very first season, Olimpas finished first in the league and was promoted to the NKL.

Life John Angelos was the son of Isaac II Angelos, the Byzantine Emperor from 1185 to 1195, and again from 1203 to 1204; and Margaret of Hungary, the daughter of King B√©la III (r. 1172‚Äì1196) and sister of King Emeric (r. 1196‚Äì1204). John had three older half-siblings from his father's first marriage: Anna-Euphrosyne, Irene Angelina and Alexios IV Angelos, while he had a younger full brother, Manuel Angelos (b. after 1195 ‚Äì d. 1212). The family found refuge in the Hungarian court in 1222. King Andrew II of Hungary (r. 1205‚Äì1235), his uncle, gave him \\"Syrmia and beyond\\", i.e. south of the Sava river, including Belgrade and Macs√≥, which he ruled until 1253. In 1221, Pope Honorius III demanded that the \\"heretics\\" (Bogomils) be exterminated in Bosnia. His chaplain Aconcio was unable to gain any followers in Ragusa, and died while in Bosnia. Ugrin Cs√°k, the Archbishop of Kalocsa, proposed to Andrew II of Hungary that he would lead the Bosnian Crusade, and the king and pope promised him all lands that he would clear of heretics. Ugrin overrated himself, and instead gave 200 silver marks to John Angelos, the ruler of Syrmia, to perform the task. John took the money but never acted against the Bogomils, despite being reminded of his obligation by Pope Honorius III in 1227. King B√©la IV appointed John Angelos as the governor of Syrmia, and Rostislav Mikhailovich as the governor of Slavonia, securing his southern boundaries while heading towards the Adriatic. Another source claims that he ruled Syrmia and Baƒçka from ca. 1230. He died by 1253, since documents related to marriage of his daughter Maria mention him as deceased. Issue John was married to Matilda of Vianden (ca. 1216‚Äì), daughter of Henry I, Count of Vianden and Margaret Courtenay, Matilda‚Ä≤s mother Margaret was daughter of Peter Courtenay, Latin emperor of Constantinople, and thus sister of Latin emperors Robert and Baldwin II. Their daughter Maria was married to \\"Anselm of Keu\\". Their marriage licenses were issued in 1253 and 1254, by the papal chancellery. The first document mentions the marriage \\"inter Anselmum de Keu ac Mariam, natam Matildis dominae de Posaga, natae comitissae Viennensis\\", while the second document mentions \\"Maria, nate quondam Calojohanni\\" and also mentions Maria‚Ä≤s maternal uncle as \\"imperatore Constantinopolitano, eiusdem Matildis avunculo\\". Those data allowed Gordon McDaniel to identify Maria‚Ä≤s father as John Angelos, lord of Syrmia, and Maria‚Ä≤s mother as Matilda, daughter of Henry I, Count of Vianden and Margaret Courtenay (sister of the Latin emperors Robert and Baldwin II). Identity of Maria‚Ä≤s husband was a subject of several genealogical and historical studies, that tried to resolve complex questions related to attribution of sources on at least two persons (father and son) who had the same name: Anseau de Cayeux. Gordon McDaniel proposed that Maria, daughter of John Angelos, is the same person as Maria, who is mentioned in several sources from the 1270s and 1280s as widow of Anseau de Cayeux, and also as sister of queen Jelena of Serbia. Based on that assumption, he concluded that Jelena‚Ä≤s father was John Angelos of Syrmia. In the summer of 1280, king Charles I of Sicily issued a document, allowing lady Maria to travel from Apulia to Serbia, to visit her sister, the queen of Serbia (). In later documents, issued in 1281, Maria was mentioned by king Charles as his cousin (), and widow of Anselm \\"de Chau\\" (). If those assumptions are correct, John Angelos would be maternal grandfather of Serbian kings Stefan Dragutin and Stefan Milutin.

In one story he was taken prisoner by Saracen invaders, he was locked in the Tower of Castel-Blancat, Saccourvielle. To escape he leapt from the top of the Tower, crossed the entire Valley and fell back without harm on the other side, printing its footprint in a stone. This stone is still visible on the threshold of the chapel built at this location. In another Aventin was beheaded but picked up his head and walked to the place where would be his tomb. Centuries later, this location was revealed to a shepherd who put the remains of Aventine on a sled drawn by cows, which stopped at the place where now the village of Saint-Aventin stands.Notice historique sur Saint-Aventin d'Aquitaine, martyr, par un pr√™tre du dioc√®se, Toulouse (Bon et Privat, 1850), 1988.

The role of the uterine epithelial cells is to selectively allow the blastocyst to implant at a specific time (the time of implantation). All other times of the cycle, these uterine epithelial cells are refractory to blastocyst implantation. Uterine epithelial cells have a similar structure in most species and the changes which occur in the uterine epithelial cells at the time of blastocyst implantation are also conserved among most species.  Structure The cytoplasm of uterine epithelial cells contains typical organelles found in other cells, including a nucleus, which is located towards the bottom of the cell with one or more prominent nucleoli, mitochondria, golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, free ribosomes, lysosomes, vesicles and lipid droplets. Like all epithelial cells, the uterine epithelial cells lie on a basal lamina. = Apical plasma membrane= The apical plasma membrane displays compositional variations that change at the time of implantation. The apical domain is specialized for the initial interaction with the embryo as well as controlling secretory and absorptive processes including endocytosis and pinocytosis. The apical surface of the uterine epithelial cells is covered with microvilli that are under hormonal control and vary in length and number with the oestrous cycle and during pregnancy. A hormonally dependent glycocalyx is found outside the microvilliBucci, M., & Murphy, C. R. (2001). Hormonal control of enzyme activity during the plasma membrane transformation of uterine epithelial cells. Cell biology international, 25, 859-871. while the center of the microvilli consists of an actin filament core which is embedded into the terminal web.Luxford, K. A., & Murphy, C. R. (1989). Cytoskeletal alterations in the microvilli of uterine epithelial cells during early pregnancy. Acta histochemica, 87(2), 131-136. The terminal web is a meshwork of actin filaments, which lies immediately below the microvilli and is important in maintaining the structural integrity of the cell surface as well as acting as a barrier to movement of cellular organelles.Luxford, K. A., & Murphy, C. R. (1992). Changes in the apical microfilaments of rat uterine epithelial cells in response to estradiol and progesterone. The Anatomical Record, 233(4), 521-526. = Lateral plasma membrane= The lateral plasma membrane domain is responsible for cell adhesion and is believed to control the paracellular transport of fluid and electrolytes, that is transport of fluid between the cells. A junctional complex characterises this domain and consists of three specialized areas; the zonula occludens (tight junction), zonula adherens (adherens junction) and macula adherens (desmosome). The zonula occludens and zonula adherens form a continuous belt around the cell that provides a barrier to paracellular transport and are thought to be important in cell-cell communication.Nicholson, M., Lindsay, L. A., & Murphy, C. R. (2010). Ovarian hormones control the changing expression of claudins and occludin in rat uterine epithelial cells during early pregnancy. Acta histochemica, 112(1), 42-52. = Basal plasma membrane = The basal domain is essential for adhesion between the epithelium and underlying stroma as well as possible communication between these two regions. The uterine epithelial cells produce the basal lamina on which they rest.Yurchenco, P. D., & Schittny, J. C. (1990). Molecular architecture of basement membranes. The FASEB Journal, 4(6), 1577-1590. The basal lamina is composed of two regions; the lamina lucida that is an electron lucent layer adjacent to the basal plasma membrane and the lamina densa that is a closely packed network of fibers.  Changes at implantation  There are dramatic changes in the morphology and biochemical characteristics of the uterine epithelial cells in preparation for blastocyst implantation.Murphy, C. R., & Shaw, T. J. (1994). Plasma membrane transformation: a common response of uterine epithelial cells during the peri‚Äêimplantation period. Cell biology international, 18(12), 1115-1128. These features include a loss of apical microvilli such that the apical plasma membrane becomes flattened.SCHLAFKE, S., & ENDERS, A. C. (1975). Cellular basis of interaction between trophoblast and uterus at implantation. Biology of Reproduction, 12(1), 41-65.Enders, A. C., & Schlafke, S. (1967). A morphological analysis of the early implantation stages in the rat. American Journal of Anatomy, 120(2), 185-225. There is also a decrease in the amount of glycocalyx covering the apical surface HEWITT, K., BEER, A. E., & GRINNELL, F. (1979). Disappearance of anionic sites from the surface of the rat endometrial epithelium at the time of blastocyst implantation. Biology of reproduction, 21(3), 691-707. which leads to a reduction in the negative charge of the uterine epithelial cells. Collectively, these plasma membrane changes have been termed the plasma membrane transformation.Murphy, C. R. (2001). The plasma membrane transformation: a key concept in uterine receptivity. Reproductive Medicine Review, 9(03), 197-208. Changes in the lateral junctional complex are important in the regulation of fluid movement along the paracellular pathway, between the epithelial cells. = Tight junction changes during early pregnancy = During the early stages of pregnancy, prior to implantation, the tight junction complex, which is the main regulator of paracellular flow, extends 0.4 ¬µm down the lateral plasma membrane with little cross-linking of the tight junctional strands.Murphy, C. R., Swift, J. G., Mukherjee, T. M., & Rogers, A. W. (1982). The structure of tight junctions between uterine luminal epithelial cells at different stages of pregnancy in the rat. Cell and Tissue Research, 223(2), 281-286. At this time, the tight junctions are quite 'leaky' allowing movement of fluid and solutes between the epithelial cells.Lindsay, L. A., & Murphy, C. R. (2004). Redistribution of aquaporins in uterine epithelial cells at the time of implantation in the rat. Acta histochemica, 106(4), 299-307. At the time of implantation the tight junctions extended further down the lateral plasma membrane (1 ¬µm) and there was a significant increase in the cross-linking of the tight junctional strands. At the time of implantation the tight junctions are electrochemically 'tighter‚Äô and prevent the movement of fluids and electrolytes between the cells. These changes were also found in ovariectomised rats treated with exogenous hormones. Animals treated with oestrogen displayed a picture of tight junctions similar to that seen on day 1 of pregnancy while rats treated with either progesterone alone or in combination with oestrogen had tight junctions with similar morphology to that seen at the time of implantation.Murphy, C. R., Rogers, A. W., Swift, J. G., & Mukherjee, T. M. (1980). Ovarian hormones alter tight junction structure in uterine luminal epithelial cells. Micron (1969), 11(3), 375-376. Various components of the tight junctions regulate the selectivity of this paracellular pathway. For example, it has been shown that it is the claudin component of tight junctions regulates the charge selectivity of the tight junctions.Colegio, O. R., Van Itallie, C. M., McCrea, H. J., Rahner, C., & Anderson, J. M. (2002). Claudins create charge-selective channels in the paracellular pathway between epithelial cells. American Journal of Physiology. Cell Physiology, 283(1), C142-C147.  Fluid transport across cells At the time of implantation in a number of species the uterine lumen closes down, which allows uterine epithelial cells to come into contact with each other and ‚Äòfixes‚Äô the blastocyst in place.Enders, A. C., & Nelson, D. M. (1973). Pinocytotic activity of the uterus of the rat. American Journal of Anatomy, 138(3), 277-299. Uterine closure involves mild generalised oedema and reabsorption of luminal fluid.Lundkvist, √ñ. (1979). Morphometric estimation of stromal edema during delayed implantation in the rat. Cell and Tissue Research, 199(2), 339-348. Fluid absorption could occur through one or a combination of mechanisms; escape of uterine fluid through the cervix, which is unlikely, as this would have the potential to displace implanting blastocysts;Kennedy, T. G., & Armstrong, D. T. (1975). Loss of uterine luminal fluid in the rat: relative importance of changing peripheral levels of estrogen and progesterone. Endocrinology, 97(6), 1379-1385. endocytosis by pinopods, which develop at the time of attachment,PARR, M. B., & PARR, E. L. (1974). Uterine luminal epithelium: protrusions mediate endocytosis, not apocrine secretion, in the rat. Biology of reproduction, 11(2), 220-233. or by transcellular means. This is influenced by the tight junction molecules and ion/water channels in the apical plasma membrane of uterine epithelial cells. Studies have found an increase in claudin-4 within the tight junctions of uterine epithelial cells at the time of implantation and an increase in ENaC in the apical membrane of uterine epithelial cells.Tsang, L. L., Chan, L. N., & Chan, H. C. (2004). Altered cyclic expression of epithelial Na+ channel subunits and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in mouse endometrium by a low sodium diet. Cell biology international, 28(7), 549-555.Salleh, N., Baines, D. L., Naftalin, R. J., & Milligan, S. R. (2005). The hormonal control of uterine luminal fluid secretion and absorption. The Journal of membrane biology, 206(1), 17-28.Tsang, L. L., Chan, L. N., Wang, X. F., So, S. C., Yuen, J. P., Fiscus, R. R., & Chan, H. C. (2001). Enhanced epithelial Na (+) channel (ENaC) activity in mouse endometrial epithelium by upregulation of gammaENaC subunit. The Japanese journal of physiology, 51(4), 539-543. The increase in claudin-4 prevents the movement of Na+ ions between the cells, and the appearance of ENaC in the apical membrane allows movement of Na+ ions through the cell, from the lumen into the underlying stroma.Orchard, M. D., & Murphy, C. R. (2002). Alterations in tight junction molecules of uterine epithelial cells during early pregnancy in the rat. Acta histochemica, 104(2), 149-155. There is also an increase in AQP5 in the apical plasma membrane of uterine epithelial cells at time of implantation.Lindsay, L. A., & Murphy, C. R. (2006). Redistribution of aquaporins 1 and 5 in the rat uterus is dependent on progesterone: a study with light and electron microscopy. Reproduction, 131(2), 369-378. The osmotic gradient created by the reabsortion of Na+ ions leads to reabsorption of water through AQP5 channels in the apical plasma membrane, which causes the uterine epithelial cells to come into contact with each other and the blastocyst.

Visitors need a permit to visit the park and these can be obtained from the National Park Office in Kotamobagu. Flora and fauna Trees in the lowland rainforest area of the reserve include Calophyllum, Eugenia, Knema, Litsea, Sterculia insularis, Acalypha caturus and Cryptocarya celebicum with the largest trees being Pometia pinnata, Endospermum peltatum and Canarium asperum. On higher slopes Eugenia sp., Lithocarpus celebicus, Lithocarpus bancanus, Calophyllum treubii, Calophyllum soulattri, Derris dalbergoides and Vaccinium sp. predominated with an understorey which included many palms. The Gunung Ambang Nature Reserve is of particular interest to bird watchers and many species of bird endemic to Sulawesi can be seen here. One of the rarest is the cinnabar hawk owl, first described in 1999. Other nocturnal birds include the Sulawesi masked owl, the Sulawesi scops owl and the great eared nightjar. A number of species of flycatcher can be seen in the canopy, often in mixed-species flocks, a rarity being the Matinan blue flycatcher. More common species include the citrine canary-flycatcher, the snowy-browed flycatcher, the little pied flycatcher and the turquoise flycatcher. Also present in these flocks among the trees are the sulphur-vented whistler, the Sulawesi babbler, the streak-headed white-eye, the crimson-crowned flowerpecker, the cerulean cuckooshrike and the Sulawesi leaf warbler. Also often present nearby are the scarlet myzomela and the dark-eared myza. The call of Malia grata can often be heard, and the Sulawesi drongo, the yellow- billed malkoha and the Sulawesi fantail are also present. The purple-bearded bee-eater is an elusive denizen of woodland verges and open areas and the olive-flanked whistler is a rare upland species. Other birds that occur in the forest under-storey and on the ground include the mountain tailorbird, the chestnut-backed bush warbler and the scaly-breasted kingfisher. Raptors are chiefly found at the edge of the forest and in areas under cultivation. In the upland areas of the nature reserve are pigeons, lorikeets, parrots, including the golden-mantled racket-tail, and hornbills, although these large-billed birds are uncommon. There are a number of mammals in the reserve although these face hunting pressure, with traps being set, mostly for small mammals. The Celebes crested macaque is found in the reserve and the spectral tarsier is also present but both of these are very wary of humans. Rare mammals include the anoa, the Celebes warty pig, the Sulawesi bear cuscus and the Sulawesi dwarf cuscus, and there are plenty of forest rats which emerge into the open at night.

She is the chef, founder, and owner of Milk Bar, the sister bakery to the Momofuku restaurant group, with sixteen locations across North America. Early life and family Christina Tosi at Hot Bread Kitchen (2012) Tosi was born in Ohio and raised primarily in Springfield, Virginia to an agricultural economist father of Italian origin and to an accountant mother. After studying to become an electrical engineer for one year at the University of Virginia, she spent time in Florence, Tuscany, Italy, to see if she wanted to be a translator. Eventually, she graduated from James Madison University. After graduating, she moved to New York and enrolled in the French Culinary Institute's pastry arts program. On July 30, 2016, Tosi married New York City- based restaurateur Will Guidara. Early career Tosi entered the culinary field at the fine dining restaurant, Bouley, and then advanced to wd~50. In 2005, she helped to write wd~50‚Äôs Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point plan. On the recommendation of Wylie Dufresne, David Chang hired Tosi in 2005 at Momofuku to write his food safety plans and help administratively with the NYC Department of Health. Chang was so impressed with Tosi that he hired her to run their pastry program. There were no desserts on Chang's menu when Tosi came on board, and she created her own pastries, putting her extreme spin on childhood favorites, from cereal-milk panna cotta to fried apple pies with sour-cream ice cream and toasted miso. Milk Bar In 2008, Momofuku Ssam Bar's adjoining next store space became available, and Chang encouraged Tosi to open her own shop, which she named Milk Bar. She had free rein to develop new recipes and the menu soon featured her trademarked Cereal Milk, Compost Cookies, Crack Pie and Candy Bar Pie. In December 2009, Anderson Cooper appeared on Regis and Kelly professing his love for Milk Bar and its Crack Pie. By 2012, Milk Bar had grown from one retail sales location in the East Village of Manhattan to nine retail outlets in New York City, one in Toronto, Canada (opened in 2013), three in Washington, D.C. (opened in October 2015, February 2018 and May 2018) one in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas (opened in December 2016). and one in Los Angeles on Melrose Avenue (opened in September 2018). Tosi opened her first Boston-area store in Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a unique partnership with &pizza;, a Washington D.C.-based pizzeria chain. The Boston store was Tosi's 16th Milk Bar, and by February 2019, Milk Bar employed 381 people across North America. Media appearances and features She joined the judging panel of MasterChef on Fox beginning with its sixth season, which premiered 20 May 2015, and the fourth season of MasterChef Junior, which premiered 6 November 2015. In April 2018, an episode of Chef's Table: Pastry featuring Tosi debuted on Netflix. In April 2015, Tosi was featured on an episode of Conan making sweet desserts with leftover candy and a hammer. She also appeared in a television ad for Subaru in 2014. She also did promotional work for American Express, Kellogg's, and Est√©e Lauder. Tosi has been featured in a variety of national publications: *A list of \\"Most Innovative Women in Food and Drink\\" by Food and Wine Magazine in 2014. *Glamour in 2014 in \\"The Power of Taking Risks and the Magic Behind Momofuku Milk Bar\\". *Multiple times by The Wall Street Journal Alternate Link via ProQuest. and The New York Times. Cookbooks Tosi is also a cookbook author. =Bibliography= * * * =Reviews= Momofuku Milk Bar, Tosi's first book, was published by Clarkson Potter in October 2011. This book mostly contains recipes of the desserts that are sold at Momofuku Milk Bar. Many reviewers praised her first book. Lisa Messinger wrote, \\"Tosi is a talented new voice you want whispering in your ear as you bake.\\" Although reviewers praised the sweet concoctions that were included in the first book, a reviewer for The Washington Post wrote that because the book is not written for the home cook, she found it very demanding to prepare the recipes since they are not tested for use in a home kitchen, some of the ingredients are not easy to obtain (glucose, gelatin and freeze-dried corn powder were mentioned), preparation of some needed intermediate ingredients are quite laborious and many home ovens do not operate in the same way as a commercial oven. Measurements used in the book are both by weight, as preferred by professional cooks, as well as by volume, as usually preferred by amateur cooks and popular food magazines. A reviewer for the Austin Chronicle wrote that preparation of some of the recipes was \\"a massive pain\\" to prepare due to the fact that there were many \\"sub-recipes\\" to be prepared before making the main item. Milk Bar Life, Tosi's second book, was published by Random House in April 2015. This book contains recipes for dishes, some savory, that the author and other chefs may prepare for themselves and friends during their off hours. In contrast, a reviewer of the second book, Milk Bar Life, liked it better since it included recipes for more savory dishes, uses easier-to-obtain ingredients, and appears to be more geared to the home cook than the first book. Jenny Rosenstrach of the New York Times Book Review wrote of her second book, \\"It's impossible not to be charmed by the chatty Tosi and her hot pink and bubble-letter-filled never-never land...\\" The book includes tips like making your own Lambrusco using red wine in a Sodastream. Other business ventures In 2012, Tosi began marketing cookie mixes through Williams Sonoma stores. The cookie mix venture was replaced in 2015 by an exclusive distribution deal with Target. In 2018, Tosi and Milk Bar had executed several partnerships, including cookies with JetBlue, a lip balm with Glossier, a clothing and cookie mix collection with Madewell, and SoulCycle's first ever food offering in studios, the SoulFuel cookie.

Its capital was in Shillong. The Assam territory was first separated from Bengal in 1874 as the 'North-East Frontier' non-regulation province. It was incorporated into the new province of Eastern Bengal and Assam in 1905 and re-established as a province in 1912. History In 1824 Assam was occupied by British forces following the First Anglo-Burmese War and on 24 February 1826 it was ceded to Britain by Burma under Yandaboo Treaty of 1826. Between 1826 and 1832 Assam was made part of Bengal under the Bengal Presidency. From 1832 to October 1838 the Assam princely state was restored in Upper Assam while the British ruled in Lower Assam. Purandar Singha was allowed to rule as king of Upper Assam in 1833, but after that brief period Assam was annexed to Bengal by the British. In 1873 British political control was imposed on western Naga communities. On 6 February 1874 Assam, including Sylhet, was severed from Bengal to form the Assam Chief-Commissionership, also known as the 'North-East Frontier'. Shillong was chosen as the capital of the Non-Regulation Province of Assam in September 1874. The Lushai Hills were transferred to Assam in 1897. The new Commissionership included the five districts of Assam proper (Kamrup, Nagaon, Darrang, Sibsagar and Lakhimpur), Khasi-Jaintia Hills, Garo Hills, Naga Hills, Goalpara and Sylhet-Cachar comprising about 54,100 sq miles. Cooch Behar a historical part of Assam, was left out. From 16 October 1905 Assam became part of the Province of East Bengal and Assam. The province was annulled in 1911 following a sustained mass protest campaign and on 1 April 1912 the two parts of Bengal were reunited and a new partition based on language followed, Oriya and Assamese areas were separated to form new administrative units: Bihar and Orissa Province was created to the west, and Assam Province to the east. British India's Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms enacted through the Government of India Act 1919 expanded the Assam Legislative Council and introduced the principle of dyarchy, whereby certain responsibilities such as agriculture, health, education, and local government, were transferred to elected ministers. Some of the Indian ministers under the dyarchy scheme were Sir Syed Muhammad Saadulla (Education and Agriculture 1924‚Äì1934) and Rai Bahadur Promode Chandra Dutta (Local Self-government). The Government of India Act 1935 provided provincial autonomy and further enlarged the elected provincial legislature to 108 elected members. In 1937 elections were held for the newly created Assam Legislative Assembly established in Shillong. The Indian National Congress had the largest number of seats, with 38 members, but declined to form a government. Therefore, the Muslim League's Sir Syed Muhammad Saadulla was invited to form a ministry. Saadulla's government resigned in September 1938, after the Congress changed its decision, and the Governor, Sir Robert Neil Reid, then invited Gopinath Bordoloi. Bordoloi's cabinet included the future President of India Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed. In 1939, all of the Congress ministries in British Indian provinces resigned, and Sir Syed Muhammad Saadulla was again invited to form a ministry. Saadulla remained the Premier (Chief Minister) of Assam up to 1946, bar a period of Governor's Rule from 24 December 1941 to 24 August 1942. During the Japanese invasion of India in 1944, some areas of Assam Province, including the Naga Hills district and part of the Manipur princely state, were occupied by Japanese forces between mid March and July. When fresh elections to the provincial legislatures were called in 1946, the Congress won a majority in Assam, and Bordoloi was again the Chief Minister. Prior to the Independence of India, on 1 April 1946, Assam Province was granted self-rule and on 15 August 1947 it became part of the Dominion of India.

Art career  Searle was the daughter of the architect Henry Searle. She was born in Burlington, Vermont, and grew up from the age of ten in Rochester, New York. She started painting still lifes of flowers and fruit early in life; in 1863 she exhibited some at the \\"Babies' Hospital Relief Bazar\\" and the following year at the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy. She taught painting and drawing at Mrs. Bryan's Female Seminary in Batavia. In 1866 she had her first show, at the National Academy of Design in New York.Clement, Clara Erskine.

Preyer rarely took private students but made an exception in her case. Her mature style is very similar to his, with less detail and finer color, and contemporary reports noted that she was almost his equal as a master painter.Kunstmuseum D√ºsseldorf and Galerie Paffrath, Lexikon Der D√ºsseldorfer Malerschule 1819‚Äì1918, 3 vols., Volume 3, Munich: Bruckmann, 1998, , p. 268 Her shows during this time, for example at the D√ºsseldorf art dealers Bismeyer & Kraus in March 1870, were highly praised in the press. In 1872, Searle returned to the United States and established a studio in Washington, D.C.

She had major commissions and exhibitions throughout Germany, at the Paris Salon, and at the National Academy of Design in New York. Most of her paintings are now in private hands, but some are in publicly viewable collections such as the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the Worcester Art Museum. In the span of 1981-2008, Searle's total sales for her artwork was $122,805. Personal life While living in D√ºsseldorf, Searle had met a widowed American painter, James William Pattison (1844‚Äì1915); in 1876 they married. For a while they lived in the artists' colony at √âcouen, north of Paris.

The Nyaya School recognizes Pratyaksha (perception) as a kind of pramana along with Anumana (inference), Upamana (comparison) and Shabda (verbal testimony); this school recognizes these four kinds only. The Sankhya School does not recognize Upamana as a pramana. To these four auxiliaries which help illuminate things the Vedantins and the Mimamsakas also add Anupalabdhi (non-apprehension) and Arthapatti (presumption)as valid pramanas. Means of knowledge Pratyaksha is one of the three principal means of knowledge. The three principal means of knowledge are ‚Äì 1) Anumana, inference from data, which depends for its value on the possession of the right data, on the right observation of the data including the drawing of the right analogies, the unerring perception of true identity and rejection of false identity, the just estimate of difference and contrast, and on the power of right reasoning from the right data; 2) Pratyaksha which is the process of collecting and knowing the data, and 3) Aptavakya which is evidence, the testimony of men in possession of the sought after knowledge. Implication Pratyaksha refers to the faculties of perception with which are connected thoughts (Chinta), imagination (Kalpana) and volition (Praytna), which four together as Chetas illuminate the Manas, the ordinary mental equipment of the individual, and give awareness or consciousness (Chetna). There are four types of valid perceptions ‚Äì a) Indriya pratyaksha or sense perception, b) Manas pratyaksha or mental perception, c) Svavedana pratyaksha or self-consciousness, and d) Yoga pratyaksha or super normal intuition. In sense perception, which is an indeterminate perception the chittashakti (intelligence-energy) acts as the substratum of the senses. Mental perception arises when chittashakti, with the aid of Buddhi, reflects upon objects of senses, and is a determinate perception. Self-consciousness arises when, directed by the tattvas or panchakoshas, raga (attachment), vidya (knowledge), niyati (order of things), kala (time) and kalpa (the elements) along with pleasure and pain become objects of knowledge to chit, the intelligence of the self. Super normal intuition is gained after removal of impurities cover the intelligent-self through practice of the eight-fold yogic-discipline. Pratyaksha knowledge can be gained through a) Worldly pratyaksha, externally through the five senses and internally through mind, and b) Transcendental pratyaksha which is divided into Samanya, Lakshana, Gyana lakshana and Yogaja. Pratyaksha (apparent or obvious) is divided into Savikalpa, Nirvikalpa and Pratibhigya. Pratyaksha knowledge is intuitive in nature and in Yoga and Vedanta is also known as Aparokshanubhuti.

Biography Louw was born in Johannesburg, South Africa on 31 December 1932. He matriculated in 1949 at the Ho√´rskool Helpmekaar in that city. In 1952 he completed a bachelor's degree cum laude at the University of Pretoria, South Africa, majoring in Greek, Hebrew and Sociology. This was followed by a master's degree cum laude in 1954. The title of his thesis was \\"Die Œ∫Œ±œÑŒøœáŒÆ in die Memphis papyri\\" (\\"The Œ∫Œ±œÑŒøœá·º† in the Memphis papyri\\"). He held the post of lecturer at the University of the Orange Free State Bloemfontein, South Africa, in 1954, becoming the head of the department of Greek at this university in 1966. In 1956 he married Rina Watson. Three children were born from this marriage. He completed his doctoral studies at the University of Pretoria in 1959, with a dissertation entitled \\"A study of Œº·º† with the Present Imperative and Aorist Subjunctive\\". From 1973 to 1992 he was head of the department of Greek at the University of Pretoria. After retiring in 1992, he and Rina moved to Herolds Bay, on the Cape South Coast of South Africa. He died in Pretoria on 23 December 2011. He studied abroad in 1961 (University of Utrecht, Netherlands) and 1971 (Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio). In 1987 Princeton University offered him a four-year appointment as head of a newly established Translators' Institute. Louw declined, because of political pressure. Louw remained active retirement. He was a collaborator on the reference Bible being prepared by the Bible Society of South Africa, and was the main translator of the ScriptureDirect Interlinear Greek Bible translation of the New Testament that is available as an app in different formats. Academic career During 1960 and 1961, as guest researcher at the University of Utrecht, Netherlands, he studied under professors De Groot, Gonda, Quispel, and Van Unnik. It was here that the foundation for his interest in Linguistics was laid. On returning to South Africa, he founded an academic journal, Acta Academica, and developed an approach to linguistics for which international journals coined the designation South African Discourse Analysis. In 1991 Professor Black of the Lockman Foundation in California described this methodology as the basis of New Testament interpretation. During a period of research at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, USA, he attended several international conferences. This was an important step towards working with Dr/ Prof Eugene Nida on a new approach to lexicography. In this approach, words were arranged in a lexicon according to semantic categories, rather than according to alphabetical order. The Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament was published by the United Bible societies in New York in 1988, with four reprints in the first two years. This has become a standard reference work for Bible Translators all over the world. Professional Societies and Journals Louw participated in the activities of a number of professional societies, sometimes also serving on the boards of such societies. These included the Classics Society of South Africa, the South African Society for Patristic and Byzantine Studies, and the Linguistics Society of South Africa. He served as editor of the international journal Estudios de Filologia Neotestamentica. He founded the University of Pretoria Center for Interlingual Communication.

He was a consultant in the revision of the Good News Bible. He was invited to serve on the selection committee for scientific publications of the United Bible Societies. The Bible translation organisation The Word for the World (TWFTW), has been particularly impacted by Louw. Dr Veroni Kruger, founder president of that organisation lectured in Louw's department of Greek at the University of Pretoria, and Professor Louw was also the academic supervisor under whom Veroni studied for his doctorate. Principles learned from him form the basis of TWFTW training program and the organisation's approach to translation to this day. Louw's widow, Rina Louw, decided to donate a large portion of his library to TWFTW, and the books were received from her in August 2013, in Pretoria. Academic Legacy Johannes P. Louw is well-known internationally for his pioneering work in applying linguistic insights to the study of New Testament Greek. Most well-known of his more than 130 publications is the Greek-English Lexicon Based on Semantic Domains, published by the United Bible Societies in 1988. Johannes Louw and Eugene A. Nida were co-editors of this work. This lexicon has become a standard reference work in Bible translation. Probably his greatest contribution to the study of New Testament Greek was the development of an exact methodology for the analysis of meaning, not only at the lexical level, but also at the level of the sentence and paragraph and even greater units of discourse. This has proved to be a great help to Bible translators all over the world. Through his academic career as a teacher, he exerted tremendous influence in the lives and careers of many students and other academics who worked with him in some or other capacity. Important in this regard is the fact that, in spite of the political isolation of South Africa at the time, students from the United States and Hong Kong studied for their doctorates under him. Louw influenced on the teaching of exegetical skills to church leaders as an honorary academic adviser to Veritas College International, an organisation that provides church based leadership training in more than 30 countries. He served Veritas. Dr Bennie Wolvaardt, the founding president of Veritas College, was a student of Louw at the University of Pretoria. The semantic discourse analysis of Louw is at the root of the \\"do it yourself\\" exegetical approach with which Veritas equips their students . Another important element in his legacy is his contribution to the ScriptureDirect app for reading and understanding the Greek text of the New Testament. After his retirement, Louw served alongside Dr Bennie Wolvaardt as the main translator for the new Interlinear Greek Bible Translation of the New Testament along with explanations of the Greek forms.

It is one of the earliest surviving works by Hals, and has been held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City since 1913. The painting shows people festivities at Shrovetide (), an annual carnival of food and jollity which takes place before the Christian fasting season of Lent. Painting  The painting shows the face of an elegantly dressed smiling woman raising her right finger to make a point, while a man grabs her shoulder to whisper in her ear: he has a string of herring, eggs and mussels around his neck, with a pig's trotter and a fox tail, symbols of gluttony and foolishness respectively. Another amused gentleman, with a wurst hanging from his cap, leans on the first man's shoulder and listens to their banter. Some claim these are the Baroque theatre characters Peeckelhaeringh and Hans Wurst. Behind them other people are talking and laughing. The flagon Bears the initials \\"fh\\". The female wears much more brightly colored clothing than any of Hals other sitters, and shows a strong resemblance to the young woman portrayed in Hals' Yonker Ramp and His Sweetheart. Both are considered to be genre works today, so the models could be anyone in Hals circle such as his children or pupils. In his 1989 catalog of the international Frans Hals exhibition, Slive included a full color photo of this work to demonstrate Hals' \\"love of life\\". The painting itself could not be included in the exhibition because it can never be lent out.Frans Hals, by Seymour Slive as editor, with contributions by Pieter Biesboer, Martin Bijl, Karin Groen and Ella Hendriks, Michael Hoyle, Frances S. Jowell, Koos Levy-van Halm and Liesbeth Abraham, Bianca M. Du Mortier, Irene van Thiel-Stroman, page 129, Prestel-Verlag, Munich & Mercatorfonds, Antwerp, 1989, In the same year that Slive was writing his exhibition catalog, Claus Grimm rejected the attribution of this painting to Frans Hals, though he conceded it was probably after a painting by Hals, calling it a copy of a lost original.Entry \\"k1\\" in Frans Hals : het gehele oeuvre, by Claus Grimm, Amsterdam, Meulenhoff/Landshoff, 1990 Hals' positioning of the figures are related to two other known paintings: File:Frans Hals - Merry Trio.jpg|Hals' Merry Trio (lost in World War II) File:After Frans Hals - Shrovetide revellers NK1564.jpg|A period copy, situated outside under the moon Provenance The painting was first documented by Wilhelm von Bode in 1883, and after that was included in most catalogs of Hals' works, including by Ernst Wilhelm Moes in 1909, Hofstede de Groot in 1910, by W.R. Valentiner in 1923, and by Gerrit David Gratama in 1946. The Metropolitan Museum of Art lists an Amsterdam sale entry from 1765 mentioning a genre work of Vasten-Avond, or Shrove Tuesday, and Seymour Slive mentions a period drawing by Mathys van den Bergh. The painting was bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City on the death of Benjamin Altman in 1913. Altman paid $89,102 to acquire it from a Monsieur Cocret in 1907.

Acting on the survey findings, the Government of India initiated actions to start an advanced research institute solely dedicated to the cause and, as a result, NTIB was established in 1959, on a property, Avalon, donated by the then Maharajah of Mysore. The technical assistance was provided by the World Health Organization and the Institute procured the equipment through UNICEF assistance. The Institute has, ever since, been active in research projects and studies and has been successful in formulating a TB Control Program for the country which incorporates the clinical, epidemiological and sociological aspects of the disease. It is involved in activities such as training of medical and paramedical staff and personnel across the country, formulating policies and programs in accordance with the WHO recommended DOTS strategies, planning, coordinating and executing research on the disease and its epidemiology, monitoring of programs, campaigns and impacts and documentation and dissemination of knowledge through print and audio-visual media. The Institute was accredited as a WHO Collaborating Centre for TB research and training in 1985. Programs =Training programs= The primary activity of the Training Department of the Institute is to train the medical and paramedical personnel, both as career-based and in-service courses, to groom them for training the staff working at the primary health centres and other lower strata medical facilities in the country. The course, Training of Trainers (TOT), is a two-week course, open to medical and paramedical personnel in the District Medical Centres and medical colleges. The other training courses offered by the Institute are: * State TB Training and Demonstration Centre (STDC) Training: Three week course for STDC personnel such as Epidemiologists, Bacteriologists, Statisticians, TB specialists and trainers. * RNTCP Modular Training: The course is designed as modular and is aimed at Senior Treatment Supervisors (STS) and Senior TB Laboratory Supervisors (STLS) and other training officers of the District Medical Centres. * Training for Program Managers: Two week program for the Senior TB Officers (STO) and the Medical Officers (MO) aimed at developing the managerial and computer skills. * Post graduate Training: 10-day program for the master's degree students in Community Medicine, Chest Medicine and General Medicine and the mode of training is through practicals and presentations. * Training for NGOs and Private Practitioners: Two day course for private practitioners and NGOs as per recommendations from the State or Central TB Divisions. * Training of WHO Fellows: This is a special program for WHO Fellows and is conducted on request and recommendation from WHO. NTIB also conducts regular seminars, workshops and conference for easy dissemination of knowledge and information. =Research programs= alt=World map with In 2007, the prevalence of TB per 100,000 people was highest in sub-Saharan Africa, and was also relatively high in Asia. NTIB undertakes research programs on a regular basis, two of the current programs are: Capture-recapture to estimate incidence, periodic prevalence and completeness of Tuberculosis cases reporting under RNTCP in Tumkur district: The program aims to estimate the incidence and period prevalence of the disease in Tumkur district in Karnataka and arrive at the case finding efficiency of the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP). The research methodology is based on capture- recapture method where the patient record is compared with various other data sources. Challenges in implementation of diagnostic algorithm for patients having symptoms suggestive of pulmonary TB with smear negative report initial sputum examination: The project is focussed on preparing a database of smear test negative patients under RNTCP in the districts of Mysore, Mandya, Chikkamangalur and Shimoga, chart out the system and patient constraints and to document the behavioural patterns of the patients for preparing a diagnostic algorithm. The methodology deployed is random sampling and interview and comparison of the data with the lab registers maintained at the District Medical Centres (DMCs). =Monitoring programs= The monitoring program of NTIB covers the whole of India except the Union Territories of Daman and Diu and Lakshadweep under National Tuberculosis Programme (NTP) and Revised National Tuberculosis Programme (RNTCP). The program covers monitoring of data of smear positive and Smear negative case detections, sputum positive cases and treatment success rate. Library NTIB Library, established in 1960, is the knowledge repository of the Institute and acts as the Information Support Centre of the Institute and oversees the publications and the dissemination of information. It is accessible to the faculty and staff of the Institute, trainees, medical students, research scholars, health care providers, patients and public. The Library stocks 4,000 reference books and 10,000 bound volumes on Tuberculosis related topics such as Public Health, Radiology, Bacteriology, Statistics, Sociology, Epidemiology, Fugitive and Grey literature. It subscribes to 20 international and 35 national periodicals and has a collection of 120 audiovisual packages, 700 slides, 30 CDs and 150 transparencies, other than the NTIB publications. Publications NTIB has published many books, leaflets and journals related to Tuberculosis and its control mechanisms. * * * * * * * * * * NTIB has also brought out several manuals, guides and other publications. # Manual for Census Takers - 1960 # Manual for the BCG Vaccinator - 1960 # Manuals for the key personnel of District Tuberculosis Programme viz., Introduction, District Tuberculosis Officers, Treatment Organisers, Statistical Assistants, X ray Technicians and Peripheral Health Institutions - 1963 # Periodical Abstract Bulletin (for internal circulation only) - introduced from the year 1967 # Summaries of NTI studies Vol I & II 1976 & 1977 # Summaries of Tuberculosis Research Centre studies Vol I & II 1976 & 1977 # Report of the WHO-Government of India Workshop on Tuberculosis and Primary Health Care - 1981 # Establishment and functioning of a Tuberculosis Culture Laboratory - 1983 # NTI Souvenir - 1985 # Proceedings of the NTI Silver Jubilee Celebrations - 1985 # Tuberculosis: its diagnosis and treatment for lay persons - 1985 # Participation of General Medical Practitioners - a key to success of National Tuberculosis Programme - 1985 # Scientific Report 1980-89 - 1990 # Guidelines for Medical Officers of Peripheral Health Institutions on National Tuberculosis Programme ‚Äì Chart - 1990 # Introduction to District Tuberculosis Programme - 1994 # Manual for District Tuberculosis Officers - 1994 # Manual for Treatment Organisers - 1994 # Manual for Laboratory Technicians - 1994 # Manual for Statistical Assistants - 1994 # Manual for X-ray Technicians - 1994 # Manual for Peripheral Health Institutions - 1994 See also * Robert Koch * World Tuberculosis Day * Global Plan to Stop Tuberculosis References External links * http://www.tbcindia.nic.in/rntcp.html * on Wikimapia * Reference on TB Association of India site * Reference on US National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health site * Reference on Indian Journal of Medical Ethics Category:Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Category:Tuberculosis organizations Category:Research institutes in Bangalore Category:Medical research in India Category:Medical research institutes in India Category:Tuberculosis in India Category:1959 establishments in India Category:Research institutes established in 1959 Category:Research institutes in Karnataka ","title":"National Tuberculosis Institute"},{"id":"43313681","text":"Sulekha Hussain (1930 ‚Äì 15 July 2014) was an acclaimed Urdu novelist from India.

It is located on the Tergi River in Kazbegi Municipality, at less than 1 km from the Russian-Georgian border, 160 km far from Tbilisi.Dariali Hydro Power Plant Construction and Operation Project (Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Reportt). Darial Energy LLC. Issued in 2011. Retrieved on 2014-16-07. It is a diversion-type facility, including a small upstream diversion dam, a 5 km-long, 5 m diameter headrace tunnel, and a downstream underground power house. With an overall installed capacity reaching 108 MW (three vertical Pelton turbines 36 MW each), Dariali HPP was the fourth largest hydropower plant in Georgia on the date of its commission. More importantly, it was the largest to be built in Georgia since its independence in 1991. It is expected to generate an average electricity output of 510 GWh per year for the National Grid, to which it is connected via Dariali 110kV transmission overhead line. The project was launched in 2011, its funding was approved in May 2014 and boring works started later this year. The underground construction was completed in April 2015, and the whole facility was commissioned in April 2017.  Funding  Total cost of the project was $123 million, fairly close from the initially- planned $ 120 million, 23% of which correspond to the state contribution. The agreement on construction was signed between the Government of Georgia and the company Dariali Energy JSC on May 19, 2011.New hydro plant is coming up in Dariali Gorge. Georgian America. Retrieved on 2014-16-07. Before EBRD loan approval the company had actively used the domestic (more expensive) resource to boost the project development as much as possible. The company is supported by a top European project engineering conglomerate (Landsvirkjun Power & Verkis) (Iceland) which provides the project‚Äôs engineering supervision and preparation and implementation of the construction project. Construction and electromechanical contracts have been executed according to FIDIC standards, which makes the employer-contractor relationship the most transparent and effective. On August 2014, the company Dariali Energy JSC and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development signed loan agreement for up to US 80 million for the financing of the development, construction and operation of Dariali HPP, which comprises the first project financing and first successful public-private partnership project in energy sector of Georgia. This project is one of the first energy projects in Georgia to rely on limited recourse to the Sponsors and, under an A/B loan syndication structure, could provide a demonstration of new financing methods to other project developers in the market. EMEA Finance‚Äôs Project Finance Awards 2014 awarded Dariali Energy JSC for the Best water project in Central and Eastern Europe.http://www.diaholding.com/sayfalar.asp?LanguageID=2&cid;=104&b;=haberdetay  Environment  According to the environmental and social policies of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the project was awarded the ‚ÄúA‚Äù category. The categorization is based largely on the specific location of the proposed project and sensitive environment connected to the development of hydropower plants in Georgia, in general. The project is in full compliance with EC European Energy Policy adopted in 2007 and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (enacted by Kyoto Protocol in 2005), which appeals to all states to concentrate efforts towards increasing of energy consumption efficiency through increased utilization of renewable energy sources and decrease of environmental degradation. As a diversion-type run-of-the-river power plant, Dariali HPP required a very limited flooding the upper part of the river (the upstream impounding pond volume is 7,000 m¬≥ ), and a reduced construction magnitude, thus drastically decreasing the environmental impact of the project both in short and long term perspectives. Dariali HPP features a fish path, which should create close to natural conditions to the local river ichtyofauna (namely brown trout). The company is committed to maintain the biodiversity and for this purpose the Aquatic Biodiversity Action Plan by the Blue Rivers Environmental Consulting company has been developed. The Project claims to be the first carbon neutral energy project construction in Georgia. In order to compensate for entire lifecycle GHG emissions of the project (construction works and operation), the project includes a reforestation component. 200 hectares of forest are set to be planted by 2021 in the nearby Kazbegi Municipality. The use of Dariali HPP hydropower instead of new fossil-fueled capacities will cause the reduction of more than 250,000 tons of greenhouse gas annually, and allow reducing Georgia's independance to imported fossil fuels. Local impacts Electricity demand in Georgia has been on the rise since 2009 and investments in new generation capacity were lagging behind.Galdava, Irakli, Eric Livny and Norberto Pignatti. Khudoni and Georgia‚Äôs Energy Policy Dilemma: Go Green or Go Greedy. The ISET Economist, June 14, 2013. Retrieved on 2014-30-06. Georgia has a huge economically viable hydroelectricity generation potential (avout 27 TWh/year), although only about a third of it was tapped (8,5 GWh/year) in the 2010s, allowing a large increase in future installed capacity. The Dariali HPP generated electricity will be consumed in winter locally and exported in summer. There are plans to export the electricity to Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Balkan countries, but if Georgia‚Äôs economy develops further, it will be used to cover domestic needs. According to the EBRD the project will strengthen the private energy sector in Georgia where state owned generators account for 45% of electricity consumption. Construction of Dariali HPP aimed at developing the hydroelectric potential of the Tergi River. Income growth of Kazbegi municipality and the whole region is also expected. Construction works generated 420 jobs and plant operation requires another 70, both mostly attributed to local residents. The facility will make an annual contribution of Lari 2,5 million to the local budget as a result of the property tax. The contractor is also involved in various social activities (for example, it sponsors the children‚Äôs rugby team in Kazbegi). Opposition The critique focuses on the fact that the project will divert about 90% of Tergi‚Äôs water leaving an approximate 8 km section of the Tergi River with minimum environmental flow only. That is particularly problematic since the HPP borders with the territory of the Kazbegi National park. At present the possible impact on biodiversity especially brown trout listed in the Georgia Red List is being investigated and if any, relevant mitigation measures will be developed. The landscape on this section of the gorge will also change. One of the more known Georgian NGOs, Green Alternative, has warned already in 2012 about the increased risk of natural disasters due to inadequate analysis of the hydrological regime of the Tergi river and its tributaries, glacial rivers with large fall of stream, significant sedimentation drift and mudflow currents during heavy rain and snowmelt periods.Statement on the natural disaster in the Dariali gorge.

There was a case landslide already (in May 2014), when around 1,5 million cubic metres of landmass crashed down the mountainside and deposited in Tergi River, causing human deaths and destroying of the roads. However, there is no confirmation of the contribution of the Dariali HPP construction to this dangerous natural phenomenon.

Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi (born May 8, 1964 in Durham, North Carolina) is an advocate for disability rights and for Israel. She currently serves as president of the disability advocacy nonprofit, RespectAbility. She is also the co- founder/director of the Mizrahi Family Charitable Fund. She has published more than 100 articles on disability issues. Of particular note are those on disability and criminal justice reform, inclusion in Hollywood, philanthropy, and faith communities. Non-profit leadership Mizrahi currently does pro bono work to help foundations and funders be inclusive of people with disabilities and to advance opportunities for marginalized people. She has published on inclusive philanthropy in the Chronicle of Philanthropy, Non- profit Quarterly, EJewishPhilanthropy, the D5 Coalition, NCRP. Together with Meagan Buren she published a primer in EJewishPhilanthropy on how to make faith-organizations inclusive. A former political strategist, advocate, and commentator, Mizrahi currently writes columns for the Huffington Post,[1]Times of Israel,[2] and The Mighty.[3] She has founded or co-founded multiple organizations including The DCJCC Community Services Program, Laszlo & Associates, The Israel Project and Laszlo Strategies. As such she and the group have met 1-1 with 46 of America‚Äôs governors on disability employment issues.[4] They also rank each state on their employment levels for people with disabilities. Three times The Jewish Forward has named Mizrahi one of the 50 most influential Jews in North America ‚Äì each time for a different body of work. First it was for her work in organizing campaign training seminars behind the Iron Curtain to help defeat communism. Most recently it was for her work in Arabic to reach out to Arabs for peace with Israel.[6] The Forward listed Mizrahi as the second most influential Jew in North America. She was also profiled with an entire chapter in the book Jewish Sages of Today.[7] In 2002, Mizrahi co-founded the Israel Project,[3] a non-profit educational and outreach organization. She spent 10 years as president of the group. In 2012, shortly after stepping down from the Israel Project, Mizrahi re-established the Washington, D.C.-based consulting firm, Laszlo Strategies [4] which had previously been called Laszlo & Associates where she advised clients on issues such as medical research and education. The firm previously had focused on winning candidate and issue advocacy campaigns around the world. In 2013, along with Donn Weinberg and Shelley Cohen, she co-founded RespectAbility, a disabilities-focused non-profit. She currently serves as president of the organization, which focuses on disability policy, advocacy and empowerment of individuals with disabilities, promoting their independence, particularly in the domain of employment. Mizrahi‚Äôs change from working on Israel/Jewish issues to disability issues was broadly covered in the Jewish media including in JTA, The Baltimore Jewish Times and Tablet. Today Mizrahi is well-known as a spokesperson on disability issues. For example, on the 25th Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act she was interviewed on the Diane Rehm show. The PBS NewsHour interviewed Mizrahi on getting political candidates to address disability issues. She has published op-eds on employment for people with disabilities in more than 30 states, including the early caucus state of Iowa and her native state of North Carolina. Mizrahi is the co-author, along with Philip Pauli, Janie Jeffers and Eddie Ellis, of Disability & Criminal Justice Reform: Keys to Success. The report was featured on the PBS NewsHour. Today Mizrahi is very active in advocating for inclusion in Hollywood as a way of reducing stigmas that harm people with disabilities. In 2013 she published an important op-ed in USA Today which advocated inclusion in Hollywood and she has published many pieces since. She is also very active in promoting people with ‚Äúmultiple minority status,‚Äù including in supporting diversity for people of color with disabilities in Hollywood. During the 2016 election, Mizrahi and RespectAbility were extremely active in raising the awareness of the importance of the disability. Their publication, The RespectAbility Report, covered all the presidential candidates and swing races for Senate and Governor. During the election Mizrahi was quoted on page one of both The New York Times[8] and the Washington Post.[9] The PBS NewsHour also did a segment, featuring Mizrahi and RespectAbility on the disability vote.[10] Mizrahi has come under fire from some within the disability community for what some perceive as racist commentary on the 2016 election.[5] Mizrahi apologized for the comment and reaffirmed her lifelong commitment to social justice and equality. Mizrahi and RespectAbility run the National Leadership Program to advance a diverse leadership talent pool for the disability movement. So far more than 140 people have graduated from the program. In 1987 Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi co-founded and managed the first DCJCC Community Services Program which she ran through 1989. During her tenure it helped recruit, trained and placed 900 volunteers and helped 15,000 at risk people, including hospitalized babies, teen parents, at-risk youth, working poor, homeless and senior citizens annually. Under her leadership the program received many awards including: ‚Ä¢ 1,000 Points of Light, President George Bush ‚Ä¢ Part of the Solution, Coalition for the Homeless ‚Ä¢ Best Program in North America, Jewish Welfare Board ‚Ä¢ Community Service Award, Moment Magazine ‚Ä¢ New Horizons, D.C.

The remains are those of a civilization that peaked around the 14th and 15th centuries, with elements still visible at the time of European contact in the early 19th century. The rulers of Leluh gradually conquered and thus unified the island of Kosrae. From the capital at Leluh, they ruled the island with a monarchy that archaeologists believe was similar to the kingdoms of Tonga or Hawaii. The city itself is built of blocks of coral and basalt. It consists of housing, royal tombs and sacred spaces. Housing regrouped the king, his family, the high and low aristocracy and of course the commoner population. The materials used for the construction of housing depended on social class, as did the spatial situation of the people: in the center the King and the aristocracy behind high walls of basalt (similar to those of Nan Madol), to the west, the lower aristocracy in modest houses of coral, and the rest of the population in simple huts. At the time of European contact, the population of Kosrae was estimated at 6,000 persons; it dropped to 200 in 1870. In the wake of increased settlement, materials of the city were recycled for other uses over the 20th century. The site was listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

The play was based on the true story of Wilhelm Voigt, a German ex- convict who masqueraded as a Prussian military officer in 1906 and became famous as the Captain of K√∂penick. The Captain from K√∂penick was Oswald's second film version of the story; the first was a 1931 German film also called The Captain from K√∂penick. In the intervening years Oswald had fled Nazi Germany for France, then the United States; this was his first American film. It was completed in 1941, but due to difficulty finding a distributor, it was not released until 1945. Plot A statue of Wilhelm Voigt as the Captain of K√∂penick at K√∂penick city hall German postage stamp, 2006 Shoemaker Wilhelm Voigt is released from prison after many years of hard labor. His freedom is new to him and, as he tries to navigate this strange new world, he promptly finds himself in the midst of a Prussian catch-22: To get a residence permit (passport), he must have a job, but he can only get a job if he has a residence permit. No one in the Prussian-German bureaucracy feels compelled to help him: everything must go by the book. Out of desperation, Voigt breaks into a police station to forge the much-needed permit and escape the vicious circle. Unfortunately, Voigt is caught and again has to spend many more years behind bars. The prison's warden subjects the prisoners to the whims of his militarism. The warden loves everything military and has the prisoners re- enact famous battles. When Voigt is released, he still doesn't have his permit, but now he has a deep knowledge of military uniforms, military ranks and military speak that he can use to his advantage. In Berlin he buys and wears a used captain's uniform, then marches towards a platoon of soldiers standing guard and commands them to immediately follow him to K√∂penick, a suburb of Berlin. He is so convincing that they actually do! When they arrive, he has the soldiers stage a coup-like takeover of the Town Hall so he can commandeer his much sought-after permit, but is informed by the staff the permits are now only issued in Berlin. After he pockets all of the cash in the municipal treasury, he orders his soldiers to take the train back to their original posts in Berlin and then absconds with the cash. When Voigt sees wanted posters offering a reward for the capture of the perpetrator of the Koepenick Caper, he goes to the Chief of Police, confesses and returns all the money. The police in the station all erupt in fits of laughter, offer him drinks and congratulate him for the best practical joke they have ever heard of. Voigt is now famous and even the Kaiser wants to hear his story.

The Charleston Daily Mail reported that The Captain Of Koepenick is in production a second time, but although \\"Oswald is attempting to make the film exactly as before ... now none of his German comics can open their mouths without uttering something with a political meaning. They say what they said in 1931, but their every utterance is fraught with ideals. Still, Albert Bassermann plays a captain in uniform magnificently. John Hall is producing the picture and it better be good. Else John Hall, himself, in person, stands to lose a sizeable chunk of his money. So do Messrs.

The manufacturers compose a brave crew.\\" p. 22 (p. 8, col. 1) p. 24 (p. 10, col. 1) Release In his biography of Oswald, Kay Weniger recalled Oswald's problems with shooting good movies in Hollywood: \\"Of all his films, only his barely screened I Was a Criminal (the U.S. version of his The Captain from K√∂penick), with an excellent performance by Albert Bassermann in the leading role, is of any relevance. As U.S. audiences had a hard time relating to themes of Prussian militarism, subservience and lack of democracy, the film went without a distributior for many years and only premiered at the beginning of 1945\\". The Captain from Koepenick was screened at the Syracuse Cinefest on 14 March 2013 as Passport to Heaven.Syracuse Cinephile Society's Cinefest 2013 Critical reception Jan Christopher Horak wrote: \\"The film is a remarkable achievement for the Director. The Berlin architecture was rendered via documentary footage and studio sets, and the camera uses movement through light and shadow to bring the symbols of power again and again into the picture: In one setting, shadows transform the omnipresent image of the emperor into a portrait of the F√ºhrer. Alas, the story of a simple shoemaker [...] up against the Prussian mentality of authoritarian militarism and bureaucratic obedience, the desperation of the permitless worker rejected over and over, all these were foreign to pre-war America in 1941. [...] Unlike Max Adalbert (1931) and Heinz R√ºhmann (1956) who played the shoemaker as the \\"little guy\\", ...

Since joining the Tigers, he was given the nickname \\"Ume- chan\\". Early Baseball Career 200px Born in Nakagawa-cho, Fukuoka Prefecture, Ryutaro started playing baseball when he was in 2nd grade, mainly due to the influence of his father who at that time was a coach of the town's little league team. He originally played as an outfielder, but changed his position to catcher when he was in 4th grade. In middle school, his team, the Nakagawa Sharks, regularly participated in the Japan Baseball League. From 2005 to 2006, he led his team to 2 consecutive overall championships as the main catcher and 4th batter. Under a baseball scholarship program, he entered Fukuoka Koudai Joto High School where he played as an outfielder until the summer of his sophomore year. He was elected as team captain and returned to the catcher position during the autumn of the same year. He was a year ahead Masahiro Nakatani, another Hanshin player drafted straight from high school, who also converted from an outfielder to a catcher. He hit a total of 24 home runs in high school. Ryutaro was supposed to be included in the 2009 amateur draft, but he thought he might not be able to handle the strain from professional matches yet, so he decided to attend Fukuoka University instead. His team regularly competed in the Kyushu University Baseball League, and for four consecutive seasons, made it to the finals. In all his league appearances, he hit a total of 28 home runs, and recorded a batting average of .300. In addition, he was selected as captain of Japan's team to the 2013 USA College Baseball Championships, where Japan won the series 3‚Äì2. In November 2013, his team defeated Nippon Bunri Daigaku in the Kyushu University Baseball League championships. With this, their team represented the Kyushu region in the 44th Meiji Jingu Baseball Tournament. Unfortunately, his team was eliminated in the first round (November 16), despite him delivering three hits and a solo homer. Hanshin Tigers He was Hanshin's 4th pick in the autumn 2013 professional draft. He was assigned the jersey no. 44, previously worn by famous Hanshin sluggers Randy Bass and Cecil Fielder. 2014 With his notable performance during the pre-season exhibition games and the lack of reliable catchers in the roster, Manager Wada decided to give the rookie a go at the plate. He debuted as a pinch hitter in the March 28 season opener with the Yomiuri Giants in Tokyo Dome, and remained as a catcher until the end of the game. Two days after in the same card, he scored his first hit, again as a pinch hitter in the 6th. This feat of having a Tiger rookie catcher score during the season's opening card was last achieved 45 years ago (1969) by K≈çichi Tabuchi. He first appeared as a starter in an April 20 match with the Swallows, the first time in twelve years that a Hanshin rookie catcher did so, since Ryo Asai. A week later, he hit his first professional home run in the 9th during the match against the BayStars. He is the third rookie catcher to do so in Hanshin history, the first being K≈çichi Tabuchi, followed by Shimada Munehiko in 1985, and the second rookie catcher to hit a home run as a pinch hitter, next to Hiroshi Yagi in 1987. In the May 6 game with the Dragons, with both teams tied at the 12th, no outs and a runner at 1st, he was tasked once again to pinch hit. And to the astonishment of the crowd at Nagoya Dome, he hit a tie-breaking 2-run homerun, earning his team the victory. Even though his appointment that day was a last minute call, he didn't fail to deliver, recording his second homer for the season. He formed a battery with fellow rookie Suguru Iwazaki the next day, the first time since 2002, when both rookies Yuya Ando and Ryo Asai started an official game. From June onwards, his starts gradually increased, mostly as a catcher for Randy Messenger. He again made Hanshin history on July 1 when he hit 2 consecutive home runs, the 3rd rookie to do so since Akinobu Okada in 1980, and just the 2nd catcher since Tabuchi in 1969. On July 5, he helped Iwazaki pitch 7 shutout innings against the BayStars, making their victory the first in 31 years since a Hanshin rookie battery won an official game. His July streak carried on, and he racked up 2 more homers on the July 8 match against the Carps and the Baystars on the 11th. The strain from his continued appearances finally caught up with him however, making him lose considerable weight (10 kilos) and brought him to a slump towards the end of the season. And with the revival of veteran catchers Tsuruoka and Fujii, Umeno spent the remainder of the season mostly in the dugout. But even though he only made it to 92 games, he recorded 49 hits, 21 RBIs, and 7 home runs- at least twice that of any Hanshin catcher's home run record for the previous season. Legendary catcher Koichi Tabuchi himself praised Umeno, saying that the young rookie should give it his all to become worthy of wearing Tabuchi's former jersey number, 22. Defense- wise, he boasted a 99.5 fielding percentage and was the only catcher in both leagues to never be charged with a passed ball,2014Âπ¥Â∫¶ „Çª„É≥„Éà„É©„É´„Éª„É™„Éº„Ç∞ Êó•Êú¨ÈáéÁêÉÊ©üÊßã„Ç™„Éï„Ç£„Ç∑„É£„É´„Çµ„Ç§„Éà 2014-12-16Êó•Èñ≤Ë¶ß„ÄÇ a feat that was never accomplished in the past 35 years on NPB. Though he didn't get any playing time during the off-season Climax Series, he was tasked to pinch hit in the 2nd leg of the Japan Series with the Fukuoka Hawks. In November, he also joined the Hanshin-Yomiuri team in a friendly practice game against USA, in preparation for the 2014 Suzuki All-Star Series. He received a 9.6 million salary raise on November 21, bringing his annual salary to approximately 18 million for the 2015 season. 2015 This was his first season to start at the season opener in March, and he continued to be the team's main catcher for 13 more games until he went into a slump in April and got taken off the roster. He continued to play in the Western League (farm) games, and on May 31, he together with Fumiya Hojo and Taiga Egoshi notched a historic 3 consecutive home-run feat that was last accomplished in the farm 35 years ago. He managed to get back to the main squad in August, but given the competition with veteran catchers Fujii and Tsuruoka, he hardly got any more play time until the season ended. In 56 game appearances, he finished with an average of 0.239, and notched 18 RBIs including 4 home runs. He was tasked to catch during the first stage of the post-season Climax Series, but the Tigers did not advance to the final stage despite him contributing 3 hits and 1 run. Because his performance for the regular season was below par, he received a 3 million yen pay cut during the November salary negotiations. 2016 Fujii retired at the end of 2015, but with the breakthrough performance of Ikusei-turned-main squad catcher Fumihito Haraguchi, and the entry of another newly drafted catcher Seishir≈ç Sakamoto, Umeno was faced with more competition and his appearances became even more limited. He finished with a personal low of 12 hits and 4 RBIs out of 37 games for the entire season. 2017 With Haraguchi being groomed more towards first base and Sakamoto suffering from an injury, Umeno finally became the team's main catcher for majority of the games. On the May 6 match with the Carps, he batted in 3 runs and played a big part in biggest come-from-behind win in team history where the Tigers made up for a 9-run deficit in just 2 innings. He continued to produce hits until mid-season, which got him voted as main catcher in his first All-Star game. But as Sakamoto fully recovered in July, the two were again alternated to catch. He fell into a slump in August, and his starts gradually diminished until the season ended in which he finished with only a 0.206 batting average. He got elected as the chief player representative for the 2018 season in November. 2018 Umeno managed to firmly secure the team's main catcher role and appeared in most of the team's games. Despite having a rocky start early in the season (.217 average until June), his hitting picked up in July and by August, he batted 0.338 and racked up 10 RBIs with 4 home runs in 23 games. This earned him the team's MVP of the month award. He was mostly assigned to bat 5th or 6th, and finished the season with a 0.724 OPS, 0.259 average, 100 hits, 47 RBI with 8 home runs in 132 games. He finished second in the league in caught stealing percentage (32%) and was awarded the Mitsui Golden Glove Award for his exceptional fielding, making him the 3rd home-grown Hanshin catcher to do so, and the first one to win the award despite the team ranking last. His improved performance earned him a 24 million pay raise, almost doubling his previous salary to 50 million yen. Playing Style His right arm throw to 2nd base was clocked at 1.9 seconds, and has a fast swing speed.„Éô„Éº„Çπ„Éú„Éº„É´„Éª„Éû„Ç¨„Ç∏„É≥Á§æ„ÄéÈÄ±Âàä„Éô„Éº„Çπ„Éú„Éº„É´„Äè2013Âπ¥11Êúà11Êó•Âè∑„Äå2013„Éâ„É©„Éï„ÉàÁ∑èÊ±∫ÁÆóÂè∑„Äç Hanshin import Randy Messenger, who teamed up with Umeno in most of his starts, praised the rookie's ability to catch even his most difficult pitches. Personal When Umeno was in 4th grade, his 34-year-old mother died of cancer. In her last two remaining months, her last request to her husband was \\"Please help Ryutaro become a professional baseball player\\". His father raised both him and his younger brother singlehandedly, while he carried on with his interior design business. When he made it to the 2013 draft, he thanked his mother during the TBS live conference on October 24. He offered the commemorative ball of his first professional hit on his mother's grave.

History Randolph Cemetery was established as the first cemetery for Columbia's African-American population (up until then, African-Americans has been buried in the local potter's field called Lower Cemetery between the river and the current Randolph Cemetery). The cemetery initially consisted of three acres purchased from Elmwood Cemetery in 1872. An additional acre was purchased in 1899. Today it spans about six acres. But how those additional two acres were acquired is not clear. The cemetery fell into decline as the descendants of those interred and the owners of the remaining plots moved away, many as part of the Great Migration. The area became wilderness by the middle of the 20th century. The city of Columbia began to clear it out with bulldozers as part of its urban renewal program in 1959, but the clearing was halted when Minnie Simons Williams, a local resident, drew the city's attention to the historical significance of the cemetery. Williams, along with descendants of the founders of the cemetery, reestablished the Randolph Cemetery Association and were given (through a legal suit) stewardship of the cemetery. The association has organized donations and volunteers to restore and maintain the cemetery.

It consists of three volumes with a total of 1.1 million Chinese characters. In 1991, it won the Mao Dun Literature Prize and was honored with the title \\"a bright pearl of the Mao Dun Literature Prize crown\\". Plot =The first volume= The story begins in the autumn of 1975, a year before the end of the Cultural Revolution in Shanxi province in China(the author‚Äôs hometown).. An ordinary teenager going into adulthood in a distant village located on the Loess Plateau in northern Shanxi, northwestern China, Shaoping Sun goes to the county of YuanXi to complete his high school. His humble descent makes him shy and diffident. He falls in love with his classmate Hongmei Hao, a girl of upper class descent, which is notorious during the Cultural Revolution. However, this relationship is revealed by their classmate Yuying Hou, and the abashed Hao have no choice but to end this relationship. Hao then quickly begins another relationship with her monitor, Yangmin Gu, a young man whose family is relatively much better than Sun's. After Sun's graduation from high school, he went back home and becomes a teacher in the local village school and then becomes friend with Xiaoxia Tian, daughter of Fujun Tian, the vice president of the county's revolutionary committee. Sun's elder brother Shao'an, who has been working in the field after his graduation from primary school, falls in love with his childhood friend Runye Tian, daughter of Fujun's brother Futang, who harshly disdained this relationship. Shao'an's aunt arranges for him to meet Xiulian, the daughter of one of her very distant cousins. The two quickly starts to seeing each other and goes back to Shao'an's native village to prepare for the wedding. Runye then obeys his father to marry Xiangqian Li. Runye's father is the leader of their village. However, in the year of 1975, his village faces great difficulty in agricultural production and his applications are all proved useless. =The second volume= After the Chinese eleventh CPC Central Committee Third Plenary Session in 1976, the CPC decided to end the Cultural Revolution that was first established in 1966 and modified many concepts that are called Maoism, attributed the Chinese Communism leader Mao Zedong, during the Cultural Revolution. The new governor of the province proposed a new Household Contract Responsibility System, which contradict the central belief of Maoism. Futang, a loyal fan of Maoism, however, opposes to operate under the new system but fails; he is depressed by the great turning point of the nation. Shao'an then establishes a factory to fabricate brick in the city and becomes the wealthiest person in the village. Shaoping goes to a near city to find opportunity and finally become a miner in a nearby mine. He then starts to see Xiaoxia, who becomes a journalist after her graduation from the local normal university. Runye's life after marriage with Xiangqian is not happy. She bluntly rejects several of Xiangqian's attempt to show affection. She eventually warms up with him after Xianqian lost both of his legs in a traffic accident. Shaoping's younger sister Lanxiang manages to be enrolled in the Astronomy program of the Northern University of Industry. =The third volume= Shaoping is promoted in the mine but his girlfriend Xiaoxia dies when she is reporting a flood within the province. Shao'an's factory is ruined by a fake technician and he desperately finds himself in debt. However, with the assistance of his friends, he manages to re-establish the factory and becomes the most productive person in the whole region. Xiaoxia was killed when reporting a flood. Shaoping is wounded and disfigured in an accident in the mine. When he is recovering in the capital of the province, his friend's sister and his sister's friend Xiu Jin expresses her feeling to him and her desire to start a relationship with him. After careful consideration, Shaoping decides that he, a disfigured miner, should not marry Xiu, a university student who has great expectations in the future. http://book.ifeng.com/yeneizixun/detail_2012_09/01/17275227_0.shtml In a survey conducted during 2003Ôºç04 in seven universities in China, the novel was considered one of the most influential books.http://scitech.people.com.cn/GB/44995/45009/45228/3227823.html  Theme  The stories chronicled in this novel between 1975 and 1985 reflect the drastic political and economic changes taking place in China from nearing the end of the Cultural Revolution to the early period of Reform and opening policies championed by then-Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. The characters involved in this novel encompass a broad range of socioeconomic spectrum, involved with one another in different ways. While the protagonists of the novel, the Suns, represent the changing life situation of common people in the underdeveloped countryside, the readers also gets a personal glimpse of high- level decision-making process and personal struggles of higher officials through the experience of Fujun, Futang's younger brother. This setting enables the novel to present the viewers with a panoramic and comprehensive picture at a personal level of the reforms and changes taking place at the time.

Each district has famous beaches to promote tourism in the state such as Bheemili Beach, Rushikonda Beach, Ramakrishna Mission Beach, Yarada Beach, Vodarevu Beach, Suryalanka Beach, Narsapur etc., with Visakhapatnam district having many beaches. =Fishing and aquaculture= Farmers in coastal areas prefer fishery, Aquaculture such as cultivating fish, molluscs, Shrimp production etc., as the major occupation.AP top producer of shrimp: MPEDA - The Hindu The geographical location of the state allows marine fishing as well as inland fish production which is more profitable than agriculture, with fresh water and brackish water aquaculture cultivation.  Mineral deposits  Several minerals are found in the coastal corridor namely beach sand, heavy mineral deposits such as Ilmenite, Leucoxene, Monazite etc. An estimate of tonnes of deposits of mineral reserves are present in the beach sand of the state coast. Silica sand reserves are found along the coastal areas of Prakasam, Nellore and Guntur districts. Silica sand are used for Moulding sand, Sodium silicate, Ceramic, glass etc. Quartzites are found in Orvakal of Kurnool district. There also were sightings of rare minerals on the coast.  Sea-trade  During the medieval period, the Britishers and the Dutch, started sea trade through the coastline of India, with Andhra Pradesh coast being one of their destination. The evidences of these can be found as some coastal towns such as Bheemunipatnam. The coastline has major, intermediate and minor Ports and fishing harbours for seatrade with other countries. Visakhapatnam Port, being the major port on the east coast and there are several other ports from Srikakulam district to Krishnapatnam Port of Nellore district.  Tropical cyclonic effects  Storms turn out into severe cyclones in the Bay of Bengal and hence, 71 cyclones were recorded during 1892-1997 in the coastal region. Nellore district leads with 11 severe and 21 normal cyclones. Some of the factors like lack of flood protection and irrigation systems, drains, embankments etc., are responsible for severe damage to public and property of coastal zone.

Music written using tone-clock theory features a high economy of musical intervals within a generally chromatic musical language. This is because tone-clock theory encourages the composer to generate all their harmonic and melodic material from a limited number of intervallic configurations (called 'Intervallic Prime Forms', or IPFs, in tone-clock terminology). Tone-clock theory is also concerned with the way that the three- note pitch-class sets (trichords or 'triads' in tone-clock terminology) can be shown to underlie larger sets, and considers these triads as a fundamental unit in the harmonic world of any piece. Because there are twelve possible triadic prime forms, Schat called them the 'hours', and imagined them arrayed in a clock face, with the smallest hour (012 or 1-1 in IPF notation) in the 1 o'clock position, and the largest hour (048 or 4-4 in IPF notation) in the 12 o'clock position. A notable feature of Tone-Clock Theory is 'tone-clock steering': transposing and/or inverting hours so that each note of the chromatic aggregate is generated once and once only. Relationship to pitch- class set theory and serialism While Tone-Clock Theory displays many similarities to Allen Forte's pitch-class set theory, it places greater emphasis on the creation of pitch 'fields' from multiple transpositions and inversions of a single set-class, while also aiming to complete all twelve pitch-classes (the 'chromatic aggregate') with minimal, if any, repetition of pitch-classes. While the emphasis of Tone-Clock Theory is on creating the chromatic aggregate, it is not a serial technique, as the ordering of pitch- classes is not important. Having said that, it bears a certain similarity to the technique of 'serial derivation', which was used by Anton Webern and Milton Babbitt amongst others, in which a row is constructed from only one or two set-classes. It also bears a similarity to Josef Hauer's system of 'tropes', albeit generalised to sets of any cardinality. Peter Schat Peter Schat's 'Zodiac of the Hours', which graphically represents the tone-clock steerings of the twelve hours. Note that X can only be steered as a diminished seventh tetrachord (hence, the only non-triangular shape). Each point of a shape represents a pitch-class on the chromatic circle, and each shape represents one transposition or inversion of an hour. The term 'tone clock' (toonklok in Dutch) was originally coined by Dutch composer Peter Schat, in reference to a technique he had developed of creating twelve-note pitch 'fields' by transposing and inverting a trichord so that all twelve pitch- classes would be created once and once only. Schat discovered that it was possible to achieve a trichordally partitioned aggregate from all twelve trichords, with the exception of the diminished triad (036 or 3-10 in Forte's pitch-class set theory). Schat called the 12 trichords the 'hours', and they became central to the harmonic organization in a number of his works. He created a 'zodiac' of the hours, which shows in graphical form the symmetrical patterns created by the tone-clock steerings of the hours. (Note that Hour X is substituted with its tetrachord, the diminished seventh, which can be tone- clock steered). Jenny McLeod and Tone-Clock Theory In her as-yet- unpublished monograph 'Chromatic Maps', New Zealand composer Jenny McLeod extended and expanded Schat's focus on trichords to encompass all 223 set- classes, thus becoming a true 'Tone-Clock Theory'. She also introduced new terminology in order to 'simplify' the labelling and categorization of the set-classes, and to draw attention to the specific transpositional properties within a field. The most succinct musical expression of the theory is in her 24 Tone Clock Pieces, written between 1988‚Äì2011. Each of these piano works explores different aspects of tone-clock theory. McLeod's terminology The following terms are explained in McLeod's Chromatic Maps I: * Intervallic Prime Form (IPF): the prime form of a pitch-class set, expressed as a series of interval classes (e.g. set-class (037) is called 3-4 in Tone-Clock Theory, as these are the interval classes between successive pitches in the prime form). Where possible, IPFs should be labelled using hour-group notation (see below). Furthermore, if an IPF can be rewritten so that the number of different interval classes in the title is one or two, then this is the preferred notation: e.g. IPF 143 (0158 in pc-set theory) can be rewritten as 414 or 434, which is to be preferred, as it makes the relationship to the trichords clearer ‚Äî see below. * Hours: the 12 trichordal set-classes, called 'triads' in Tone-Clock Theory. The 'first hour' is therefore IPF 1-1 (in pc- set theory, this would be set-class 3-1 or (012)), while the 'twelfth hour' is IPF 4-4 (in pc-set theory, this would be set-class 3-12 or (048)). In Tone- Clock Theory, the hours are often referred to using Roman numerals ‚Äî so IV is IPF 1-4, while IX is IPF 2-5. * Major/minor form: For 'asymmetrical' hours (hours that are formed from two different interval classes), the 'minor' form is the inversion of the triad with the smallest ic on the bottom, while the 'major' form is the inversion with the largest ic on the bottom. So, XIm is equivalent to a standard minor triad (3-4), while XIM is equivalent to a major triad (4-3). * Hour Groups: IPFs with only one or two interval classes can often be related to a single hour, and relabelled using the Roman numeral hour notation to make this relationship clear. For instance, the tetrachord IPF 242 clearly relates to the 'eighth hour', IPF 2-4 (set-class 3-8 in pc-set theory). It can therefore be labelled as VIII4 ‚Äî the 4 relating to its cardinality, a tetrachord. Note that some IPFs cannot be labelled as hour- groups if the distribution of intervals is ambiguous: e.g. for IPF 2232, it is unclear as to whether the generating trichord is 2-2 (VI) or 2-3 (VII). However, 2232 can be rewritten as 3223, 5225 or 5555 or 2323, all of which are valid hour groups (see 'Multiple-Hour Groups' below). * Oedipus Groups: The commonest kind of hour-group, in which two interval classes alternate (e.g. the octatonic scale, in which the interval classes proceed 1212121), relating to the second hour (II, or IPF 1-2). These are simply written in the form: II8. * Multiple-Hour Groups: Some IPFs can be rearranged so that while they are no longer in prime form, they do display a different hour relationship ‚Äî for instance, 414 (IVM4) can also be rewritten as 434 (XIM4). In Tone-Clock Theory, this is considered to show that an IPF has multiple relationships to different hours, which can be brought out by the composer depending on how they are voiced and utilized. * Symmetrical Pentads: A pentachord/pentad that has a clear relationship to an asymmetrical hour, but in which the two interval classes are arrayed symmetrically rather than alternately (e.g. 2442) is called a 'symmetrical pentad', and is written thus: SP VIII. * Steering: one IPF transposes by another (i.e. IPF a 'steers' IPF b). If IPF a and b are the same, then this is 'self steering'. Note that the IPF does not necessarily remain in its prime form, but can also appear inverted. In Tone-Clock Theory, the 'steering group' (the IPF that is underlying the transpositional levels) has a kind of 'deep structure' status ‚Äî the listener does not necessarily hear its immediate effect, but it governs elements such as voice-leadings. * Reverse Steering: the 'steering group' becomes the 'steered group' and vice versa ‚Äî i.e. IPF b 'steers' IPF A. In Tone-Clock Theory, this is considered to have a kind of 'symmetry', and often appears to provide contrast or 'closure' to a passage. * Twelve-Tone Steering or Tone-Clock Steering: a specific steering of an IPF so that the chromatic aggregate is created with no repetition of pc. All of the triads except the tenth hour (the diminished triad) can be steered in this way. Some tetrachords, and all hexachords that are self-complementary (i.e. not Z-related) can also be steered in this way. * Anchor Form: the creation of the twelve-tone aggregate with no pc repetition, typically from a tetrachord, but using a second IPF to complete the aggregate. Mathematical generalizations of 'tessellating' set-classes New Zealand composer and music theorist Michael Norris has generalized the concept of 'tone-clock steering' into a theory of 'pitch-class tessellation', and has developed an algorithm that can provide tone-clock steerings in 24TET. He has also written about and analyzed Jenny McLeod's 'Tone Clock Pieces'.

Early life and family  Arnold was born on May 2, 1925, in Melrose, Massachusetts, where she was raised. Her father was Edmund Arnold, a civil engineer, and her mother was Fanny (n√©e Doty) Arnold. She had two brothers, and together they grew up spending their summers on the coast of Massachusetts in Humarock. She is a direct descendant of Benedict Arnold, and can trace her ancestry back to the Mayflower. Anne married the abstract painter Ernest Briggs in 1960. Arnold and Briggs bought a house and barn in Montville, Maine, in 1961, at the foot of Hogback Mountain. Briggs died in 1984. Anne's long-time companion was the photographer Robert Brooks. In 1946 Arnold received her BA from the University of New Hampshire, and in 1947 an MA from Ohio State University. She studied art from 1949 until 1953 at the Art Students League in New York.  Artistic career  Anne Arnold began creating sculptures of dogs, people and other domestic creatures in the 1950s. In 1960 she held her first one-person exhibition at New York's Tanager Gallery. From 1964 until 1988 Arnold showed her work at the Fischbach Gallery in New York. The Paul Creative Arts Center of the University of New Hampshire exhibited a full retrospective of her work in 1983. During the 1970s Arnold created life- size, and bigger than life-size sculptures. She made them by wrapping canvas around wooden armatures. After Arnold's husband Ernie Briggs' death in 1984 she worked mostly with watercolor and pencil on sketches made outdoors in Maine. In 2006 the Alexandre Gallery in New York began to represent Arnold's work. In 2012 and in 2014 the Alexandre Gallery held one-person shows of her work. Arnold served on the Board of Governors of the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture from 1981 until 2010. She was also an associate of the National Academy of Design in New York.North American Women Artists of the Twentieth Century: A Biographical Dictionary by Jules & Nancy G.

Beginning in 1971, and for the following 20 years, Arnold taught sculpture at Brooklyn College. She also taught at Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania. Arnold died on June 20, 2014, of natural causes, in her New York City studio at the age of 89.

He works as a detective for the Louisiana State Homicide Unit, alongside his partner Martin \\"Marty\\" Hart, portrayed by Woody Harrelson. The season follows Cohle and Hart's hunt for a serial killer in Louisiana across 17 years. The character of Rust Cohle and Matthew McConaughey's performance have gained critical acclaim. McConaughey received a Critics' Choice Television Award and nominations for a Golden Globe Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance. Character overview Cohle is introduced as a gifted, but deeply troubled, detective from Texas who is transferred from working on regional drug task force to the Louisiana State Police near the end of 1994. After three months with the LSP, in January 1995, he and his partner are tasked with investigating a series of brutal, bizarre murders. A haunted, solitary cynic, Cohle believes that life is meaningless, human beings are merely \\"sentient meat\\", and hope is self- delusion. Cohle spends his free time obsessing over every detail of the crime, hoarding evidence in a storage locker and keeping extensive notes in a ledger, which earns him the derisive nickname \\"The Taxman\\" among his colleagues. The series gradually reveals Cohle's backstory. He was born in South Texas but raised in Alaska by his father after his parents divorced. He became a police detective in his 20s. Years before the main story arc, his two-year-old daughter, Sophia, was killed in a car accident, a tragedy that destroyed his marriage. Devastated by the loss, Cohle grew ever more unstable and unpredictable in his work, eventually killing a crystal meth addict who had injected his own child with the drug. His superiors offered him a chance to avoid prison by working as an undercover narcotics detective, which he did for four years; Cohle notes that this was twice as long as most undercover detectives are kept in rotation. During this assignment, Cohle became addicted to drugs, and eventually killed three cartel members in a shootout, while being shot multiple times himself. During his recovery, he was committed to a mental hospital in Lubbock, Texas. Upon his release, he was offered retirement with full pension, but he declined that offer in favor of transferring to a homicide division. His superiors then transferred him to Louisiana. In Louisiana, he lives alone and has no friends, living only for his work. Cohle also has synesthesia and suffers from flashbacks from his drug-using years as an undercover cop. The series takes place in two time periods: 1995‚Äì2002, in which Cohle and Hart work together to find the killer; and 2012, when Cohle, who has by now quit the police force and become an alcoholic, submits to an interview with Louisiana State Police Department detectives Maynard Gilbough (Michael Potts) and Thomas Papania (Tory Kittles) regarding the murders. Cohle sees through the detectives, and realizes that they think he is the killer. He uses the interview to find out what information the detectives have on him. Character arc Cohle and Hart are assigned to investigate a murder in which the killer raped and tortured the victim, Dora Lange, and attached a pair of antlers to her head after killing her. They find Lange's diary, which contains repeated references to \\"Carcosa\\" and a \\"Yellow King\\". In the wreckage of a burnt-out church Lange attended, they find a wall painting depicting a human figure wearing deer antlers. Cohle and Hart work the case for three months, during which they trace the murder to Reggie Ledoux (Charles Halford), a former cellmate of Lange's ex-husband. To find more information, Cohle infiltrates a biker gang with ties to Ledoux, posing as a drug dealer representing a cartel in Mexico. He assists the gang in a home invasion so he can kidnap the ringleader, Ginger (Joseph Sikora), and force him to lead them to Ledoux, who cooks meth for the biker gang. During the home invasion, a shootout ensues in which several people are killed. Ginger takes Cohle to meet Ledoux's cousin and \\"cook partner\\", Dewall (√ìlafur Darri √ìlafsson). The meeting does not go well, but Hart follows Dewall to Ledoux's meth lab and calls Cohle to tell him where it is. There, Hart and Cohle discover that Ledoux has kidnapped and tortured two children, and Hart kills Ledoux in a fit of rage as Cohle looks on. Dewall, meanwhile, is killed after he runs off and blows up on one of his own homemade mines. Cohle stages evidence to support Hart's story that Ledoux opened fire on them, forcing Hart to kill him in self-defense. The two are hailed as heroes, and receive commendations and promotions. In 2002, Cohle interrogates a suspect who reveals that Ledoux and Dewall did not act alone. He tells Cohle that he will give them information about the \\"Yellow King\\" in return for a plea deal. Cohle wants to investigate this lead further, but the suspect kills himself in his cell that night, after receiving a phone call. Cohle becomes obsessed with reopening the case, and pursues several leads, including a private Christian school run by Rev. Billy Lee Tuttle (Jay O. Sanders) that had been closed amid rumors of child molestation. Tuttle complains to Cohle's superiors, who suspend Cohle without pay and order him to leave the case closed. That night, Hart's wife Maggie (Michelle Monaghan) shows up at Cohle's apartment and seduces him as revenge for Hart's infidelity. Hart finds out and gets into a fistfight with Cohle in front of the entire department. Cohle quits the force the same day, and becomes a drifter and an alcoholic, supporting himself as a part-time bartender. Cohle in 2012 In 2012, murders similar to those from 1995 begin again, Cohle is seen in the vicinity of the body, arousing the suspicion of Louisiana State Police Department detectives Maynard Gilbough and Thomas Papania. They believe that Cohle was the killer in 1995, because he led Hart to every lead they had and seemed to know everything about the killer's frame of mind. Gilbough and Papania now believe that Cohle is committing the new murders as well. They interview Cohle and Hart, who both refuse to cooperate once the purpose of the interview becomes clear. Cohle meets with Hart and tells him that he has found evidence leading to the killer. Hart is skeptical, and still resentful of Cohle for having sex with Maggie, but Cohle convinces him to help with the investigation by showing him a videotape he stole from Rev. Tuttle's home. The video is over 20 years old, and shows numerous masked men raping and torturing Marie Fontenot, a missing child whose name had come up in their investigation 17 years earlier. Cohle and Hart track down the original case's chief investigating officer, Steve Geraci (Michael Harney), and interrogate him at gunpoint. Geraci tells them that his superior, the late Sheriff Ted Childress, ordered him to halt the investigation; Childress was one of Tuttle's relatives. They soon discover that the Tuttle and Childress families ‚Äî to whom both Reggie and Dewall Ledoux belong ‚Äî are related, and have long histories of child abuse and murder. They ultimately discover that the killer is a Childress, and go to the late sheriff's home to investigate. Cohle and Hart go to the Childress house, where they find that the sheriff's son, Errol (Glenn Fleshler), is the killer, and discover the remains of his father tied up in a shed. They also encounter Betty Childress (Ann Dowd), his mentally disabled half-sister, with whom he is having an incestuous relationship. Cohle pursues Childress into the catacombs behind the house, which Childress identifies as Carcosa. Cohle discovers an idol draped in yellow and covered in skulls ‚Äî the \\"Yellow King\\" ‚Äî and has a hallucination of a spiraling vortex, the same vortex that had been drawn on many of the victims over the past 17 years. Childress stabs Cohle in the gut and also attacks Hart, but Cohle saves his partner by shooting Childress in the head, killing him. Gilbough and Papania, whom Hart had called, arrive at the scene. With the evidence Hart and Cohle collected, they connect Childress to dozens of murders, including Dora Lange's. Cohle falls into a coma, during which he feels the loving presence of his father and daughter. He later wakes up in hospital and leaves with Hart, and looks up at the night sky, telling his partner, \\"Once there was only dark.
