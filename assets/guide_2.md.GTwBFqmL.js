Biography In 1977, Hayes began to attend punk rock shows in the San Francisco bay area. He soon adopted the \\"punk rock name\\" Larry Livermore, an allusion to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a nuclear research and development facility in Livermore, California, run by the University of California. In 1984, he founded Lookout magazine, based in Laytonville, California, and continued to publish it until 1995. In 1985, he formed the Lookouts, a punk-rock band whose 12-year-old drummer, Tre Cool, later went on to play for Green Day.Green Day gig preview The Lookouts recorded two LPs, One Planet One People and Spy Rock Road, and two EPs, Mendocino Homeland and IV, between 1985 and 1990, with Livermore playing guitar and singing. In 1987, with his friend David Hayes (no relation), he co-founded Lookout Records, which released gold and platinum- selling albums by Operation Ivy and Green Day,https://books.google.com/books?id=ixyhqFqgqVIC&pg;=PT230&lpg;=PT230&dq;=operation+ivy+green+day+lookout+gold+platinum&source;=bl&ots;=PUgsMW6beT&sig;=ACfU3U01ekWNNjodFA5I6gLyC_D24xjv5g&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjMrND5qrzoAhXGl3IEHRfZCyUQ6AEwCnoECBAQAQ#v=onepage&q;=operation%20ivy%20green%20day%20lookout%20gold%20platinum&f;=false as well as scores of releases from other artists. Many of the bands on Lookout were associated with 924 Gilman Street, a nonprofit, volunteer-run punk-rock club based in Berkeley, California. David Hayes left the label at the end of 1989 to establish a label of his own, Very Small Records. Larry Livermore continued as president and principal owner of Lookout Records until he retired in 1997. In 1992, Livermore, Chris Appelgren, and Patrick Hynes formed the Potatomen, a pop band that has released two albums, Now and Iceland, two EPs, On the Avenue and All My Yesterdays, and a split EP, The Beautiful and Damned/The Day I Said Goodbye, with the Canadian band Cub. From 1987 until 1994, Livermore was a columnist for Maximum Rocknroll magazine, and from 1994 to 2007 wrote a monthly column for Punk Planet magazine. Livermore had a scene report column on East Bay's punk zine Absolutely Zippo. He was also a contributor to the Anderson Valley Advertiser, Janelle Hessig's zine Tales of Blarg, and the seminal queercore zine Homocore. In 2008, quarterly periodical Verbicide Magazine began publishing his column, titled \\"Beneath the BQE.\\" Livermore's first column for Verbicide appears in issue 23. Livermore released his first book, Spy Rock Memories, on Don Giovanni Records in 2013. He released his second book, How to Ru(i)n a Record Label: The Story of Lookout Records, in 2015.

He was born in Estonia but moved to Sweden in 1946. Acclaimed mostly for his artwork, Gohs usually writes his own stories as well. Early works such as Mannen fr√•n Claa (The Man from Claa) and D√∂dens F√•gel (The Bird of Death) were well received. In the late 1950s he began to produce covers for the Swedish \\"Fantomen\\" comic book. Today he is probably best known to the general public for his cover paintings. As Sweden's most prominent comic book cover artist, Gohs has produced covers featuring some of the most well-known comic characters from all over the world. Many of his works have been published outside Sweden. Swedish Fantomen album from 1994. Art by Rolf Gohs. In 1969, Gohs created his most famous comic, Mystiska 2:an (The Mysterious Two) about two young teenagers in Stockholm. Sometimes the stories were pure adventure style, at other times more of social realism. Mystiska 2:an was published irregularly in comic books and album form for almost twenty years. However, a 1980s story where one of the young boys fell in love with a grown-up man, caused some controversy on the Swedish comic book arena, and apparently meant the end of the feature (as well as the recently created magazine Comet, in which it was published). Since then, Gohs produced a comic book story about the legendary Children's Crusade directly for the Swedish Phantom comic book.

In the perspective of family, marriage can bring families of different surnames (different clans) together, and continue the family life of the concerned clans. Therefore, only the benefits and demerits of the clans, instead of the individual couples, are concerned in a marriage. Socially, a married couple is the basic unit of the population; sometimes marriages can affect the country's political stability and international relations (especially to certain foreign tribes like Mongolians, Manchus, Huns, and Turks); thus marriage can be related to politics. From the point of view of Confucian philosophy, one of the purposes of marriage is the cultivation of virtue. The Chinese have seen that marriage () should be founded on love since the concept of monogamy is rooted in their mindset. Ideographically, h≈´n (Â©ö) is identical to h≈´n (Êòè, literally means an evening; a dusk) in ancient writings, though the former has the radical (Chinese character) n«î (Â•≥, literally means a female). Similarly, yƒ´n (Âßª) is the same as yƒ´n (Âõ†). According to Zhang Yi's (ÂºµÊèñ) (), a dictionary for ancient Chinese characters, yƒ´n (Âõ†) means friendliness, love and harmony, indicating that correct way of living for a married couple. Further influences on marriage Due to the concept of filial piety and following rites of propriety, marriage was a costly affair and seen as second only to funeral ceremonies. The use of a matchmaker was meant to ensure that the husband and wife were compatible with each other, but primarily worked in the families' best interests.

The defence secured an acquittal. During the Revolution of 1688, Booth declared in favour of William of Orange, and raised an army in Cheshire in support of him. After William was installed as William III, he made Booth chancellor of the exchequer in 1689.

The lyrics were inspired by the 1946 aggravated assault and blinding of World War II veteran Isaac Woodard in a county jail in South Carolina. The song mistakenly references Aiken, SC, as the location of this savage beating. Batesburg, SC, a small textile milling town nearly 30 miles to the northeast served as the actual location of the incident which sparked a major civil rights issue. The song title appears to be a reference to the biblical tale of the Binding of Isaac. Guthrie later wrote, \\"I sung this Isaac Woodard song in the Lewisohn Stadium one night for more than 36,000 people, and I got the loudest applause I've ever got in my whole life. This song is a long song, but most of the action is told in Isaac's own words.

History  Halle Berry attending the premiere of the movie Robots Chilean President Sebasti√°n Pi√±era arriving in Paris in October 2010 The earliest known reference to walking a red carpet in literature is in the play Agamemnon by Aeschylus, written in 458 BC. When the title character returns from Troy, he is greeted by his wife Clytemnestra who offers him a red path to walk upon: > Now, dearest husband, come, step from your chariot. But do not set to earth, > my lord, the conquering foot That trod down Troy. Servants, do as you have > been bidden; Make haste, carpet his way with crimson tapestries, Spread silk > before your master‚Äôs feet; Justice herself Shall lead him to a home he never > hoped to see. * Phillip Vellacott, The Oresteian Trilogy, Penguin 1973 > (Google Books) Agamemnon, knowing that only gods walk on such luxury, responds with trepidation: > I am a mortal, a man; I cannot trample upon these tinted splendors without > fear thrown in my path. Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting often show rugs and carpets, patterned but with red often the main background colour, laid on the steps to a throne, or on a dais where rulers or sacred figures are placed. A red carpet was rolled out to a river to welcome the arrival of United States president James Monroe in 1821. In 1902, the New York Central Railroad used plush crimson carpets to direct people as they boarded their 20th Century Limited passenger train. This is believed to be the origin of the phrase \\"red-carpet treatment\\". Film premieres are often laid down with red carpets, but wasn't until the 1920s that the red carpet and Hollywood became truly synonymous. The crimson-hued carpet was unfurled for the Hollywood premiere of Robin Hood, starring Douglas Fairbanks, in front of the Egyptian Theatre in 1922. And for the following decades, there were only few places where the public could catch a glimpse of charismatic stars like Clark Gable, Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly, and the red carpet was one of them. Then, in 1961, the red carpet was introduced at the Academy Awards at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. A few years later, the broadcasters of the ceremony opted to film outside the venue, showing the arrival of guests as they stepped out of their limousines. From this point in 1964, the red carpet became a globally acknowledged focal point for actors and actresses to make a grand entrance and showcase themselves at the Oscars. Publicity events A red carpet is also used in gala celebrity events such as the Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, Grammy Awards, Met Gala, and BAFTAs. While the awards take place inside, much of the publicity and excitement takes place outside with journalists discussing the red carpet fashions, what designers are being worn by which stars and photographers taking pictures. This is now a spectacular international product placement arena of great importance to the fashion industry. Red carpets are often coupled with publicity backdrops which contain brand logos or emblems for photography purposes. Carpeting in other colors may replace red in some instances to honor a certain cause or for a sponsored event, the sponsor's logo colors, such as a \\"green carpet\\" to promote environmental awareness, or for the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, an orange carpet is used instead to go with the network's primary imaging color. MTV uses a blue colored carpet for their Video Music Awards. The premiere of the film Detective Pikachu used a yellow carpet to match the color of the lead character. In some countries such as South Africa and the Philippines, a red carpet is laid for members of parliament and other guests entering the joint session, allowing a showcase of fashion for politicians. Phrases More generally, \\"red carpet treatment\\" and \\"rolling out the red carpet\\" usually refer to any special efforts made in the interests of hospitality.

Duchesne was born in L'√éle-Bouchard. He was educated at Loudun and afterwards at Paris. From his earliest years he devoted himself to historical and geographical research, and his first work, Egregiarum seu selectarum lectionum et antiquitatum liber, published in his eighteenth year, displayed great erudition. He enjoyed the patronage of Cardinal Richelieu, a native of the same district with himself, through whose influence he was appointed historiographer and geographer to the king. He died in Paris in 1640, in consequence of having been run over by a carriage when on his way from the city to his country house at Verri√®res. Works Andr√© Duchesne, Histoire g√©n√©alogique de la maison de Montmorency et de Laval (1624) Duchesne's works were very numerous and varied, and in addition to what he published, he left behind him more than 100 folio volumes of manuscript extracts now preserved in the Biblioth√®que Nationale (L. Delisle, Le Cabinet des manuscrits de la Biblioth√®que imp√©riale, t. L, 333‚Äì334). Several of his larger works were continued by his only son Fran√ßois Duchesne (1616‚Äì1693), who succeeded him in the office of historiographer to the king. The principal works of Andr√© Duchesne are Les Antiquit√©s et recherches de la grandeur et majest√© des rois de France (Paris, 1609), Les Antiquit√©s et recherches des villes, ch√¢teaux, &c.;, de toute la France (Paris, 1609), Histoire d'Angleterre, d'Ecosse, et d'Irelande (Paris, 1614), Histoire des Papes jusqu'√† Paul V (Paris, 1619), Histoire des rois, ducs, et comtes de Bourgogne (1619‚Äì1628, 2 vols. fol.), Historiae Normanorum scriptores antiqui (1619, fol., now the only source for some of the texts), and his Historiae Francorum scriptores (5 vols. fol., 1636‚Äì1649). This last was intended to comprise 24 volumes, and to contain the narrative sources for French history in the Middle Ages; only two volumes were published by the author, his son Fran√ßois published three more, and the work remained unfinished. Besides these Duchesne published a great number of genealogical histories of illustrious families, of which the best is that of the house of Montmorency. His Histoire des cardinaux francais (2 vols. 101. 1660‚Äì1666) and Histoire des chanceliers et gardes des sceaux de France (1630) were published by his son Fran√ßois. Andr√© also published a translation of the Satires of Juvenal, and editions of the works of Alcuin, Abelard, Alain Chartier and √âtienne Pasquier. * Les Antiquit√©s et recherches de la grandeur et majest√© des rois de France (Paris, 1609) * Les Antiquit√©s et recherches des villes, ch√¢teaux, &c.;, de toute la France (Paris, 1609) * Histoire d'Angleterre, d'√âcosse, et d'Irlande (Paris, 1614) * Biblioth√®que des auteurs qui ont √©crit l'histoire et la topographie de la France, 1618 * Histoire des Papes jusqu'√† Paul V (Paris, 1619) * Histoire des rois, ducs, et comtes de Bourgogne (1619‚Äì1628, 2 volumes fol.) * Grande Histoire de la Maison de Vergy, (Parigs, 1625) * Historiae Normanorum scriptores antiqui (1619) * Histoire de la Maison de Chastillon sur Marne, Paris, 1621 * Historiae Francorum scriptores (5 volumes fol., 1636‚Äì1649) ReferencesExternal links *Historiae Normannorum scriptores antiqui at Google Books *Historiae Francorum scriptores... at Google Books: Vol I, Vol II, Vol IV, Vol V Category:1584 births Category:1640 deaths Category:French male non-fiction writers Category:17th-century French historians Category:17th-century male writers ","title":"Andr√© Duchesne"},{"id":"1892047","text":"The Confederate Monument, University of North Carolina, commonly known as Silent Sam, is a bronze statue of a Confederate soldier by Canadian sculptor John A. Wilson, which stood on the historic McCorkle Place of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) from 1913 until it was pulled down by protestors in 2018. Its former location has been described as \\"the front door\\" of the university and \\"a position of honor\\". Establishing a Confederate monument at a Southern university became a goal of the North Carolina chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) in 1907. UNC approved the group's request in 1908 and, with funding from UNC alumni, the UDC and the university, Wilson designed the statue, using a young Boston man as his model. At the unveiling on June 2, 1913, local industrialist and UNC Trustee Julian Carr gave a speech espousing white supremacy, while Governor Locke Craig, UNC President Francis Venable and members of the UDC praised the sacrifices made by students who volunteered to fight for the Confederacy. The program for the unveiling simply referred to the statue as \\"the Confederate Monument\\", with the name \\"Soldiers Monument\\" also being used around the same time. The name Silent Sam is first recorded in 1954, in the student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel. Beginning in the 1960s, the statue faced opposition on the grounds of its racist message, and it was vandalized several times during the civil rights movement. Protests and calls to remove the monument reached a higher profile in the 2010s, and in 2018, UNC Chancellor Carol L. Folt described the monument as detrimental to the university, and said that she would have the statue removed if not prohibited by state law. Increased protests and vandalism resulted in the university spending $390,000 on security and cleaning for the statue in the 2017‚Äì18 academic year. The statue was toppled by protesters, and later that night removed to a secure location by university authorities. A statement from Chancellor Folt said the statue's original location was \\"a cause for division and a threat to public safety,\\" and that she was seeking input on a plan for a \\"safe, legal and alternative\\" new location. The UNC-Chapel Hill Board of Trustees made a recommendation in December 2018 for a new \\"University History and Education Center\\" to be built on campus, at an estimated cost of $5.3 million, but this was rejected by the university system's Board of Governors. The pedestal base and inscription plaques were removed in January 2019, with a statement from Chancellor Folt citing public safety. In November 2019, in response to a lawsuit from the Sons of Confederate Veterans, UNC donated the statue to the group, with a $2.5 million trust for its \\"care and preservation\\", on the condition that the statue would not be displayed in the same county as any UNC school. However, in February 2020 the settlement was overturned by the judge who originally approved it, who ruled that the SCV lacked standing to bring the lawsuit. Early history, 1909‚Äì1913=Campaign The statue in John A. Wilson's Waban Hill Road Studio, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts During the American Civil War, over 1,000 students and employees of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) enlisted, of whom 287 are known to have lost their lives. University president David Lowry Swain had petitioned the Confederacy to exclude students in their final two years from conscription, and this was granted in 1863, but revoked a year later. Swain was able to keep the university open throughout the war by educating the few students unable to fight‚Äîthose too young to enlist, exempt because of ill health, or discharged because of war injuries‚Äîthough the senior class in the spring of 1865 had only one student. In 1907, the North Carolina chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) decided that its next major goal was to \\"be the erection, on the campus at the State University, of a monument to the students and faculty, who went out from its walls in 1861 to fight and die for the South.\\" University President Francis Preston Venable spoke to the 1909 UDC Convention, approving of the plan for a monument, and saying that record of the students who enlisted \\"should ever be before the eyes of the present-day students\\". The request for a monument was presented to, and approved by, the UNC board of trustees on June 1, 1908. The monument was funded by the university, alumni, and the UDC. UNC and the UDC spent until 1913 fundraising the $7,500 that Canadian sculptor John Wilson charged for the statue, which he discounted from his asking price of $10,000. The Daughters originally were slated to give $1,500 of the cost of the statue, though their success at fundraising led the university to ask for them to cover $2,500 by 1911. Most of the rest of the cost was covered by alumni donations. UNC eventually had to give $500 to reach the contracted total of $7,500. The statue was planned to be in place for the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the Civil War in 1911. Raising funds to pay for the statue delayed the project by two years. Design In a manner similar to his earlier Daniel A. Bean sculpture, John A. Wilson created a \\"silent\\" statue by not including a cartridge box on the infantryman's belt so that he cannot fire his gun. Like the earlier sculpture, Wilson used a northerner, Harold Langlois of Boston, as his model. That was part of a tradition of \\"Silent Sentinels,\\" statues created in the North, often mass-produced, depicting soldiers without ammunition or with their guns at parade rest. As with the other statues, the memorial was positioned to face north, towards the Union. A bronze plaque in bas-relief on the front of the memorial's base depicts a woman, representing the state of North Carolina, convincing a young student to fight for the Southern cause as he drops his books, representing students leaving their studies. A smaller bronze plaque on the left side of the base says: Another bronze plaque on the right reads: \\"Duty is the sublimest word in the English language\\" is a quote from a letter attributed to Confederate commander Robert E. Lee, but revealed in 1914 to have been a forgery. File:Silent Sam plaque inscription, left side (cropped).jpgLeft side File:Silent Sam pedestal, bas-relief plaque (cropped).jpgFront File:Silent Sam plaque inscription, right side (cropped).jpgRight side Dedication Unveiling of the monument on June 2, 1913 The program for the unveiling of the monument started at 3:30 pm, on June 2, 1913. Attendance was reported to be 1,000. Speeches were given by, among others, Mrs. Marshall Williams, president of the local division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy; and Francis Preston Venable, the university's president. The University Band played Dixie while \\"students formally accepted the monument\\", and the program concluded with a rendition by a quartet of \\"Tenting on the Old Camp Ground\\". The Governor of North Carolina, Locke Craig, also spoke; regarding the service of students who died in the war: The dedication speech which has attracted the most subsequent notice was given by Julian Carr, a prominent industrialist, UNC alumnus and Trustee, former Confederate soldier, and the largest single donor towards the construction of the monument. This speech has been described by UNC history professor W. Fitzhugh Brundage as one in which Carr \\"unambiguously urged his audience to devote themselves to the maintenance of white supremacy with the same vigor that their Confederate ancestors had defended slavery.\\" In it, Carr emphatically praised the student-soldiers and soldiers of the Confederate Army for their wartime valor and patriotism, adding that According to Brundage, Carr's phrase \\"the four years immediately succeeding the war\\" is a clear reference to the Reconstruction era, when the Ku Klux Klan, working to restore the dominance of traditional white hierarchy in the South, terrorized blacks and white Republicans. Later in the speech; Carr stated:  Later reactions =20th century The monument appears on an undated, early 20th-century postcard. A picture from 1918, with two soldiers in front, appeared in the 1961 yearbook Yackity Yack. The statue was called the \\"Soldiers Monument\\" in the first student newspaper reference to it in 1913, but was referred to as the \\"Confederate Monument\\" in the program for its unveiling, and this name was used from the 1920s through the 1940s. The earliest known use of the name \\"Silent Sam\\" is from 1954, in the campus newspaper The Daily Tar Heel. A story developed that \\"Sam\\" would fire his gun if a virgin walked by, but never did (he was silent) because he never saw any. In 1937 this story was called an \\"old local wisecrack\\". The monument has been a subject of controversy and a site of protest since the 1960s. In 1965, a discussion about the monument's meaning and history occurred in the letters to the editor of the UNC student newspaper, The Daily Tar Heel. In 1967, poet John Beecher \\"debated\\" Silent Sam, reading to the statue from his book of poetry To Live and Die in Dixie. Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, the monument was vandalized with orange, green, red, and yellow iridescent paint, including a hammer and sickle. In the early 1970s, the monument was the site of several demonstrations by the Black Student Movement. In 1971, the monument was defaced with paint following a basketball victory. In 1986, the statue was temporarily removed and shipped to Cincinnati, where it was cleaned and restored by bronze specialists Eleftherios and Mercene Karkadoulias. They repaired cracks, removed green oxidation, and gave the statue a protective wax coating. The refreshed statue was put back in place six months later. The cost was $8,600. Students gathered by the statue to speak out after Los Angeles police officers were found not guilty in the 1992 Rodney King trial. In 1997, a Martin Luther King Jr. Day march focusing on issues facing UNC housekeepers ended at the monument. In 2003, Gerald Horne, at that time director of the Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History, in a letter to The Daily Tar Heel, called the monument \\"an eyesore\\". In January 2011, Adam Domby (then a graduate student in history at UNC, later Assistant Professor of History at the College of Charleston), wrote a letter to The Daily Tar Heel entitled \\"Why Silent Sam was built: A historian's perspective\\". The letter highlighted Julian Carr's speech at the dedication of the statue, which Domby had uncovered in the university archives in 2009. Carr's speech became a \\"galvanizing force\\" in activists' efforts to get the statue removed. 2011‚Äì2017 Protest against Silent Sam, August 2017 Several protests in the late 2010s were directed toward the statue, along with calls for its removal. On September 1, 2011, a group calling itself the Real Silent Sam Movement held a protest \\"to attract attention to the statue's history\\". That group, also known as the Real Silent Sam Committee, \\"campaigned over the past two years [2011‚Äì2013] to replace the current plaque with one that tells what they call \\"the true history of the confederate soldier.\\" North Carolina NAACP President Reverend William Barber II spoke at a program held on the monument's centenary in 2013. In July 2015, the statue was vandalized with the words \\"Black Lives Matter\\", KKK, and \\"murderer\\", during a wave of vandalism targeting Confederate monuments. A UNC history professor, Dr. Harry Watson, said that he believed the monument represented an important part of history but that its glorification promoted a false conception of the Civil War. A second protest was held on October 12, University Day, on the steps of Wilson Library. Officials said that \\"a protective layer would be placed on the monument to ease cleaning efforts for future situations\\". In late July 2015, the North Carolina General Assembly passed SL 2015‚Äì170, the Cultural History Artifact Management and Patriotism Act of 2015, which states that \\"An object of remembrance [defined as \\"monument, memorial, or work of art\\"] located on public property may not be permanently removed\\". It does allow an object to be permanently relocated, provided that it is \\"relocated to a site of similar prominence, honor, visibility, availability, and access, ...within the boundaries of the jurisdiction from which it was relocated.\\" Approval of the North Carolina Historical Commission is required. On the night of August 17‚Äì18, 2015, the statue, along with the Chapel Hill Post Office, were defaced with the words \\"Who is Sandra Bland?\\" On September 9, 2015, the monument was blindfolded with \\"a Confederate bandanna\\". Seeing how the monument was being defaced, a \\"Pro-Confederate Rally\\" in support of Silent Sam was announced for October 25; the protestors were from Alamance County, and had no connection with the university. They were met by three times as many counterdemonstrators, \\"most of them students\\". One of the students handed out 158 copies of W.E.B. DuBois' seminal 1903 book The Souls of Black Folk ‚Äî 158 being, according to the student, the number of years between the foundation of the university and its admitting black students. On October 12, 2015, University Day, a group of about two dozen students, calling itself The Real Silent Sam Coalition, interrupted a speech by Chancellor Folt, shouting \\"Tear it down, tear it down, or we'll shout you down\\". They received applause from some faculty present. On January 12, 2016, UNC police arrested a man for \\"spray-painting a message on Silent Sam\\". 2017‚Äì2018 school year Already in August 2017, it was reported that Silent Sam \\"has been vandalized multiple times in recent years\\". \\"Silent Sam has been a target for protest and vandalism for decades.\\" \\"The push to get UNC to remove the statue...took off in earnest in August 2017\\", after the proposed removal of Confederate statues in Charlottesville, Virginia led to the Unite the Right rally on August 11‚Äì12, and on August 14, the toppling of the Confederate Soldiers Memorial in nearby Durham. Beginning in August there was \\"a year of sit-ins, rallies and protests involving students, faculty and community members\\". On August 15, 2017, a video taken by a passer-by shows a man beating the statue with a hammer. On August 17, 2017, Chapel Hill mayor Pam Hemminger sent a letter to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, requesting that it petition the North Carolina Historical Commission to immediately remove Silent Sam from campus \\"in the interest of public safety.\\" \\"The possibility of a breach of the peace is high, and with it the likelihood that Silent Sam could suffer substantial damage.\\" On August 20, 2017, protestors singing \\"We Shall Overcome\\" draped Silent Sam in black, as had just been proposed for the Charlottesville statues of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, whose removal, at least for the moment, had recently been blocked (see Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials#Virginia). On August 21 Chancellor Folt issued a message urging students not to attend the rally scheduled for the next day, \\"considering the potential for a highly charged atmosphere and the very real possibility for confrontation with outside groups.\\" The rally was \\"being organized by groups not associated with the university... If we had the ability to immediately move the statue we would.\\" The same day, UNC chancellor Carol Folt, UNC president Margaret Spellings, UNC board-of-governors chairman Lou Bissette, and UNC trustee chairman Haywood Cochrane wrote to Governor Roy Cooper, warning of \\"significant safety and security threats\\" concerning Silent Sam: \\"it is only a matter of time before an attempt is made to pull down Silent Sam in much the same manner we saw in Durham ... An attempt may occur at any time.\\" They also asked the Governor to convene the North Carolina Historical Commission to take up the question of what to do with the statue,\\" although \\"the panel has little leeway to remove the statue permanently.\\" The danger was not just the physical risks of taking such a heavy object off a pedestal, it was the probable confrontations between pro- and anti-Confederate demonstrators from outside the University. Folt stated that if UNC could remove the statue it would, but was prohibited by the 2015 law cited above. Cooper responded to Spellings, saying UNC could remove the statue if there was \\"a real risk to public safety,\\" but did not himself say that the risk existed. Folt replied that despite the governor's advice, the university did not think it could say it was a \\"risk to public safety\\" in the sense intended by the 2015 law, which refers to \\"a building inspector or similar official\\" making that determination, \\"where the statue itself poses a physical hazard.\\" As put on a separate occasion, \\"UNC ... doesn't agree that it's received the green light by anyone with authority to relocate the statue.\\" Removal will require legislative action. Folt received considerable criticism from UNC-CH students and faculty for not taking a stronger position on the removal of Silent Sam. The UNC Board of Governors also criticized Folt for her request of the Governor, saying that the request \\"was a 'wholly unacceptable' unilateral decision by Spellings and Bissette\\". They said the letter to the governor should have been reviewed and approved by the entire board, instead of only the board's committee chairs. They said they would not have given their approval to send the letter to Cooper. ... \\"The letter exuded a weakness and hand wringing that does not accurately reflect the Board's opinion about how the potential of campus unrest should be treated\\", said the letter, which was dated August 22. According to UNC-CH officials, \\"any petition to the North Carolina Historical Commission requesting the removal of the statue would have to come from the UNC System Board of Governors. That body has shown no public interest in doing so at this point.\\" The UNC Board of Trustees then released a statement supporting Folt, saying: \\"Above all, regardless of the circumstance, the chancellor has a responsibility to the people of North Carolina to uphold all state laws. With this new law, it is relatively easy for many individuals to speculate about its meaning or offer possible loopholes as ways to operate around the law. It would be unwise and imprudent for the University to take any action regarding the monument without additional legal clarity, and we would expect no less from our chancellor.\\" On August 22, 2017, at the beginning of the school year, a \\"Rally for Removal of Silent Sam\\", announced on a poster describing the day as \\"the first day of Silent Sam's last semester\\", attracted about 800 people. Thousands signed a change.org petition to remove it. Chanting \\"Hey, hey. Ho, ho. This racist statue has got to go\\" and \\"Tear it down\\", protestors marched to the official residence of University President Margaret Spellings, briefly blocking traffic on Franklin Street, Chapel Hill's main street, which adjoins the oldest part of the campus, where Silent Sam was located. The statue was surrounded by police in riot gear. Former UNC-CH Chancellor James Moeser, interviewed at the rally, said: \\"I used to be of the mind that we should contextualize history...but Charlottesville changed my mind.\\" \\"Once statues like this become weaponized by the white supremacist[s] and the Nazis, keeping it up is untenable, I think it has to go. And I think it will go.\\" On September 6, 2017, demonstrators chanted and made noise with drums, pots and pans, birthday party horns, and \\"anything they could get their hands on\\" in front of South Building, where Chancellor Folt's office is. Their stated intent was \\"disrupt[ing] business as usual\\", and they unusuccessfully asked Chancellor Folt to listen to their reasons why they felt Silent Sam should be removed. On September 21, the day before the North Carolina Historical Commission was to meet, UNC-CH issued a press release. It stated that the University was not making any proposal on Silent Sam to the Commission at that time. Given that the North Carolina Historical Commission had not yet made any ruling related to the 2015 law, and that Governor Cooper, through the North Carolina Department of Administration, had filed a petition to relocate three monuments located on the State Capitol grounds, \\"We are carefully following these proceedings, which we hope will shed light on what standards the commission will be using to evaluate such matters.\\" (The decision, which arrived two days after Silent Sam was toppled, was negative, as the North Carolina Historical Commission found that the law did not allow them to approve the request.) On October 26, 35 professors from the School of Law posted a statement saying: \\"To many in our community, the armed soldier expresses the idea that some in our community are not equal. This disparaging and marginalizing symbol has no place at the core of an inclusive learning environment.... We also believe that the message it sends undercuts the University's mission \\"to teach a diverse community of undergraduate, graduate, and professional students to become the next generation of leaders. Maintaining this monument undercuts the value of equality protected by North Carolina law and the United States Constitution. We note that federal law obliges the University to provide an inclusive learning environment free of racial hostility.... If the University remains uncertain of its legal ability to act, we ask it to seek a declaration in court to affirm UNC's right to remove the statue. This path would spare our students and faculty from the distraction, expense and pain of suing their home institution.\\" They related the Silent Sam situation with another controversial issue, \\"the Board of Governors' recent ban on representation or counsel by the Center for Civil Rights.\\" In November, 2017, Maya Little, graduate student in history and leader of Silent Sam protests during 2017‚Äì2018, posted documentation of the University's Police Department having used an undercover officer to gather information on the protestors, which the university confirmed. This discovery led to another rally outside South Building on November 14. A November 1 statement (posted November 9) from the Department of Communication stated \\"We understand 'Silent Sam' to be a symbol of the history and legacies of racial slavery, anti-black racism, and white supremacy that persist in the state of North Carolina, the university, and our country.... [W]e have a moral obligation to remove this symbol of violent oppression from our midst, and continue the work of dismantling systemic racism.\\" The UNC Department of Geography, in a letter reported on November 9, stated that Silent Sam \\"contradicts values of diversity, social justice and anti-violence that our discipline embraces.... The continued presence of the monument is damaging to all of us who share this campus, but disproportionately jeopardizes the wellbeing of students with marginalized identities.\\" On November 27, the UNC School of Education posted a statement on its website, saying that the statue is and \\"was erected as a symbol of hatred, bigotry, and white supremacy\\". ... As educators, we have an obligation to continue the work of dismantling systemic racism.\\" \\"Faculty, staff, students and graduates from the UNC School of Social Work\\", in a letter reported on December 15, added their support, saying \\"Whatever else the memorial may symbolize to some, it was erected to glorify White people in the South, and, by extension, to carry on the subjugation of Black people. Its presence continues to legitimize and incite violence, dehumanization, and oppression. Such racist symbolism is antithetical to the ethos of this vibrant, public university.\\" In late February, 2018, an email was sent anonymously to Chancellor Folt, stating it was from 17 \\"senior faculty\\", \\"all Full Professors and Endowed Chaired [sic] Professors\\", who vowed \\"to move the statue themselves if the Chancellor has not done so by March 1st at midnight\\", saying they did not fear arrest. They claimed to be from the College of Arts and Sciences, the Medical School, the School of Public Health, and the School of Law, and quoted Edmund Burke: \\"the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing\\". They said they would release the email to The Daily Tar Heel, the campus newspaper, if she did not reply first. On February 25 a University spokesperson confirmed the letter had been received. On the same day the email, accompanied by a press release, was sent to The Daily Tar Heel, which published them. The paper said it had met with a representative from the group, \\"who is a senior faculty member at UNC\\". In a statement on February 27, \\"the group said they received word...that Folt is preparing to ask Gov. Roy Cooper to petition the North Carolina Historical Commission for an urgent ruling to relocate Silent Sam\\", and \\"as a sign of good faith, understanding that the Chancellor is now seeking the quick removal of Silent Sam, we shall stand down for the present\\". Asked if Folt reached out or was planning to reach out to Cooper in response to the letter, Joanne Peters Denny, a UNC spokesperson, said these conversations were not happening: \\"We don't make our policy decisions based on threats from unauthenticated, anonymous groups\\". On April 30, 2018, Maya Little defaced the statue, which she called \\"a symbol of UNC's commitment to white supremacy\\", with a mixture of red ink (some sources say paint) and her own blood. She described her action as \\"provid[ing] context\\": \\"This statue, Silent Sam, was built on white supremacy. It was built by white supremacists.... These statues symbolize the violence toward Black people. Without that blood on the statue, it's incomplete, in my opinion. It's not properly contextualized.\\" The act was publicized in advance and news media and the UNC Police were present. She was arrested and charged with defacing a public statue, with a court date of August 20. She was also charged with a UNC Honor Code violation. The statue cleaning began within minutes, although at her trial, \\"a campus maintenance supervisor testified it took several days to remove red stains at a cost of about $4,000 in supplies and labor\\". Faculty in the History Department issued a statement supporting her. At her trial on October 15, she admitted her guilt, but the judge withheld the verdict (\\"continued judgment\\"), so she received no sentence, and court fees and restitution were waived. A petition Little posted on change.org asking for the Honor Court charges to be dropped received 6,600 signatures. In July, 2018, Silent Sam, covered by a red X and the words \\"North Carolina needs a monumental change\\", was depicted in Raleigh on two identical billboards, on Blount Street near Hoke Street and on North Raleigh Boulevard near the intersection with Yonkers Road. They were paid for by the Make It Right Project, a project of the Independent Media Institute, which is working to have Silent Sam and nine other Confederate monuments removed. The stated audience the billboards were intended to reach ‚Äî thus the Raleigh locations ‚Äî were the members of the North Carolina Historical Commission. At about the same time, the Project printed posters with a picture of Silent Sam, an X over him, and the words \\"We need REAL heroes\\", and students put them up on the campus. In a press release dated August 15, the North Carolina Historical Commission stated that it \\"has received requests from private individuals to relocate the 'Silent Sam' monument at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but has not received a petition from the university, the UNC system, or its governing body, the Board of Governors.\\" UNC had begun developing alternate signs and an interactive tour meant to place Silent Sam in context and tell the \\"true\\" history of UNC. From July 1, 2017 ‚Äì June 30, 2018, UNC spent $390,000 on security for the monument. Of that, $3,000 was for cleaning the monument. The $387,000 remainder was spent on law enforcement personnel costs. Silent Sam was under 24-hour video surveillance via a monitor in the campus Police Department. Toppling, 2018 On the night of August 20, 2018, the day before the 2018‚Äì19 academic year began, another \\"Remove Silent Sam\\" rally was held, beginning with speakers at 7 P.M. The protest had been billed as a rally in support of graduate student Maya Little, whose original court appearance for defacing the monument was scheduled for that day. Protestors marched down and briefly blocked Franklin Street, Chapel Hill's main downtown street. In contrast with the 2017 rally, police stayed in the background, and video of the protest was reported as showing police moving away from the monument shortly before protesters pulled it down.\\" In a speech at the protest, Little said, : \\"It's time to tear down Silent Sam. It's time to tear down UNC's institutional white supremacy\\". Large signs with such inscriptions as \\"The whole world is watching\\", \\"Which side are you on?\\", \\"For a world without white supremacy\\", and a list of victims of racial violence (beginning with \\"Unnamed Black woman beaten by Julian Carr\\") were held around the monument, blocking it from view while heavy ropes were tied to it. A later report referred to \\"torches\\" as well. WUNC Managing Editor Dave DeWitt, who was present, called it \\"a well-planned and executed effort\\". At 9:20 p.m., Silent Sam was felled; the crowd cheered. \\"People [were] screaming and jumping in disbelief.\\" A newscaster on the scene described the mood as \\"jubilation\\". Holding signs and chanting \\"stand up, fight back\\" and \\"This is what democracy looks like\\", some protesters stamped on the statue or tried to cover it with dirt. Police, who cordoned off the area around the pedestal, arrested one person who concealed his or her face in the public protest (prohibited in North Carolina). Some police are reported to have been smiling. Crowds remained around the base, and the Associated Press reported that students were drawn to see it as the news of the toppling spread. Later that night, campus staff loaded the statue, which did not seem to be seriously damaged, onto a flat-bed dump truck and removed it from the site.  Aftermath  On August 25 and 30 and on September 8, follow-up demonstrations were held at the site by supporters and critics of the toppling of the statue. The August 30 demonstration was convened as a \\"Silent Sam Twilight Service\\" by Alamance County Take Back Alamance County, a group designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. (See Flaggers.) Chancellor Folt asked people not to come to these events for safety reasons. Some of these protests led to arrests for assault, resisting arrest, and inciting a public disturbance. Supporters of Silent Sam were greatly outnumbered by counter-protesters. = University response = The morning after the toppling, UNC issued a statement on Twitter which read: : \\"Last night's actions were unlawful and dangerous, and we are very fortunate that no one was injured. The police are investigating the vandalism and assessing the full extent of the damage\\". A later statement from Chancellor Folt, UNC President Margaret Spellings, and other university leaders said, \\"Last night's rally was unlike any previous event on our campus. This protest was carried out in a highly organized manner and included a number of people unaffiliated with the University. While we respect that protesters have the right to demonstrate, they do not have the right to damage state property.\\" The State Bureau of Investigation agreed to help UNC police with their investigation into the toppling. The chair of the UNC board of governors, Harry Smith, said on August 22, 2018, that the board would engage an outside firm to investigate the actions of the university and police at the protest, adding that Chancellor Folt had not herself ordered police to take a hands-off approach. On University Day, October 12, 2018, Chancellor Folt issued an apology for the university's connections to slavery, saying: \\"I reaffirm our university's commitment to facing squarely and working to right the wrongs of history so they are never again inflicted\\". = Legality = As of September 7, 2018, only one person had been charged with participating in the actual toppling of the Silent Sam statue. At least 25 other people had been arrested on charges of misdemeanor riot, misdemeanor defacing of a public monument, causing damage to property, causing a public disturbance, defacing a public building, concealing one's face, resisting arrest, simple assault, and affray (fighting). At a hearing on September 20, one person's charge was dropped, and that of another person was to be dropped following completion of community service. =Scrutiny of UNC Police= During 2017‚Äì2018, the UNC Police Department used an undercover police officer to gain information on the activities of campaigners against Silent Sam. This was discovered on November 2, 2017 when students saw the former \\"auto mechanic\\" in police uniform. The Police Department has confirmed this and defended what they did as \\"intelligence gathering\\". The use of an undercover officer was bitterly resented by some Silent Sam protestors, and was brought up repeatedly during later protests. The actions or inaction on August 20, 2018, of the UNC Campus Police and the Chapel Hill Police Department, which differed from their actions at the 2017 protest, have been the subject of many comments. As mentioned above, they will be examined by outside investigators. One Chapel Hill officer was put on administrative leave with pay after his tattoo closely resembling that of a far-right group was seen during the Aug. 20 protest. Eight persons, all of whom had been arrested, signed a document alleging police misconduct at the September 8 protest. A Community Policing Advisory Committee meets monthly to receive feedback concerning the Campus Police. At the August meeting there were 2 attendees, \\"who wanted to speak about Silent Sam\\". The September 11 meeting had over 75 participants and was moved to the Chapel Hill Public Library. Campus Police Chief Chris Blue was asked to leave slightly after the meeting began, and he did so. More than 20 people spoke, all of them critical of various police actions: \\"The people who are there being violent are the police themselves,\\" said an attorney who attended. Several speakers alleged that the police were more lenient with demonstrators from outside the university than they were with student participants. At an earlier September 5 meeting on the campus, \\"residents\\" asked the town to reconsider its relationship with the Greensboro Police Department, whose Special Operations Division was called in to assist with crowd control during the August 30 protest. On September 20, 2018, about 75 demonstrators in front of South Building protested \\"police brutality\\" and what they called \\"targeting, harassing, and spying on anti-racist protesters.\\"  Reactions Critics of the toppling= The pedestal remained in McCorkle Place without the Silent Sam statue until January 14, 2019. * Newspapers ** Editorial in the Wilson Times: \\"When demonstrators pulled Silent Sam from his perch Monday night, the University of North Carolina joined an ignoble list of colleges where peaceful protest gives way to lawlessness and mob rule.\\" \\"North Carolina...has become a focal point in the debate over what should be done with markers honoring the Confederacy.\\" * Legislators ** State Representative Bob Steinburg: \\"It is absolutely inexcusable and those responsible, including security who stood by and let it happen, need to be prosecuted, no excuses!! ... Whoever was on that security detail that allowed this to take place and are seen in this video and can be identified ... need to lose their jobs.\\" ** State Representative Larry Pittman: \\"Chaos will be the result if nothing is done.... If we don‚Äôt stand up and put a stop to this mob rule, it could lead to an actual civil war\\". ** Senate leader Phil Berger: \\"Many of the wounds of racial injustice that still exist in our state and country were created by violent mobs and I can say with certainty that violent mobs won't heal those wounds. Only a civil society that adheres to the rule of law can heal these wounds and politicians ‚Äì from the Governor down to the local District Attorney ‚Äì must start that process by ending the deceitful mischaracterization of violent riots as 'rallies' and reestablishing the rule of law in each of our state's cities and counties.\\" ** House Speaker Tim Moore: \\"There is no place for the destruction of property on our college campuses or in any North Carolina community; the perpetrators should be arrested and prosecuted by public safety officials to make clear that mob rule and acts of violence will not be tolerated in our state.\\" * UNC Board of Governors and President ** Former State Senator Thom Goolsby, a member of the Board of Governors: \\"NC State law is CLEAR. Silent Sam MUST be reinstalled.\\" He was the only member of the Board of Governors to vote against giving the University until November 15 to develop a plan, \\"saying the situation should be resolved quickly\\". ** A joint statement from UNC Board of Governors Chairman Harry Smith and UNC President Margaret Spellings: \\"The actions last evening were unacceptable, dangerous, and incomprehensible. We are a nation of laws ‚Äî and mob rule and the intentional destruction of public property will not be tolerated.\\" * Governor and former Governor ** Governor Roy Cooper: \\"The actions that toppled Silent Sam bear witness to the strong feelings many North Carolinians have about Confederate monuments. I don't agree with or condone the way that monument came down, but protesters concluded that their leaders would not ‚Äî could not ‚Äî act on the frustration and pain it caused.\\" His office issued a similar statement. Cooper has publicly stated his support for removal of Confederate monuments. The announcement that the North Carolina Historical Commission found that the 2015 law prohibited removing three Confederate monuments at the state capitol, which removal Cooper had sought, by coincidence came two days after Silent Sam was toppled. Cooper subsequently called for repeal of the 2015 law. ** Former Governor Pat McCrory, in an August 21 interview, labeled the toppling as mob rule and questioned whether people will begin to call for the destruction of the Washington Monument or Jefferson Memorial, since George Washington and Thomas Jefferson owned slaves. \\"Do you think these left-wing anarchists are going to end with Silent Sam?\\" McCrory said. At another stage in the interview, he compared the actions of the protesters to that of the Nazis who tore down statues and burned books. * Polling: Harper Polling surveyed 500 North Carolina \\"likely voters\\" between September 4 and September 7, 2018. 70% disapproved of the toppling, 22% approved, and 9% were unsure or declined to answer. 39% said they favor removing Confederate monuments legally, and 50% were opposed. Results broke along age and party lines. In a separate poll of \\"sixty North Carolina leaders in education, politics, business and advocacy\\" by the News & Observer, 30 of the 45 respondents said Confederate monuments should be removed. The News & Observer later said that \\"public opinion on the monument was about as polarized as any political issue these days.\\" * Alumni and the general public: According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, it and other publications have received \\"a deluge\\" of emails \\"demand[ing] that the statue be re-erected\\". * On November 11, 2018, Veterans Day, a plane towing a Confederate flag and the banner \\"Restore Silent Sam Now\\" flew over Chapel Hill. \\"Kevin Stone, North Carolina Division Commander of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, took credit on Facebook for the flight.\\" =Supporters of the toppling= * Newspapers ** The Editorial Board of the Charlotte Observer, North Carolina's largest newspaper, saw the toppling of the statue as an act of civil disobedience, \\"a tradition that goes back at least to Henry David Thoreau, who famously argued that it is the citizen's duty not to acquiesce and allow the government to perpetrate injustice.\\" The toppling of the statue is compared to Rosa Parks, who broke the law by refusing to give up her bus seat, the Greensboro four, and the Boston Tea Party. The Observer said the action was not \\"mob rule\\": \\"Mob rule was what happened at Little Rock Central High School in 1957 when nine black students, even armed with a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, were turned back by an angry and violent white mob.\\" ** Editorial Board of the Winston- Salem Journal: \\"Silent Sam had to go.... Their cause was just, if not their methods. And it is easy to understand their mounting frustration and anger.... Blame 'mob rule' if you will. But it was poor leadership in Chapel Hill and Raleigh that ultimately led to Monday night.\\" ** Editorial Board of the Fayetteville Observer: \\"The most surprising thing about the toppling of \\"Silent Sam\\" on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus Tuesday night was that it took so long to happen. ... And as cities and states across the South have seen frequent protests and have wrestled with decisions about the nature, meaning and location of their many monuments to the Civil War and the soldiers who fought in it, North Carolina's official position has been to do nothing. ... It's clear that Silent Sam was meant to be a reminder to blacks of the doctrine of white supremacy that was prevalent then and is still too much with us today.\\" Myron Pitts, staff writer at the Fayetteville Observer, said in the newspaper \\"It was past time to remove UNC's Silent Sam. State and university officials' lack of leadership led to last week‚Äôs events.\\" ** Editorial in the Daily Tar Heel, UNC-CH's student newspaper: \\"[I]t's heartening to hear that leaders in UNC and Orange County do not want Silent Sam replaced or reinstated, but at the end of the day, their lack of action in the moments that matter make them complicit in white supremacy. Finding [Maya] Little guilty and spending $400,000 a year to keep a Confederate statue up relay the same message: The leaders in our community refuse to completely denounce white supremacy and its symbols.... When leaders refuse to completely denounce obvious symbols of white supremacy, no progress will be made toward systematic injustices that are woven into the culture of this University. The Editorial Board hopes community leaders will take substantive action in the future regarding Silent Sam and other Confederate symbols.\\" ** Editorial in Technician, NC State student newspaper, reprinted in the Daily Tar Heel: \\"[W]e fully support the actions of the protesters. The practice of vandalism is something that in normal circumstances, Technician does not condone. However, as all legal recourse had been pursued, and UNC students' authority to shape their own campus environment had been undermined by the state and the university, we support the risk taken by these individuals, in full knowledge of the legal repercussions they may face.\\" ** Editorial Board of The Daily Reflector (Greenville, N.C.): \\"Frustrated at being given no alternatives, protesters took matters into their own hands.... Those responsible have to be charged and prosecuted.... But our history demonstrates the inevitability of the public's embrace of freedom and individual rights ‚Äî and the progressive disappearance of institutions and symbols that stand in the way.\\" ** Editorial Board of the Washington Post: \\"It's not a surprise that citizens would take matters into their own hands when arbitrary curbs had been placed on local democracy.\\" *UNC students ** The UNC undergraduate student government executive branch posted a letter to all students, saying \\"the African-American activists had 'courage and resilience' and had 'corrected a moral and historical wrong that needed to be righted if we were ever to move forward as a university.'\\" * UNC faculty ** Groups *** 42 UNC faculty members signed a letter published in The News & Observer on August 23 claiming UNC administration \\"dodged\\" the Silent Sam issue, leading to \\"not the most desirable\\" situation but one that had to come nonetheless. \\"The time is now for the university administration to show leadership, not bureaucratic obfuscation,\\" the letter reads. \\"Show us that you and the university do indeed stand for Lux et Libertas, not sustaining and enforcing the symbols of human cruelty.\\" The letter quoted John F. Kennedy: \\"Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.\\" *** 29 faculty members in the Department of History (August 23): \\"Civil disobedience, particularly among students, has a long and storied history in the United States, especially in the American South. The hyperbolic characterization of Silent Sam's toppling as 'lawlessness' and 'mob action' by Chancellor Folt and UNC System leaders demonstrates a purposeful, obdurate disregard for historical and social context.\\" *** The University of North Carolina's Center for the Study of the American South (August 23): \\"UNC's leadership refuses to recognize that their own inaction put our community in danger. We acknowledge the constraints they face but we urge them to stand on the right side of history and join us in rejecting simplistic interpretations of last night's actions as vandalism. Silent Sam was violence. Protestors who removed it sought to reorient our future toward non-violence.\\" *** The University of North Carolina's Center for Civil Rights (September 7): \\"Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights demonstrators of the 1950s and 1960s knew that there were just laws and unjust laws, and they were prepared to pay the price of violating unjust laws. As those who train new generations of students in law, we at the UNC Center for Civil Rights cannot advocate lawlessness, but we can teach about the traditions of resistance to unjust laws. We did not urge protesters to take the actions that brought down Silent Sam, but we do believe that the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the State of North Carolina will be better for having Silent Sam removed from its place of honor on the campus. Silent Sam was never silent.\\" ** Individuals *** Joseph T. Glatthaar, Stephenson Distinguished Professor of American Civil War Studies, University of North Carolina: \\"I understand that many people want to honor the sacrifices and efforts of their ancestors, but Silent Sam represented the worst aspects and deeds of those ancestors.... The University and the state should offer magnanimous terms to those students and allow them to return to school unpunished.\\" *** Barbara Rimer, Dean of the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in a public letter, \\"suggested a monument to a person who promoted peace, equity or prevention, instead of a return to Silent Sam.\\" \\"An ever-potent symbol of a past we said we aimed to transcend, the statue sent a powerful, contradictory message. In its silence, it spoke loudly. It's no wonder that, as other states sought to move beyond the past by removing statues, our inability to do so caused wounds to fester until the pain became unbearable. It is not surprising that it happened Monday night. It is only surprising that it did not happen sooner.\\" *** Former UNC-CH Chancellor James Moeser: \\"I will confess to you that one of my failings as chancellor was not removing that monument when I had had a chance to do it. [When activists toppled the statue] I gave a private cheer when our students had the courage to do what I didn‚Äôt have the courage to do.\\" However 92% of the 14 suspects arrested were not UNC students. * Scholars (see also Glatthaar, above) ** In an op-ed in the New York Times, scholars of slavery Ethan J. Kytle and Blain Roberts, authors of Denmark Vesey's Garden. Slavery and Memory in the Cradle of the Confederacy (2018), professors of history at California State University, Fresno, with Ph.D.s in history from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill: \\"We once believed that Confederate statues should be left up but also placed in historical context.... Over time, however, we lost our enthusiasm for this approach.... The white supremacist intent of these monuments, in other words, is not a relic of the past.... The prominence of the memorials shows how white Southerners etched racism into the earth with impunity.\\" Their recommendation: leaving the \\"empty pedestal ‚Äî shorn all original images and inscriptions ‚Äî eliminates the offending tribute while still preserving a record of what these communities did and where they did it.... The most effective way to commemorate the rise and fall of white supremacist monument-building is to preserve unoccupied pedestals as the ruins that they are ‚Äî broken tributes to a morally bankrupt cause.\\" ** Karen Cox, professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and the author of Dixie‚Äôs Daughters: The United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Preservation of Confederate Culture (2003): \\"People seem to be at their wit's end. When people feel they're not being heard, when people don't have a place at the table, then this is the result.\\" ** Adam Domby, historian of the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the American South, with a Ph.D. in history from UNC at Chapel Hill: \\"I think ultimately what really did this (toppling) is the Heritage laws were really undemocratic.... They're taking away any recourse for communities who want to remove a monument.\\" It was Domby who unearthed the Carr speech (see above). However, there is a procedure to petition the historical society for removal of monuments. * Legislators ** In a joint statement, State Senator Valerie Foushee, Representative Verla Insko, and Representative Graig R. Meyer said the removal of UNC's Confederate statue was long overdue. \\"It was past time for Silent Sam to be moved from a place of honor on the campus of the University of the People. It is unfortunate that state legislators chose not to hear and pass the bill we filed earlier this year to move the monument to an indoor site where it would stand as a reminder of the bitter racial struggle that continues to burden our country. ** U.S. Representative David Price: \\"It should not have taken an act of civil disobedience to remove this monument to hate. We should not condone actions that threaten public health or safety but neither should politicians in Raleigh prevent local communities from taking action through peaceful means.\\" * Religious leaders ** Olin T. Binkley Memorial Baptist Church: \\"Racism is still not eradicated in this day. We, members of a Chapel Hill faith community, seek to follow a man named Jesus who, at every turn, identified with the outcasts and spoke truth to power. He did not wait until a convenient time to speak or act. We believe it was time to act in ridding the UNC campus of a very public Silent Sam.... We support placing a placard in place of the statue, reminding us of what once stood there and what it stood for.\\" * Museum director ** Former Orange County Historical Museum director Candace Midgett: \\"James Grossman, the executive director of the American Historical Association, has said that these statues were meant to create 'legitimate garb for white supremacy,' and queries why we would put up a statue of Robert E. Lee or Stonewall Jackson‚Äîor, I would add, Silent Sam‚Äîin times of real suppression of civil rights of people of color in places like Raleigh, in places like Chapel Hill. There's only one meaning to be extracted from that, and that is that these monuments are about touting white supremacy and intimidating people of color. That is why they were made, and that's what they continue to reflect where they stand. I believe the board of the university and the administration have this one chance to be on the right side of history, and I'm hoping they find a way to take it.\\" =Anniversary= * On August 20, 2019, the anniversary of the toppling, a \\"Silent Sam is Down: Anniversary Party!\\" was held at the new Peace and Justice Plaza on Franklin Street. = Documentary = A student documentary about the statue, \\"Silence Sam\\", was shown on November 30, 2018, at Duke University, under the sponsorship of Duke's Center for Documentary Studies.  Viewpoints on future disposition  From August 2018, Silent Sam was being kept in an undisclosed location because of safety concerns. In September 2019, a student reporter found what appeared to be the statue and pedestal under tarpaulins in a storage yard on the UNC campus. The university declined to confirm or deny the report. The University of North Carolina system president, Margaret Spellings, summarised the situation: \\"The people who are paying the bills in the state of North Carolina, who underwrite in very significant ways the cost of operating that and every other institution in this system, by all polling and all accounts seem to support the restoration of the statue. Conversely, the community of Chapel Hill seems to feel very strongly that it should not be restored to its original place.\\"  Legal requirement to put it back on the pedestal, in the same spot  Thom Goolsby, Board of Governors member and former state senator, has said that the law is \\"perfectly clear\\": \\"Silent Sam needs to go back up on that same spot. Anything short of that is giving into mob rule and anarchy, and I won't agree with it.\\"  Proposals for reinstallation elsewhere on the campus  Former Chancellor James Moeser said it was \\"inconceivable\\" that the statue go back on the pedestal, and proposed the creation of a civil rights museum on campus, perhaps in the Playmakers Theatre building, as a place where the statue could be displayed. On August 31, Chancellor Folt issued a statement saying that Silent Sam's original location was \\"a cause for division and a threat to public safety,\\" and that, with the approval of the university system's Board of Governors, she was seeking input on a \\"safe, legal and alternative\\" location for the statue elsewhere on campus. On November 9, a further statement from Chancellor Folt said that a decision had not yet been made, and the Board of Governors had granted a \\"short extension\\" to this deadline. On September 4, 2018, a letter from 450 UNC faculty members, supporting Folt's preference for relocating the statue, was sent to the Board of Governors, Board of Trustees, and key administrators. \\"The civic, economic, emotional, and cultural well-being of our community, as well as the university's educational mission, will suffer continued damage by the presence of the monument on McCorkle Place.\\" On the same day, 8 alumni co-chairs of a fundraising committee, most former members of the Trustees or the Board of Visitors, sent a letter to the Board of Trustees: This is an \\"increasingly dangerous situation impacting our students and faculty and threatening to tarnish the reputation of our nation‚Äôs first public university, as well as the State of North Carolina.... Now that Silent Sam is down, we are united in agreeing that it should not return to its former location.\\" The Chapel Hill-Carrboro Chamber of Commerce and the Chapel Hill Downtown Partnership also called for the permanent relocation of Silent Sam, saying the continued protests around the monument are hurting business and threatening the safety of the town.  Opposition to reinstallation in its previous location  The Administrative Board of the Library stated publicly that it did not want the statue in any university library, and recommended that it go to a location such as Raleigh's North Carolina Museum of History. On August 28, 41 department chairs in the College of Arts and Sciences sent a letter to Chancellor Folt opposing the return of Silent Sam to its pedestal or any prominent location on campus. At the end of August, 37 Chapel Hill faith leaders wrote an open letter saying that \\"returning Silent Sam to its previous location furthers the goal of those who originally put it there: venerating white supremacy, and denigrating people of color.\\" Mayor of Chapel Hill Pam Hemminger had written the university on August 17, 2017, requesting that Silent Sam be moved (see above). On September 21, 2018, Mayor Hemminger and the entire town council wrote Folt and other UNC leaders: : The Mayor also mentioned the threat to public safety, the negative impact on downtown Chapel Hill, and the \\"unsustainable strain\\" on finances and other resources that the statue represented. The North Carolina Attorney General, Josh Stein, also made a statement supporting the removal or relocation of \\"statues that...promote white supremacy\\".  Proposals for removal from the campus altogether  A September 7, 2018, statement in the Washington Post from 59 black UNC-CH faculty members asked that the university \\"permanently remove the Confederate statue and its pedestal from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.... A symbol of racism, violence, and white supremacy has no place on our 21st century campus often called the 'University of the People'.\\" 417 other UNC-CH faculty signed a letter of support. On October 12, the Faculty Council, UNC's main faculty body, passed a resolution requesting the permanent removal of the statue and its base. \\"Returning the statue to the UNC-Chapel Hill campus would reaffirm the values of white supremacy that motivated its original installation,\\" the resolution said. \\"Moreover, to do so would undermine the physical security of all members of our community.\\" Settlement and transfer to Sons of Confederate Veterans In November 2019 the University of North Carolina Board of Governors announced that ownership of the statue was being transferred to the North Carolina Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV), on the condition that it not be displayed in any county in which the University has a campus. The university also agreed to fund an independent charitable trust ‚Äî with $2.5 million in money not from the state ‚Äî to be used for care and preservation of the statue. This settlement offer came on November 27, 2019, two minutes after the Sons of Confederate Veterans sued the UNC system and its Board of Governors. The settlement was ordered five minutes after the response was filed. A letter distributed to the SCV members, briefing them on the settlement, was published via Dropbox by attorney T. Greg Doucette.https://indyweek.com/news/orange/unc-board-of- governors-silent-sam-sons-of-confederate-veterans/#.XeRMoLqrjOQ.twitter It was removed by Dropbox due to a complaint of violation of the DMCA,https://boingboing.net/2019/12/02/scv-dmca.html but subsequently republished by news sources.https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2019/12/sam- settlement-secrets The agreement was criticised by university staff, alumni and students, who accused the university of a back-room deal with white supremacists. There had been no public meeting to discuss the settlement, or any public announcement of the lawsuit or potential deal until it was settled. On February 12, 2020, after the statue and money had been handed over to the SCV, Orange County Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour, who had originally approved the settlement, overturned it, noting that the deal had been agreed before the lawsuit existed, and ruling that the Sons of Confederate Veterans \\"lacked standing\\" for the suit. The university subsequently sought help from the judge to recover the statue and money from the SCV. Baddour ruled April 8 that $2.42 million from the trust fund go back to the UNC system in 10 days. The trust would then be dissolved. Baddour also extended the date for the statue's return to May 5 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Political repercussions According to the Carolina Journal in September 2018, the controversy surrounding Silent Sam was becoming a political issue that could affect the 2018 elections in the state, \\"a development that, in most cases, would hurt Democrats\\". In a September poll, 76% of swing voters and 93% of Republicans disapproved of the toppling; as did 44% of Democrats, versus 41% who approved. Also according to the Carolina Journal, the Silent Sam affair has national implications: \\"As public universities bend under the force of rampant ‚Äî sometimes violent ‚Äî political unrest, all eyes turn to UNC-Chapel Hill, where the toppling of a Confederate statue recharges a national conversation about public safety and the future of free speech... The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is poised to set a national example of allowing lawful protest while protecting free speech. But campus administrators and law enforcers so far have come up short, some experts say.\\" Archival material In response to an August 21 request from WRAL-TV, on September 12 the UNC-CH administration released 800 pages of emails and texts relevant to the toppling. Archival material on Julian Carr is in Special Collections, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Library. Much has been digitized and is available online.

The land upon which the campus is situated accommodates several buildings, dating from the early 1900s, designated as provincial heritage buildings, including a wooden water tower. As the buildings have heritage status, this legally forbids any alteration of their exterior, with the exception of repair, a prohibition which does not extend to their interior. Thus these buildings have been transformed into new classrooms, a bookstore, common areas and cafeteria. The water tower has been braced to protect it from collapse, and repainted in its original colour, Canadian Pacific Railway red, the only colour legally allowed due to its heritage status. In September 2016, the new Heritage Centre building was officially opened. In 2011, St. Mary's initiated a site development planning process to identify guiding principles, development options and concept plans for its 35-acre campus. St. Mary's library contains over 30,000 titles and has 51 workstations accessible by students.http://library.stmu.ca/ The St. Mary's library is also home to The St. John's Bible. It is a fully illuminated bible that is handwritten by world renowned calligrapher Donald Jackson (calligrapher) who is the scribe to the Queen of England. It is arguably the first time a cathedral, monastery or religious organization has commissioned something to this scale in over 500 years.

Known as a promoter of missionary work, he also took part in theological controversy. Biography Fuller was born in Wicken, Cambridgeshire, and settled at Kettering, Northamptonshire. During his life, Fuller pastored two congregations ‚Äì Soham (1775‚Äì1782) and Kettering (1782‚Äì1815), which is now the Fuller Baptist Church, He died on 7 May 1815 at Kettering. Baptist Missionary Society Fuller is best known in connection with the foundation of the Baptist Missionary Society, to which he for the most part devoted his energies. His work in promoting the missionary enterprises of the Baptist church began about 1784. A sermon published by him then, The Nature and Importance of Walking by Faith, with an appendix A Few Persuasives to a General Union in Prayer for the Revival of Religion, indirectly stimulated the movement. The Baptist Missionary Society (initially \\"Particular Baptist Society for Propagating the Gospel among the Heathen\\") was formed at Kettering in 1792. William Carey, impressed by Fuller's work The Gospel Worthy of all Acceptation, became the first missionary. Fuller took on the work at home. Views Fuller, a Particular Baptist, was a controversialist in defence of the governmental theory of the atonement against hyper-Calvinism on the one hand and Socinianism and Sandemanianism on the other. Abraham Booth accused him of giving up true Calvinism. Fuller debated theology with the General Baptist Dan Taylor, but they remained on good terms. According to Christianity Today, \\"'Tall, stout and muscular, a famous wrestler in his youth,' this self-taught farmer‚Äôs son became a champion for Christ, 'the most creatively useful theologian' of the Particular Baptists. His book The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation, 1785, restated Calvinist theology for Baptists influenced by the Evangelical Revival. His Doctorate of Divinity was bestowed by Brown University, Rhode Island.\\" Works Fuller wrote: * The Gospel worthy of all acceptation, or the Obligations of Men fully to credit and cordially to approve whatever God makes known. * The Calvinistic and Socinian Systems examined and compared as to their Moral Tendency, 1794, 1796, 1802. * The Gospel its own Witness, or the Holy Nature and Divine Harmony of the Christian Religion contrasted with the Immorality and Absurdity of Deism, 1799‚Äì1800. * An Apology for the late Christian Missions to India. * Memoirs of the Rev.

Fuller also wrote pamphlets, sermons, and essays. He contributed to Charles Edward de Coetlogon's Theological Miscellany, the Evangelical Magazine, the Missionary Magazine, the Quarterly Magazine, the Protestant Dissenters' Magazine, and the Biblical Magazine. John Ryland, in his Life of Fuller, enumerated 167 articles that Fuller had contributed. Editions of his Complete Works appeared in 1838, 1840, 1845, 1852, and 1853. Joseph Belcher edited an edition in three volumes for the Baptist Publication Society of Philadelphia, and his major publications were issued with a memoir by his son in Bohn's Standard Library, 1852.

It is named after American astronomer Edward Singleton Holden. It is part of the Uzboi-Landon-Morava (ULM) system. Description Like Gusev, it is notable for an outlet channel, Uzboi Vallis, that runs into it, and for many features that seem to have been created by flowing water. It's believed that Holden Crater was formed by an impact during the Noachian or Hesperian periods.Grant, J. et al. 2008.

Geologic map of the western equatorial region of Mars, U. S. Geol. Surv. Misc. Invest. Ser. Map I-1802-A. The crater's rim is cut with gullies, and at the end of some gullies are fan-shaped deposits of material transported by water.Moore, J. A. Howard. 2005. Large alluvial fans on Mars. Journal of Geophysical Research: 110, E04005. The crater is of great interest to scientists because it has some of the best-exposed lake deposits. One of the layers has been found by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to contain clays.Murchie, S. et al. 2009.

Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM Clays only form in the presence of water. There are two units of sediments in the crater. The lower unit formed in a large lake. It is believed the lake waters originated from the crater walls/or groundwater. Water from the crater walls may have come from precipitation when the Martian climate was different. The upper unit formed when water that was ponded to the south in Uzboi Vallis broke through Holden's rim. It is believed that great amount of water went through the rim; one flow was caused by a body of water larger than Earth's Lake Huron.Grant, J. et al. 2010. A lake in Uzboi Vallis and implications for late Noachian-Early Hesperian climate on Mars. Icarus: 212, 110-122 Some of the evidence for such a large flow of water is the presence of boulders tens of meters in size sticking above the surface. To transport such huge rocks takes a great deal of water. Holden is an old crater, containing numerous smaller craters, many of which are filled with sediment. The crater's central mountain is also obscured by sediment. Holden Crater was a proposed landing site for NASA's Mars Science Laboratory, until Gale Crater was deemed a better landing site. Just to the northeast of Holden Crater is Eberswalde Crater which contains a large delta. The lower beds of Holden are thought by some to maybe similar to materials in Eberswalde Crater.Malin, M., K.

Thesis, Los Angeles, California  Mars Science Laboratory  Several sites in the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle were proposed as areas to send NASA's major Mars rover, the Mars Science Laboratory. Holden Crater made the cut to be among the top four, although Gale Crater was chosen as the final landing site. Holden Crater is believed to have once been a lake. The aim of the Mars Science Laboratory is to search for signs of ancient life. It is hoped that a later mission could then return samples from sites identified as probably containing remains of life. To safely bring the craft down, a 12 mile wide, smooth, flat circle is needed. Geologists hope to examine places where water once ponded, and want to examine sediment layers. Although the Curiosity landed in Gale Crater, Holden was one of the seven finalists for the MSL landing site: which also included Eberswalde Crater, Mawrth Vallis, Miyamoto Crater, Nili Fossae Trough, and the Southern Meridiani Breccia in the crater Holden, taken by HiRISE.

His Erdbeschreibung (\\"Earth description\\") was the first geographical work of any scientific merit. He also did significant work on behalf of education. Biography He was born at Stadthagen in Schaumburg-Lippe, on the 27 September 1724. In his youth, he was harshly treated by his father, but a clergyman of the name of Hauber, pleased with his talents, undertook to give him free instruction, and afterwards enabled him to continue his studies at Halle. There, by application and good conduct, he acquired numerous friends, and in 1748 he was appointed tutor in the family of the count zu Lynar, who was then going as ambassador to St Petersburg. On the way to St. Petersburg, B√ºsching noticed the defective state of geographical science, and he resolved to devote his life to its improvement. Leaving the count's family at the first opportunity, he went to reside at Copenhagen, and devoted himself entirely to this new pursuit. In 1752 he published his brief Description of the Counties of Schleswig and Holstein as a specimen of what he hoped to do. In 1754 he moved to G√∂ttingen. While at G√∂ttingen, he married the poet Christiana Dilthey. Here a work in which he dissented from some of the Lutheran tenets lost him the appointment in 1757 to the theological chair for which he had become a candidate, but he was appointed professor of philosophy. In 1761 he accepted an invitation to minister to a Protestant German congregation at St Petersburg. There he organized a German-language secondary school which, under him, soon became one of the most flourishing in the north of Europe. A disagreement with Marshal M√ºnich led him, in spite of the empress's offers of high advancement, to return to central Europe in 1765. Back in Germany, he first went to live at Altona, but next year he was called to superintend the famous Greyfriars Gymnasium (), which had been formed at Berlin by Frederick the Great. Here he superintended the progress of every pupil, and inspected the minutest details connected with the prosperity of the institution, besides giving lectures on the history of the arts and sciences. His writing and example given a new impulse to education throughout Prussia, and the government was so sensible of the value of his services that they allowed his extensive correspondence to pass free of postage. He died in Berlin of dropsy, on 28 May 1793. Works B√ºsching's works on geography, history, education and religion, enumerated by Meusel in his Lexicon of German Authors, amount to more than a hundred. His reputation chiefly rests on his geographical works, for although he did not possess the genius of D'Anville, he may be regarded as the creator of statistical geography. His magnum opus is the Erdebeschreibung, in seven parts, of which the first four, covering Europe, were published in 1754‚Äì1761, and were translated into several languages (e.g. into English with a preface by Murdoch, in six volumes, London, 1762). In 1768 the fifth part was published, being the first volume upon Asia, containing Asiatic Turkey and Arabia. It displays an immense extent of research, and is generally considered as his masterpiece. B√ºsching was also the editor of a valuable collection entitled Magazin f√ºr die neue Historie und Geographie (23 vols. 4to, 1767‚Äì1793), and also of Wochentliche Nachrichten von neuen Landkarten (Berlin, 1773‚Äì1787). His works on education enjoyed great repute. In biography he wrote a number of articles for the Magazin, and a valuable collection of Beitr√§ge zur Lebensgeschichte merkw√ºrdiger Personen (6 vols., 1783‚Äì1789), including an elaborate life of Frederick the Great. His theological writings were less successful. When he died, Matthias Christian Sprengel and several other geographers continued his work. Family His son Johann Gustav Gottlieb B√ºsching was a noted antiquarian.

Members included Karla Jay, Martha Shelley, Rita Mae Brown, Lois Hart, Barbara Love, Ellen Shumsky, Artemis March, Cynthia Funk, Linda Rhodes, Arlene Kushner, Ellen Broidy, and Michela Griffo,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/lgbtq-history-month-road- america-s-first-gay-pride-march-n917096 and were mostly members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) and the National Organization for Women (NOW). Origins The story of the origin of the phrase \\"Lavender Menace\\" is that it was first used in 1969 by Betty Friedan, president of NOW, to describe the threat that she believed associations with lesbianism posed to NOW and the emerging women's movement. Friedan, and some other heterosexual feminists, worried that the association would hamstring feminists' ability to achieve serious political change, and that stereotypes of \\"mannish\\" and \\"man-hating\\" lesbians would provide an easy way to dismiss the movement. Under her direction, NOW attempted to distance itself from lesbian causes ‚Äì including omitting the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis from the list of sponsors of the First Congress to Unite Women in November 1969. Friedan's remarks and the decision to drop DOB from the sponsor list led lesbian feminist Rita Mae Brown to angrily resign her administrative job at NOW in February 1970 (Jay 137-138, Brownmiller 82). On March 15, 1970, straight radical feminist Susan Brownmiller quoted Friedan's remarks about the \\"lavender menace\\" and dismissed her worries as \\"A lavender herring, perhaps, but no clear and present danger\\" in a New York Times Magazine article. While the term \\"Lavender Menace\\" originated as a negative term for lesbianism, it was later reclaimed as a positive term by lesbian feminists. Brownmiller later said that when she wrote the article, she had intended to use a humorous quip to distance herself from Friedan's homophobia (Jay 140, Brownmiller 82), but some lesbian feminists (especially Michela Griffo) took her remarks as \\"a scathing put-down\\" (Brownmiller 82) and \\"evidence of Susan's homophobia or closet homosexuality--that is, that she was trying to distance herself from lesbians by insulting us\\" (Jay 140)‚Äîbecause they felt that the quip dismissed lesbians as an insignificant part of the movement, or lesbian issues as unnecessary distractions from the important issues. \\"The women's movement had coined the motto 'the personal is political,'\\" said Karla Jay, in the 2014 documentary She's Beautiful When She's Angry. \\"But when you were a lesbian and wanted to talk about lesbian relationships, as opposed to heterosexual relationships, they didn't want to hear about it.\\" Second Congress to Unite Women Describing lesbian activist Rita Mae Brown, Karla Ray has said: \\"one thing that you were not going to tell Rita was to shut up.\\" Brown suggested to her consciousness-raising group that lesbian radical feminists organize an action in response to Brownmiller's comments, and the public airing of Friedan's complaints. The group decided to target the Second Congress to Unite Women in New York City on May 1, 1970, which they noticed featured not a single open lesbian on the program (Jay 140). They planned a zap for the opening session of the Congress, which would use humor and nonviolent confrontation to raise awareness of lesbians and lesbian issues as vital parts to the emerging women's movement. They prepared a ten-paragraph manifesto entitled \\"The Woman-Identified Woman\\" and made T-shirts, dyed lavender and silkscreened with the words \\"Lavender Menace\\" for the entire group (Jay 140-142). They also created rose colored signs with slogans like \\"Women's Liberation IS A Lesbian Plot\\" and \\"You're Going To Love The Lavender Menace\\" written on them, which were then placed throughout the auditorium. Karla Jay, one of the organizers and participants in the zap, describes what happened: After the initial stunt, the \\"Menaces\\" passed out mimeographed copies of \\"The Woman-Identified Woman\\" and took the stage, where they explained how angry they were about the exclusion of lesbians from the conference and the women's movement as a whole. A few members of the planning committee tried to take back the stage and return to the original program, but gave up in the face of the resolute Menaces and the audience, who used applause and boos to show their support. The group and the audience then used the microphone for a spontaneous speak-out on lesbianism in the feminist movement, and several of the participants in the \\"zap\\" were invited to run workshops the next day on lesbian rights and homophobia (Jay 144). Straight and gay women from the congress joined an all-women's dance (a frequent organizing and social tool used by Gay Liberation Front men and women) (Brownmiller 98). Effects The \\"Lavender Menace\\" zap, and the publication of \\"The Woman-Identified Woman,\\" are widely remembered as a turning-point in the second-wave feminist movement, and as a founding moment for lesbian feminism. After the zap, many of the organizers continued to meet, and decided to create a lasting organization to continue their activism, which they eventually decided to call the \\"Radicalesbians.\\" At the next national conference of NOW, in September 1971, the delegates adopted a resolution recognizing lesbianism and lesbian rights as \\"a legitimate concern for feminism\\". In 1999, Susan Brownmiller described the impact by writing that \\"Lesbians would be silent no longer in the women's movement\\" (98). Karla Jay described it in her memoirs as \\"the single most important action organized by lesbians who wanted the women's movement to acknowledge our presence and needs,\\" and said that it \\"completely reshaped the relationship of lesbians to feminism for years to come\\" (137). \\"We felt as well,\\" Jay wrote, \\"that the zap was only the first of many actions to come and that lesbian liberation was suddenly and unstoppably on the rise\\" (145).

Aristomenes () was a king of Messenia, celebrated for his struggle with the Spartans in the Second Messenian War (685‚Äì668 BC), and his resistance to them on Mount Eira for 11 years. At length the mountain fell to the enemy, while he escaped and, according to legend, was snatched up by the gods; in fact he died at Rhodes. Life Aristomenes was a member of the Aepytid family, the son of Nicomedes (or, according to another version, of Pyrrhus) and Nicoteleia, and took a prominent part in stirring up the revolt against Sparta and securing the co- operation of Argos and Arcadia. He showed such heroism in the first encounter, at Derae, that the crown was offered to him, but he would accept only the title of commander-in-chief. His daring is illustrated by the story that he came by night to the temple of Athene \\"of the Brazen House\\" at Sparta, and there set up his shield with the inscription \\"Dedicated to the goddess by Aristomenes from the Spartans.\\" His prowess contributed largely to the Messenian victory over the Spartan and Corinthian forces at \\"The Boar's Barrow\\" in the plain of Stenyclarus, but in the following year the treachery of the Arcadian king Aristocrates caused the Messenians to suffer a crushing defeat at \\"The Great Trench.\\" Aristomenes and the survivors retired to the mountain stronghold of Eira, where they defied the Spartans for eleven years. On one of his raids he and fifty of his companions were captured and thrown into the Caeadas, the chasm on Mount Taygetus into which criminals were cast. Aristomenes alone was saved, and soon reappeared at Eira: legend told how he was upheld in his fall by an eagle and escaped by grasping the tail of a fox, which led him to the hole by which it had entered. On another occasion he was captured during a truce by some Cretan auxiliaries of the Spartans, and was released only by the devotion of a Messenian girl who afterwards became his daughter-in-law. At length Eira was betrayed to the Spartans (668 BC according to Pausanias), and after a heroic resistance Aristomenes and his followers had to evacuate Messenia and seek a temporary refuge with their Arcadian allies. A desperate plan to seize Sparta itself was foiled by Aristocrates, who paid with his life for his treachery. Aristomenes retired to Ialysus on Rhodes, where Damagetus, his son-in-law, was king, and died there while planning a journey to Sardis and Ecbatana to seek aid from the Lydian and Median sovereigns.Pausanias iv. 14-24 Other narratives A girl saves Aristomenes by Franc Kavƒçiƒç Another tradition represents him as captured and slain by the Spartans during the war.Pliny, Nat. Hist. xi. 187; Val. Maximus i. 8, 15; Steph. Byzant. s.v. ·ºàŒΩŒ¥Œ±ŒΩŒØŒ± Though there seems to be no conclusive reason for doubting the existence of Aristomenes, his history, as related by Pausanias, following mainly the Messeniaca of the Cretan epic poet Rhianus (about 230 BC), is evidently largely interwoven with fictions. These probably arose after the foundation of Messene in 369 BC. Aristomenes's statue was set up in the stadium there: his bones were fetched from Rhodes and placed in a tomb surmounted by a column,Pausanius iv. 32. 3, 6 and more than five centuries later heroic honours were still paid to him, and his exploits were a popular subject of song.Pausanius iv. 14. 7; 16. 6 According to explorer Richard Francis Burton, one story about Aristomenes, in which he had been thrown into a pit and had to escapebeing set free by Archidameiais the principal inspiration for one of the voyages of Sinbad the Sailor in the Arabian Nights.

Family Aristobulus was the younger son of Alexander Jannaeus, King and High Priest, and Alexandra Salome. After the death of Alexander in 76 BCE, his widow succeeded to the rule of Judea and installed her elder son Hyrcanus II as High Priest in 73 BCE.Year based upon Josephus (Antiquities 14.1.2), where, in the original Greek, is written: \\"Hyrcanus began his high priesthood on the third year of the hundred and seventy seventh Olympiad..., when presently Aristobulus began to make war against him.\\" The 177th Olympiad corresponded with the 238th year of the Seleucid era, or what was then 73 BCE. When Salome died in 67 BCE, Hyrcanus succeeded to the kingship as well. Aristobulus shared his late father's views on religion and politics. He entertained designs upon the throne, even during the life of his mother. He courted the nobles and military party by constituting himself the patron of the Sadducees and bringing their cause before the queen. The many fortresses which the queen placed at the disposal of the Sadducees, ostensibly for their defense against the Pharisees, constituted in reality one of the preparatory moves of Aristobulus for the usurpation of the government. The queen sought to direct his military zeal outside Judea, and sent him (70-69) against Ptolemy Mennaeus; but when the undertaking failed, Aristobulus resumed his political intrigues. He left Jerusalem secretly and betook himself to his friends, who controlled the largest number of fortified places, with the intention of making war against his aged mother. But the queen died at the critical moment, and he immediately turned his weapons against his brother Hyrcanus, the legitimate heir to the throne. Rebellion Hyrcanus seemed to be sympathetic to the Sadducees just like his father Alexander Jannaeus. Aristobulus rebelled against his elder brother. Because of this conflict, the Pharisees seemed to be in a vulnerable position at this time.Junghwa Choi, Jewish Leadership in Roman Palestine from 70 C.E. to 135 C.E. BRILL, 2013 p90 Hyrcanus advanced against Aristobulus at the head of his mercenaries and his followers. The brothers met in battle near Jericho and many of Hyrcanus' soldiers went over to Aristobulus, and thereby gave the latter the victory. Hyrcanus took refuge in the citadel of Jerusalem; but the capture of the Temple by Aristobulus compelled Hyrcanus to surrender. A peace was then concluded, according to the terms of which Hyrcanus was to renounce the throne and the office of high priest, but was to enjoy the revenues of the latter office.Sch√ºrer, \\"Gesch.\\" i. 291, note 2 This agreement however did not last, as Antipater the Idumaean convinced Hyrcanus that Aristobulus was planning his death and to take refuge with Aretas III, King of the Nabataeans. The Nabataeans advanced toward Jerusalem with an army of 50,000 and besieged the city for several months. Roman intervention During this civil war, the Roman general Pompey defeated the Kingdoms of Pontus and the Seleucids. He sent his deputy Marcus Aemilius Scaurus to take possession of Seleucid Syria. As the Hasmoneans were allies of the Romans, both brothers appealed to Scaurus, each endeavoring by gifts and promises to win him over to his side. Scaurus, moved by a gift of 400 talents, decided in favor of Aristobulus and ordered Aretas to withdraw his army. During his retreat, the Nabateans suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Aristobulus. When Pompey arrived in Syria in 63 BCE, both brothers and a third party that desired the removal of the entire dynasty, sent their delegates to Pompey, who however delayed the decision. He favoured Hyrcanus II over Aristobulus II, deeming the elder, weaker brother a more reliable ally of the Roman Empire. Pompey defeated the Jewish armies in multiple battles, and took the fortresses of Judea. Aristobulus and his sons Alexander and Antigonus were captured in 63 BCE. Aristobulos, suspicious of Pompey, entrenched himself in the fortress of Alexandrium, but when the Romans defeated his army again, he surrendered and undertook to deliver Jerusalem over to them. However, since many of his followers were unwilling to open the gates, the Romans besieged and captured the city by force, badly damaging city and temple. Hyrcanus was restored as High Priest, but deprived of political authority. Aristobulus II escaped in 57 BCE, instigating rebellion against Rome in Judea, until he was finally holed up by Aulus Gabinius, consul of the Roman province of Syria, in Machaerus. Marc Antony, commander of the cavalry under Gabinius, led several men to scale Aristobulus' fortifications and subdue his forces.Plutarch \\"Makers of Rome\\" p. 272, trans by Ian Scott-Kilvert, Penguin Classics. Taken prisoner, Aristobulus was released by Julius Caesar in 49 BCE in order to turn Judea against Pompey. He was on his way to Judaea with his son Alexander, when \\"he was taken off by poison given him by those of Pompey's party\\".Josephus, Jewish Wars 1 9:1 (184). His son Alexander was beheaded by the Roman commander Scipio at Antioch.Josephus, Jewish Wars 1 9:2 (185). His son Antigonus led a rebellion against Rome, with help from the Parthians, and became king and high priest in 40 BCE, but was defeated and killed by the Romans in 37 BCE.

He presumably was a native or at least a citizen of Cappadocia, a Roman province in Asia Minor (modern day Turkey), and most likely lived after the first century (possible floruit 130‚Äì140 CE). He is generally styled \\"the Cappadocian\\" (). Diagnostic method Aretaeus wrote in Ionic Greek several general treatises on diseases, which are still extant. His valuable work displays great accuracy in the detail of symptoms, and in seizing the diagnostic character of diseases. In his practice he followed for the most part the method of Hippocrates, but he paid less attention to what have been styled \\"the natural actions\\" of the system; and, contrary to the practice of the Father of Medicine, he did not hesitate to attempt to counteract them, when they appeared to him to be injurious. Aretaeus offered clinical descriptions of a number of diseases among which he gave classic accounts of asthma, epilepsy, pneumonia, tetanus, uterus cancer and different kinds of insanity. He differentiated nervous diseases and mental disorders and described hysteria, headaches, mania and melancholia. He wrote the first known description of coeliac disease, naming it disease of the abdomen, koiliakos. The account which Aretaeus gives of his treatment of various diseases indicates a simple and sagacious system, and one of more energy than that of the professed Methodici. Thus he freely administered active purgatives; he did not object to narcotics; he was much less averse to bleeding; and upon the whole his Materia Medica was both ample and efficient. It may be asserted generally that there are few of the ancient physicians, since the time of Hippocrates, who appear to have been less biased by attachment to any peculiar set of opinions, and whose account of the phenomena and treatment of disease has better stood the test of subsequent experience. Aretaeus is placed by some writers among the Pneumatici because he maintained the doctrines which are peculiar to this sect; other systematic writers, however, think that he is better entitled to be placed with the Eclectics. Works Aretaeus' work consists of eight books, two De causis et signis acutorum morborum, two De causis et signis diuturnorum morborum, two De curatione acutorum morborum, and two De curatione diuturnorum morborum. They are in a tolerably complete state of preservation, though a few chapters are lost. The work was first published in a Latin translation by Junius Paulus Crassus (Giunio Paolo Grassi), Venice 1552, together with Rufus Ephesius. The first Greek edition is that by Jacobus Goupylus, Paris, 1554, which is more complete than the Latin version of Crassus. In 1723 a major edition in folio was published at the Clarendon press at Oxford, edited by John Wigan, containing an improved text, a new Latin version, learned dissertations and notes, and a copious index by Michel Maittaire. In 1731, Boerhaave brought out a new edition, of which the text and Latin version had been printed before the appearance of Wigan's; this edition contains annotations by Pierre Petit and Daniel Wilhelm Triller. The edition by C. G. K√ºhn, Leipzig 1828, included Wigan's text, Latin version, dissertations, etc., together with Petit's commentary, Triller's emendations, and Maittaire's index. An edition by F. Z. Ermerins was published in Utrecht in 1847. A more recent standard edition is by Karl Hude (1860‚Äì1936) in the Corpus medicorum graecorum (2nd ed., Berlin, Akademie-Verlag, 1958, online). The four books De causis et signis have now been issued in an annotated bilingual edition in Greek and French (Ar√©t√©e de Cappadoce, Des causes et des signes des maladies aigu√´s et chroniques, trans. R.T.H. Laennec, ed. and comm. Mirko D. Grmek, pref. by Danielle Gourevitch, Geneva, 2000). Secondary literature The medical opinions of Aretaeus have been discussed by such scholars as Johann Albert Fabricius, Albrecht von Haller, and Kurt Sprengel.

He was said to have organised the murder of Juan de Escobedo. Attempts to prosecute Perez led to riots and disorder. He eventually fled Spain after being liberated from prison by his supporters, and spent most of his remaining years in France.  Biography = Early years  Antonio Perez was born in Madrid in 1534. In 1542 he was legalized as son of Gonzalo P√©rez, Secretary of the Council of State of king Charles I of Spain (Holy Roman Emperor Charles V). Most probably Antonio was indeed the son of Gonzalo P√©rez but conceived while Gonzalo was clergy. Even though Antonio was born in Madrid his attachment was to Aragon where his father was from and where his family was most influential. His followers and supporters were all from Aragon and later in life he would flee to Aragon to find support for himself and protection from the king's persecution. Antonio P√©rez was raised in Val de Concha, Guadalajara, in the lands of Ruy Gomez de Silva, Prince of Eboli and leader of one of the political factions of the time, of which Gonzalo P√©rez was part. (The other faction was that of the Duke of Alba.) Antonio later attended the most prestigious universities such as Alcal√° de Henares, Salamanca, Leuven, Venice and Padua. His father introduced and trained him in matters of State.  Secretary  In 1543 Gonzalo P√©rez was appointed secretary of Prince (later king) Philip. In 1556 Charles abdicated his Spanish kingdoms to his son who became king Philip of the several Spanish kingdoms (Castile, Aragon, etc.) and Gonzalo P√©rez continued as secretary of the new king. Gonzalo P√©rez died in 1566 and his son Antonio was made Secretary of State of Castile a year later. During the first ten years as secretary Gonzalo P√©rez had great influence over king Philip who valued his advice. With the death of the Prince of Eboli in 1573 Antonio P√©rez became the leader of that faction in accord with the widow, Ana de Mendoza, the one-eyed Princess of √âboli. In 1567 Antonio P√©rez married Juana de Coello with whom he had several sons.  Murder of Escobedo  P√©rez Mart√≠n is most remembered for his role in the murder of Juan de Escobedo, secretary of Don Juan of Austria. King Philip was suspicious of the designs of his half brother Don Juan of Austria and Antonio P√©rez exploited this suspicion to his own benefit. By advice of Antonio P√©rez, in 1575, the king imposed Juan de Escobedo, whom Antonio P√©rez considered trustworthy, as secretary of Don Juan of Austria. The design was that Escobedo would spy for Antonio P√©rez but it turned out that, unexpectedly, Escobedo became faithful to Don Juan. Antonio P√©rez then began to make king Philip suspicious of Escobedo. P√©rez, as secretary for the affairs of the Low Countries, was in a position to intercept and turn to his own advantage many innocent documents. He doctored reports and wrote derisive comments on the margins of letters destined for the king. He repeatedly insinuated to the king that Don Juan was plotting against him and Escobedo (code named Verdinegro - \\"green-black\\") was encouraging him in his plotting.Amarie Dennis, Don Juan of Austria. He convinced the king that Escobedo must be killed without judicial process for \\"reasons of State\\". The king gave his assent but had no other participation in the murder. In early 1577 Don Juan was in the low Countries and Escobedo, his secretary, was visiting Madrid having been sent there by Don Juan. After three clumsy attempts to poison Escobedo failed, P√©rez recruited swordsmen to assassinate him. P√©rez removed himself from Madrid and, on the night of March 31, 1578, in a narrow alley the assassins stabbed Escobedo to death. Insausti was the name of the killer and was helped by a group of loyals of Antonio P√©rez, people from Aragon, where Antonio P√©rez was from and where he was most powerful and influential. Immediately rumors were flying that Antonio P√©rez was behind the killing. A few months later, on October 1, Don Juan died of Typhus in the Low Countries. (His body was cut in three parts and secretly passed through France to Spain where it was reassembled and given proper burial.) King Philip soon became suspicious of the motives of his secretary and realized he had given his assent to a terrible crime. Nevertheless, he could not arrest him immediately as P√©rez was a powerful man with information which could damage the king, including the murder of Escobedo. At first the family of Escobedo demanded an investigation but later they gave up this claim. They were probably paid off by Antonio P√©rez or someone close to him. Arrest and trials  Antonio P√©rez. 1791 engraving. Biblioteca Nacional de Espa√±a. Madrid. On 28 July 1579 Antonio P√©rez and the Princess of √âboli were arrested by order of the king. The Princess of √âboli, as a proud woman who confronted the king, was kept imprisoned in different places, mostly on her palace in Pastrana, for the rest of her days. Antonio P√©rez was more prudent and had compromising information so his situation with the king deteriorated slowly over time. At first he was under house arrest and had relative freedom but his liberty was gradually diminished. Also, he thought it might be possible for him to regain the favor of the king. In 1584 he was subject to the judicial process called visita which was an auditing or review of his service as Secretary of the king. In this process he was formally accused of corruption and of altering ciphered messages to the king. On 31 January 1585 he jumped out a window and sought asylum in a nearby church but the king's officers forced the door and arrested him without regard for the special judicial status of the church. This incident provoked a lawsuit from the church claiming infringements of their rights and demanding the man be returned to them but this claim went nowhere. Antonio P√©rez was taken prisoner to the castle of Tur√©gano, near Segovia. On 23 March he was notified of the sentence of the visita process: two years in prison, ten years banishment from the court with disqualification for all official posts as well as some monetary penalties. While at Tur√©gano Antonio P√©rez enjoyed relative freedom, his wife and children went to live with him and he soon assembled, as was his custom, a retinue of followers.Gregorio Mara√±√≥n, Biograf√≠a de Antonio P√©rez Antonio P√©rez plotted his own escape with the help of more followers who would take the castle at Tur√©gano and overcome the guard. This group set up their base in the nearby village of Mu√±overos and did manage to enter the castle in the middle of the night but the governor and his guard, outnumbered and against all odds, tricked them and convinced them to give up their attempt. As a result, Antonio Perez's property was confiscated and his wife and children were imprisoned in Madrid. Finally, in 1587 Antonio P√©rez was formally accused of the 1578 murder of Escobedo. This judicial process progressed very slowly and during this time Antonio P√©rez was kept prisoner but moved around different towns and castles. During all this time his conditions varied from harsh to relative freedom. The intention of the king was to recover the incriminating papers which P√©rez still kept hidden somewhere. P√©rez knew that his safety depended on having these papers and would not produce them and the king's tactics alternated between punishing him or giving him more freedom. But the king was becoming aware that he was not getting the papers he wanted. In early 1590 Antonio P√©rez was questioned under torture but he only confessed very vaguely implying the king was behind the killing. At this point he believed he may be sentenced to die and so, again, he planned his escape. On 19 April, with the help of his wife, Juana Coello, who was eight months pregnant, in the evening, he escaped his prison in Madrid. The escape was very carefully planned. With two loyal men he rode all night trying to gain the border of Aragon, separate kingdom with laws that protected him. In spite of his age and his poor physical state after being tortured, they rode all night changing horses along the Royal Posts. A second group followed a short while later, disguised as servants of a nobleman, with the purpose of tiring the Posts' horses and thus make them unavailable should any officers of the king try to follow. Once in Aragon they rested in the Monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de Huerta, then in Aragon (although this is not the case today as the border was later moved). A group of followers came to join them there with fresh horses and, further on, a military escort. He demanded the judicial process known as manifestaci√≥n de personas, a form of habeas corpus which guaranteed his due process under the laws and justice of Aragon (fueros) and this was immediately granted. With this he could not be extradited to Castile without a formal judicial process. He then moved slowly towards Zaragoza while he raised his supporters. On May 1 he entered triumphantly in Zaragoza surrounded by his followers and escorts. There he was put in the prison of manifestados subject to the justice of Aragon which for him meant protection from the king and the judicial process in Castile. In the prison of manifestados Antonio P√©rez had great liberty. He received his friends and prepared his defense. He had access to all his documents which had been sent to Arag√≥n even before his escape. In the meanwhile the king had immediately set the judicial process in motion. On 23 April, even before Antonio P√©rez had arrived in Zaragoza, a new judicial process was initiated by the king against Antonio P√©rez in Aragon accusing him of being responsible of the murder of Escobedo, of having given the king false information with the purpose of getting him to approve the extrajudicial killing, of using secrets of State for his own ends and of falsifying messages to the king as he deciphered them as well as having escaped from prison. On 1 July the judge in Madrid, Rodrigo de Arce, issued a death sentence against Antonio P√©rez. To prevent any escape attempt a special guard was placed outside the prison of manifestados by order of the king and Antonio P√©rez used this to his advantage by playing the issue as one of Castile infringing on the sovereignty of Aragon. By linking his case to that of the rights and freedoms of Aragon (known as fueros), Antonio P√©rez cleverly obtained the support of the people of Aragon. The courts of Aragon hindered the judicial process and it seemed Antonio P√©rez would be found innocent so the king's accusation was withdrawn and a new, similar, accusation was presented by the king's representative in Aragon, I√±igo de Mendoza y de la Cerda, Marquis of Almenara. Also, on 1 September, a new accusation was presented by the king as king of Aragon. In this new accusation Antonio P√©rez was accused of serving king Philip badly in matters relating to Aragon but Antonio P√©rez claimed as defense that he never served the king in any matters related to Aragon. Antonio Perez released by the Aragonese town in 1591. In 1591 P√©rez made an unsuccessful attempt to escape and the judicial processes were moving very slowly. The king then resorted to the farce of accusing Antonio P√©rez of heresy through the Inquisition which was an ecclesiastical organization and had jurisdiction in both Castile and Aragon. The purpose of this was to bypass the judicial system of Arag√≥n. On 13 May Antonio P√©rez was moved to a prison in the Aljafer√≠a which caused riots of the people of Aragon who considered this an affront and a violation of their laws. In the riots the marquis of Almenara, representative of the king, was killed and soon Antonio P√©rez was triumphantly returned to the prison of manifestados. The situation was growing chaotic, the local authorities escaped in fear of the rioters and P√©rez was planning his escape to France when the king ordered the invasion of Aragon by troops of Castile in a watershed move against the specific laws of Aragon and its limited self-government. On 10 November 1591 Antonio P√©rez fled Zaragoza and two days later the Aragonese armies crumbled and the royalist armies entered Zaragoza without opposition. The king gave order that the Chief Justice, Juan de Lanuza y Urrea, be executed without trial and on December 20, 1591, his head was exhibited for all the terrified people to see.  Escape and exile in France and England On the night of 23 November, disguised as a shepherd and in heavy snow, Antonio P√©rez crossed the Pyrenees into the Kingdom of Bearn-Navarre. He first went to Pau in B√©arn where Catherine, sister of Henry III of Navarre (IV of France), governed. He spent the rest of his life trying to make a living off the sale of the secrets he knew, but he failed to make an impression on Queen Elizabeth I and her chief minister William Cecil. In 1593 he arrived in England as a guest of Anthony Bacon and he was admired by the Essex circle for his knowledge of Tacitism. It was the printer Richard Field who printed Perez' Pedacos de Historia o Relaciones. He was a guest of Francis Bacon's on the famous Night of Errors at Gray's Inn when the throng of disorderly people nearly prevented a performance of A Comedy of Errors. He was the target of several unsuccessful assassination attempts, originating with the Spanish Government: Patrick O'Collun and John Annias, executed in 1594 for conspiracy to kill the Queen, initially confessed only to an attempt to kill Perez, and the royal physician Rodrigo Lopez, who was executed for the same crime, was a party to a separate plot to kill him. It has been claimed that Perez was mocked in Love's Labour's Lost in the persona of the preposterous Spaniard Don Armado. Gustav Ungerer argued that there were many similarities between Perez and Armado, including their prose style and their love life.Felicia Hardison Londr√©, \\"Elizabethan Views of the Other\\", in Love's Labour's Lost: Critical Essays, Routledger, 2001, p.333. Perez was recalled to France by Henry of Navarre, now Henry IV. He remained there until the end of his days except for several travels to England. Perez's Relaciones along with the Apologia written by William of Orange in 1580, are largely responsible for the Black Legend that has grown around Philip II. King Philip died in 1598; and the wife and children of Antonio P√©rez, who were still imprisoned in Madrid, were set free. In 1611 Antonio P√©rez died in Paris and was interred in a convent, but his remains were lost during the desecrations of the French Revolution.

(The name is pronounced \\"gory & defeated\\".) The Gorre & Daphetid, also known as \\"The Gorre\\" or just \\"The G&D;,\\" was actually three successive model railroads. The first two small versions were built at Allen's home in Monterey. The final version of the G&D;, which incorporated the earliest layout, was much larger and built over a period of twenty years at his new 9 Cielo Vista Terrace home in Monterey, where he excavated part of the basement to build the railroad. Mr. Allen was a pioneer in the field of model railroading - as a professional photographer he had the artistic talent and attention to detail to create and document incredibly realistic scenes, and did so in numerous articles featured in Model Railroader, the NMRA's Scale Rails and Railroad Model Craftsman magazines. He developed a wonderful story of origin, including humor and numerous references to his friends in the model railroading and model railroading publishing industry. He designed and built numerous buildings and people. The final layout is considered one of the greatest layouts of all time, and has several fan websites and a devoted Yahoo discussion groups. The basement of the house was severely damaged by fire just ten days after John Allen suffered a fatal heart attack in January 1973. Most of the layout was destroyed in the fire. However, one of the locomotives, No. 34, a 4-10-0 that John kitbashed from parts, resided in the office of the late former Model Railroader magazine executive editor Andy Sperandeo. Sperandeo was a frequent visitor to the G&D;, being stationed in California while serving in the United States Army. In the February 2020 issue of Model Railroader, 15 locomotives from the G&D; were found in the home of NMRA past president Bob Dupont in the attic until he passed on and the locomotives were discovered by Rod Smith. Rod sent the locomotives to Kenichi Matsumoto and recently restored G&D; 10 and is in running condition at the NMRA exhibit at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento, California. Kalmbach Publishing published several editions of a book entitled Model Railroading with John Allen written by Allen's longtime friend, Linn Westcott. Allen was a professional photographer by trade, and numerous boxes of his slides and prints are in storage at Kalmbach Publishing's corporate building in Waukesha, Wisconsin. Some of the boxes were singed by the flames of the fire that destroyed the G&D;, and the smell of smoke from the blaze still lingers when one opens a box for a look at unpublished photos of the G&D.; References * Model Railroading With John Allen: The Story of the Fabulous HO Scale Gorre & Daphetid Railroad (Paperback) Linn H.

Located east of Citi Field near the Flushing River, it is known for its automobile shops and junkyards, and had a population of 10 people in 2011. Proposals to redevelop Willets Point started after World War II, but gained full traction in 2007. New York City Council members and the few residents of the area strongly opposed the original plan, leading to several years of lawsuits. In 2011, the city began a $4 billion redevelopment project began to construct a retail shopping center, residential buildings with a combined 3,000 units, an entertainment complex, and a public school. The New York City Economic Development Corporation's plan to redevelop the area was approved in 2013, and demolition of the industrial section of Willets Point began in 2016. The new development was originally set to open in stages between 2018 and 2032. However, the redevelopment plans were changed after a New York state court blocked the construction of the shopping center. The development was re- approved in February 2018. Description Willets Point is bounded by Northern Boulevard to the north, 126th Street and Citi Field to the west, Roosevelt Avenue and Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park to the south, and the Flushing River to the east. The New York City Subway's Mets‚ÄìWillets Point station, serving the , is located at the southwest corner of the area, at Roosevelt Avenue and 126th Street. The neighborhood is part of Queens Community District 7. Willets Point is zoned mostly for industrial activity. It has no sidewalks or sewers , and due to the area's geography and the lack of paved roads in the area, flooding is common during heavy rains. The area consists mostly of auto repair shops, scrap yards, waste processing sites, and similar small businesses. It has been described as being \\"post-apocalyptic\\" in appearance. A Hunter College study in April 2006 found that Willets Point was a \\"unique regional destination\\" for auto parts and repairs, and that the 225 businesses in the area employed a combined 1,400 to 1,800 people at the time. It had a population of 10 people . The concentration of auto-repair shops resulted in the area's nickname of the \\"Iron Triangle.\\" History The area was named after that portion of Willets Point Boulevard lying west of Flushing Creek, which flows northward past the area. Willets Point Boulevard once crossed a now-demolished bridge over Flushing Creek and continued to the Willets Point cape, at the confluence of the East River and Long Island Sound. The original Willets Point is the site of Fort Totten near Bayside, but over the course of the 20th century it became commonplace to apply the name \\"Willets Point\\" (derived from the street, rather than the geographical feature) to the area on the Flushing River instead. The neighborhood, street, and cape's name are all derived from the Willets family, whose land the government bought in 1857 to build Fort Totten (originally named \\"Fort at Willets Point\\"). Citi Field, which opened in Willets Point in 2009 Shea Stadium, which was located in Willets Point from 1964 to 2008 By the end of World War II, Willets Point was known as an area of auto junkyards. Since then, several redevelopment plans for Willets Point were proposed, but never implemented. Before the 1964 New York World's Fair, Robert Moses tried to incorporate Willets Point into Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park but failed when the junkyard owners hired Mario Cuomo as their lawyer. Shea Stadium, a multipurpose stadium in Willets Point, was opened in 1964, the same year as the World's Fair. After the New York Jets left Shea Stadium at the end of the 1983 season to play at the Meadowlands, Willets Point was the proposed location for a new, 82,000-seat domed football stadium that would bring the Jets back to New York. After the Jets decided to remain in New Jersey, the proposed stadium was also discussed as a potential new home for the St. Louis Cardinals of the NFL, the Atlanta Falcons, and the New Jersey Generals. By the 1990s, the New York Mets were looking to replace the aging Shea Stadium. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg started planning for the redevelopment of Willets Point in 2002. Citi Field was originally proposed as part of the city's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, which was submitted in 2005. Willets Point was supposed to contain athlete's housing. Even though New York City lost the bid to London, the plans for Citi Field progressed anyway. Following Citi Field's completion, Shea Stadium was demolished in 2009. Since 2009, the neighborhood has been discussed as a potential site for the New York Islanders to move to, as well as a Major League Soccer team. Redevelopment=Initial proposal and controversy On May 1, 2007, Mayor Bloomberg announced his administration's new plan for urban renewal in the area. The plan called for replacing the scrapyards and industrial sites with a sustainable and affordable mixed-use development including a convention center, 5,500 units of housing, of retail, for a school, of office space, Community Facility, as well as environmental remediation, installation of sewers and other infrastructure, and relocation of previous businesses. Willets Point would create more than 5,300 permanent jobs and add 18,000 construction jobs. On April 9, 2008, the Willets Point Industry and Realty Association (WPIRA), a group of the 10 largest business and land owners in Willets Point, filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the City of New York seeking a court order requiring the City to provide infrastructure improvements, including repairs to streets and storm sewers, installation of sanitary sewers, street lights, street signs and other services that the City had allegedly withheld for over 40 years, as well as unspecified damages for past neglect. Judge Edward R Korman granted the City's motion to dismiss this lawsuit on November 25, 2009. On April 21, 2008, a majority of the New York City Council's members expressed their \\"adamant opposition\\" to the proposed Willets Point redevelopment in writing to Robert Lieber, New York City's Deputy Mayor for Economic Development. The \\"adamant opposition\\" letter was signed by 29 City Council members. Three days later, Queens elected officials, various union members and others rallied at a press conference on the steps of New York City Hall. The gathering was in support of having the City move forward with the proposed development of Willets Point. The rally was led by Queens Borough President Helen Marshall. Also in attendance were state senators Frank Padavan and Toby Ann Stavisky and Assembly Member Nettie Mayersohn, former Queens Borough President Claire Shulman and Queens Chamber of Commerce President Al Pennisi who spoke about the vital role the development would play in the Queens business community. On June 30, 2008, the plan was approved with numerous conditions by Queens Community Board 7 and by the City Planning Commission on September 24, 2008. The City Council held a public hearing regarding the plan on October 17 and voted on November 13, 2008 to approve the redevelopment plan, which includes the potential use of eminent domain to acquire property. Some property owners have vowed to try to stop the plan through litigation, while others voluntarily sold their property to the City during the fall of 2008 so as to avert involuntary taking of their property through eminent domain and relocation by the New York City Economic Development Corporation. On July 31, 2009, the Corporation announced plans to invest $100 million into infrastructure projects in Queens that would include development in Willets Point. In March 2009, Joseph Ardizzone, the only resident of Willets Point at the time, as well several local businesses filed another lawsuit in state court. The new suit challenged the City's approval of the development plan and contending that the plan had undergone inadequate environmental review. Allegations arose in 2009 that the City of New York and its Economic Development Corporation had improperly provided funding to organizations that lobbied the City Council in favor of the Willets Point development plan. In May 2010 the New York City Department of Transportation opened a new Municipal Asphalt Plant on Harper Street, on the north side of Willets Point. Plan approved by City Council In 2011, the $4 billion redevelopment project began.Garfield, Leanna (April 6, 2017) \\"11 billion-dollar mega-projects that will transform New York City by 2035\\" Business Insider The next year, the city changed the agreement to include a mall with 200 stores, as well as a 2,500-unit housing development, of which 875 would be affordable housing. This caused a change in public opinion, and many of the project's original supporters came to oppose the mall. A draft supplemental environmental impact statement (EIS) was published on March 15, 2013, and a final EIS was published on August 9. At the time of the FEIS's approval, the redevelopment area consisted of four parking lots around Citi Field, as well as a \\"Special Willets Point District\\" consisting of a triangle-shaped area where most of the industry was located. On October 9 of the same year, the City Council approved the Willets Point redevelopment plan. In phase 1A of the plan, which was expected to be completed in 2018, a 200-room hotel would have been constructed alongside a retail area of , connected by an esplanade at 126th Street. There would have been a temporary 2,825-spot parking lot east of the hotel and retail area, which would host recreational events for at least half the year. Meanwhile, one of Citi Field's western parking lots would have been demolished to make room for a mall with of leasable retail space and up to 200 stores including anchors. The mall would have included a food court, a movie theater, and a new 2,900-spot parking structure. Another 1,800-spot parking structure would have replaced an existing 640-spot western portion of Citi Field's South Lot south of Roosevelt Avenue. Even after Phase 1A was finished, there would still be a portion of the Willets Point triangle for automotive and industrial uses. Phase 1B of the plan would have taken ten more years to build, and would have complete by 2028. The temporary 2,825-spot lot would have been gradually redeveloped into of \\"residential, retail, additional hotel, office, parking, and community facility\\" development, as well as a public school and of parkland. The eastern portion of the South Lot, as well as Lot D to the east, would have been replaced with two 6-floor parking structures. This proposal for Phase 1B would have followed the same zoning map as in Phase 1A. As in Phase 1A, a smaller portion of the Willets Point triangle wasremain for automotive and industrial uses. Since the streets in this part of the redevelopment project slope downward, the Phase 1B development would have also graded downward toward the industrial section of the neighborhood. The Van Wyck Expressway would also have had two new access ramps to serve Phase 1B. The city allocated $66 million of their budget for the design and construction of the new ramps. Housing would have been built as part of the second phase of the project, set to be complete by 2032. There would have been 2,490 housing units, of which 35%, or 1,000, will be affordable units. However, in the 2013 FEIS, the EDC stipulated that there might be up to 5,850 housing units, which would comprise a combined of space. There would also be of retail space; of office space; of space for a new convention center; for a hotel or hotels with a combined 700 rooms; for a community center; for a public school; and of parkland. Parking would also be expanded up to 6,700 spaces based on demand. Lot B, located between Citi Field and Roosevelt Avenue, would likely have a retail area, a parking lot, and a 10-floor office building. This would significantly alter the zoning for the area, but would also bring more economic activity into Flushing and Corona.  Changes to plan  In 2014, Bill de Blasio replaced Michael Bloomberg as mayor of New York City. He opposed the redevelopment plan because of the lack of affordable housing, but the City Council approved the project in 2015. State Senator Tony Avella and a small community group sued to stop the mall from being built. In June 2015, a state court ruled that the mall could not be built on a parking lot in Willets Point. The developers appealed the lawsuit, but the city's government refused to join in on the appeal. By the end of July 2016, the last auto repair shops between 38th and Roosevelt Avenues had been closed and demolition had started on the development, now priced at US$4 billion. Most Willets Points business owners either went out of business or moved to Hunts Point, Bronx. Actual construction on the Phase 1 shopping area was halted by a 2015 lawsuit, which was filed to prevent the retail area from being built in a portion of the neighborhood that is legally part of Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park. The suit did not preclude any other part of Phase 1A from being built. The New York Supreme Court, which began hearing arguments in April 2017, ruled against the construction of the mall on June 6. In February 2018, the de Blasio administration and developers came to an agreement in which 1,100 lower- and middle-class apartments, a 450-pupil school, parks, and of retail space would be built. The new plan did not include a mall, as the original plan had. Under the agreement, the developers The Related Companies and Sterling Equities were expected to clear all toxic materials from Willets Point by 2020, and the first 500 apartments were expected to open by 2022. In popular culture The \\"Valley of Ashes\\" described in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby is said to have been inspired by a former dump (now the location of Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park) in Willets Point. The 2007 film Chop Shop was also filmed and set in this neighborhood. The 2010 dramatic film Willets Point, directed by T. J. Collins, is set in the neighborhood.Catsoulis, Jeanette (November 25, 2010) \\"Latino Family Drama: The New York Times The 2018 documentary The Iron Triangle, directed by Prudence Katze and William Lehman, describes the history behind the destruction of the once-thriving neighborhood.Kensinger, Nathan (February 22, 2018) \\"The Life and Death of Willets Point\\" Curbed New York Neutral Drop, an automotive YouTube channel, films many of their videos in the streets and backlots of the Iron Triangle. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kw5u1YOgs5g ReferencesExternal links * *WILLETS POINT Environmental Review.

Appalachian Mountains During the early Triassic period, the super-continent Pangea was formed as the Iapetus Ocean closed up and the proto-North American continent collided with Avalonia, part of modern-day Africa. This caused great uplift and the creation of the Appalachian Mountains, which, at the time, were bigger than modern-day Himalayas. Erosion of the Appalachian Mountains now exposes metamorphic rocks once very deep in the Earth's mantle and uplifted during this time period. Eastern Border Fault About 200 million years after this collision and the formation of Pangea, during the middle of the Mesozoic Era, the Atlantic Ocean floor started spreading and great extensional forces were experienced, resulting in faulting. Connecticut's Eastern border fault was created, a fault which begins in New Haven and stretches 130 miles up to Keene, New Hampshire. As a result, the land west of this fault was downset, creating a rift valley and causing the land to tilt an average of 15 to 25 degrees. The fault is currently inactive. The formation of this basin eventually refilled with soft fluvial and alluvial sediments. Ice Age During Ice Ages, glacial activity shaped much of New England‚Äôs landscape, eroding mountains, leaving glacial till scattered everywhere, and forming glacial lakes. At its greatest extent, one of these glaciers left behind a moraine which became today's Long Island. One of the biggest glacial lakes of the time was Glacial Lake Hitchcock. It formed when the Laurentide Ice Sheet retreated and glacial meltwater began to accumulate at the glacier's terminal moraine in Rocky Hill, Connecticut and back up into the Connecticut River. The glacial lake left behind a soft, varved landscape, gathering silt and sand in the summertime due to the influx of glacial meltwater and clay in the wintertime as the lake froze until it was later drained. River Valley This soft surface has since been downcut, resedimented and oft flooded by the Connecticut River, making it a very soft, nutrient-replenished area and host to the majority of Connecticut's farmland soils. The land on either side of the Connecticut River Valley is less suitable for farmlands. The eastern section holds the shallow Proto-North American Terrane while the western section contains the Iapetos and Avalonian Terranes, which still holds remnants of glacial till and lack the soft fluvial sediments so prominent in the Connecticut River Valley region.

It is headed by the Cardinal Secretary of State and performs all the political and diplomatic functions of the Holy See. The Secretariat is divided into three sections, the Section for General Affairs, the Section for Relations with States, and, since 2017, the Section for Diplomatic Staff. History of the Secretariat of State The origins of the Secretariat of State go back to the fifteenth century. The apostolic constitution Non Debet Reprehensibile of 31 December 1487 established the Secretaria Apostolica comprising twenty-four apostolic secretaries, one of whom bore the title Secretarius Domesticus and held a position of pre-eminence. One can also trace to this Secretaria Apostolica the Chancery of Briefs, the Secretariat of Briefs to Princes and the Secretariat of Latin Letters. Pope Leo X established another position, the Secretarius Intimus, to assist the Cardinal who had control of the affairs of State and to attend to correspondence in languages other than Latin, chiefly with the Apostolic Nuncios (who at that time were evolving into permanent diplomatic representatives). From these beginnings, the Secretariat of State developed, especially at the time of the Council of Trent. Two secretaries of state: Cardinal Angelo Sodano (former Secretary of State of the Holy See) with Condoleezza Rice (former U.S. Secretary of State) For a long time, the Secretarius Intimus, also called Secretarius Papae or Secretarius Maior, was almost always a prelate, often endowed with episcopal rank. It was only at the beginning of the pontificate of Innocent X that someone already a Cardinal and not a member of the Pope's family was called to this high office. Pope Innocent XII definitively abolished the office of Cardinal Nephew, and the powers of that office were assigned to the Cardinal Secretary of State alone. On 19 July 1814, Pope Pius VII established the Sacred Congregation for the Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, expanding the Congregatio super negotiis ecclesiasticis Regni Galliarum established by Pius VI in 1793. With the apostolic constitution Sapienti Consilio of 29 June 1908, Saint Pius X divided the Sacred Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs in the form fixed by the Codex Iuris Canonici of 1917 (Can. 263) and he specified the duties of each of the three sections: the first was concerned essentially with extraordinary affairs, while the second attended to the ordinary affairs, and the third, until then an independent body (the Chancery of Apostolic Briefs), had the duty of preparing and dispatching pontifical Briefs. With the apostolic constitution Regimini Ecclesiae universaePaul VI, Apostolic Constitution Regimini Ecclesiae Universae of 15 August 1967, Pope Paul VI reformed the Roman Curia, implementing the desire expressed by the bishops in the Second Vatican Council. This gave a new face to the Secretariat of State, suppressing the Chancery of Apostolic Briefs, formerly the third section, and transforming the former first section, the Sacred Congregation for the Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, into a body distinct from the Secretariat of State, though closely related to it, which was to be known as the Council for the Public Affairs of the Church. Structure On 28 June 1988, John Paul II promulgated the apostolic constitution Pastor bonus,Pope John Paul II (1998), Apostolic Constitution Pastor Bonus which introduced a reform of the Roman Curia and divided the Secretariat of State into two sections: the Section for General Affairs and the Section for Relations with States, which incorporated the Council for the Public Affairs of the Church. Pope Francis added a third unit, the Section for Diplomatic Staff, in November 2017. The head of the Secretariat of State is the Secretary of State, who is a cardinal. The Cardinal Secretary of State is primarily responsible for the diplomatic and political activity of the Holy See, in some circumstances representing the Pope himself. Section for General Affairs The Section for General Affairs handles the normal operations of the Church including organizing the activities of the Roman Curia, making appointments to curial offices, publishing official communications, papal documents, handling the concerns of embassies to the Holy See, and keeping the papal seal and Fisherman's Ring. Abroad, the Section for General Affairs is responsible for organizing the activities of nuncios around the world in their activities concerning the local church.Ibid, Articles 41‚Äì44 Substitute for General Affairs The Section for General Affairs is headed by an archbishop known as the Substitute for General Affairs, or more formally, Substitute for General Affairs to the Secretary of State. The current Substitute for General Affairs to the Secretary of State is Archbishop Edgar Pe√±a Parra. There have been 10 substitutes since 1953: *Nicola Canali (21 March 1908 ‚Äì 24 September 1914) *Federico Tedeschini (24 September 1914 ‚Äì 31 March 1921) *Giovanni Battista Montini (13 December 1937 ‚Äì 17 February 1953) (Later Pope Paul VI) *Angelo Dell'Acqua (17 February 1953 ‚Äì 29 June 1967) *Giovanni Benelli (29 June 1967 ‚Äì 3 June 1977) *Giuseppe Caprio (14 June 1977 ‚Äì 28 April 1979) *Eduardo Mart√≠nez Somalo (5 May 1979 ‚Äì 23 March 1988) *Edward Idris Cassidy (23 March 1988 ‚Äì 12 December 1989) *Giovanni Battista Re (12 December 1989 ‚Äì 16 September 2000) *Leonardo Sandri (16 September 2000 ‚Äì 1 July 2007) *Fernando Filoni (1 July 2007 ‚Äì 10 May 2011) *Giovanni Angelo Becciu (10 May 2011 ‚Äì 29 June 2018) *Edgar Pe√±a Parra (15 October 2018 - present) Assessor for General Affairs of the Secretariat of State The deputy to the Substitute for General Affairs, effectively deputy chief of staff, is called the Assessor for General Affairs of the Secretariat of State.

In 1814, Pope Pius VII gave this office responsibility for negotiations with all governments, renaming it the Extraordinary Congregation for the Ecclesiastical Affairs of the Catholic World (). Some years later, Pope Leo XII changed its name to the Sacred Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs (), which remained its title until 1967 when Pope Paul VI separated this body from the Secretariat of State, calling it the Council for the Public Affairs of the Church. This Council was later replaced by the present Section for Relations with States. Responsibilities The Section is responsible for the Holy See's interactions with civil governments. According to the relevant articles of the apostolic constitution Pastor bonus,Ibid, Articles 45‚Äì47 the responsibilities of the Secretary for Relations with States are: * for the Holy See's diplomatic relations with states, including the establishment of concordats or similar agreements; * for the Holy See's presence in international organizations and conferences such as the United Nations; * in special circumstances, by order of the Supreme Pontiff and in consultation with the competent dicasteries of the Curia, provides for appointments to particular Churches, and for their establishment or modification; * in close collaboration with the Congregation for Bishops, it attends to the appointment of bishops in countries which have entered into treaties or agreements with the Holy See in accordance with the norms of international law. Structure The Section is headed by an Archbishop, the Secretary for Relations with States, who reports to the Secretary of State. His staff includes a Prelate, the Under-Secretary for Relations with States, and is assisted by Cardinals and Bishops. The Secretary for Relations with States is often called the foreign minister of the Holy See, and the Under-Secretary is often called the deputy foreign minister. The current Secretary for Relations with States is Archbishop Paul Gallagher. The current Undersecretary for Relations with States is Francesca Di Giovanni, the first woman to hold this office. The current Delegate for Pontifical Representations is Archbishop Jan Paw≈Çowski and the current Head of Protocol is Monsignor Joseph Murphy. Section for Diplomatic Staff On 21 November 2017, via a communiqueCommuniqu√© of the Secretariat of State, 21.11.2017 of the Secretariat of State, it was announced that Pope Francis had created the Section for Diplomatic Staff, expanding the responsibilities of the Delegate for Pontifical Representations.

In the regional ductus, the last syllable of the name is stressed as \\"Sankt yo-Hahn'\\". History St. Johann is situated in the Leukental, which extends from Jochberg to the Streichen close to the Bavarian border. This region was already settled in the 4th century BC by a Celtic tribe, the Ambisontiers, who pursued copper mining in the surrounding mountains. In 15 BC the Romans conquered the Eastern Alpine region and the Leukental became part of the Roman province of Noricum. Following the downfall of the West Roman Empire in 476 AD the region went to the Duchy of Bavaria in the 7th century in the wake of the European migrations and as result of the settlement of the Germanic tribe of the Bavarii. In the following centuries the nobles of the House of Liuchinger, after whom the Leukental is named, established a county in the valley. The Liuchingers lived at Leukenstein Castle, which is located at the foot of the Niederkaiser. The exact site of the castle, which was also the judicial seat for the county, is no longer known today, but is recalled by the farm name of Burgwiesen (\\"castle meadows\\"). Following the extinction of the Liuchingers around 1170, their county ended up in the hands of the Falkensteins, but this noble family also died out after just 70 years and the county in the Leukental was subsequently ruled by officials representing the Bavarian dukes. In the 8th century (probably before 738), the missionaries built a Catholic church in the region of St. Johann, which was dedicated to St. John the Evangelist and who gave St. Johann its name. The church of St. Johannes was first mentioned in a document in the year 1150. In 1446, the bishops of Chiemsee were given the responsibility of the parish of St. Johann, from which time onwards it became their summer residence. The opening of the copper and silver mines in 1540 increased the wealth of St. Johann. The mines were located in the small hills, known as Rerobichl close to Oberndorf, which belonged to St. Johann. In the 17th century the Heilig-Geist-Schacht (\\"Holy Ghost Shaft\\") was the deepest shaft in the world, over deep. The mining of copper and silver continued until the 18th century. In 1875, the construction of the Gisela Railway linked St. Johann to the international railway network, with the result that the economy boomed and tourism began to take hold.  20th Century  In 1927, Oberndorf and St. Johann split and from this time onwards Oberndorf became a separate parish. In 1954, St. Johann received its own Coat of Arms; in 1956, St. Johann reached the elevated status of a market town. Geography=Location St. Johann lies in a valley basin between the mountain range of the Wilder Kaiser and mountain called the Kitzb√ºheler Horn in the centre of the district of Kitzb√ºhel.

With approximately 520,000 overnight stays per year, roughly evenly split between summer and winter, St. Johann is one of the major tourist resorts in the Tyrol. Its holiday infrastructure ranges from hotels to campsites and from restaurants to discoth√®ques. In recent decades, St. Johann has experienced an economic boom in trade, services and light industry and it has become the shopping centre for the district of Kitzb√ºhel. Many new firms have settled here, especially along the B 178 federal road, where they benefit from its central location. In addition, the opening of a pedestrian zone in the 1990s has improved the town centre, which receives an average of 20,000 visitors per day. Several firms are based in St. Johann, such as the headquarters of the Fritz Egger GmbH & Co, one of the best known chip board manufacturers in Europe. Today, the region around St. Johann in Tirol is one of the agricultural centres of Tyrol, despite its harsh climate and heavy precipitation. Agriculture in the wide basin of the St. Johann bowl has a great tradition as the former breadbasket of Tyrol and, even today, farming continues to play an important role. A relatively large number (for the Tyrol) of farms are established in the wide, level basin and on its fairly gently (with a few exceptions) slopes. According to Statistik Austria about a third of the farms are form the main source of income. These primary income farms use rather more than half the agricultural and forested land in the municipality. St. Johann in Tirol is an important tourist centre with impressive ski-slopes and related facilities. The ski resorts are especially populous starting after Christmas into early January. It is also popular in summer, especially with British, Irish and German tourists. Located near the Wilder Kaiser (Wild Emperor) mountains, the Kitzb√ºhler Horn dominates the town. It is well served by ski lifts and cable car.

Water supply and waste disposal  District heating pipes as plastic-sheathed composite tube by Logstor The market town has water supply, sewage and waste disposal systems that are organised by the parish council. In addition to electricity and natural gas there has also been an environmentally friendly district heating system since the end of 2008 which supplies the largest buildings in the village. Since December 2007 The St. Johann Village Heating Company (Ortsw√§rme St. Johann in Tirol GmbH) has supplied households, firms and public institutions in St. Johann in Tirol with district heating. The firm is 74% owned by the parish of St. Johann in Tirol and 26% by the firm of Fritz Egger. The head office is in Bahnhofstra√üe 5, in the parish office. The heating company does not have its own energy generation with the exception of backup and peak-load boilers in the centre of the village. The energy is generated by the Egger factory from waste heat and biomass in conjunction with an absorption heat pump and is transferred at the boundary of the factory site into the district heating network. At the end of 2009 around 400 buildings and 1,300 households in St. Johann were heated by district heating. These include the district hospital, the barracks, the schools, traders, single and multi- family homes. A total of about of routing, or (double) of piping has been laid. In 2009, of heating was purchased, that corresponds to an oil consumption of about per year. In the medium term the introduction of district heating in St. Johann will save about 12,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually in the village centre. To read the heat meters and to visualize the individual house systems, an optical fibre was laid as part of the installation of the heating district network.

It is located on the southwest side of the city. Its community neighbors include Gage Park, West Englewood, Ashburn, and West Lawn. It is bounded by Bell Avenue on the east, Central Park Avenue on the west, 59th Street on the north, and 75th Street on the south, and is southwest of the Loop. Local citizens refer to the area as \\"Marquette Park,\\" after the park in its center. History John F. Eberhart, the father of Chicago Lawn The city of Chicago Lawn was founded by John F. Eberhart in 1871. Although it was annexed by the city of Chicago in 1889, it remained mostly farmland with some scattered settlements until the 1920s. Between 1920 and 1930 the population increased from 14,000 to 47,000. Residents of German and Irish descent began to move into the area from the Back of the Yards and Englewood neighborhoods. Poles, Bohemians, and Lithuanians followed them. Most new residents belonged to various Protestant denominations, but Chicago Lawn also was home to many Roman Catholic churches and schools. Today, there are six Catholic institutions that make up the Marquette Park Catholic Campus Council. Chicago Lawn was a thriving urban neighborhood as the Depression hit the nation and by 1940 its population had reached 49,291. In 1941, the National Biscuit Company announced plans to build a huge bakery in Chicago Lawn. When completed, this was the largest bakery in one location in the world. The size of the facility was doubled in the late 1990s. The Lithuanian community has maintained a notable presence in the area by establishing a network of institutions that earned their community the label as the Lithuanian Gold Coast. They formed some of the richest savings and loans in the city. The Lithuanian Sisters of Saint Casimir founded Holy Cross Hospital in 1928 and Maria High School in 1952 (originally established as St. Casimir Academy in 1911). The Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church was established in 1927 on the corner of 69th Street and Washtenaw Avenue. It was founded as a Lithuanian national parish and services are still held in Lithuanian. An Art Deco monument was erected by Chicago's Lithuanian community in Marquette Park commemorating Lithuanian pilots Stasys Girƒónas and Steponas Darius who died in the crash of the Lituanica in 1933. Racial issues Chicago's changing racial demographics had a profound impact on Chicago Lawn. In the 1960s many of the white Americans had fled Englewood & West Englewood and Chicago Lawn became a target for civil rights groups' open housing marches during the Civil Rights Movement. In 1966, as part of the Chicago Freedom Movement, Martin Luther King Jr. led a march into Marquette Park, where the marchers met a violent reaction. King himself was hit by a rock. Violence also erupted in the neighborhood when Gage Park High School attempted to integrate after Brown v. Board of Education (1954). The primary resistance to integration came from fear of declining property values by people who put their life savings into their homes and disruption of ethnic bonds, especially for the Lithuanians. Despite that, the 1990 Census still showed Non-Hispanic whites as the largest demographic group by race comprising 43% of the population. However, over the next decade the racial composition of the neighborhood changed radically and by the 2000 Census African Americans had become the largest racial group comprising 53% of the population, with Hispanic and Non-Hispanic whites groups accounting for 35% and 10% respectively. There are also black Jewish and Palestinian communities in the neighborhood. Some Irish, Poles, and Lithuanians still remain too, although most have moved further south and west. Many of the Lithuanians and Poles have reestablished their communities in Lemont. Arabs and Islamic community By the 1920s Arabs immigrated to Chicago, and political turmoil in the decades following the 1948 creation of Israel brought more Palestinian Muslims to Chicago. Arab families live in Chicago Lawn and Gage Park Neighborhoods. Arab community founded Chicago Islamic Center and Mosque on 63rd. Many Middle Eastern store and restaurant near Mosque area. Arab families come from Palestine, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. In the 1950s, Palestinians with families moved out of their boardinghouses and shops and into apartments and homes just west of Chicago's \\"Black Belt.\\" By the 1970s, they formed a concentrated residential community in Gage Park and Chicago Lawn, on the South Side, and had established a business district with stores catering to Arab clientele. Chicago's largest concentration of Palestinians still lives in these areas and in the communities to the south and west of them. In the 1980s, many upwardly mobile Palestinian families moved to the southwest suburbs, bringing significant Palestinian and Arab populations to Bridgeview, Alsip, Oak Lawn, Hickory Hills, Palos Hills. Alsalm Mosque Foundation is small place to worship, Palestinians built new Mosque Foundation in 1982 in Bridgeview.

Street was often accompanied to the ring by his long-time manager and wife Miss Linda, and the two worked primarily as villains. Early life Born in Brynmawr in Brecknockshire, Street's family was in the coal mining business ‚Äì his father was a miner for 51 years. In his teenage years, he began bodybuilding. He left home at age 16 and began his professional wrestling career in 1957. His early inspirations were American wrestlers Lou Thesz, Buddy Rogers and Don Leo Jonathan (from whom Street adopted his first moniker, Kid Tarzan Jonathan). Professional wrestling career Street was trained as a professional wrestler by Chic Osmond and Mike Demitre. His first professional wrestling match was on 8 August 1957. Using the name Kid Tarzan Jonathan, Street defeated Geoff Moran. Later in his career, he developed his \\"Exotic\\" Adrian Street image, an outrageously- attired, effeminate character who was hinted but never outright-stated to be gay. Street has explained that this gimmick was born by accident as a result of him playing up to taunting from an audience one evening, commenting \\"I was getting far more reaction than I'd ever got just playing this poof. My costumes started getting wilder\\". His wrestling attire evolved to including pastels and glitter make up and clipping his bleached hair into mini-pigtails. As \\"The Exotic One\\" his signature move in the ring was to kiss opponents to escape being pinned down and to put make up on his opponents when they were disabled. He also sang several glam rock songs, such as \\"Sweet Transvestite With A Broken Nose\\" and \\"Imagine What I Could Do To You\\"; the latter being his entrance music. Working primarily as a heel, Street travelled all over the world including wrestling in Germany, Canada and Mexico. In the UK, he formed a tag partnership with fellow heel Bobby Barnes named the Hells Angels. In 1969 Street met his future manager/valet and real-life wife Miss Linda (Linda Gunthorpe Hawker). During the 1970s, Linda wrestled in Britain as Blackfoot Sue. Later in America, the two formed a double-act, Miss Linda becoming one of professional wrestling's first female valets and frequently participating as an accomplice to Street's in-ring shenanigans. Street and Linda appeared in various areas in the independent wrestling circuit in North America, and finally settled in Ron Fuller's Continental Championship Wrestling (CCW) in Birmingham, Alabama in 1985. He worked early on as a heel against Austin Idol, Wendall Cooley and Norvell Austin before turning face in 1986. Street was so convincing as a heel that fans stood in shock as Street saved Bob Armstrong, under a mask as the Bullet, from an attack by Robert Fuller, Jimmy Golden and Tom Prichard. Street had a long feud there with \\"The Hustler,\\" Rip Rogers. He returned to the area shortly before it closed in summer, 1989, teaming with Bill Dundee and Todd Morton against \\"RPM\\" Mike Davis and a young Masahiro Chono, as well as a feud against Terry Garvin (Terry Sims) and his partner, Marc Guleen, known as Beauty and the Beast. After retiring from full-time in- ring work, Street ran the Skull Krushers Wrestling School in Gulf Breeze, Florida, until being forced to close doors following severe damage from Hurricane Ivan. Street and Linda also went into business designing and selling professional wrestling gear and other sundries via their website. He created the ring gear worn by Mick Foley as Dude Love during his feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin. In 2005, Street appeared at WrestleReunion in a battle royal for the IWA Heavyweight Championship, which was won by Greg Valentine. That same year, he began wrestling for NWA Wrestle Birmingham, where he actively wrestled until the promotion ceased operations in 2014. After his last match on June 14, 2014, in Birmingham Alabama, Street estimated that during his career he had wrestled between 12,000 and 15,000 matches.

At one time it was known as South Lynne. The boundaries of West Englewood are Garfield Blvd to the north, Racine Ave to the east, the CSX and Norfolk Southern RR tracks to the west, and the Belt Railway of Chicago to the south.Chicago Area Geographic Information Study, Community Area Map request, http://www.cagis.uic.edu/demographics/camapreq2.html Cited September 14, 2009 Though it is a separate community area, much of the history and culture of the neighborhood is linked directly to the Englewood neighborhood. Early history The first European settlers to the area that developed as West Englewood were predominantly German and Swedish farmers who arrived in the 1840s.Encyclopedia of Chicago, \\"West Englewood\\", 2005, Available online at http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1337.html, Cited September 14, 2009 After construction of rail lines for the Rock Island and Wabash Railroads, the area became known as Chicago Junction, which soon changed to Junction Grove. This is commemorated today with the Junction Grove Playlot Park, which is maintained by the Chicago Park District.Chicago Park District; http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/parks.detail/object_id/4E837E07-97F2-48DD-97E8-E36C6B38CCBA.cfm By 1865, Junction Grove became the unincorporated town of Lake, which was later renamed Englewood. Two events led to population increases for the Englewood and West Englewood neighorhoods. In 1871 the Great Chicago Fire destroyed many neighborhoods to the north. The combination of open spaces for housing and the presence of railroad lines made these neighborhoods ideal for Chicagoans looking for less crowding and moving from the urban center destroyed in the fire. In 1889 the neighborhoods of Englewood and West Englewood became part of the City of Chicago after the town of Lake was annexed by the city. With annexation came Chicago street cars, the second factor to encourage development. In 1903 the Englewood Elevated Railway Company built a branch running roughly along 63rd Street to Loomis, which was connected to the South Side Elevated Railroad.Chicago \\"L\\".org, \\"The Original L Companies\\", online at http://www.chicago-l.org/history/4line.html, Cited September 15, 2009 These improvements in transportation made the Englewood area an easy commute for workers traveling north to the stockyards, a major employer, and downtown. Economic and racial change At the same time that hundreds of thousands of European immigrants were coming to Chicago, where unskilled labor jobs in the stockyards and steelmills enabled them to support families, blacks from the rural South started migrating to the industrial city. Beginning during World War I, when they replaced workers who were drafted, blacks migrated to the city in great number before 1940. They were escaping oppressive social and political conditions: a high rate of lynchings, disfranchisement across the South that prevented them from voting, segregated education in underfunded systems, and legal racial segregation. Initially, they competed with immigrants primarily for unskilled jobs and housing; blacks were restricted by discrimination in housing practices to narrow areas of older housing on the South Side, known as the Black Belt. European immigrants and ethnic whites dominated separate territories on the South Side: the Irish, Polish, Italians and others had their own centers of population which they protected against each other and against blacks. According to statistics compiled by the Encyclopedia of Chicago, the West Englewood area had 63,845 residents in 1930, 98% of whom were white and almost 23% foreign born. It reached its peak population in 1940, with more than 64,000 residents. Industrial restructuring after World War II led to the massive loss of jobs that residents had depended on: the stockyard operations were moved west, first to Kansas City, Kansas, and eventually the good-paying jobs in the steelmills also shifted out of the region. Railroads also restructured, causing more loss of union jobs among both whites and African Americans. In 1960 the median income was close to the Chicago median income, $6,738 ($ adjusted for inflation), and 12% of the residents were black. During the 1960s and after, advances in civil rights opened more areas of housing to blacks, and they followed other Americans into the further reaches of the city, settling in West Englewood and other southern neighborhoods. The changes in industry, however, meant that skilled workers could no longer achieve middle- class lives. Although union jobs were no longer racially restricted, fewer were to be had. Many workers left the area to seek employment, and neighborhoods declined in population and services. Other residents moved further out into suburban towns to seek newer housing. By 2000 due to the loss of jobs, the population of West Englewood had dropped to 45,282. By that time, with demographic changes, 98% of residents were black. According to the 2000 census, only 1% of the population was foreign born. Late 20th-century immigrants have been primarily from Latin America and Asia, and have created concentrated settlements in other neighborhoods.

It is situated along the north bank of the Charles River in Cambridge and consists of McKinlock Hall, constructed in 1925; two 12-story towers completed in 1960; and two floors of 20 DeWolfe Street, a building Leverett shares with two other houses at Harvard. It has the largest student population within the Harvard house system. Structure McKinlock Courtyard The bulk of McKinlock Hall consists of 5 entryways (labeled A through E), each of which leads to four or five floors of suites for approximately 35 students. McKinlock houses the Leverett Dining Hall, the Junior and Senior Common Rooms, the Old Library Theatre, the Faculty Dean's Residence, and several other common spaces. The Leverett Towers (commonly referred to as F- and G-Tower, corresponding to their respective entryway labels) serve a primarily residential function. Each tower consists primarily of singles and doubles and holds approximately 150 students. The top floors of the towers - especially those facing south - boast outstanding views of the Boston skyline and the Charles River. The ground floor of G-Tower features a common area that house residents have nicknamed the \\"G-spot,\\" although the space goes largely unused due to its poor design. The ground floor of F-tower includes a common area similar to the one found in G-Tower, as well as several offices belonging to the Allston Burr Resident Dean and House Administrator. Between the towers and McKinlock sits the Leverett Library, which was constructed along with the towers and has won awards for its innovative design. The ground floor of the library building houses the building manager's office. The top floors of 20 DeWolfe Street were annexed by the house in fall of 2007. Originally intended for faculty or graduate students, the DeWolfe suites are smaller apartment- style units with more modern amenities than those available in either McKinlock or Leverett Towers. History Leverett House was named after John Leverett (whose grandfather, John Leverett had been the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony), who was President of Harvard from 1708 to 1724. Leverett's election was one of the significant turning points for Harvard, for every President before him had been a clergyman. Leverett was a leader of the liberal movement in the Congregational Church and he opposed the powerful clergymen Increase Mather and Cotton Mather, who had attempted to impose upon the College a new charter containing a loyalty oath that would have refused appointment to the faculty of anyone not willing to acknowledge the primacy of Biblical scripture. Leverett, during his tenure as president, improved the quality of instruction in the College, and maintained the position of Harvard in the critical years when Yale was becoming a formidable rival. Leverett F-Tower, with the house library in the foreground In the mid-1920s, Harvard constructed student residences on the banks of the recently dammed Charles River. These residences were initially occupied by freshmen. McKinlock Hall, built in 1925, was one of those original buildings. The building was donated by the family of Lieutenant George Alexander McKinlock Jr, a Harvard graduate who was killed by a German machine gun near Soissons in 1918. With the formation of Leverett House in 1930-31, Mather Hall, across Mill Street, was built along with the present dining hall and Master's residence. Six squash courts were also constructed, adjacent to Mather Hall. Leverett remained in that configuration until the early 1960s, when the College expanded and new Houses were added. Mather Hall became a part of Quincy House, the squash courts were lost, and the Leverett Towers were built. The Saltonstall family gave money for a new library in honor of the ten generations of Saltonstalls who had attended Harvard, and the House offices moved to the first floor of F-Tower. Shepley, Bulfinch, Richardson and Abbott designed the two-story library, as well as the two twelve-story Leverett Towers that were constructed at the same time. In 1983, McKinlock was renovated, and at that time a new entrance to the dining hall was constructed. The first Master of the House was Kenneth Murdock, Professor of English and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The second Master was Leigh Hoadley, an embryologist and professor of zoology. Hoadley resigned in 1957, shortly before Leverett was to be renovated. The third Master was John J. Conway, a scholar of Canadian history. He married his wife Jill, who was a graduate student in Harvard's history department at the time, in the early 1960s. The fourth Master was Richard T. Gill, an economist. A bass singer, Gill sang each year in the Leverett House Opera, which was a fixture in the House. While Master, he auditioned for the New York City Opera and was offered a contract. He accepted and left Harvard, economics, and Leverett to begin a new career, first with the New York City Opera, and later with the Metropolitan Opera. The fifth Co-Masters, Kenneth Andrews and Carolyn Andrews, were appointed in 1971. During their tenure, the Houses became coeducational. Andrews was a professor at Harvard Business School and the first Business School faculty member to be appointed Master. During Harvard's 350th anniversary celebration in 1986, Andrews was one of 20 individuals who received a Harvard Medal for distinguished service to the University. His citation read: \\"He understands, as Mark Twain never did, how business works best; his writings elucidate the complex subject to the benefit of his Harvard colleagues and of managers everywhere.\\" Renowned biologist John E. Dowling and his wife Judith were appointed as the sixth Co-Masters of Leverett House in 1981 and served until 1998. The seventh Faculty Deans, Howard Georgi and his wife Ann, were appointed in 1998 and served until 2018. Howard and Ann, more commonly known as Chief and Coach respectively, are beloved for their house pride, their dogs, and monkey bread, a delicious cinnamon-flavored treat popular among Leverett students. Brian D. Farrell and Irina Ferreras were appointed as the eighth Faculty Deans in 2018. Farrell is a professor of biology and curator of entomology at the Museum of Comparative Zoology. Ferreras is a curatorial assistant at the Harvard University Herbaria. In their first year as Faculty Deans, they have supported the appreciation of art and nature by inviting Brazilian artist to exhibit his works and by hosting nature walks for students. People Notable alumni of Leverett House include Aga Khan IV, Colin Jost, Timothy Crouse, Andrew Glaze, Al Jean, Anthony Lake, Steven Levitt, Jeremy Lin, Saul Perlmutter, Mike Reiss, Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Sydney Schanberg, Pete Seeger, Laurence Tribe, John Weidman, Cornel West, and Pete Buttigieg. Yo-Yo Ma was a music tutor for the house. Archibald MacLeish, Perry Miller, and Lillian Hellman lived on the top of F-Tower. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan, both cabinet officials in the Obama Administration, also resided in Leverett during their times at Harvard. House symbols The House Shield is a derivative of the ancient Leverett family crest depicting three hares rampant with an inverted chevron. The family name is derived from the word \\"leveret\\" (with one \\"t\\"), which means young hare; family tradition has it that the earliest recorded family members were keepers of ferrets, which were trained to chase rabbits from their burrows. The official house colors are black and yellow, appearing on the earliest House paraphernalia that can be found. However, the combinations of black and red as well as green and yellow are often used. Annual T-shirt designs usually feature some combination of those four colors. Leverett House has a sister house at Yale, Timothy Dwight College.

Several variants of fantasy wrestling exist which may be differentiated by the way they are transmitted (through websites, message boards, e-mail, postal mail, face-to-face, etc.), the method in which the storyline is determined, (via roleplay, \\"angles\\", strategy- or statistics- based systems, etc.) and how the roster is composed (are characters created by the players, are real wrestlers \\"imported\\" into the game, etc.). Fantasy wrestling's roots lie in the play-by-mail wrestling games often featured in professional wrestling magazines that became prominent in the mid-to-late 1980s during one of professional wrestling's boom periods. By the late 1980s, fantasy wrestling games had started to appear on the Internet. In the early 1990s, the advent of national bulletin board services like Prodigy, AOL, and Compuserve allowed players to use e-mail and bulletin boards to more easily trade information and post roleplays. As technology progressed and the internet evolved, fantasy wrestling enthusiasts took advantage, using websites and newsgroups to connect and build broader communities for gameplay. History and progression=Creation of character(s) In order to begin fantasy wrestling, one must create a custom character. Some people will elect to use pro-wrestlers over their own, custom characters; this can be either allowed or rejected by the administrator of the federation. Usually, one will decide the following: physical appearance (height, weight, sex; these can be copied through \\"renders\\" - images of pro-wrestlers - or through their imagination/CAW mechanics through wrestling games), moveset (style, signature moves, finishing moves, etc.), fan reaction (heel or face; booed or cheered), and entrance music. Once this is all decided, the character is named and the player can begin to promo in the federation. Some players create multiple characters, either for choice for playing or to freshen the experience/start new. Play-by-mail Early versions of the game began in the 1980s using play-by-mail formats. Based on the moves and any strategies applied the adjudicator would then decide the outcome. Play-by-mail leagues often included a 'pay to play' model where handlers paid a fee per match and/or 'strategy' applied. The later expansion into email was a natural progression, often using the same mechanics as the pbm format. Internet email play In the late 1980s, e-wrestling got started on the Internet, played by email and often advertised via Usenet, including rec.games.pbm and rec.games.frp.There is a Usenet posting dating to Nov. 1990 advertising for a play by email wrestling league. https://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.pbm/browse_thread/thread/858e739be2a9be36/7f8dd468379b5506?lnk=gst&q;=wrestling#7f8dd468379b5506 retrieved 6 Feb. 2013 The early games followed the model of a simplified role- playing game with \\"combat systems\\" of varying complexity, resolved by the Federation Head, or \\"Fedhead.\\" The role-playing aspect was significant and the fast turn-around of email allowed for collaboration in the creation of \\"promos\\" and the formation of tag-teams and \\"stables\\" made up of multiple players. The term e-wrestling was coined about this time, probably by Scott Baxter, since there were enough federations active to require a collective noun.https://sites.google.com/site/totalprowrestling/home/summit-background retrieved 17 May 2016 By 1989, there was enough activity for a dedicated Usenet group, rec.sports.pro-wrestling.fantasy, to be created.http://rspw.org/faq/999-funkymfuq.txt retrieved 17 May 2016 Email play persisted, as was still common enough in 1995 to rate the occasional mention in annual reviews, although not always favourably. Online bulletin boards Fantasy wrestling expanded in the early 1990s with the rise of nationwide message boards based on PRODIGY, AOL and Compuserve. Originally connected to message boards focused on professional and amateur wrestling, fantasy wrestling's popularity caused specific subforums to be created on PRODIGY's Wrestling BB and AOL's Grandstand. The games based on the online boards had some differences from the federations operating on the Internet via email and Usenet. Many stat-based systems found ways to integrate roleplay as a factor into determining match winners, paralleling similar developments in some of the Internet email federations. Eventually, roleplay became the primary factor for many leagues. The Web As the previously isolated message board services began to connect to the Internet, the disparate communities began to overlap, and much of the activity began to migrate to the World Wide Web. The use of roleplay and promos became a larger factor in the operation of many leagues and determining results. The first websites featuring fantasy wrestling began to pop up as the World Wide Web started to develop. An early example was \\"The Wild World of e-Wrestling,\\" which was devoted to the Internet-based games,\\"The Web Magazine\\" (print), October/November 1996, reviews, p. 68;an archived version of the site still exists, http://ewrestling.avigne.org and ‚ÄúFW Central,‚Äù a site devoted to the PRODIGY-based fantasy wrestling community based on PRODIGY. These sites offered new places for players to interact and expand the hobby, providing online news and resources. As the web matured, so did sites devoted to the hobby. The various federations, which had been exclusively text-based, or nearly so, began to integrate Poser images of created wrestlers, animated videos, audio shows, and vlogs. Current Fantasy wrestling continues to evolve. Traditionally, most roleplays (referred to as \\"promos\\") revolved around more traditional pro-wrestling topics, focused on trash talking an opponent and hyping an upcoming match, although extensive storylines existed, and gag advertising was fairly common. Longer form roleplay has continued to gain in popularity, resulting in detailed stories and arcs. However, roleplay is not the only form of fantasy wrestling currently available. There are also federations based around angles and booking, there are turn-based sites that allow you and an opponent to alternate between different parts of the match until a moderator decides who wins. Another niche is match-writing federations. Seen as one of the more challenging types, match-writing federations require you to write your match against your opponents and the winner's match is seen as canon. Stat or dice based federations continue to thrive, as well, sometimes deliberately harkening back to the earlier days of the hobby. Another method of fantasy wrestling currently used is called \\"E-Fedding\\" (a slang term for E-Federations, internet groups that identify as fictional companies). Individuals roleplay with promos, written similar to a screenplay of a movie, and the moderators/administrators of the forum/group decide the winner(s) based on the promos written, storylines in play/building, along with other factors that may present themselves. On Facebook, several E-Federations can be found. Some players have created social media accounts now to live out the lives of their characters in ways a typical roleplay could not show. In the now shutdown social media website Google+, users would create communities for Fantasy Wrestling role-play. Often, these communities involved the community members voting for who they deemed winner of the fantasy matches. The members of the community would choose the victor based on which participant in the match made the better promo in their opinions. These wrestling role-play communities became very popular among wrestling fans on Google+. With the biggest community, named World Wrestling Role-play (WWR), having over 800 members. Pro wrestling companies in fantasy wrestling In 2004, World Wrestling Entertainment began its own fantasy wrestling game focused on selecting WWE Superstars as part of a team and receiving points based on their involvement on the WWE television shows. WWE singled out \\"real wrestling\\" E-Feds who used the names and likenesses of WWE Superstars and began sending them cease-and-desist letters. WWE later disbanded its fantasy wrestling game. Between 2005 and 2006, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling also operated their own fantasy wrestling game. The game operated from the promotion's message boards and was based on real wrestlers. The game never gained notoriety and was removed along with the message boards from the promotion's website in late 2006. In June 2011, TNA relaunched their fantasy wrestling game as a part of their Impact Wrestling campaign.

World Wrestling Entertainment (2004-2006) Thomas and Heartbreaker, now going by Romeo Roselli, joined World Wrestling Entertainment's developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling in 2004, though Roselli wasn't officially signed to a WWE developmental contract until February 2005. Renamed \\"The Heart Throbs\\" and going simply by Antonio and Romeo respectively, they made their WWE debut on the April 18, 2005 episode of Raw, losing to World Tag Team Champions William Regal and Tajiri. They participated in a tag-team turmoil match for the World Tag Team Championship at Backlash 2005, but were defeated once again. The Heart Throbs mainly appeared on the Raw B-show, Heat. They had short-lived feuds with Eugene and William Regal, The Hurricane and Rosey, and Val Venis and Viscera. In 2006, the Heart Throbs gained a great deal of fan reaction and began entertaining the crowd by bringing two \\"hot chicks\\" into the ring and getting them to dance. During a WWE Unlimited webcast the Heart Throbs were sitting with the fans and they ended up being on its \\"Kiss Cam\\" segment, each kissing a girl sitting near them. Both Thomas and Roselli were released by WWE on February 10, 2006. Independent circuit (2006-present) Since their release, they have been active on the independent wrestling scene.

Originally comprising guitarists Danny Amis (formerly of the Raybeats), Eddie Angel and drummer L. J. \\"Jimmy\\" Lester under the name The Straitjackets, the band split up soon after forming, but reunited as Los Straitjackets in 1994 with the addition of bassist E. Scott Esbeck. Esbeck left the band in 1998 and was replaced by Pete Curry. The current lineup also features Greg Townson on guitar and Chris Sprague on drums. The band has released fourteen studio albums, four collaboration albums and eight live albums. History Eddie Angel was a noted rockabilly guitarist who moved to Nashville in the early 1980s to record and perform with the Planet Rockers. Danny Amis recorded and performed with the Raybeats, then worked as a sound engineer in Nashville. The two formed The Straitjackets in 1988 with Jimmy Lester, a Nashville session player who had worked and toured with Robert Gordon. They played several gigs during the summer of that year, but soon broke up. In 1994 they reformed as Los Straitjackets, adding bass player Scott Esbeck. Their first album, The Utterly Fantastic and Totally Unbelievable Sound of Los Straitjackets, was released the following year on Upstart Records. In the post-Pulp Fiction surf revival, the group began attracting a following, though their music is not entirely surf-oriented. Over the next few years, the band developed a cult following through its tight instrumentation and stage shows. In its live performances, band members dress in identical black suits, gold Aztec medallions, and personalized Mexican wrestling masks. Danny Amis, a fan of Luchador films and Mexican culture had suggested the band wear the masks he had purchased in Mexico at the band's first gig on a whim; the crowd went wild and a tradition was born. Frontman Amis (aka \\"Daddy-O Grande\\") was the sole spokesperson of the band, and would introduce the songs in fast, heavily accented Spanish. In 1998 Esbeck left the band during the recording of The Velvet Touch of Los Straitjackets and was replaced by Pete Curry, formerly of the Halibuts, a 1980s surf-revival group. In 2005 Lester left and was replaced by Jason \\"Teen Beat\\" Smay. They have become known as frequent collaborators, recording Sing Along with Los Straitjackets with a number of different artists. They were nominated for a Grammy Award for their collaboration with blues singer Eddy Clearwater, Rock 'N' Roll City. Their stage shows have become more elaborate and frequently feature choreography, guest vocalists such as Eddy \\"The Chief\\" Clearwater, Kaiser George of the Scottish band the Kaisers, Big Sandy, and the burlesque dancing troupe The World Famous Pontani Sisters. In recent years, they have staged festive Christmas shows during the holiday season. In 2010 Danny Amis was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. He was sidelined from recording and touring while under treatment. Los Straitjackets recruited guitarist Greg \\"Gregorio El Grande\\" Townson to fill Amis' role during his absence. In 2012 Amis announced that his cancer was \\"under control\\" and he would return to recording and limited touring with Los Straitjackets in September 2012. This coincided with the band's new studio release Jet Set and debut of new drummer Chris \\"Sugar Balls\\" Sprague. Amis now lives in Mexico City. In late 2016, Los Straitjackets were due to embark on a tour with NRBQ. Prior to the tour, Pete Curry had to undergo shoulder replacement surgery. While he was recovering, his replacements consisted of Eddie's son, Max, Todd Bradley of the Hi-Risers, and Juan Ugalde of The Outta Sites. On May 19, 2017, the band released What's So Funny About Peace, Love And..., a tribute to the music of Nick Lowe, on Yep Roc Records. In 2019 the band embarked on a UK tour backing Lowe. Their February 2019 single with Lowe, \\"Love Starvation,\\" was described by Rolling Stone magazine as \\"a peppy-sounding old-school rock song that paints a bleak lyrical picture of romantic fallout.\\" Lowe said of the band: \\"Apart from being a fantastic rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll band, they know how to play tons of different styles really well. They can knock you out a version of Bacharach and David's \\"The Look of Love\\" with no trouble at all.\\" Film and television Los Straitjackets provided some of the music for the independent film Psycho Beach Party, and appeared briefly in the film. They also recorded two albums of music specifically for television and commercial use, and their work is often heard as filler or background music on radio and television shows. In the late 1990s, Conan O'Brien had the band perform Christmas music each holiday season on his late-night television program.

Along with Harvard's pension assets, working capital, and non-cash gifts, it is managed by Harvard Management Company, Inc. (HMC), a Harvard-owned investment management company. Harvard Management Company HMC employs financial professionals to manage the approximately 12,000 funds that constitute the endowment. The company directly manages about one third of the total endowment portfolio while working closely with the external companies that manage the rest. HMC is headed by a professional, who holds the titles of president and chief executive officer of the company. HMC is a 501(c)(3) non-profit entity and is so exempt from federal income taxation.  Past Management  Jack Meyer managed HMC from 1990 to September 30, 2005, beginning with an endowment worth $4.8 billion and ending with a value of $25.9 billion (including new contributions). During the last decade of his tenure, the endowment earned an annualized return of 15.9%. In part after compensation disagreements, a number of HMC managers including Meyer himself left to form their own investment management firms. Bloomberg in 2011 reviewed a group of the resultant firms‚ÄîAdage Capital Management LP, Charlesbank Capital Partners LLC, Convexity Capital Management LP (Meyer's), Highfields Capital Management LP and Regiment Capital Advisors LLC‚Äîwhich at that time between them managed $43 billion in assets.Wee, Gillian, \\"Harvard's Crimson Cubs With $43 Billion Dwarf Their Former Endowment Home\\", Bloomberg, March 2, 2011.

He came from the bond trading company PIMCO and pledged to \\"rebuild and reinvent\\" the company. He announced his leaving September 12, 2007, to return to PIMCO after guiding the endowment to a one-year return of 23%. Jane Mendillo was named the new head of HMC, effective July 1, 2008. She had been Wellesley College‚Äôs chief investment officer since 2002. Prior to that, she served as vice president for external management at HMC. A 1984 graduate of Yale University followed by an MBA from Yale School of Management, Mendillo first joined HMC as an equities analyst in 1987. Her tenure was largely shaped by the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010, with a cash squeeze in University operation and endowment performance, a shrinkage of endowment asset value, and errant interest rate, financial derivatives and leveraged positions, according to a Feb. 2009 news report. Staff of HMC was trimmed 25%, or by about 50 people, in line with shrinkage of about $8 billion (about 22%). A source for the report said that some of the positions in the endowment which had to be liquidated were in hedge funds run by Meyer's Convexity Capital and Seth Klarman's Baupost Group.Fabrikant, Geraldine, \\"Endowment Director Is on Harvard‚Äôs Hot Seat\\", The New York Times, Feb. 20, 2009.

Bicknell and others in front of Dr. John Clarke's grave in Newport (from Bicknell's \\"Story of Dr. John Clarke\\") Thomas W. Bicknell (September 6, 1834 ‚Äì 1925) was an American educator, historian, and author. Early life and career Thomas Williams Bicknell was born in Barrington, Rhode Island to Harriet Byron Kinnicutt (1 September 1791 - 15 December 1837), daughter of Josiah Kinnicutt and Rebecca Townsend Kinnicutt, and Rhode Island minister and Senator, Lt.-Col. Allin Bicknell (13 April 1787 - 16 August 1870), who had served with the Bristol County, Rhode Island Militia.Bicknell, T. W. History and genealogy of the Bicknell family and some collateral lines, of Normandy, Great Britain and America. Comprising some ancestors and many descendants of Zachary Bicknell from Barrington, Somersetshire, England, 1635 by Thomas Williams Bicknell; USA; 1913, p. 173. Thomas Bicknell attended Thetford Academy in Vermont and Amherst College in Massachusetts, taught school and became principal in Rehoboth, Massachusetts, then principal in Elgin, Illinois. When he returned to Rehoboth, serving as principal once again, he earned a master's degree from Brown University. While a senior at Brown he was elected State Representative in the Rhode Island General Assembly. After graduating from Brown, he became principal of Bristol High School and then Arnold Street Grammar School, then back to Bristol High School. Rhode Island Governor Seth Padelford (Republican 1869‚Äì1873) selected Bicknell to be the Commissioner of Public Schools in 1869. As commissioner he focused on re-establishing the Normal School (now Rhode Island College). He was a gifted speaker and fundraiser, who would triple the amount of money spent on public education; he also established a Rhode Island State Board of Education, oversaw the selection of school superintendents in every town and city in the state, dedicated over 50 new schoolhouses, and increased the school year from 27 to 35 weeks. Civil rights reformer In the 1850s Bicknell signed on to help settle the State of \\"Free Kansas\\" to prevent the spread of slavery. On the way to Kansas he was taken hostage by bandits on the Missouri River, but after two weeks as a prisoner, sharpshooters set him adrift. Bicknell was an equaligist, a racial and sexual reformer, an early advocate to end Black segregation in schools; he also helped elect the United States' first all-female school board for the town of Tiverton, Rhode Island. Heritage and legacy Bicknell joined the Rhode Island Society of the Sons of the American Revolution in 1896 and was the founder of the National Society of the Sons and Daughters of the Pilgrims and Order of the Founders and Patriots of America (1898). He re-established, and was the president of, the American Institute of Instruction, and was president of the Rhode Island Institute of Instruction and the National Educational Association. He was the president of the New England Publishing Company. In 1914, wanting to have a town named for him, he offered a 1000-volume library to any town in Utah that would adopt his name. Two towns vied for the prize, Grayson and Thurber; the two towns compromised and in 1916 Thurber changed its name to Bicknell, and Grayson took the name of Blanding, the maiden name of Bicknell's wife. The towns then split the library with 500 books to each. Bicknell and his wife, Amelia, donated $500 to the Rehoboth Antiquarian Society in Rehoboth, to establish the Blanding Public Library in memory of Amelia's parents, Christopher and Chloe Blanding. In addition to education, he was also active in civic activities and the church. He served as commissioner from Rhode Island to the Universal Exposition at Vienna, Austria. He helped establish the U.S. Postal Code system as a member of the 1878 Postal Congress. He served as president in over thirty associations and organizations, and was a member in over one hundred. He was president of the International Sunday School Union, the Massachusetts Congregational Sunday School Union, the Chautauqua Teachers' Reading Union, and the New England Sunday School Association. Writings Bicknell was an author, editor, and publisher of the New England Journal of Education (Boston, 1875‚Äì1880). He was the author of the five-volume History of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, the author-publisher of The Governors of Rhode Island, The Dorr War, The Story of the Rhode Island Normal School, and Story of Dr. John Clarke, and the editor-publisher of History and Genealogy of the Bicknell Family and Collateral Lines. As a historian he also contributed to The Bay State Monthly magazine.

It is located on the far south side of the city and was the original location of the South Side Irish Parade before it was relocated to the Beverly neighborhood farther southwest in the city. Development Auburn Gresham's development as a community dates back to the early nineteenth century, when the area was defined primarily by small German and Dutch settlements. A later influx of Irish railroad workers and others lured to the South Side by newly extended city services in the late nineteenth century led to further residential and commercial growth. In the 1920s, the population increased nearly threefold, from 19,558 to 57,381. The plethora of bungalow-style housing and brick two- flat apartment buildings throughout Auburn Gresham serves as lasting evidence of the community's formative years. Like most other Southside communities, Auburn Gresham suffered from blockbusting, rising crime, and white flight during the 1960s: the neighborhood was nearly 100% white in 1960, but flipped to being 69% black by the 1970 census. 308x308px Transportation Auburn Gresham is serviced by a Metra commuter rail stop at W. 87th St. and Vincennes Ave., which provides daily inbound service to LaSalle Street Station in Chicago and outbound service to Joliet. Community leaders have long encouraged the construction of an additional Metra rail stop at W. 79th St. In 2014, the City of Chicago obtained a half-acre parcel of land on which to construct the station. CTA red line stops at 79th St. and 87th St. are also available along the Dan Ryan Expressway in nearby Chatham. Landmarks Chicago Public Library operates the Thurgood Marshall Branch in Auburn Gresham at W. 75th St. and S. Racine Ave. The 13,500 square foot library, which features a 125-seat auditorium, reading garden, and several artworks, opened in April 1994. St. Sabina Church is located in the community, headed by Rev. Michael Pfleger. The church and its priest have been pivotal in helping transform Auburn Gresham, with new housing and store fronts opening up in the neighborhood. One of the largest new single-family home developments in Chicago is nearly complete at W. 87th St. and S. Parnell Ave., in the southeast corner of Auburn Gresham. Auburn Gresham is home to the St. Leo Campus for Veterans, which includes the Catholic Charities' St. Leo's Residence, the Auburn Gresham Community Based Outpatient Clinic, the St. Leo's Veteran's Garden, and the Pope John Paul II Residence. The community is also home to Perspectives Leadership Academy and Perspectives Technology Academy which are a part of the Renaissance 2010 program. Both schools are housed in the same building that was home to the former Calumet High School in the Auburn Gresham community. Calumet High School was one of Chicago's oldest high schools opening its doors to Auburn Gresham neighborhood students in 1919. The Auburn Gresham community is also home to the first urban S.O.S. Children's Village in the U.S.  Demographics Politics The Auburn Gresham community area has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections. In the 2016 presidential election, the Auburn Gresham cast 19,286 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 272 votes for Donald Trump (97.29% to 1.37%). In the 2012 presidential election, Auburn Gresham cast 24,782 votes for Barack Obama and cast 130 votes for Mitt Romney (99.34% to 0.52%).

Career Born Hisako Uno, Hokuto became a professional wrestler in the wake of the enormous popularity of tag team the Crush Gals (Chigusa Nagayo and Lioness Asuka), and was responsible for organizing the Bull Nakano fanclub. She joined the AJW dojo after quitting high school. All Japan Women's Pro Wrestling (1985‚Äì1995) Debuting for All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling (AJW) shortly before her eighteenth birthday, Hokuto immediately stood out from the crowd, winning AJW's Rookie of the Year award for 1985. The next year, she won the AJW Junior Championship, and participated in AJW's Match of the Year, paired with Yukari Omari in a losing effort against Chigusa Nagayo and Yumiko Hotta in the final of the annual Tag League the Best tournament. In 1987, Hokuto won the AJW's top tag team belt, the WWWA World Tag Team Championship paired with Yumiko Hotta. Twelve days later, however, the two lost the titles to the Red Typhoons (Kazue Nagahori and Yumi Ogura) in a two out of three falls match. During the finish of the first fall, Hokuto took a tombstone piledriver off the second rope and broke her neck. She wrestled the entirety of the second and third falls, sometimes holding her head in place with her hands. This gained Hokuto a reputation for toughness. In 1990, Hokuto was booked to win the Japan Grand Prix, AJW's annual tournament to determine the number one contender to the top singles belt, the WWWA World Single Championship. However, she once again suffered a severe injury. During a Grand Prix match against Manami Toyota, Hokuto performed a plancha and crashed her knee into the ringside metal barrier. She tore open her knee, and was rendered unable to walk. Crying, she tied a bandage around her leg, pulled herself back into the ring, and attempted to continue the match. It was clearly impossible, however, and she was removed from the tournament. When Hokuto returned to singles competition, she slowly revealed a new, more dynamic, persona. She grew her hair longer and bleached it blonde, wore flashy attire, used stylised make-up to complement her features and called herself \\"Akira Hokuto\\", after popular wrestler Akira Maeda. Teaming with Suzuka Minami as the Marine Wolves, she won the WWWA Tag Team belts twice more. She also won the All Pacific Championship in 1991 and 1992, and sustained many more injuries (earning the nickname 'the Mummy' since she so often came to the ring wrapped in bandages). The year 1993 is considered by many to be the best year of her career. She feuded with Shinobu Kandori of the LLPW promotion during the inter-promotional period, where the major promotions active in women's wrestling in Japan at the time combined to run shows with dream match-ups that attracted some of the largest cards in history. At AJW All-Star Dreamslam on April 2, 1993, Hokuto defeated Kandori, which was given a perfect five-star rating by Dave Meltzer and is considered by some to be the greatest women's match in history. Hokuto was subsequently defeated by Kandori in a tag match at Dreamslam II nine days later and in a singles match in December of that year. Also in 1993 she won the Japan Grand Prix and was granted another shot at the WWWA Championship, against champion Aja Kong on October 9. Hokuto was again injured in August of that year, and requested that the match be made a non-title match, since she felt wrestling in her injured state would insult the prestige of the belt. Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (1993‚Äì1995) Later that year, having married Mexican wrestler Antonio G√≥mez Medina who worked as \\"M√°scara M√°gica\\", Hokuto moved to Mexico. She continued her career in her new home, adopting the persona \\"Reina Jabuki\\"\\". On July 30, 1994, she defeated La Diab√≥lica for the CMLL World Women's Championship, and carried it for over two years. Later that year, having divorced her first husband and returned to Japan, she defeated Aja Kong in the final of the interpromotional V*Top Woman Tournament at the Big Egg Wrestling Universe event, which drew a gate of 42,500 to the Tokyo Dome. Hokuto had one her last great matches for AJW on September 2, 1995, losing a thrilling 21-minute battle against Manami Toyota. World Championship Wrestling (1995‚Äì1997) On November 26, 1995, Hokuto made her U.S. debut at the World War 3 pay-per-view event. Managed by Sonny Onoo, she teamed with Bull Nakano and defeated the team of Cutie Suzuki and Mayumi Ozaki. The same teams competed in a match on Monday Night Nitro the following night, with Hokuto and Nakano winning again. Hokuto and several other GAEA wrestlers, including Chigusa Nagayo, KAORU, Meiko Satomura, and Sonoko Kato, came to America to compete in a tournament to crown the first WCW Women's Champion. Hokuto competed in the first round of the tournament twice, using both the Akira Hokuto and Reina Jabuki gimmicks. As Reina Jabuki, she lost in the first round to Madusa Miceli. Due to this TV appearance, she was stripped of the CMLL title. As Akira Hokuto, she won the tournament, defeating Madusa in the finals, held at WCW's Starrcade on December 29, 1996, in Nashville, Tennessee. Hokuto later defeated Madusa at WCW's The Great American Bash on June 15, 1997, a match where Madusa was forced to 'retire' due to a stipulation. This was the last time Hokuto ever appeared in WCW and the Women's Championship was apparently dropped, as it was never defended or mentioned again. This made her the only WCW Women's Champion. Gaea Japan (1996‚Äì2002) In 1996, she left AJW and joined Chigusa Nagayo's new promotion, Gaea Japan. Unlike most Japanese women wrestlers, who retire when they marry and start a family, she returned to the ring in 1999 and won GAEA's AAAW Tag Team Championship in 2000 with Mayumi Ozaki. The year 2000 also saw her induction into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in recognition of her skill and contributions. For her retirement match on April 7, 2002, Hokuto teamed up with Meiko Satomura to face Ayako Hamada and Chigusa Nagayo. Hokuto was wrestling with a broken rib, but, just as she had done so many times before, she defied the pain, and scored the pin on Hamada with the Northern Lights Bomb. In the post-match retirement ceremony, some of Hokuto's colleagues entered the ring, gave her flowers, hugged her, and bowed to her. She even slapped a few of them, including Satomura, and Sakura Hirota (slapping is considered a way to transfer part of her fighting spirit). This was followed by a ten-gong salute before Hokuto was showered with streamers. She then walked up the walkway where she was met by husband Kensuke Sasaki and their son.  Post-retirement (2002-present)  Despite retiring in 2002, Hokuto has wrestled occasionally since then, including a 10-man tag team match for All Japan Pro Wrestling in 2004 where she teamed with her husband Sasaki, Genichiro Tenryu, Katsuhiko Nakajima and Kenshin to defeat RO&D; (Jamal, Taiyo Kea, Buchanan, D-Lo Brown and Taka Michinoku).https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=41375 In her last match to date on February 11, 2006, at a Kensuke Office show, she took part in a battle royal where the winner would receive ¬•120,000. The match was eventually won by Minoru Suzuki.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=18551 She also served as the chief executive officer of Hawaii Championship Wrestling for a period of time during a Japan vs. Hawaii feud, as well as engaged in several squash matches against comedy wrestler Stalker Ichikawa, and became the first woman in history to compete in a match in All Japan Pro Wrestling against Kendo Kashin, a match that Hokuto won in just 3 minutes with the aid of outside interference. Personal life While retired from active competition, Hokuto has stayed busy raising her family, helping her husband Kensuke run his Kensuke Office/Diamond Ring promotion, and making occasional appearances on Japanese radio and television. Kensuke Sasaki and Akira Hokuto were voted one of Japan's leading celebrity couples in 2006. Hokuto has also assisted her husband in various publicity and charitable activities in his position as Japan's Friendship Ambassador to Fiji for the year 2007. She has made various media appearances as a \\"mother celebrity\\". In 2010, for example, she appeared in a television commercial for \\"Mama Gohan\\" (lit. \\"Mama Meal\\"), a co-product by Ajinomoto and popular women's magazine I Love Mama, along with three female gyaru-mother models.\\"Popular gyaru-mama model & Akira Hokuto support mama's cooking\\" , 16 June 2010, Model Press Hokuto married Kensuke Sasaki on October 1, 1995, after Sasaki proposed to her on their first date. Hokuto became pregnant in early 1998 and gave birth to her first son, Kennosuke on November 6, 1998. Hokuto gave birth to her second son, Seinosuke in March 2003. In addition to their two biological children, Hokuto and Kensuke have formed a very strong, almost parental bond with Kensuke's prot√©g√© Katsuhiko Nakajima. On September 23, 2015, Hokuto announced she had been diagnosed with breast cancer and was undergoing surgery the following day to have her right breast removed. The surgery was successful and will need several months to recuperate.

It was originally broadcast on NBC as a two-part miniseries on May 16 and 17, 1999. Plot Bradshaw Disposal Services has a nuclear bomb made in Russia to transport, and an employee (named Henry Bradshaw) decides to save money by concealing it on a freight train. This train is also loaded with hazardous and flammable chemicals, including metallic sodium, which spontaneously ignites on contact with water. The train suffers a brake failure and becomes a runaway heading for Denver. John Seger, a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator, boards the train and with the assistance of the railwaymen tries various ways to stop the train. Several ideas are tried, such as coupling a following train to the caboose (the coupling mechanism on the caboose breaks, which also results in the death of one of the train's crew members), a derailing attempt (after it is revealed the catastrophe the chemicals would cause if ignited) in which a helicopter narrowly avoids being hit, and finally, an attempt at manually activating the brakes (via hitting a part of the engine mechanism with a wrench). The final attempt works successfully but is short-lived. The following rescue train, unaware of the freight's slowing, speeds forward and crushes the caboose (killing an injured crew member in the process). The force disengages the brakes, this time for good, causing the train to speed up once again. Meanwhile, Denver residents are struggling to collect their families and then leave town, despite rioters, looters, and gridlock. Realizing that there is no way to stop it, John and the engineer (who was initially reluctant) abandon the train by jumping off before it can speed up too much. The train derails and becomes a terrific wreck. Discovering the now highly unstable bomb on board, firefighters struggle to extinguish the fire at the crash site. After realizing that metallic sodium is on the train, the firefighters and NEST teams retreat to evaluate a strategy. In the meantime, all firefighting aircraft are grounded. The misinterpretation of a radio call to a water bombing helicopter leads it to dump its load of water onto the wreck. Water comes into contact with the metallic sodium, which explodes and in turn causes the nuclear bomb to detonate. The blast causes severe damage throughout Denver and releases an electromagnetic pulse. No cars work, electricity is down and anything with a computer is shut down. After the blast, Denver lies in ruins. John (who made it back to town via helicopter) then attempts to get his family out of Denver before nuclear fallout starts. After finding a working car, John eventually reunites with his family at a FEMA refugee camp in Eminence, Kansas.  Rail equipment  The release poster features Fairbanks-Morse C-liners, of which none are known to exist today. The actual film uses all Canadian equipment, including the rare MLW M420. The two locomotives that attempt to couple to the runaway are in the paint scheme of BC Rail, which has since been folded into Canadian National. Those two locomotives may still be working on CN, either in the paint scheme of BCR or CN.

He is perhaps best known for his nature and animal motifs, especially with dramatic situations. He was the most important and probably most influential Swedish wildlife painter of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Hammond, Nicholas, Modern Wildlife Painting, Pica Press, 1998, , pp.31‚Äì40. He also drew some sequential picture stories, making him one of the early Swedish comic creators. Biography Hawk and Black-Game (1884) Peregrine falcon in treetop Portrait of the artist‚Äôs father (1884) Anna (1885) Liljefors was born in Uppsala, Sweden. His parents were Anders Liljefors and Maria Margareta Lindb√§ck. He was brother of the composer and conductor Ruben Liljefors (1871‚Äì1936). He went to Uppsala Cathedral School for six years. He received instruction from 1879-82 at the Swedish Royal Academy of Fine Arts. From 1882-83, he made a study trip to D√ºsseldorf, Baiern, Venice, Florence, Naples, Rome and Paris. He received inspiration from the Scandinavian artist colony in Grez-sur-Loing. In 1886, he became a member of the Artists' Union (Konstn√§rsf√∂rbundet), which was in opposition to the Royal Academy. From 1888-89, he taught at Valand Academy in Gothenburg. In 1887, he married Anna Olivia Olofsson (1864-1947). The marriage ended with a divorce in 1895 at which time he married his first wife's younger sister Signe Adolfina Helena Olofsson (1871-1944). He was a resident of Uppsala, until the summer of 1894 when he sought out the Stockholm archipelago. From 1905-17, he lived at Ytterj√§rnain S√∂dermanland and from 1917 to √ñsterbybruk in Uppland. He established a studio in √ñsterbybruk where he lived and worked between 1917 and 1932. During the last years of the nineteenth century, a brooding element entered his work, perhaps the result of turmoil in his private life. He was often short of money and in 1925, he suffered a facial neuralgia with severe pain. From 1932, Liljefors lived at Kungsholmen in Stockholm. The last two years of his life he spent in Uppsala. Liljefors died during 1939 and was buried at the Uppsala old cemetery. Work Liljefors is held in high esteem by painters of wildlife and is acknowledged as an influence by, for example, American wildlife artist Michael Coleman. All his life Liljefors was a hunter, and he often painted predator-prey action, the hunts engaged between fox and hare, sea eagle and eider, and goshawk and black grouse serving as prime examples. However, he never exaggerated the ferocity of the predator or the pathos of the prey, and his pictures are devoid of sentimentality. The darker quality in his paintings gradually began to attract interest, and he had paintings exhibited at the Paris Salon. The influence of the Impressionists can be seen in his attention to the effects of environment and light, and later that of Art Nouveau in his Mallards, Evening of 1901, in which the pattern of the low sunlight on the water looks like leopardskin, hence the Swedish nickname Panterf√§llen. Bruno was fascinated by the patterns to be found in nature, and he often made art out of the camouflage patterns of animals and birds. He particularly loved painting capercaillies against woodland, and his most successful painting of this subject is the large-scale Capercaillie Lek, 1888, in which he captures the atmosphere of the forest at dawn. He was also influenced by Japanese art, for example in his Goldfinches, painted in the late 1880s. Collections of his art are on display at the Nationalmuseum, Gothenburg Museum of Art, Thiel Gallery and Uppsala University. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. Style He amassed a collection of animals to act as his living models. Ernst Malmberg recalled: The greatness of Liljefors lay in his ability to show animals in their environment. Sometimes he achieved this through hunting and observation of the living animal, and sometimes he used dead animals; for example, his Hawk and Black Game, painted in the winter of 1883‚Äì84, was based on dead specimens, but he also used his memory of the flocks of black grouse in the meadows around a cottage he once lived in at Ehrentuna, near Uppsala. He wrote: File:Bruno Liljefors - Winter landscape with bullfinches 1891.jpgWinter landscape with bullfinches, 1891 File:Bruno Liljefors - Winter landscape at dawn 1900.jpgWinter landscape at dawn, 1900 Image:Bruno_Liljefors_-_Winter_Hare.jpgWinter hare, 1908 File:Bruno Liljefors - Vinterhare vid gardesgard.jpgWinter hare, undated Assessment Such practices have sometimes led to criticism of Liljefors' work; Lars Jonsson has noted a \\"heraldisation\\" of the drama in Golden Eagle Chasing a Hare, 1904, which causes a departure from pure naturalism, and he deduces from the position of the eagle's wing feathers that it would have been gliding rather than turning in reaction to the hare as painted. Nevertheless, Liljefors was a pioneer at a time when wildlife art was still emerging from its association with scientific depiction and taxidermy. He also set a standard of identification with the landscape that substantially influenced the development of wildlife art in the twentieth century.

In 1895 it was sold to Andrew Carnegie, who moved the mill to Homestead, Pennsylvania. The mill was Uniontown's largest industry in the early 1890s. History The Columbia Rolling Mill had a substantial number of employees, especially in its first years of operation. It was serviced by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The mill reported marginal gains in 1887, 1888, and 1889. Although the gains were small, it proved those who thought the mill would quickly fold to be wrong. A small-scale strike hampered the mill in 1890. In 1891 and 1892, the mill reported losses. However, in 1893 the mill recovered and in 1894, the mill took in substantial gains. 1895 appeared to be another solid year, when suddenly, the mill was sold and moved. Andrew Carnegie paid an impressive sum for the mill and many Uniontown citizens lost their jobs. The Columbia Rolling Mill had since been a topic of great controversy in Uniontown. In the late 19th century, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was gaining footing as an iron and steel producing giant. Andrew Carnegie had fabulous transportation services, thanks to the Monongahela, Allegheny, and Ohio Rivers, and to the railroads servicing Pittsburgh. Much of the coal that was used in the Pittsburgh mills was obtained from the hills surrounding Connellsville, Pennsylvania, a neighboring town to Uniontown. Supposedly, Carnegie feared that a mill in Uniontown could lead to an Uniontown and Connellsville alliance that could hurt his profits. Uniontown was considerably closer to the rich coal fields than Pittsburgh, thus transportation costs will be cheaper. While Uniontown had no major waterways, the neighboring town of Brownsville, Pennsylvania, a shipbuilding center, was located on the Monongahela River. If Carnegie would not have seized the Columbia Rolling Mill before he did, other mills may have opened in the Uniontown area, causing problems for Carnegie.

The character made her first appearance during the episode broadcast on 19 May 2000. During her time on the show, Maria has been the centre of major storylines. In late-2009, Longchambon took maternity leave and Maria was off- screen from November 2009 until June 2010. Longchambon went on maternity leave again in 2015 and Maria was off-screen from October 2015 until April 2016. In June 2019, it was announced that Longchambon had signed a new contract keeping her with the show for at least another 12 months. Storylines Maria is first seen working in the kennels belonging to her father, Eric (Steve Money). Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) and Jack Duckworth (Bill Tarmey) bring Tyrone's greyhound, Monica, in to look for a stud to mate with. Maria and Tyrone are immediately attracted to one another and the pair begin a relationship. Tyrone proposes to Maria at the top of Blackpool Tower and she happily accepts. However, their relationship quickly dissolves as Tyrone succumbs to his feelings for Fiz Brown (Jennie McAlpine), leading a heartbroken Maria to end their engagement. Later, she romances Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas). After deciding to change careers, she takes a hairdressing course. She is then hired by Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) at the salon as a junior stylist but does not get along with Audrey or fellow stylist Maxine Peacock (Tracy Shaw). Maria ends her romance with Jason after discovering that he had sex with Candice Stowe (Nikki Sanderson). She and her friend Toyah Battersby (Georgia Taylor) later move into the flat above the salon, having become good friends on a trip to Blackpool, where Maria saved Fiz from being arrested after Maria's brother Kirk Sutherland (Andrew Whyment), who had followed them on the trip with Fiz, Tyrone and Jason, broke into an empty caravan to find a place to stay without telling the others. Maria attends Gail Platt (Helen Worth) and Richard Hillman's (Brian Capron) wedding in July 2002, where she meets Gail's son Nick Tilsley (Adam Rickitt). Maria realises she has fallen in love with Nick and they embark on a romance. They decide to run away to Canada, with Maria turning Tyrone down when he comes to the airport to beg her to stay. Nick worked all hours, leaving a bored Maria home alone. She dumps him and returns soon after. Upon her return, she takes a job at the Rovers Return Inn and changes her image, becoming more promiscuous and fashion-conscious. Maria moves back into the flat where Fiz had moved in her absence. There is an uneasy truce between the former rivals for Tyrone's affection, especially since Fiz is now seeing Kirk and Maria is unhappy about her brother spending so much time in the flat, but the pair soon become close friends. Maria has a casual relationship with Vikram Desai (Chris Bisson) and is pleased when he takes her on holiday abroad, unaware he is merely using her as cover for drug smuggling to pay off his debts. When Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) finds out what Vik is up to, he forces him to leave town without saying goodbye to Maria. In late-2002, Toyah arrives home with a new boyfriend, her tutor from college, John Arnley (Paul Warriner). Maria ends up having a one-night stand with John in January 2003 but is shocked when John wants nothing to do with her afterwards. Fiz discovers Maria and John's affair but keeps the secret. However, she struggles to conceal it when Maria announces she is pregnant. Maria later has an abortion but when Toyah finds out she slept with John, Maria denies responsibility, leading Toyah to believe John raped Maria and attacks him. When Toyah realises the truth, she refuses to forgive Maria and leaves Weatherfield, resulting in her family blaming Maria for driving her away. Maria's sloppy work habits soon found her on the wrong side of her boss Shelley Unwin's (Sally Lindsay) mother Bev (Susie Blake). Even though Bev had goaded Maria into causing a scene while working, family loyalty wins out and Maria is sacked. She soon persuades Audrey to take her back on at the salon. She takes a dislike to fellow stylist, Candice, who took her ex-boyfriend Jason from her and who Audrey moves into the flat with her and Fiz, although they eventually become friends. She also shares with Claire Casey (Julia Haworth) for a time. In April 2004, Nick, another of Maria's ex-boyfriends, returns and the pair reconcile. However Nick's ex-wife Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) returns months later, and after hearing what Maria had done to her stepsister Toyah, succeeds in splitting Nick and Maria. Nick leaves Weatherfield, taking a job in Nottingham. Maria stays on in the flat above Street Cars where she and Nick were living and Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) moves his mother, Liz (Beverley Callard) into the flat in November 2004 as Maria's flatmate. She \\"borrows\\" ¬£200 from the petty cash at the salon to go on holiday with her latest fling, Dave, and Tyrone lends her the money to pay it back before Audrey finds out. After Audrey tells her it is better to marry a good man who is loyal to you rather than go after looks, Maria reunites with Tyrone and the couple resumes dating in late-2004, with Maria moving in with Tyrone at No.9 Coronation Street. Even though she has a one-night stand with another man, Stuart (Junior Laniyan), they become engaged again. In 2005, Maria's parents relocate to Cyprus. Maria is disappointed that Eric intends to leave the kennel business to Kirk and persuades him to give her a half share but leaves all the work to Kirk. Kirk accidentally allows a pedigree bulldog to be gelded and has to sell the business to pay compensation to the owner, leaving himself and Maria with little profit. Maria and Tyrone later break up after she keeps trying to change his personality, giving him a back wax because she is embarrassed by his physique, and he discovers she does not love him as much as he loves her when she reacts with horror on having a pregnancy scare. Maria begins renting the flat alongside the builder's yard from Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward). Even though he is dating Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), Charlie sets out to seduce Maria, installing security cameras at the yard to watch Maria's flat and staging a break-in to make her feel vulnerable. Maria falls for Charlie and begins an affair with him but when David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) finds out and tries to blackmail Charlie, Charlie tries to drown him in Maria's bath. Maria stops him and admits the affair to Tracy, resulting in a fight between the two women in the street. Even though she wants nothing more to do with Charlie, Maria is the only resident aside from Jason to be upset when Tracy murders him in revenge for the affair. Maria starts dating property developer Chris Pitcher but is disappointed to learn he considers her beneath him and is only interested in a casual relationship. Maria is reminded of the way she treated Tyrone and tries to resume her romance with him, even though he is now dating Molly Compton (Vicky Binns), but he turns her down. Maria later begins a relationship with Liam Connor (Rob James-Collier) and moves in with him. Maria finds that she is pregnant, and Liam proposes. Unknown to Maria, Liam has captured his sister-in-law Carla Connor's (Alison King) affections, which causes Maria some anxiety, but they still marry. Maria is horrified to realise that the baby has stopped kicking and an emergency scan shows that the baby has died. She delivers a stillborn baby boy who she names Paul after Liam's late brother, Paul Connor (Sean Gallagher) and Liam finds himself drawn to Carla. The secret lovers are discovered by Carla's fianc√©e Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien) who has Liam murdered in a hit and run attack. The same night, Liam's sister, Michelle (Kym Marsh) realises Maria is pregnant again. Maria learns about Liam's affair when a drunken Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor) shows her video footage of Carla and Liam in each other's arms at Carla's wedding to Tony. The video was taken by her daughter, Rosie (Helen Flanagan). Maria becomes suspicious of Tony when she learns that he knew about the affair before marrying Carla and suspects he is involved in Liam's death. She begins a harassment campaign against Tony, who considers killing Maria to silence her. Maria almost runs Tony over in her car, causing him minor injuries, and he refuses to press charges against her. Carla discovers Maria was right and flees Weatherfield, leaving Tony a broken man. When Maria finds Tony mourning at Liam's grave on her wedding anniversary, they call a truce and build a close friendship. When Maria goes into labour on a day trip to the beach, Tony delivers her baby, another boy that she names Liam Anthony Connor, after Liam and Tony. Tony suggested that she call him Sandy as he was born at a beach, but Maria was determined to name her son after his dad. Tony proposes to Maria and she accepts. Maria discovers the truth about Tony when he suffers a heart attack and confesses to Roy Cropper (David Neilson) that he had Liam murdered. Roy's wife Hayley (Julie Hesmondhalgh) informs a heartbroken Maria. She refuses to believe it but Tony admits it, causing Maria to have a breakdown and asks them to raise Liam but they make her realise that she has done nothing wrong and is a fit mother to Liam. They persuade her that she simply needs a change of scene so she and baby Liam go to Ireland with them. Maria returns to Weatherfield in June 2010, announcing her intention to stay and moves into the salon flat with Liam and Kirk. The same month, Tony escapes from prison and with the help of a former cellmate's plans to kidnap Carla and Hayley in the Underworld factory. Robbie tricks Carla into entering the factory alone with her and holds her at gunpoint, tying her to a chair and taping her mouth shut. Robbie then tricks Hayley into coming to the factory, saying Carla has had an accident. Hayley sees Carla bound and gagged, but is held at gunpoint too and tied to a chair. Tony appears and announces his plans to kill them. Maria appears to see Carla, and Tony forces her to try and get rid of Maria. When Carla tries to warn Maria, Tony knocks her unconscious and pulls Maria into the hostage situation. Tony threatens to kill Maria if she tells anyone but she escapes and raises the alarm. Tony eventually lets Hayley go and sets fire to the factory to kill himself and Carla. However, Carla manages to untie herself and escapes, although Tony walks into the inferno and kills himself. Carla then offers Maria a job as a personal assistant at Underworld, and she agrees. Carla sends Maria to Frank Foster's (Andrew Lancel) house all dressed up for an informal meeting. Frank attempts to kiss Maria despite her telling him she has a boyfriend and when he doesn't stop, she begins panicking. When she tries to stand up from the sofa, Frank forces her back down, his hands wandering but she manages to fend him off. She escapes and rushes home crying and shaken. Over the next few weeks, Maria has to put up with Frank's appearances at Underworld, Maria informs Carla of what he did, but after numerous apologies, Frank agrees to business with the factory. Maria reaches breaking point when Carla announces that Frank has bought into the business and will be a new partner, she slaps Carla and quits her job after Carla says that Maria provoked the attack on herself. Having reached the end of her tether, Maria eventually reports Frank to the police. Frank is arrested the next day, but there is not enough evidence so the police do not press any charges. Maria then returns to her old job as a hairdresser at Audrey's Salon, alongside David and Audrey. Maria receives a phone call from a distressed Carla, on the eve of her wedding to Frank, asking her to come over to her flat. Upon arrival, a shocked Maria finds Carla cowering on the floor, revealing that Frank has raped her. Maria puts her feud with Carla to one side and is immediately supportive, helping Carla as she reports the attack to the police. She supports Carla as she presses charges on Frank. Michelle returns from her cruise and the three sisters-in-law support Carla as Frank faces trial, he is found 'not guilty'. Maria later begins fawning over gay friend; Marcus Dent (Charlie Condou) and he moves in with her, after splitting from his then boyfriend Sean Tully (Antony Cotton). After constant complaining about being single, her friends decide to deceive her into reconciling with her ex-boyfriend, Jason. She has sex with him and they resume dating. Jason is preparing to move in with Maria until Maria discovers a lump on her breast, who confides in Marcus and after undergoing a biopsy, she learns that the lump is benign. After celebrating with Marcus, the pair share a surprise kiss, but later agree that it was a mistake. However, Maria later realises she is in love with Marcus but he is dating Aiden Lester (Toby Sawyer). Aiden receives a promotion, which is in London, and asks Maria whether Marcus will travel with him. Maria attempts to terminate the thought of moving to London as Marcus will stay. Although, the couple later notice her trickery and agree to leave for London, upsetting Maria. Marcus angrily confronts her at the flat and unable to contain his feelings, they sleep together but after their steamy session, he rejects her. The taxi arrives to take Aiden and Marcus but he refuses to leave, lying that he still loves Sean and ends his relationship with Aiden, leading a heartbroken Aiden to leave for the capital alone. Marcus stuns Maria when she sees him still at the flat and after revealing he is in love with her, they kiss and start casually dating. She later declares to Jason that their relationship is over. In late-2013, Marcus and Maria decide that they want to buy a house together, away from the street, so that there are things like boating lakes and playgrounds for Liam. After viewing a chain of properties, Marcus and Maria finally find a place with all the amenities that they were looking for. Marcus then decides to surprise Maria at the show home, and as he waits for her, their gay friend Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) accompanies Marcus, but the pair end up having sex. Maria and her friend Audrey walk in on them, which leaves Marcus horrified and embarrassed. As Marcus tries to explain himself to Maria and put things right with her, she lashes out, attacks him, and ends their relationship for good. Maria kicks Marcus out of their flat, but Maria is annoyed when he is offered a room at Todd's aunt Julie's flat. When Liam's childminder falls sick, and Maria does not answer her phone, Marcus decides to pick Liam up from the childminder's house, as no one else can. After picking Liam up, Marcus brings him back to the salon to meet Maria. Marcus tries to tell Maria that he is going to London for a short time, and Maria tells him that she wants nothing else to do with him. When Marcus returns, Maria was furious. After finding out that Tyrone's ex-fianc√©e Kirsty Soames (Natalie Gumede) has been released from prison, Maria comforts Tyrone and decided to try to rekindle their relationship by sending texts, pretending to be Kirsty (with the letter \\"K\\" at the end). Tyrone and Fiz's relationship starts to strain because of the texts and Fiz calling the police on her. When Maria gets Tyrone to herself for half an hour on the bench, she sees Fiz and deliberately hugs him in the hope that Fiz will dump him. Fiz moves out of Tyrone's house and moves back in with her brother Chesney. The next day, the police come knocking to Fiz and she found out that Kirsty is abroad and there is proof that the messages have come from the UK. Confused, Fiz rings the number and Tyrone picks it up and realizes that Maria was behind it all along. Maria tries to explain that she loves Tyrone and desperately tries to convince him that he feels the same, but a furious Tyrone pushes her away and tells her to stay away from them. The next day, Tyrone and Fiz call the police and Maria is arrested. The police then say that whatever happens next is up to Tyrone and Fiz. After some persuasion from Kirk, they decide to drop the charges. Maria then decides to take Liam to Cyprus for a while, so that he can spend a bit of time with his grandparents. Maria returns on 30 June, saying that being away helped her come to terms with what happened with Marcus and has helped her overall mental health. She and Kirk go to the Rovers for a drink where they bump into Fiz. Maria tries to apologise to Fiz for sending the texts to Tyrone and for frightening them. Fiz tells Maria that she will never forgive her for what she did. Marcus comes to Maria's defence and tells Fiz that Maria was obviously not well when she was doing those things and was therefore not herself. Marcus later catches Todd kissing another man to which had stayed the night before at Todd's house. Marcus is horrified and realises what Todd is really like. Marcus then dumps Todd and Maria comforts him. Marcus later leaves Weatherfield departing on good terms with Maria. She later begins a relationship with mechanic Luke Britton (Dean Fagan). Maria is initially reluctant to commit to Luke. He later accompanies her to a wedding and they begin a serious relationship. Maria also likes Luke as he gets along well with Liam. Maria later gets into an argument with Jenny Bradley (Sally Ann Matthews) and is stunned when Jenny slaps her. She is later annoyed when Jenny denies hitting her, however, Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent) believes Maria. She later buys Luke a stock racing car as a gift. He restores the car as it is not in good condition and later begins racing the car. She regrets buying him the racing car after she realises it could put his life in danger as he previously had an accident before he met Maria. Luke agrees to give up racing, but continues to race in secret. Maria later finds out that Luke is still racing the car after Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) lets slip that he saw Luke loading the car onto a trailer, while assumed to be working by Maria. Maria is furious when she finds out and later gives Luke an ultimatum either he gives up the racing or they're over. Luke later agrees to give up racing the car but is later blackmailed by his friend and sister's ex-boyfriend, Jamie Bowman (James Atherton) over naked photos he has of Luke's sister, Steph Britton (Tisha Merry). Maria later leaves the street for Cyprus in order to help her father Eric, look after her mother who has had an accident. Maria returns in April 2016 and it becomes obvious she is keeping a secret, whilst at the salon she takes a phone call from a man called Pablo, who she has married, Audrey later spots them kissing after he turns up outside her flat however Maria later reveals she only married Pablo to keep him in the country as he has a boyfriend living in the UK. In July 2016, she invites Caz Hammond (Rhea Bailey) to come and live with her and Luke which he becomes jealous by. Maria later has sex with Aidan Connor (Shayne Ward), who is dating Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley) and still wants to continue the affair but Aidan doesn't as he has heard the Fiz calling her 'Mad Maria' and the factory girls saying that she's crazy. They are nearly caught out after Caz accidentally mentions that she saw Aidan in the flat the night before whereas he had told a lie to Eva. Eva questioned them both and Maria makes up that Aidan is looking at flats for her. This irritates Aidan as he doesn't want to move in with her and he and Maria argue. Maria then ends her engagement with Luke, which also devastates him. Later on back at the flat, Caz tells Liam that Maria and Luke are no longer together which infuriates Maria. Caz questions Maria whether she and Aidan had something going on and Maria orders Caz out. After Maria manages to get Caz a job interview Caz kisses her, Maria then tells Audrey and Sophie about the kiss and Caz overhears this and leaves the street. Maria and Sophie, however, go after her and manage to bring her back. In October 2016, Caz tells Tyrone that Maria is threatening her to get out of the flat and goes missing framing Maria for \\"murdering her\\" by putting blood on the walls, Maria is questioned by the police however the rest of the street including Tyrone back Maria but Caz is nowhere to be seen. Tyrone and Fiz later find Maria's rug with blood stains on in the bin and tell the police, the police question Maria. After coming back from the police station Maria and Aidan hug unaware that Caz is watching in the distance. Maria later goes into the pub whilst everyone is talking about her and lashes out at pregnant Michelle Connor. Caz cuts herself in Maria's flat and wipes the blood on Maria's hairdressing scissors. Maria later finds these and with Aidan's help they dispose of them. However, Aidan's father Johnny Connor (Richard Hawley) finds them and alerts the police, which leads to Maria being arrested. Maria is released after Aidan's sister and Caz's ex-girlfriend Kate Connor (Faye Brookes) leads Caz to believe she wants her back and rings the police. Aidan goes to pick Maria up from the police station and they nearly kiss. Aidan then later confesses that he loves Maria despite his relationship with Eva. However, on Christmas Eve, Maria is sentenced to twelve months imprisonment for illegally marrying Pablo. In March 2017, she is released from prison for good behaviour but with an electronic tracking device on her ankle. She reunites and clashes with Toyah due to their feud fourteen years earlier. In May 2017, she accompanies Aidan to a business lunch where she pretends to be Eva however she needs to get home before her curfew ends and storms out of the restaurant after an argument with Aidan. She is seen walking alongside the road by Aidan who tempts her into his car for a lift home as she doesn't want to go back to prison. Once they get back to Maria's just in time before her curfew ends they have sex and afterwards she tells him he can stay with Eva and that they can carry on having an affair behind her back but Maria is heartbroken when he and Eva get engaged, and although at first she insists their affair is over; Maria carries on secretly meeting Aidan. He ends the affair once Eva tells Aidan she is pregnant. Eva annoys Maria and asks her to plan her wedding. Eva starts humiliating Maria at her hen party, where she learns that Eva has lied about her pregnancy when Maria finds her fake baby scans. After lying saying she cannot go to the wedding, Maria sneaks to the hotel instead and puts a picture of the fake scans in the guests gift bags, however after being locked in the bathroom by Toyah, Maria manages to be let out by hotel staff and storms into the ceremony exposing Eva's fake pregnancy to Aidan and the rest of the wedding guests. Eva desperately tries to deny it, but eventually admits that she found out about the affair months ago. Despite her attempts to shame him and Maria, Aidan is disgusted with her deception and storms out of the wedding ceremony. Whilst outside, Eva attacks Maria and the pair end up in a fountain until they are eventually broken up by Kirk. A few days later, Aidan makes a move on Maria following his break up with Eva but she rebuffs him, saying he's not allowed to pick and choose. Aidan commits suicide in May 2018 and Maria is devastated, especially after how close he became with Liam in his final weeks, including giving him his watch to look after. Maria falls out with Audrey when she refuses to give her any independence at work, and eventually, a heated argument leads to Maria quitting her job at the salon. She is approached by Audrey's competitor, Claudia Colby (Rula Lenska), who offers Maria the chance to invest in and run her own salon which she quickly agrees to. Maria struggles to raise the funds for the investment and is surprised when Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) offers her the money in return for a share of the profits. Maria celebrates with Claudia, Rita and her new housemate Emma Brooker (Alexandra Mardell), whom she had just offered a room to. Maria eventually pulls out of the deal when Claudia attempts to cruelly humiliate Audrey at the annual Hair Salon Awards, which had resulted in a drunken Audrey throwing flowers at Claudia. She has a heart-to-heart with Audrey where she tells Maria that she has always been like a daughter to her, and they make up with the agreement that Maria would become a partner in the salon. In December 2019, she discovers she‚Äôs pregnant with Gary Windass‚Äôs baby, only to have a miscarriage soon after. Casting Maria as she appeared in 2001. Maria was created as a love interest for Tyrone Dobbs, and first appeared working as a kennel maid at her parents' kennels. Auditions were held for the role in 2000, and actress Samia Ghadie beat several rivals, including singers Kimberley Walsh (of Girls Aloud) and Suzanne Shaw (of Hear'Say), to win the part. Describing Maria's development as a character since her arrival on Coronation Street, the official website states: \\"Maria has blossomed from working as a kennel maid to one of the Street's most glamorous young women. She laps up the male attention that her good looks bring her but playing footloose and fancy- free with the men in her life has gained her a bit of a reputation.\\" Jenny Cockle, writing for the Sunday Mirror, has similarly observed that during the character's duration on the show, Maria has evolved from a \\"dowdy kennel maid\\" to a \\"sexy siren\\". Reflecting on her early days at the programme, Ghadie said: \\"I thought I'd do my three months and then I'd be off. I was a jobbing actress when I joined and was really pleased to have a job for three months. I never imagined I'd still be here now.\\" Since her arrival at Coronation Street Samia Smith has revealed that she will always be grateful for the opportunities she has been given since she joined. In 2012, Ghadie revealed that she would like to stay at Coronation Street for another ten years, she said to OK! magazine: \\"I'd be very happy if I was still in Corrie in ten years' time. I think because of everything that has happened in the last few years I'm trying not to plan too much ahead. I am happy for each day\\". She also confirmed that she had signed another contract that would keep her in the show til September 2013. Ghadie revealed that it does not feel like she has been on the show for 12 years: \\"I'm 30 in July so it's quite scary, really! I was 17 when I joined so it just feels like my life is going really quickly! When I first joined, I was on a three-month contract. I thought I'd do my three months and then I'd be off. I was a jobbing actress when I joined and was really pleased to have a job for three months. I never imagined I'd still be here now, but I'm still really enjoying it. I think the show is going from strength to strength and it's got a brilliant mix of comedy and drama at the moment. For once, I'm involved in the lighter-hearted stuff, so that's nice!\\" Development=Relationships Discussing if Maria and Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) could get back together, she said: \\"She could save him from Kirsty, couldn't she? I really love working with Alan Halsall, who plays Tyrone, because he's like a brother in real life. I've known him forever so it's always good working with him, and I do love Maria and Tyrone scenes.\\" Commenting on the relationship between Maria, Liam and Carla prior to Maria and Liam's wedding, Smith assessed: \\"I think Liam loves Maria but he is in lust with Carla.\\" Asked how she felt about Maria's romance with Tony Gordon, the man responsible for Liam's death, Smith commented: \\"It's freaked me out to be honest! It is a bit creepy, we can't deny that, considering everything that's happened between them! I think the writers have done a brilliant job in making it a slow burner and making it as realistic as possible to allow them to fall for each other. They have actually got quite a bit in common. They've both had their hearts broken by two people who they were very close to and considered the loves of their lives. Ultimately, they've forgotten everything that went on earlier this year with the accusations of murder and everything - that's all been brushed under the carpet..\\" Commenting on Maria's relationship with Tony, Smith said: \\"I think Maria genuinely loved Tony. I don't think she feels anything but hatred for him now. She's quite sad thinking about what might have been with him because she actually thought she'd got it all sussed - that she was going to be with him and he was going to be a father to Liam. Her world ended when she found out that he'd murdered her husband.\\" In 2012, Maria began a relationship with ex-boyfriend Jason Grimshaw played by Ryan Thomas, Thomas praised the plot: ‚ÄúShe was one of the first girls he ever went out with. I think he's just done a big round circle and come back. It's been great, I've enjoyed working on it. They've got all the right qualities to last as a couple but you just do not know. Couples do not seem to last too long on Corrie and if they do, there's always things that get in the way of relationships in soaps, so we'll wait and see.‚Äù Ghadie revealed that filming the scenes with Thomas was more awkward than romantic as she and Thomas are good friends and revealed that it was like kissing your brother. Stillbirth Discussing the scenes in which Maria give birth to a stillborn son, Smith described the research she put into filming the storyline to ensure authenticity: \\"It was so important that I got it right and it wasn't too overdramatic. They were both the hardest and easiest scenes I've ever had to do, because the situation was so sad. I was absolutely emotionally drained at the end of it all. The midwife has a lot of experience of attending stillbirths, and she helped me work out how to play it so that it seems real. It scared me personally, though, because the idea of going through something like that is petrifying. They were the most challenging scenes I've ever done.\\" On filming the delivery scene itself, she explained; \\"There was a prosthetic baby, but the director didn't show it to me until filming started so I'd get the full impact. It looked so real and I just broke down.\\" Smith also gave the insight that filming the storyline affected her on a personal level, leading to the discovery her own mother had gone through the same situation: \\"Because of my mum, I wanted to do the scenes well but they left me feeling exhausted and drained. I know mum will be watching it at home, as will thousands of women who've been through it so I need to do it justice for them.\\" In an interview for the Inside Soap Year book 2009, a point was made about the fact nothing nice seems to happen to the character and asked Samia about it, she replied \\"I'd love Maria to be happy for a change! I sometimes wonder if the Corrie scriptwriters think I've got a dodgy smile or something, because Maria hasn't smiled for months\\". Frank Foster and attempted rape In February 2011, It was reported that Kym Marsh who played Michelle Connor was to be written out due to her pregnancy, forcing re-writes to the script instead of Michelle, Maria became involved with Frank Foster (Andrew Lancel). It was reported that Maria would be a victim of a sexual attack by Frank; a Coronation Street source revealed: \\"Time will tell how bad Frank's character will be - but he's a ladies' man and no Weatherfield woman will be safe from his interest. Samia Smith revealed that the storyline would be very dramatic and there would be plenty of tears. Smith also revealed that Maria faces a horrible dilemma, she told All About Soap magazine: \\"She's absolutely terrified. He starts groping her all over and has his hand up her thigh. He basically tries to rape her but she manages to struggle out of his grip and runs from the house screaming and petrified.\\" Smith noted that she was worried about offending people with the storyline: \\"A few years ago my first kind of hard-hitting storyline was when Maria had the stillborn baby and it sort of makes you really hyper-aware that other people have been through it, so you kind of want to do it justice. It's the same with this one really. Sexual assault is a very serious issue, so I want to do it justice and hopefully not offend people who have been sexually assaulted. Caz Hammond In August 2016, it was reported that Maria's current lodger Caz Hammond would hatch her most twisted plan yet as she uses Maria's recent encounter with a burglar to her own advantage. The incident leaves Maria with a nasty injury when she falls and hits her head as the intruder flees, but there's a coincidence when Caz soon shows up and rescues her. Caz deals with the situation perfectly as she tends to Maria's wound and calls the police to report the burglary, then agrees to stay over for the night to keep an eye on Maria. Rhea Bailey, who plays Caz, revealed: \\"Caz is just grateful that she can be there to mop up the aftermath and be a shoulder to cry on for Maria. In some twisted way, I think Caz feels like the hero. She just happened to be around the Street when Maria was burgled. She is sad that this meant Maria had to get hurt, but she's secretly really happy that she can be around and help Maria get over this.\\"  Imprisonment  Maria marries Pablo, who is gay, in order for him to gain a visa. In December 2016, she was consequently imprisoned for 12 months. She was released from prison in March 2017. Reception In 2006, the character won the Inside Soap 'Best Dressed' accolade. Grace Dent, writing for The Guardian, has been highly critical of Maria during her time on the show. In February 2006, she highlighted the unlikeliness of Maria's relationship with Tyrone Dobbs is very romantic, writing: \\"Maria Sutherland is one of those shiny, lithe, capricious, tidily-kept hairdresser girls who flutter around the Trafford Centre's Karen Millen store on Saturdays, trying on sparkly halter frocks, dreaming about snaring Rio Ferdinand. Tyrone Dobbs, on the other hand, looks like one of the Flumps.\\" Following the death of Charlie Stubbs in January 2007, she deemed Maria to be the Street's \\"local loose-knickered simpleton\\", and has also referred to her as being \\"such a tit\\", and \\"a pretty, perky, easily beddable dimwit\\". A writer from TV Magazine noted that most of Maria's men end up dead and quipped \\"Maria is the Street's unlikely black widow and her men often have a bleak future.\\" In August 2017, Longchambon was longlisted for Best Bad Girl at the Inside Soap Awards. She did not progress to the viewer-voted shortlist. Trivia In October 2020, during an interview on Lorraine, Longchambon was asked about Maria's taste in men. Lorraine revealed the team had worked out Maria's \\"bodycount\\" over her 20 year span on the cobbles was 31 men, causing Longchambon to comment \\"My eyes are watering looking at that! I can't believe that! ... That's quite impressive, if that's the right word. I didn't know it was that many!\\" See also *List of Coronation Street characters (2000) *List of soap opera villains ReferencesExternal links *Maria Connor at itv.com Category:Coronation Street characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2000 Category:Fictional hairdressers Category:Fictional beauticians Category:Fictional bartenders Category:Fictional female businesspeople Category:Fictional factory workers Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas Category:Fictional prisoners and detainees Category:Female characters in television Category:Female villains Category:Fictional people from Manchester ","title":"Maria Connor"},{"id":"1892375","text":"James Bonham, circa 1835 James Bonham (February 20, 1807 ‚Äì March 6, 1836) was a 19th-century American soldier who died at the Battle of the Alamo during the Texas Revolution. He was a second cousin of Travis and was a messenger of the Battle of the Alamo. His younger brother, Milledge Luke Bonham, was a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army in the American Civil War, and served as Governor of South Carolina from 1862 to 1864. Early life Bonham was born, along with his sibling (Milledge Luke Bonham) in the Redbank area (present day Lexington County, South Carolina) on February 20, 1807. The son of James and Sophia Butler (Smith) Bonham. Bonham entered South Carolina College in 1824. In 1827, in his senior year, he led a student protest over harsh attendance regulations and the poor food served at the college boardinghouse. He was expelled, along with the entire senior class. In 1830, Bonham practiced law in Pendleton, but was found in contempt of court after caning an attorney who had insulted one of Bonham's clients. When ordered to apologize by the sitting judge, he refused and threatened to tweak the judge‚Äôs nose. Bonham was sentenced to ninety days for contempt of court. He served as an aide to Governor James Hamilton Jr. during the Nullification Crisis in 1832. Bonham brandished a sword and pistol, condemning Andrew Jackson and the Washington politicians. His outspoken position brought him the rank of lieutenant colonel. At the same time he served as captain of a Charleston artillery company. In October 1834, Bonham moved to Montgomery, Alabama, where relatives lived. The following year he went to Mobile, where he helped organize a company of militia cavalry called the Mobile Greys to serve in Texas. The company reached San Felipe, Texas in November 1835, and Bonham was commissioned a lieutenant in the Texian Cavalry on December 3. Texas and the Alamo On December 1, 1835, he wrote to Sam Houston from San Felipe volunteering his services for Texas and declining all pay, lands, or rations in return. In December 1835, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Texas cavalry, but apparently was not assigned to any specific unit. He had time to set up a law practice in Brazoria and was advertising the fact in the Telegraph and Texas Register by January 2, 1836. Bonham and Houston quickly developed a mutual admiration. After being in Texas for only one month Bonham recommended to Houston that William S. Blount of North Carolina be granted a commission as a captain in the Texas cavalry. On January 11, 1836, Houston recommended to James W. Robinson that Bonham be promoted to major, for \\"His influence in the army is great, more so than some who \`would be generals'.\\" Bonham probably traveled to San Antonio de B√©xar and the Alamo with James Bowie and arrived on January 19, 1836. On January 26 he was appointed one of a committee of seven to draft a preamble and resolutions on behalf of the garrison in support of Governor Henry Smith. On February 1 he was an unsuccessful candidate in the election of delegates to represent the Bexar garrison at the Texas constitutional convention. He was sent by Travis to obtain aid for the garrison at Bexar on about February 16, 1836. He visited Goliad, but the commander of the forces there, James Fannin, was unable to provide assistance. Bonham's inimitable spirit is best described by T.R. Fehrenbach in his Texas opus, Lone Star: A History of Texas and the Texans: \\"\\"At the end, the weary Bonham, a lawyer, a Carolinian of exulted family and a friend of Travis, turned his mount around and rode back toward San Antonio. He was told it was useless to throw away his life. He answered back that Buck Travis deserved to know the answer to his appeals, spat upon the ground, and galloped west into his own immortality.\\" Thus, Bonham returned to the Alamo on March 3, bearing through the Mexican lines a letter from Robert McAlpin Williamson assuring Travis that help was on its way and urging him to hold out. Bonham died in the battle of the Alamo on March 6, 1836. James Bonham was 29 at the time, he is believed to have died manning one of the cannons in the interior of the Alamo chapel. Legacy James Butler Bonham Elementary School, San Antonio, TX The town of Bonham, Texas, is named for him. Bonham is the county seat of Fannin County, named for the commander who Bonham tried to enjoin for assistance at the Alamo. A 1936 Texas Centennial Marker was placed on the courthouse square in the city of Bonham. The monument displays a statue of Bonham by Texas sculptor Allie Tennant. Many Texas schools are named after James Bonham, for example, in the cities of Abilene, Amarillo, Bryan, Dallas, El Paso, Houston, McAllen, Midland, Odessa, San Angelo, San Antonio, and Temple. \\"Flat Grove,\\" Bonham's home in Saluda, is the only known birthplace of an Alamo defender still in existence. It is maintained as a museum. Texas A&M; University and Bonham's alma mater, the University of South Carolina began an SEC cross-divisional rivalry in 2014 with both schools competing for the Bonham trophy.https://www.sbnation.com/college- football/2016/9/30/13067130/texas-am-south-carolina-rivalry-history-trophy See also * Bonham House * List of Alamo defenders ReferencesSources *James Butler Bonham Messenger of Defeat, William N.

They also occur on platelets, but not on red blood cells. Their function is to display peptide fragments of proteins from within the cell to cytotoxic T cells; this will trigger an immediate response from the immune system against a particular non-self antigen displayed with the help of an MHC class I protein. Because MHC class I molecules present peptides derived from cytosolic proteins, the pathway of MHC class I presentation is often called cytosolic or endogenous pathway.http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/H/HLA.html#Class_I_Histocompatibility_Molecules Kimball's Biology Pages, Histocompatibility Molecules In humans, the HLAs corresponding to MHC class I are HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C.  Function  Class I MHC molecules bind peptides generated mainly from degradation of cytosolic proteins by the proteasome. The MHC I:peptide complex is then inserted via endoplasmic reticulum into the external plasma membrane of the cell. The epitope peptide is bound on extracellular parts of the class I MHC molecule. Thus, the function of the class I MHC is to display intracellular proteins to cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). However, class I MHC can also present peptides generated from exogenous proteins, in a process known as cross-presentation. A normal cell will display peptides from normal cellular protein turnover on its class I MHC, and CTLs will not be activated in response to them due to central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms. When a cell expresses foreign proteins, such as after viral infection, a fraction of the class I MHC will display these peptides on the cell surface. Consequently, CTLs specific for the MHC:peptide complex will recognize and kill presenting cells. Alternatively, class I MHC itself can serve as an inhibitory ligand for natural killer cells (NKs). Reduction in the normal levels of surface class I MHC, a mechanism employed by some viruses and certain tumors to evade CTL responses, activates NK cell killing. PirB and visual plasticity Paired-immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB), an MHCI-binding receptor, is involved in the regulation of visual plasticity. PirB is expressed in the central nervous system and diminishes ocular dominance plasticity in the developmental critical period and adulthood. When the function of PirB was abolished in mutant mice, ocular dominance plasticity became more pronounced at all ages. PirB loss of function mutant mice also exhibited enhanced plasticity after monocular deprivation during the critical period. These results suggest PirB may be involved in modulation of synaptic plasticity in the visual cortex.  Structure  MHC class I molecules are heterodimers that consist of two polypeptide chains, Œ± and Œ≤2-microglobulin (B2M). The two chains are linked noncovalently via interaction of B2M and the Œ±3 domain. Only the Œ± chain is polymorphic and encoded by a HLA gene, while the B2M subunit is not polymorphic and encoded by the Beta-2 microglobulin gene. The Œ±3 domain is plasma membrane-spanning and interacts with the CD8 co-receptor of T-cells. The Œ±3-CD8 interaction holds the MHC I molecule in place while the T cell receptor (TCR) on the surface of the cytotoxic T cell binds its Œ±1-Œ±2 heterodimer ligand, and checks the coupled peptide for antigenicity. The Œ±1 and Œ±2 domains fold to make up a groove for peptides to bind. MHC class I molecules bind peptides that are predominantly 8-10 amino acid in length (Parham 87), but the binding of longer peptides have also been reported. Synthesis Simplified diagram of cytoplasmic protein degradation by the proteasome, transport into endoplasmic reticulum by TAP complex, loading on MHC class I, and transport to the surface for presentation The peptides are generated mainly in the cytosol by the proteasome. The proteasome is a macromolecule that consists of 28 subunits, of which half affect proteolytic activity. The proteasome degrades intracellular proteins into small peptides that are then released into the cytosol. Proteasomes can also ligate distinct peptide fragments (termed spliced peptides), producing sequences that are noncontiguous and therefore not linearly templated in the genome. The origin of spliced peptide segments can be from the same protein (cis-splicing) or different proteins (trans- splicing). The peptides have to be translocated from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to meet the MHC class I molecule, whose peptide- binding site is in the lumen of the ER. They have membrane proximal Ig fold Translocation and peptide loading The peptide translocation from the cytosol into the lumen of the ER is accomplished by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). TAP is a member of the ABC transporter family and is a heterodimeric multimembrane-spanning polypeptide consisting of TAP1 and TAP2. The two subunits form a peptide binding site and two ATP binding sites that face the cytosol. TAP binds peptides on the cytoplasmic side and translocates them under ATP consumption into the lumen of the ER. The MHC class I molecule is then, in turn, loaded with peptides in the lumen of the ER. The peptide-loading process involves several other molecules that form a large multimeric complex called the Peptide loading complex consisting of TAP, tapasin, calreticulin, calnexin, and Erp57 (PDIA3). Calnexin acts to stabilize the class I MHC Œ± chains prior to Œ≤2m binding. Following complete assembly of the MHC molecule, calnexin dissociates. The MHC molecule lacking a bound peptide is inherently unstable and requires the binding of the chaperones calreticulin and Erp57. Additionally, tapasin binds to the MHC molecule and serves to link it to the TAP proteins and facilitates the selection of peptide in an iterative process called peptide editing, thus facilitating enhanced peptide loading and colocalization. Once the peptide is loaded onto the MHC class I molecule, the complex dissociates and it leaves the ER through the secretory pathway to reach the cell surface. The transport of the MHC class I molecules through the secretory pathway involves several posttranslational modifications of the MHC molecule. Some of the posttranslational modifications occur in the ER and involve change to the N-glycan regions of the protein, followed by extensive changes to the N-glycans in the Golgi apparatus. The N-glycans mature fully before they reach the cell surface. Peptide removal Peptides that fail to bind MHC class I molecules in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are removed from the ER via the sec61 channel into the cytosol, where they might undergo further trimming in size, and might be translocated by TAP back into ER for binding to a MHC class I molecule. For example, an interaction of sec61 with bovine albumin has been observed. Effect of viruses MHC class I molecules are loaded with peptides generated from the degradation of ubiquitinated cytosolic proteins in proteasomes. As viruses induce cellular expression of viral proteins, some of these products are tagged for degradation, with the resulting peptide fragments entering the endoplasmic reticulum and binding to MHC I molecules. It is in this way, the MHC class I-dependent pathway of antigen presentation, that the virus infected cells signal T-cells that abnormal proteins are being produced as a result of infection. The fate of the virus-infected cell is almost always induction of apoptosis through cell-mediated immunity, reducing the risk of infecting neighboring cells. As an evolutionary response to this method of immune surveillance, many viruses are able to down-regulate or otherwise prevent the presentation of MHC class I molecules on the cell surface. In contrast to cytotoxic T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells are normally inactivated upon recognizing MHC I molecules on the surface of cells. Therefore, in the absence of MHC I molecules, NK cells are activated and recognize the cell as aberrant, suggesting that it may be infected by viruses attempting to evade immune destruction. Several human cancers also show down-regulation of MHC I, giving transformed cells the same survival advantage of being able to avoid normal immune surveillance designed to destroy any infected or transformed cells. Genes and isotypes * Very polymorphic ** (HLA-A) ** (HLA-B) ** (HLA-C) * Less polymorphic ** (HLA-E) ** (HLA-F) ** (HLA-G) ** (pseudogene) ** (pseudogene)  Evolutionary history  The MHC class I genes originated in the most recent common ancestor of all jawed vertebrates, and have been found in all living jawed vertebrates that have been studied thus far. Since their emergence in jawed vertebrates, this gene family has been subjected to many divergent evolutionary paths as speciation events have taken place. There are, however, documented cases of trans-species polymorphisms in MHC class I genes, where a particular allele in an evolutionary related MHC class I gene remains in two species, likely due to strong pathogen-mediated balancing selection by pathogens that can infect both species. Birth-and-death evolution is one of the mechanistic explanations for the size of the MHC class I gene family.  Birth-and-death of MHC class I genes  Birth-and-death evolution asserts that gene duplication events cause the genome to contain multiple copies of a gene which can then undergo separate evolutionary processes. Sometimes these processes result in pseudogenization (death) of one copy of the gene, though sometimes this process results in two new genes with divergent function. It is likely that human MHC class Ib loci (HLA-E, -F, and -G) as well as MHC class I pseudogenes arose from MHC class Ia loci (HLA-A, -B, and -C) in this birth- and-death process.

In his career, he performed in North America, Europe, and Japan under a variety of gimmicks, including in multiple stints in World Championship Wrestling as Rage as one half of the team The Wrecking Crew with Fury, Blade as one half of the Master Blasters with Steel, and finally as a singles wrestler as The Dog. Career Green was trained for a professional wrestling career by Steve Keirn, making his debut in 1990 as Blade, one half of The Master Blasters tag team alongside Kevin Nash. The Master Blasters On September 22, 1990 Blade was a replacement for Iron, who left World Championship Wrestling after only one match. The reconstituted Master Blasters continued their undefeated streak in October. Meanwhile, Kevin Nash would have his first singles match on September 28, defeating Tom Zenk in Baltimore, Maryland. At Halloween Havoc on October 27, 1990, in Chicago, Illinois the Blasters upended The Southern Boys and began to move up the WCW tag-team ratings. However their winning streak would finally come to an end on November 22 at the Omni in Atlanta, Georgia when Tom Zenk & Brian Pillman handed them their first defeat (Pillman pinning Blade). They rebounded to go on another undefeated streak, defeating The Southern Boys as well as Alan Iron Eagle & Tim Horner and earning a US Tag-Team title shot against the champions The Steiner Brothers. The Steiners however were victorious in matches on December 25 and December 26. They were pinned as well on television in 52 seconds by the Steiners in a match that aired on WCW Worldwide on February 2, 1991. Following this loss their momentum began to dissipate as the Blasters would suffer follow-up losses to the Southern Boys and Ricky Morton and Tommy Rich. The team disbanded at the end of the month, with Nash briefly continuing to wrestle simply as \\"The Master Blaster\\" until being given the new gimmick of \\"Oz\\" in May 1991. Meanwhile, Green would leave WCW to compete for Florida Championship Wrestling in The Bounty Hunters tag team as Bounty Hunter #1. The team won the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship in November, but when Green's partner (Tim Parker) was injured, The Terminator stepped in and defended the tag team titles with Green. The team held the gold until the Nasty Boys beat them on a card in Nassau, Bahamas on January 6, 1991. The Wrecking Crew While the team with The Terminator was a makeshift team at first, but they began teaming regularly first under the name The Terminators then later on as The Wrecking Crew where the Terminator became known as Fury and Al was renamed Rage. The team competed for the International Wrestling Federation based in Florida showing themselves to be a force in the tag team division. On May 28, 1992, the duo beat IWF Tag Team Champions The Long Riders (Brett Colt and Kip Winchester). By late 1992 the Wrecking Crew got signed by World Championship Wrestling, making their debut in January 1993. Shortly after their debut the Wrecking Crew got national exposure by competing at Clash of the Champions XXII on January 13 where they defeated Tom Zenk and Johnny Gunn. After their success at the Clash the team rode on a wave of success defeating Gunn and Zenk repeatedly, as well as looking impressive against temporary teams such as 2 Cold Scorpio and Johnny B. Badd, and Marcus Bagwell and Joey Maggs. By March the team was contesting a series of matches with future WCW World Tag Team Champions 2 Cold Scorpio and Marcus Alexander Bagwell as well as feuding with the identical twin duo known as The Cole Twins (Keith and Kent Cole). The feud with the Cole Twins was soon expanded to also include Bagwell and Scorpio as well as Tex Slazenger and Shanghai Pierce. As the feud wore on the Cole Twins got the upper hand in the feud over the two big men. The Wrecking Crew also faced Cactus Jack and The Barbarian in a series of house show matches. As Summer turned to fall the Wrecking Crew‚Äôs time with WCW ended, returning to the independent scene. In 1994 the Wrecking Crew traveled to Europe to work for Otto Wanz‚Äô Catch Wrestling Association. On July 24 they defeated David Finlay and John Hawk in the finals of a tournament to crown new CWA Tag Team Champions after Larry Cameron had died during a match. Fury and Rage held the belts for only three weeks before being unseated by CWA regulars August Smisl and Ulf Herman in Vienna, Austria. In 1995 the Wrecking Crew toured with All Japan Pro Wrestling over the summer being put over young teams like Kentaro Shiga and Mannukea Mossman. The highlight of their summer tour was a clash with multiple time All Asia Tag Team Champions Doug Furnas and Dan Kroffat which the Wrecking Crew lost. Return to WCW Green performed in WCW during the late 1990s, mainly on low level programs like WCW Saturday Night. On August 31, 1998 he faced Goldberg in a losing effort in the co-main event of WCW Monday Nitro. While doing guest commentary, Kevin Nash made reference to Green being a former tag team partner of his (also making a pun of his name, relating to the more famous singer Al Green). In 2000, he was repackaged as The Dog when he formed a hardcore tag team managed by Fit Finlay with former Nasty Boy Brian Knobs. Green's mannerisms in this gimmick were those of a stereotypical attack dog and would have habits not unlike dogs, including drinking from the toilet. He was a last minute replacement in their group for Sabu, who couldn't start for WCW due to contract issues. Upon the acquisition of WCW by the World Wrestling Federation in early 2001, Green's contract was one of the assets not taken. Other appearances Green made appearances for the short lived WXO in 2000 under a mask. Green's last television appearances were as a guest on the reality shows Hogan Knows Best and Brooke Knows Best on VH1. Death Green died on June 14, 2013, at the age of 57. He had been suffering from COPD for some time before his death.

Additionally, he is a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, the party's top decision making body. In his earlier political career, he served as the Communist Party Secretary of Qinghai, the party secretary of Shaanxi, and the head of the Organization Department of the Communist Party of China. He entered the Politburo in 2012, and was promoted to the Standing Committee five years later. Biography=Early life Zhao Leji was born in Xining, Qinghai province. His parents were from Xi'an, Shaanxi province. The family moved to Qinghai as part of the aid the frontiers programs of the Mao years. During the later years of the Cultural Revolution, Zhao went to the countryside to perform manual labour on a commune. After working there for about a year, Zhao returned to the city to become a communications assistant at the Commerce Department of Qinghai province. Zhao joined the Communist Party in 1975 and entered Peking University in 1977 as a gongnongbing student; he studied philosophy there until January 1980. He then spent three years teaching at the Qinghai School of Commerce and overseeing the Communist Youth League wing of the provincial department of commerce. In 1985, he was transferred to a Qinghai-based metal products company to be its party chief. In April 1986, he became deputy head of the provincial department of commerce. Qinghai Zhao entered the provincial government in 1993, becoming part of the inner circle of then Qinghai party secretary Yin Kesheng. He was then elevated to vice-governor, then Communist Party Secretary of his hometown Xining. He acceded to the post of governor in 1999 at age 42, becoming the youngest provincial governor in the country at the time. Having 'jumped' several levels in a short period of time, Zhao's upward trajectory began to slow by the turn of the century. Zhao became party chief of Qinghai in 2003 after having spent nearly five years in the Governor's office. Part of his inability to move to a more economically prosperous and more politically visible province was attributed to his Shaanxi background. He spoke in Shaanxi dialect even at government meetings. Zhao's tenure in Qinghai was marked by rapid economic growth, and a tripling of the province's GDP from the time he took office as Governor to when he left as party chief in 2007. It was said that Zhao took a relatively soft approach on ethnic minority issues and took on environmentally conscious investment projects. His achievements in Qinghai were lauded by the party's central leadership. Shaanxi In 2007, Zhao was transferred to become party secretary in his parents' home province of Shaanxi, having taken on the top jobs in both his 'native' province and the province of his birth, breaking an unspoken rule in the Communist Party that party chiefs should never hail from the province they are native to. This was seen as an indication of the trust shown to Zhao by the central leadership. In 2008, Shaanxi's GDP growth figures hit 15%, becoming one of only two provincial-level divisions to set sights on GDP growth rates of over 13%. In Shaanxi, Zhao oversaw the expansion and development of the GuanZhong-TianShui(ÂÖ≥‰∏≠-Â§©Ê∞¥) economic belt. After the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in November 2012, he was appointed member of the Politburo and head of the Organization Department of the Communist Party of China. Zhao was a member of the 16th and 17th Central Committee and the 18th Politburo of the Communist Party of China. Politburo Standing Committee Zhao was chosen to be a member of the 19th Politburo Standing Committee, China's top decision-making body, at the 1st Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on 25 October 2017. In the same Session, he succeeded Wang Qishan to become the Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party's highest internal-control institution that has been noted for executing Xi's anti-corruption campaign.

It looks at specific, learned behaviours and how the environment, or other people's mental states, influences those behaviours, and consists of techniques based on learning theory, such as respondent or operant conditioning. Behaviourists who practice these techniques are either behaviour analysts or cognitive-behavioural therapists.O'Leary, K. Daniel, and G. Terence Wilson. Behaviour Therapy: Application and Outcome, 7-12. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1975. Print. They tend to look for treatment outcomes that are objectively measurable.O'Leary, K. Daniel, and G. Terence Wilson. Behaviour Therapy: Application and Outcome, 12-14. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1975. Print. Behaviour therapy does not involve one specific method but it has a wide range of techniques that can be used to treat a person's psychological problems.Antony, M.M., & Roemer, E. (2003). Behaviour therapy. In A.S. Gurman & S.B. Messer (Eds.), Essential psychotherapies (2nd ed., pp. 182-223). New York: Guilford. Behavioural psychotherapy is sometimes juxtaposed with cognitive psychotherapy, while cognitive behavioural therapy integrates aspects of both approaches, such as cognitive restructuring, positive reinforcement, habituation (or desensitisation), counterconditioning, and modelling. Applied behaviour analysis (ABA) is the application of behaviour analysis that focuses on functionally assessing how behaviour is influenced by the observable learning environment and how to change such behaviour through contingency management or exposure therapies, which are used throughout clinical behaviour analysis therapies or other interventions based on the same learning principles. Cognitive-behavioural therapy views cognition and emotions as preceding overt behaviour and implements treatment plans in psychotherapy to lessen the issue by managing competing thoughts and emotions, often in conjunction with behavioural learning principles. A 2013 Cochrane review comparing behaviour therapies to psychological therapies found them to be equally effective, although at the time the evidence base that evaluates the benefits and harms of behaviour therapies was felt to be weak. History Precursors of certain fundamental aspects of behaviour therapy have been identified in various ancient philosophical traditions, particularly Stoicism. For example, Wolpe and Lazarus wrote, The first use of the term behaviour modification appears to have been by Edward Thorndike in 1911. His article Provisional Laws of Acquired Behavior or Learning makes frequent use of the term \\"modifying behavior\\". Through early research in the 1940s and the 1950s the term was used by Joseph Wolpe's research group.Wolpe (1958) Psychotherapy by Reciprocal Inhibition The experimental tradition in clinical psychologyIn A.J. Bachrach (Ed.), Experimental foundations of clinical psychology (pp. 3‚Äì25). New York: Basic Books used it to refer to psycho-therapeutic techniques derived from empirical research. It has since come to refer mainly to techniques for increasing adaptive behaviour through reinforcement and decreasing maladaptive behaviour through extinction or punishment (with emphasis on the former). Two related terms are behaviour therapy and applied behaviour analysis. Since techniques derived from behavioural psychology tend to be the most effective in altering behaviour, most practitioners consider behaviour modification along with behaviour therapy and applied behaviour analysis to be founded in behaviourism. While behaviour modification and applied behaviour analysis typically uses interventions based on the same behavioural principles, many behaviour modifiers who are not applied behaviour analysts tend to use packages of interventions and do not conduct functional assessments before intervening. Possibly the first occurrence of the term \\"behavior therapy\\" was in a 1953 research project by B.F. Skinner, Ogden Lindsley, Nathan Azrin and Harry C. Solomon. The paper talked about operant conditioning and how it could be used to help improve the functioning of people who were diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia. Early pioneers in behaviour therapy include Joseph Wolpe and Hans Eysenck. In general, behaviour therapy is seen as having three distinct points of origin: South Africa (Wolpe's group), The United States (Skinner), and the United Kingdom (Rachman and Eysenck). Each had its own distinct approach to viewing behaviour problems. Eysenck in particular viewed behaviour problems as an interplay between personality characteristics, environment, and behaviour.Yates, A.J.(1970). Behavior Therapy. New York Wiley Skinner's group in the United States took more of an operant conditioning focus. The operant focus created a functional approach to assessment and interventions focused on contingency management such as the token economy and behavioural activation. Skinner's student Ogden Lindsley is credited with forming a movement called precision teaching, which developed a particular type of graphing program called the standard celeration chart to monitor the progress of clients. Skinner became interested in the individualising of programs for improved learning in those with or without disabilities and worked with Fred S. Keller to develop programmed instruction. Programmed instruction had some clinical success in aphasia rehabilitation.Goldfarb, R. (2006). Operant Conditioning and Programmed Instruction in Aphasia Rehabilitation. SLP-ABA, 1(1), 56‚Äì65 BAO Gerald Patterson used programme instruction to develop his parenting text for children with conduct problems.Patterson, G.R. (1969). Families: A social learning approach to family life. (See Parent management training.) With age, respondent conditioning appears to slow but operant conditioning remains relatively stable.Perlmutter, M. & Hall, E. (1985). Adult development and aging. New York: John Wiley. While the concept had its share of advocates and critics in the west, its introduction in the Asian setting, particularly in India in the early 1970s and its grand success were testament to the famous Indian psychologist H. Narayan Murthy's enduring commitment to the principles of behavioural therapy and biofeedback. While many behaviour therapists remain staunchly committed to the basic operant and respondent paradigm, in the second half of the 20th century, many therapists coupled behaviour therapy with the cognitive therapy, of Aaron Beck, Albert Ellis, and Donald Meichenbaum to form cognitive behaviour therapy. In some areas the cognitive component had an additive effect (for example, evidence suggests that cognitive interventions improve the result of social phobia treatment.) but in other areas it did not enhance the treatment, which led to the pursuit of third generation behaviour therapies. Third generation behaviour therapy uses basic principles of operant and respondent psychology but couples them with functional analysis and a clinical formulation/case conceptualisation of verbal behaviour more inline with view of the behaviour analysts. Some research supports these therapies as being more effective in some cases than cognitive therapy,Block, J.A. & Wulfert, E. (2000) Acceptance or Change: Treating Socially Anxious College Students with ACT or CBGT. The Behavior Analyst Today, 1(2), 3‚Äì10. BAO but overall the question is still in need of answers.√ñst, L.G. (2008). \\"Efficacy of the third wave of behavioral therapies: a systematic review and meta-analysis\\". Behaviour Research and Therapy, 46(3), 296‚Äì321 Theoretical basis The behavioural approach to therapy assumes that behaviour that is associated with psychological problems develops through the same processes of learning that affects the development of other behaviours. Therefore, behaviourists see personality problems in the way that personality was developed. They do not look at behaviour disorders as something a person has, but consider that it reflects how learning has influenced certain people to behave in a certain way in certain situations. Behaviour therapy is based upon the principles of classical conditioning developed by Ivan Pavlov and operant conditioning developed by B.F. Skinner. Classical conditioning happens when a neutral stimulus comes right before another stimulus that triggers a reflexive response. The idea is that if the neutral stimulus and whatever other stimulus that triggers a response is paired together often enough that the neutral stimulus will produce the reflexive response.Schaefer, Halmuth H., and Patrick L. Martin. Behavioral Therapy, 20. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969. Print. Operant conditioning has to do with rewards and punishments and how they can either strengthen or weaken certain behaviours.Schaefer, Halmuth H., and Patrick L. Martin. Behavioral Therapy, 20-24. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969. Print. Contingency management programs are a direct product of research from operant conditioning. Current forms Behavioural therapy based on operant and respondent principles has considerable evidence base to support its usage.William O'Donohue and Kyle E. Ferguson (2006): Evidence-Based Practice in Psychology and Behavior Analysis. The Behavior Analyst Today, 7(3), pp. 335‚Äì50 BAO This approach remains a vital area of clinical psychology and is often termed clinical behavior analysis.

The Behavior Analyst Today, 3(3), 254‚Äì8 and draws heavily on radical behaviourism and functional contextualism. Functional analytic psychotherapy holds to a process model of research, which makes it unique compared to traditional behaviour therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy.Gifford, E.

The Behavior Analyst Today, 3(3), 265‚Äì70 Functional analytic psychotherapy has a strong research support. Recent functional analytic psychotherapy research efforts are focusing on management of aggressive inpatients.Michael Daffern (2007) Assessing The Functions Of Aggression In Psychiatric Inpatients. The Behavior Analyst Today, Volume 8, No. 1, 43‚Äì51 BAO Assessment Behaviour therapists complete a functional analysis or a functional assessment that looks at four important areas: stimulus, organism, response and consequences.Nelson, R.O., & Hayes, S.C. (1986). The nature of behavioural assessment. In R.O. Nelson & S.C. Hayes (Eds.) Conceptual foundations of behavioural assessment (pp. 3-41). New York: Guilford. The stimulus is the condition or environmental trigger that causes behaviour.Wolpe, Joseph. The Practice of Behavior Therapy. pp 13. 3rd ed. New York: Pergamon, 1982. Print. An organism involves the internal responses of a person, like physiological responses, emotions and cognition. A response is the behaviour that a person exhibits and the consequences are the result of the behaviour. These four things are incorporated into an assessment done by the behaviour therapist. Most behaviour therapists use objective assessment methods like structured interviews, objective psychological tests or different behavioural rating forms. These types of assessments are used so that the behaviour therapist can determine exactly what a client's problem may be and establish a baseline for any maladaptive responses that the client may have. By having this baseline, as therapy continues this same measure can be used to check a client's progress, which can help determine if the therapy is working. Behaviour therapists do not typically ask the why questions but tend to be more focused on the how, when, where and what questions. Tests such as the Rorschach inkblot test or personality tests like the MMPI (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory) are not commonly used for behavioural assessment because they are based on personality trait theory assuming that a person's answer to these methods can predict behaviour. Behaviour assessment is more focused on the observations of a persons behaviour in their natural environment.O'Leary, K. Daniel, and G. Terence Wilson. Behaviour Therapy: Application and Outcome, 24-25. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1975. Print. Behavioural assessment specifically attempts to find out what the environmental and self-imposed variables are. These variables are the things that are allowing a person to maintain their maladaptive feelings, thoughts and behaviours. In a behavioural assessment \\"person variables\\" are also considered. These \\"person variables\\" come from a person's social learning history and they affect the way in which the environment affects that person's behaviour. An example of a person variable would be behavioural competence. Behavioural competence looks at whether a person has the appropriate skills and behaviours that are necessary when performing a specific response to a certain situation or stimuli. When making a behavioural assessment the behaviour therapist wants to answer two questions: (1) what are the different factors (environmental or psychological) that are maintaining the maladaptive behaviour and (2) what type of behaviour therapy or technique that can help the individual improve most effectively. The first question involves looking at all aspects of a person, which can be summed up by the acronym BASIC ID. This acronym stands for behaviour, affective responses, sensory reactions, imagery, cognitive processes, interpersonal relationships and drug use.O'Leary, K. Daniel, and G. Terence Wilson. Behavior Therapy: Application and Outcome, pp, 19. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1975. Print. Clinical applications Behaviour therapy based its core interventions on functional analysis.

Behaviour Research and Therapy, 5, 357‚Äì65 Functional analysis has even been applied to problems that therapists commonly encounter like client resistance, partially engaged clients and involuntary clients.Cautilli, J.; Tillman, T.C.; Axelrod, S.; Dziewolska, H. & Hineline, P. (2006).

IJBCT, 1(2), 147‚Äì64 BAO Applications to these problems have left clinicians with considerable tools for enhancing therapeutic effectiveness. One way to enhance therapeutic effectiveness is to use positive reinforcement or operant conditioning. Although behaviour therapy is based on the general learning model, it can be applied in a lot of different treatment packages that can be specifically developed to deal with problematic behaviours. Some of the more well known types of treatments are: Relaxation training, systematic desensitization, virtual reality exposure, exposure and response prevention techniques, social skills training, modelling, behavioural rehearsal and homework, and aversion therapy and punishment. Relaxation training involves clients learning to lower arousal to reduce their stress by tensing and releasing certain muscle groups throughout their body.Bernstein, D.A., Borkovec, T.D., & Hazlette-Stevens, H. (2000). Progressive relaxation training: A manual for the helping professions (2nd ed.). New York: Praeger. Systematic desensitization is a treatment in which the client slowly substitutes a new learned response for a maladaptive response by moving up a hierarchy of situations involving fear.Wolpe, J. (1958). Psychotherapy by reciprocal inhibition. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press. Systematic desensitization is based in part on counter conditioning. Counter conditioning is learning new ways to change one response for another and in the case of desensitization it is substituting that maladaptive behaviour for a more relaxing behaviour.Rimm, David C., and John C. Masters. Behavior Therapy: Techniques and Empirical Findings, pp. 43. New York: Academic, 1974. Print. Exposure and response prevention techniques (also known as flooding and response prevention)Rimm, David C., and John C. Masters. Behavior Therapy: Techniques and Empirical Findings, pp. 348. New York: Academic, 1974. Print. is the general technique in which a therapist exposes an individual to anxiety-provoking stimuli while keeping them from having any avoidance responses. Virtual reality therapy provides realistic, computer- based simulations of troublesome situations. The modelling process involves a person being subjected to watching other individuals who demonstrate behaviour that is considered adaptive and that should be adopted by the client. This exposure involves not only the cues of the \\"model person\\" as well as the situations of a certain behaviour that way the relationship can be seen between the appropriateness of a certain behaviour and situation in which that behaviour occurs is demonstrated.Rimm, David C., and John C. Masters. Behavior Therapy: Techniques and Empirical Findings, 125-126. New York: Academic, 1974. Print. With the behavioural rehearsal and homework treatment a client gets a desired behaviour during a therapy session and then they practice and record that behaviour between their sessions. Aversion therapy and punishment is a technique in which an aversive (painful or unpleasant) stimulus is used to decrease unwanted behaviours from occurring. It is concerned with two procedures: 1) the procedures are used to decrease the likelihood of the frequency of a certain behaviour and 2) procedures that will reduce the attractiveness of certain behaviours and the stimuli that elicit them.Rimm, David C., and John C. Masters. Behavior Therapy: Techniques and Empirical Findings, pp. 353. New York: Academic, 1974. Print. The punishment side of aversion therapy is when an aversive stimulus is presented at the same time that a negative stimulus and then they are stopped at the same time when a positive stimulus or response is presented.Bellack, Alan S., and Michel Hersen. Dictionary of Behavior Therapy Techniques, pp. 14. New York: Pergamon, 1985. Print. Examples of the type of negative stimulus or punishment that can be used is shock therapy treatments,Rimm, David C., and John C. Masters. Behavior Therapy: Techniques and Empirical Findings, pp. 374.

Print. as well as response cost contingent punishment which involves taking away a reward. Applied behaviour analysis is using behavioural methods to modify certain behaviours that are seen as being important socially or personally. There are four main characteristics of applied behaviour analysis. First behaviour analysis is focused mainly on overt behaviours in an applied setting. Treatments are developed as a way to alter the relationship between those overt behaviours and their consequences.Agras, W. Stewart., Alan E. Kazdin, and G. Terence Wilson. Behavior Therapy: Toward an Applied Clinical Science. San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1979. Print. Another characteristic of applied behaviour analysis is how it (behaviour analysis) goes about evaluating treatment effects. The individual subject is where the focus of study is on, the investigation is centred on the one individual being treated. A third characteristic is that it focuses on what the environment does to cause significant behaviour changes. Finally the last characteristic of applied behaviour analysis is the use of those techniques that stem from operant and classical conditioning such as providing reinforcement, punishment, stimulus control and any other learning principles that may apply. Social skills training teaches clients skills to access reinforcers and lessen life punishment. Operant conditioning procedures in meta-analysis had the largest effect size for training social skills, followed by modelling, coaching, and social cognitive techniques in that order.Schnieder, B.H. & Bryne, B.M. (1985). Children's social skills training: A meta-analysis. In B.H. Schneider, K. Rubin, & J.E. Ledingham (Eds.) Children's Peer relations: Issues in assessment and intervention (pp. 175‚Äì90). New York: Springer-Verlag. Social skills training has some empirical support particularly for schizophrenia.Corrigan, P.W. (1997). Behavior therapy empowers persons with severe mental illness. Behavior Modification, 21, 45‚Äì61Corrigan, P.W. & Holmes, E.P. (1994). Patient identification of \\"street skills\\" for a psychosocial training module. Hospital and Community Psychiatry, 45, 273‚Äì6. However, with schizophrenia, behavioural programs have generally lost favour.Wong, S.E. (2006). Behavior Analysis of Psychotic Disorders: Scientific Dead End or Casualty of the Mental Health Political Economy? Behavior and Social Issues, 15(2), 152‚Äì77 Some other techniques that have been used in behaviour therapy are contingency contracting, response costs, token economies, biofeedback, and using shaping and grading task assignments.Kramer, Geoffrey P., Douglas A. Bernstein, and Vicky Phares. \\"Behavioral and Cognitive-Behavioral Psychotherapies.\\" Introduction to Clinical Psychology. 7th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2009. 269-300. Print. Shaping and graded task assignments are used when behaviour that needs to be learned is complex. The complex behaviours that need to be learned are broken down into simpler steps where the person can achieve small things gradually building up to the more complex behaviour. Each step approximates the eventual goal and helps the person to expand their activities in a gradual way. This behaviour is used when a person feels that something in their lives can not be changed and life's tasks appear to be overwhelming.Freeman, Arthur. \\"Treatment of Suicidal Behavior.\\" Comprehensive Handbook of Cognitive Therapy. New York: Plenum, 1989. Pg. 341. Print. Another technique of behaviour therapy involves holding a client or patient accountable of their behaviours in an effort to change them. This is called a contingency contract, which is a formal written contract between two or more people that defines the specific expected behaviours that you wish to change and the rewards and punishments that go along with that behaviour. In order for a contingency contract to be official it needs to have five elements. First it must state what each person will get if they successfully complete the desired behaviour. Secondly those people involved have to monitor the behaviours. Third, if the desired behaviour is not being performed in the way that was agreed upon in the contract the punishments that were defined in the contract must be done. Fourth if the persons involved are complying with the contract they must receive bonuses. The last element involves documenting the compliance and noncompliance while using this treatment in order to give the persons involved consistent feedback about the target behaviour and the provision of reinforcers.Stuart, Richard B., and Leroy A. Lott, Jr. \\"Behavior Contracting with Delinquents.\\" Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry 3 (1972): 161-69. Print Token economies is a behaviour therapy technique where clients are reinforced with tokens that are considered a type of currency that can be used to purchase desired rewards, like being able to watch television or getting a snack that they want when they perform designated behaviours. Token economies are mainly used in institutional and therapeutic settings. In order for a token economy to be effective there must be consistency in administering the program by the entire staff. Procedures must be clearly defined so that there is no confusion among the clients. Instead of looking for ways to punish the patients or to deny them of rewards, the staff has to reinforce the positive behaviours so that the clients will increase the occurrence of the desired behaviour. Over time the tokens need to be replaced with less tangible rewards such as compliments so that the client will be prepared when they leave the institution and won't expect to get something every time they perform a desired behaviour.Boyle, Scott W. \\"Knowledge and Skills for Intervention.\\" Direct Practice in Social Work. Boston: Pearson/Allyn & Bacon, 2006. 223-225. Print. Closely related to token economies is a technique called response costs. This technique can either be used with or without token economies. Response costs is the punishment side of token economies where there is a loss of a reward or privilege after someone performs an undesirable behaviour. Like token economies this technique is used mainly in institutional and therapeutic settings. Considerable policy implications have been inspired by behavioural views of various forms of psychopathology. One form of behaviour therapy, habit reversal training, has been found to be highly effective for treating tics. In rehabilitation Currently, there is a greater call for behavioural psychologists to be involved in rehabilitation efforts.Gregory C. Murphy & Neville J. King (2007). Clinical data illustrating the need for greater involvement of behaviourally- oriented psychologists in the design and delivery of rehabilitation services. Behavior Analyst Today, 8(3), 273‚Äì83 BAO Treatment of mental disorders Two large studies done by the Faculty of Health Sciences at Simon Fraser University indicates that both behaviour therapy and cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) are equally effective for OCD. CBT has been shown to perform slightly better at treating co-occurring depression.Bechdolf, A., Knost, B., Kuntermann, C., Schiller, S., Klosterkotter, J., Hambrecht, M., & Pukrop, R. (2004). A randomized comparison of group cognitive-behavioural therapy and group psychoeducation in patients with schizophrenia. Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica, 110, 21-28. Considerable policy implications have been inspired by behavioural views of various forms of psychopathology. One form of behaviour therapy (habit reversal training) has been found to be highly effective for treating tics. There has been a development towards combining techniques to treat psychiatric disorders. Cognitive interventions are used to enhance the effects of more established behavioural interventions based on operant and classical conditioning. An increased effort has also been placed to address the interpersonal context of behaviour.Craighead, L.W., Craighead, W.E.(1991). Behavior therapy:recent developments. Department of Psychology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Department of Psychiatry, Duke University Medical Center, and Department of Psychology, Social and Health Sciences, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.url=http://simplelink.library.utoronto.ca/url.cfm/352333 Behaviour therapy can be applied to a number of mental disorders and in many cases is more effective for specific disorders as compared to others. Behaviour therapy techniques can be used to deal with any phobias that a person may have. Desensitization has also been applied to other issues such as dealing with anger, if a person has trouble sleeping and certain speech disorders. Desensitization does not occur over night, there is a process of treatment. Desensitization is done on a hierarchy and happens over a number of sessions. The hierarchy goes from situations that make a person less anxious or nervous up to things that are considered to be extreme for the patient.Rimm, David C., and John C. Masters. Behavior Therapy: Techniques and Empirical Findings, pp. 45. New York: Academic, 1974. Print. Modelling has been used in dealing with fears and phobias. Modelling has been used in the treatment of fear of snakes as well as a fear of water.Rimm, David C., and John C. Masters. Behavior Therapy: Techniques and Empirical Findings, 151-153.

Behavior Therapy: Techniques and Empirical Findings, pp. 411. New York: Academic, 1974. Print. Exposure and prevention procedure techniques can be used to treat people who have anxiety problems as well as any fears or phobias.Bellack, Alan S., and Michel Hersen. Dictionary of Behavior Therapy Techniques, pp. 122. New York: Pergamon, 1985. Print. These procedures have also been used to help people dealing with any anger issues as well as pathological grievers (people who have distressing thoughts about a deceased person).Bellack, Alan S., and Michel Hersen. Dictionary of Behavior Therapy Techniques, pp. 123. New York: Pergamon, 1985. Print. Virtual reality therapy deals with fear of heights,Krijin, M., Emmelkamp, P.M.G., Olafsson, R.P., & Biemond, R. (2004). Virtual reality exposure therapy of anxiety disorders: A review. Clinical Psychology Review, 24, 259-281. fear of flying,Gorman, J.M. (2006). Virtual Reality: A real treatment option. CNS Spectrums, 11, 12-13. and a variety of other anxiety disorders.Klein, R.A. (1999). Treating fear of flying with virtual reality exposure therapy. In L. Vandercreek & T.L. Jackson (Eds.), Innovations in clinical practice: A sourcebook, (Vol. 17). Sarasota, Fl: Professional Resource Press. VRT has also been applied to help people with substance abuse problems reduce their responsiveness to certain cues that trigger their need to use drugs.Rothbaum, B.O. (2006). Virtual reality in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. CNS Spectrums, 11,34. Shaping and graded task assignments has been used in dealing with suicide and depressed or inhibited individuals. This is used when a patient feel hopeless and they have no way of changing their lives. This hopelessness involves how the person reacts and responds to someone else and certain situations and their perceived powerlessness to change that situation that adds to the hopelessness. For a person with suicidal ideation, it is important to start with small steps. Because that person may perceive everything as being a big step, the smaller you start the easier it will be for the person to master each step. This technique has also been applied to people dealing with agoraphobia, or fear of being in public places or doing something embarrassing.Boyle, Scott W. \\"Knowledge and Skills for Intervention.\\" Direct Practice in Social Work. Boston: Pearson/Allyn & Bacon, 2006. Pp. 233 . Print. Contingency contracting has been used to deal with behaviour problems in delinquents and when dealing with on task behaviours in students. Token economies are used in controlled environments and are found mostly in psychiatric hospitals. They can be used to help patients with different mental illnesses but it doesn't focus on the treatment of the mental illness but instead on the behavioural aspects of a patient.Lloyd, Kenneth E., and Warren K. Garlington. \\"Weekly Variations in Performance on a Token Economy Psychiatric Ward.\\" Behaviour Research and Therapy 6.4 (1968): 407-10. Print. The response cost technique has been used to address a variety of behaviours such as smoking, overeating, stuttering, and psychotic talk.Kazdin, Alan E. \\"Response Cost: The Removal of Conditioned Reinforcers for Therapeutic Change.\\" Behavior Therapy 3.4 (1972): 533-46. Web. Treatment outcomes Systematic desensitization has been shown to successfully treat phobias about heights, driving, insects as well as any anxiety that a person may have. Anxiety can include social anxiety, anxiety about public speaking as well as test anxiety. It has been shown that the use of systematic desensitization is an effective technique that can be applied to a number of problems that a person may have.Bellack, Alan S., and Michel Hersen. Dictionary of Behavior Therapy Techniques, pp. 73. New York: Pergamon, 1985. Print. When using modelling procedures this technique is often compared to another behavioural therapy technique. When compared to desensitization, the modelling technique does appear to be less effective.Bellack, Alan S., and Michel Hersen. Dictionary of Behavior Therapy Techniques, pp. 156. New York: Pergamon, 1985. Print. However it is clear that the greater the interaction between the patient and the subject he is modelling the greater the effectiveness of the treatment. While undergoing exposure therapy, a person typically needs five sessions to assess the treatment's effectiveness. After five sessions, exposure treatment has been shown to provide benefit to the patient. However, it is still recommended treatment continue beyond the initial five sessions. Virtual reality therapy (VRT) has shown to be effective for a fear of heights. It has also been shown to help with the treatment of a variety of anxiety disorders. Due to the costs associated with VRT, therapists are still awaiting results of controlled trials investigating VRT, to assess which applications demonstrate the best results.Price, M., & Anderson, P. (2007). The role of presence in virtual reality exposure therapy. Journal of Anxiety Disorders, 21, 724-751. For those with suicidal ideation, treatment depends on how severe the person's depression and sense of hopelessness is. If these things are severe, the person's response to completing small steps will not be of importance to them, because they don't consider the success an accomplishment. Generally, in those not suffering from severe depression or fear, this technique has been successful, as completion of simpler activities builds their confidences and allows them to progress to more complex situations.Boyle, Scott W. \\"Knowledge and Skills for Intervention.\\" Direct Practice in Social Work. Boston: Pearson/Allyn & Bacon, 2006. Pp.232 . Print. Contingency contracts have been seen to be effective in changing any undesired behaviours of individuals. It has been seen to be effective in treating behaviour problems in delinquents regardless of the specific characteristics of the contract. Token economies have been shown to be effective when treating patients in psychiatric wards who had chronic schizophrenia. The results showed that the contingent tokens were controlling the behaviour of the patients. Response costs has been shown to work in suppressing a variety of behaviours such as smoking, overeating or stuttering with a diverse group of clinical populations ranging from sociopaths to school children. These behaviours that have been suppressed using this technique often do not recover when the punishment contingency is withdrawn. Also undesirable side effects that are usually seen with punishment are not typically found when using the response cost technique. Third generation The third-generation behaviour therapy movement has been called clinical behaviour analysis because it represents a movement away from cognitivism and back toward radical behaviourism and other forms of behaviourism, in particular functional analysis and behavioural models of verbal behaviour. This area includes acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), cognitive behavioural analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP) (McCullough, 2000), behavioural activation (BA), functional analytic psychotherapy (FAP), integrative behavioural couples therapy and dialectical behavioural therapy. These approaches are squarely within the applied behaviour analysis tradition of behaviour therapy. ACT may be the most well-researched of all the third-generation behaviour therapy models. It is based on relational frame theory.Blackledge, J.T. (2003). An Introduction to Relational Frame Theory: Basics and Applications. The Behavior Analyst Today, 3(4), 421‚Äì42 BAO Other authors object to the term \\"third generation\\" or \\"third wave\\" and incorporate many of the \\"third wave\\" therapeutic techniques under the general umbrella term of modern cognitive behavioural therapies. Functional analytic psychotherapy is based on a functional analysis of the therapeutic relationship.Kohlenberg, R.J. & Tsai, M. (1991) Functional Analytic Psychotherapy. New York: Plenum It places a greater emphasis on the therapeutic context and returns to the use of in- session reinforcement.Wulfert (2002) Can Contextual Therapies Save Clinical Behavior Analysis? The Behavior Analyst Today, 3(3), 254 BAO In general, 40 years of research supports the idea that in-session reinforcement of behaviour can lead to behavioural change.Cautilli, J.T.; Riley-Tillman, C.; Axelrod S. & Hineline, P. (2005). The Role of Verbal Conditioning in Third Generation Behavior Therapy. The Behavior Analyst Today, 6(2), 138‚Äì57 BAO Behavioural activation emerged from a component analysis of cognitive behaviour therapy. This research found no additive effect for the cognitive component.Jacobson, N.S.; Martell, C.R. & Dimidjian, S. (2001). Behavioral activation treatment for depression: Returning to contextual roots. Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice, 8, 255‚Äì70. Behavioural activation is based on a matching model of reinforcement.Cullen, J.M.; Spates, C.R; Pagoto, S. & Doran, N. (2006). Behavioral Activation Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder: A Pilot Investigation. The Behavior Analyst Today, 7(1), 151‚Äì64. A recent review of the research, supports the notion that the use of behavioural activation is clinically important for the treatment of depression.Spates, C.R.; Pagoto, S. & Kalata, A. (2006). A Qualitative And Quantitative Review of Behavioral Activation Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder. The Behavior Analyst Today, 7(4), 508‚Äì12 BAO Integrative behavioural couples therapy developed from dissatisfaction with traditional behavioural couples therapy. Integrative behavioural couples therapy looks to Skinner (1966) for the difference between contingency-shaped and rule-governed behaviour.Skinner, B.F. (1969). Contingencies of Reinforcement: A Theoretical Analysis. New York: Meredith Corporation. It couples this analysis with a thorough functional assessment of the couple's relationship. Recent efforts have used radical behavioural concepts to interpret a number of clinical phenomena including forgiveness.Cordova, J.; Cautilli, J.D.; Simon, C. & Axelrod-sabag, R. (2006). Behavior Analysis of Forgiveness in Couples Therapy. IJBCT, 2(2), 192‚Äì213 BAO Organisations Many organisations exist for behaviour therapists around the world. The Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI) provides accreditation for training programs in behaviour therapy. The ABAI has a special interest group for practitioner issues, behavioural counselling, and clinical behaviour analysis ABA:I. ABAI has larger special interest groups for autism and its peculiar and narrow interpretation of behavioural medicine. ABAI serves as the core intellectual home for behaviour analysts.Twyman, J.S. (2007). A new era of science and practice in behavior analysis. Association for Behavior Analysis International: Newsletter, 30(3), 1‚Äì4.Hassert, D.L.; Kelly, A.N.; Pritchard, J.K. & Cautilli, J.D. (2008). The Licensing of Behavior Analysts: Protecting the profession and the public. Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention, 5(2), 8‚Äì19 BAO ABAI sponsors two conferences/year ‚Äì one in the U.S. and one international. In the United States, the American Psychological Association's Division 25 is the division for behaviour analysis. The Association for Contextual Behavior Therapy is another professional organisation. ACBS is home to many clinicians with specific interest in third generation behaviour therapy. Doctoral-level behaviour analysts who are psychologists belong to American Psychological Association's division 25 ‚Äì Behaviour analysis. APA offers a diploma in behavioural psychology. The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (formerly the Association for the Advancement of Behavior Therapy) is for those with a more cognitive orientation. The ABCT also has an interest group in behaviour analysis, which focuses on clinical behaviour analysis. In addition, the Association for Behavioral an Cognitive Therapies has a special interest group on addictions. Characteristics By nature, behavioural therapies are empirical (data-driven), contextual (focused on the environment and context), functional (interested in the effect or consequence a behaviour ultimately has), probabilistic (viewing behaviour as statistically predictable), monistic (rejecting mind‚Äìbody dualism and treating the person as a unit), and relational (analysing bidirectional interactions). Behavioural therapy develops, adds and provides behavioural intervention strategies and programs for clients, and training to people who care to facilitate successful lives in the communities. Training Recent efforts in behavioural psychotherapy have focused on the supervision process.Walser, R.D. & Westrup, D. (2006). Supervising Trainees in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy, 2(1), 12‚Äì16 BAO A key point of behavioural models of supervision is that the supervisory process parallels the behavioural psychotherapy.Callaghan, G.M.

The Uzbek government has designated and banned Akromiya as a terrorist.Islamic blame game Asia Times Early life Yoldoshev was a native of Andijan, Uzbekistan and was trained as an engineer. He worked as a math teacher and for a furniture company in Andijan, before forming Akromiya. In 1992 he published Iymonga Yul, a pamphlet advocating Islamic values that gained him support among the populace. Uzbek police arrested him in April, 1998 for possession of narcotics. A court sentenced him to 30 months imprisonment, but the government released him in December 1998 due to an amnesty. Involvement in Islamism Police arrested him in February 1999, the day after the 1999 Tashkent bombings that killed 16 people, accusing him of involvement. A court sentenced him to 17 years imprisonment for heading Akromiya. Critics of the Uzbek government doubted that he was guilty of the charges against him. Scott Horton of the Columbia Law School has said \\"There's nothing that involves a challenge to government.\\" Alisher Ilkhamov, an Uzbek who is a sociologist at the University of London, said \\"The government perceives any grass-roots movement with hostility, whether it's Islamic or not\\". These critics claimed that \\"the fierce response to Yuldashev stems from the government's deep fear of any religious group that operates without official sanction\\". In 2005, an armed uprising took place in Andijan. Among the demands was the release of Akrom Yoldoshev. The Uzbek government cracked down, and several hundred civilians were killed in the events that ended the uprising. Family His wife, Yodgoroy Yoldosheva, has lived in Boise, Idaho, United States along with 52 other refugees since the Andijan massacre in May 2005. Yoldoshev has appeared on state-run television three times, apologizing for encouraging the unrest and telling refugees they should return to Uzbekistan. Yoldosheva herself has asked the Uzbek government for permission to return, but has not yet received an answer. His wife has denied Yoldoshev had any ties to the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a militant organization affiliated with Al-Qaeda, or Hizb ut-Tahrir, another Islamist organization. Death Yoldoshev's trial appearances in late 2005 were the last times anyone outside the government ever saw him. His fate remained a mystery until 2016. International rights groups such as U.S.-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) repeatedly released statements calling on Uzbekistan's government to provide some information about Yuldashev. In January 2016, Uzbek Service announced that Yoldoshev died in 2010/2011 of tuberculosis while imprisoned.

From October 2003 to November 2006 she served as co-host on several ESPN shows such as Cold Pizza (2003‚Äì2005), Breakfast at Churchill Downs (2004‚Äì2006), Breakfast at Pimlico (2004‚Äì2006), The ESPY Red Carpet Show (2005‚Äì2006), ESPN Hollywood (2005‚Äì2006) and Sports and Hollywood (2006). Andrews reported on horse racing, college basketball and football for the network. She used to host a Saturday night counter programming block against Hockey Night in Canada called Guys TV on TSN, and a Canadian cable show titled Cooking For Love. She was a correspondent and host on Entertainment Tonight from November 2006-October 2009. Thea Andrews hosted the first season of Top Chef Canada and Nigel Lythgoe's country music singing competition, CMT's Next Superstar. From January 7, 2013 until July 2015, she co-hosted The Insider. Early life and career Andrews was born in Toronto, Ontario to a Canadian businesswoman and a Macedonian lawyer. She attended Bishop Strachan School and was originally a \\"jock\\" before opting for theater instead. A reporter for a local cable channel as a sophomore, Andrews starred in Prom Night IV: Deliver Us from Evil in 1992. After high school, she attended Queen's University and graduated with a degree in Spanish and Latin American studies. While at Queen's University Andrews co-hosted (with Cameron Dixon) Paradigm Shift a weekly half-hour series which highlighted the works of Queen's University's Film Department. By 1999, Andrews was a producer at Fashion Television. The new millennium found her as host of the show Cooking For Love. Soon, she was hosting Guy's TV on TSN. Though both were canceled, Andrews continued to pursue her dreams. She became a reporter on the show etalk Daily and eventually the show's host. Acting career Andrews also has a list of theatre credits, including Cabaret in high school and The Vagina Monologues in 2001. She has also produced a number of shows in addition to writing internet columns for TSN. Andrews had a small role in the film Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle as the TV anchorwoman. ESPN/ESPN2/ABC Sports Before her part on Cold Pizza, Andrews was seen in the ESPN series Playmakers (2003), in which she played the role of Samantha Lovett, a television sports news reporter. The role was highly controversial and The Association for Women in Sports Media formally filed a complaint for the portrayal of Lovett. Andrews disagreed with this complaint in an interview with The Plain Dealer in 2004. Andrews joined ESPN in October 2003 as the national correspondent for Cold Pizza (2003‚Äì2005), ESPN2's signature morning show as she made her debut on October 20, 2003. Andrews' primary role on the daily weekday program (7-9 a.m. ET) was to provide live reports from sports and non-sports events as well as to present unique lifestyle features. The show was originally hosted by Jay Crawford and Kit Hoover. Eventually, Andrews became co-host. From 2004-2006, she co-hosted the Triple Crown morning shows on ESPN2 such as Breakfast at Churchill Downs (2004‚Äì2006) and Breakfast at Pimlico (2004‚Äì2006), a program of the morning the Kentucky Oaks, Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes (2004‚Äì2006). She also contributed to ESPN's long extensive coverage of the Triple Crown afternoon shows (2004‚Äì2006) including the Belmont Stakes. She also covered other big horse racing events. She served as a reporter for the Breeders Cup Simulcast Show in 2004 and 2005. After 17 months on Cold Pizza the show began cutting both the airtime of Andrews and Kit Hoover. In an attempt to become more sports-oriented rather than a blend of sports, pop culture, and entertainment, the show dropped Andrews and Hoover altogether in March 2005. They were replaced by Dana Jacobson. While Hoover left the network in late 2006, Andrews had already agreed several months prior to be transferred to Los Angeles to co-host ESPN2's new evening entertainment show, ESPN Hollywood. She also co-hosted The ESPY Red Carpet Show (2005‚Äì2006) with Stuart Scott in July 2005. She hosted it in July 2006 with Dana Jacobson.* Andrews reported the sidelines for college football on ESPN and ABC Beginning on August 15, 2005, Mario Lopez and Andrews began hosting ESPN Hollywood (2005‚Äì2006). ESPN Hollywood was a weeknight entertainment show √† la Entertainment Tonight which focused more on Hollywood's relationship to the sports world. Andrews also was the producer for ESPN Hollywood.* The show would end up cancelled in January 2006 after a management change at ESPN in which several ESPN shows were cancelled (Cheap Seats, Classic Now, etc.) and also due to poor initial ratings. After ESPN Hollywood was cancelled, Andrews briefly hosted a segment of the latest news of the convergence between the sports and entertainment worlds called Sports and Hollywood (2006), a segment on Cold Pizza which began in April 2006. The tightened focus on sports news resulted in an end to that segment in November 2006; however, actors and other performers still stopped by the Cold Pizza studios from time to time to pitch their projects and share their love of sports. Also after ESPN Hollywood, Andrews often reported the sidelines for College Basketball for ABC Sports and ESPN and also covered Golf for ESPN. She was a contributor to ABC Sports's coverage of the 2006 Belmont Stakes. She also contributed to ESPN's coverage of the 2006 Breeders Cup. Entertainment Tonight On November 16, 2006, Andrews made her debut as a correspondent on Entertainment Tonight (ET) that is where she continued to work until October 2009. She was also a regular substitute host for the show as well. She also was the weekend host of ET. Since joining Entertainment Tonight in November 2006, Andrews has interviewed many of the industry's most newsworthy celebrities, including Will Smith, Leonardo DiCaprio, Steve Carell, Hugh Jackman, Tom Cruise, Jim Carrey, Russell Crowe, Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, Anne Hathaway, Kirk Douglas, Marie Osmond, and Ellen DeGeneres. Andrews has also been featured as herself on the daytime drama The Young and the Restless and has played herself several times on HBO's True Blood. On June 30, 2007, Thea and Jay Wolf were married at the Ojai Valley Inn in Ojai, California. They have a son, Jack Aaron, born in April 2008. TNT/After ET On January 23, 2010, Andrews became co-host for the \\"16th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards\\" Red Carpet Show for TNT with People deputy managing editor Peter Castro.. She was the host of the first season of Top Chef Canada, which premiered on April 11, 2011. She stepped down as host for the second season because she was nine months pregnant during taping and was replaced by actress Lisa Ray. However, she appeared as a judge on the second season in the third episode, when the chefs were challenged to create dishes for a baby shower in honor of her and fellow judge Shereen Arazm. CMT's Next Superstar Andrews is the host of CMT's Next Superstar, a reality competition series specializing in country music, which is produced by Nigel Lythgoe. Hosting problems Andrews hosted Top Chef Canada on a season where the contestants had to cook up horse meat dishes. This led to Facebook protests from various animal rights groups.

They re-formed in 2001 with several new members. Their debut single, \\"Don't Dictate\\", is now acknowledged as a classic punk rock singleMojo (October 2001) ‚Äì 100 Punk Scorchers, Issue 95, London and their debut album, Moving Targets (1978), is still widely admired. Formation (1976-78) The band's lineup was lead singer Pauline Murray, Robert Blamire (bass), Gary Smallman (drums) and Gary Chaplin (guitar). Chaplin left in March 1978 being replaced with Neale Floyd, with second guitarist Fred Purser joining in July. The band dissolved in late 1979. They reformed in 2001 with original members Murray, Blamire and Smallman, and Steve Wallace and Paul Harvey drafted in as new guitarists. Formed in Ferryhill as The Points, under which name they played their first gig, at the Rock Garden pub in Middlesbrough in October 1976, they changed the band's name after a 1973 song by Iggy & The Stooges. Their second gig was supporting The Stranglers at Newcastle City Hall. Significantly, the band also played at the club The Roxy during its first 100 days. On 9 April 1977, the band appeared on the same bill as Generation X. Early in their career, the band also supported The Vibrators and toured with Buzzcocks. After the release of their second single, Penetration recorded the first of two sessions for John Peel at BBC Radio 1 in July 1978. Later that year, the band released their debut album. Moving Targets was number 6 in the Sounds Critics' albums of the year; and it made number 13 in the NME critics' chart. In 1979, they toured Europe, the US and Britain but the grueling schedule began to take its toll. A disappointing reaction to Coming Up For Air, the second album, was the final nail in the coffin of the original band. After the band split in October an official bootleg album called Race Against Time was released, which was a collection of early demos and live tracks. In 1980, Pauline Murray collaborated with The Invisible Girls, which also included Robert Blamire, as well as other Manchester musicians such as Vini Reilly, guitarist in The Durutti Column, and Steve Hopkins. John Maher from Buzzcocks drummed for the band. Produced by Martin Hannett, the resulting album spawned the singles \\"Dream Sequence\\" and \\"Mr.X\\", with a further non-album single \\"Searching for Heaven\\" released in 1981. Murray also provided guest vocals for The Only Ones' 1980 track, \\"Fools\\". Former guitarist Gary Chaplin formed the short-lived new wave bands The Rhythm Clicks, which released the single \\"Short Time\\" in 1980, and Soul On Ice which released the singles \\"Underwater\\" and \\"Widescreen\\" in 1982 and 1983 respectively. Pauline Murray worked sporadically as a solo artist under the name 'Pauline Murray and The Storm' with Robert Blamire, Tim Johnston and Paul Harvey. Paul Harvey is also a Stuckist artist. Blamire also worked as a producer for various groups, including Scars, whose sole LP (1981's Author! Author!) he produced. In 2015, Penetration announced the release of a new album called Resolution in October. The current line-up of the band is Pauline Murray, Robert Blamire, John Maher (ex-Buzzcocks), Paul Harvey and Steve Wallace.

The genus Ensatina originated approximately 21.5 million years ago. It is usually considered as monospecific, being represented by a single species, Ensatina eschscholtzii, with several subspecies forming a ring species. Habitat and description Ensatina eschscholtzii klauberi, the large-blotched ensatina E. eschscholtzii eschscholtzi, the Monterey ensatina The Ensatina subspecies E. e. eschscholtzii, or Monterey ensatina, can be found in Santa Cruz, Monterey, and the California coastal mountains. They reach a total length of three to five inches, and can be identified primarily by the structure of the tail, and how it is narrower at the base. This salamander is the only type that has this tail structure and five toes on the back feet. Males often have longer tails than the females, and many of the salamanders have lighter colored limbs in comparison to the rest of the body. The salamanders lay their eggs underground, often in threes, which then hatch directly into salamanders, skipping the usual aquatic phase. As a ring species Ensatina eschscholtzii has been described as a ring species in the mountains surrounding the Californian Central Valley.Wake, D. (1997) Incipient species formation in salamanders of the Ensatina complex Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 94:7761-7767 The complex forms a horseshoe shape around the mountains, and though interbreeding can happen between each of the 19 populations around the horseshoe, the Ensatina eschscholtzii subspecies on the western end of the horseshoe cannot interbreed with the Ensatina klauberi on the eastern end.Dawkins, R. (2004) The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Life , Ring Species (The Salamander's Tale) As such, it is thought to be an example of incipient speciation, and provides an illustration of \\"nearly all stages in a speciation process\\" (Dobzhansky, 1958).Dobzhansky T. (1958) in A Century of Darwin, ed Barnett S A (Harvard Univ. Press, Cambridge, MA), pp 19‚Äì55. Richard Highton argued that Ensatina is a case of multiple species and not a continuum of one species (meaning, by traditional definitions, it is not a ring species). Human contact The ensatina can usually be found under logs or brush, by or in streams and lakes, and in other moist places. They are easily distressed by improper handling, because they rely on cutaneous respiration, their thin skin is very sensitive to heating, drying and exposure to chemicals from warm hands. They may exude a sticky milky secretion from the tail Subspecies E. e. platensis from Fresno County, California *Yellow- blotched ensatina ‚Äî E. e. croceater (Cope, 1868) *Monterey ensatina ‚Äî E. e. eschscholtzii Gray, 1850 *Large-blotched ensatina ‚Äî E. e. klauberi Dunn, 1929 *Oregon ensatina ‚Äî E. e. oregonensis (Girard, 1856) *Painted ensatina ‚Äî E. e. picta Wood, 1940 *Sierra Nevada ensatina ‚Äî E. e. platensis (Jim√©nez de la Espada, 1875) *Yellow-eyed ensatina ‚Äî E. e. xanthoptica Stebbins, 1949 ReferencesExternal links  Ensatina Salamander page at Santa Rosa Junior College Department of Life Sciences * Ensatina Salamander page at AmphibiaWeb Category:Plethodontidae Category:Monotypic amphibian genera Category:Amphibians of North America Category:Taxa named by John Edward Gray ","title":"Ensatina"},{"id":"1892478","text":"(Wade) Hampton Sides (born 1962) is an American historian, author and journalist. He is the author of Hellhound on His Trail, Ghost Soldiers, Blood and Thunder, On Desperate Ground, and other bestselling works of narrative history and literary non-fiction. Sides is editor-at-large for Outside magazine and has written for such periodicals as National Geographic, The Wall Street Journal, The New Yorker, Esquire, Men's Journal, The American Scholar, Smithsonian, and The Washington Post. His magazine work, collected in numerous published anthologies, has been twice nominated for National Magazine Awards for feature writing. Early life A native of Memphis, Sides attended PDS Memphis and Memphis University School, and graduated from Yale with a BA in history. In 2017, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in humane letters from Colorado College. Sides lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico, with his wife Anne Goodwin Sides, a journalist and former NPR editor.  Career  Sides is a past fellow of the Santa Fe Institute, Yaddo, the MacDowell Colony, and the Japan Society, and has been an Edwards Media Fellow at Stanford University. He is a member of the Society of American Historians and serves on the boards of the Authors Guild and the Mayborn Literary Nonfiction Conference. Sides has guest-lectured at Columbia, Yale, Stanford, Cal Tech, the Autry National Center of the American West, the American Embassy in Manila, the National World War II Museum, the Chautauqua Institution, the Explorers Club, the Sun Valley Writers' Conference, and the Google campus, among other venues and institutions. He has appeared as a guest on such national broadcasts as the American Experience, the Today show, Book TV, the History Channel, Fresh Air, CNN, CBS Sunday Morning, The Colbert Report, and NPR's All Things Considered. Books= Ghost Soldiers  Ghost Soldiers (Doubleday, 2001), a World War II narrative about the rescue of Bataan Death March survivors, has sold slightly over a million copies worldwide and has been translated into a dozen foreign languages. Erik Larson, author of The Devil in the White City, praised Ghost Soldiers as a \\"Great Escape for the Pacific Theater,\\" and Esquire called it \\"the greatest World War II story never told.\\" The book was the subject of documentaries on PBS and The History Channel, and was partially the basis for the 2005 Miramax film, The Great Raid (along with William Breuer's The Great Raid on Cabanatuan). Ghost Soldiers won the 2002 PEN USA Award for non-fiction and the Discover Award from Barnes & Noble. The book's success led Sides to create The Ghost Soldiers Endowment Fund, a non-profit foundation dedicated to preserving the memory of the sacrifices made by Bataan and Corregidor veterans by funding relevant archives, museums, and memorials.  Americana  Americana: Dispatches from the New Frontier is a 2004 collection of non- fiction essays. The book was published in paperback on April 13, 2004 through Doubleday. The book consists of several essays that Sides wrote while traveling through the United States and examining American cultures during a period of 15 years. Sides pays specific attention to subcultures that would fall under the topic of \\"Americana\\".  Blood and Thunder  Blood and Thunder (Doubleday, 2006) focuses on the life and times of controversial frontiersman Kit Carson, and his role in the conquest of the American West. A critic for the Los Angeles Times described Blood and Thunder as \\"stunning, haunting, and lyrical,\\" while The Washington Post called it \\"riveting, monumental...authoritative and masterfully told.\\" Blood and Thunder was named one of the 10 Best Books of 2006 by Time Magazine, and was selected as that year's best history title by the History Book Club and the Western Writers of America. Blood and Thunder was the subject of a major documentary on the PBS program American Experience and is currently under development for the screen.  Hellhound on His Trail  Hellhound on His Trail (Doubleday 2010) is about the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., and the largest manhunt in American history to capture James Earl Ray, who pleaded guilty in 1969 and served the rest of his life in prison. Sides, who is a native of Memphis, is the first historian to make use of a new digital archive in that city, called the B. Venson Hughes Collection, which contains more than 20,000 documents and photos, many of them rare or never before published. Sides' research forms much of the basis for PBS's documentary \\"Roads to Memphis\\", which originally aired May 3, 2010, on the award-winning program, American Experience. Hellhound on His Trail reached #6 on The New York Times Best Seller list and was a finalist for the 2011 Edgar Awards as the year‚Äôs best non-fiction mystery. Janet Maslin of The New York Times called the book \\"spellbinding...bold, dynamic, unusually vivid,\\" while a reviewer in The New York Times Book Review suggested that Hellhound \\"may be the first book on King that owes less to Taylor Branch than Robert Ludlum.\\" Time Magazine said Hellhound \\"unfolds like a mystery‚Äîone read not for the ending but for all the missteps and near misses along the way.\\" Critic Laura Miller, writing on Salon.com, described Hellhound as a \\"meticulous yet driving account that is in essence a true-crime story and a splendid specimen of the genre.\\" David Garrow, author of a Pulitzer-winning biography of King, wrote in The Washington Post that Hellhound was \\"a carefully constructed true-crime narrative\\" and \\"a memorable and persuasive portrait\\" that \\"makes a valuable contribution to the historical record.\\" Black Label Media will produce and direct a film adaption, with a spring 2018 target for start of production. The script will be adapted by Scott Cooper who will also direct the film.  In the Kingdom of Ice  In the Kingdom of Ice (2014, Doubleday) recounts the tragic true story of the first official American attempt on the North Pole, the voyage of the USS Jeannette led by Navy captain George DeLong in 1879. The book has been translated into French, German, Chinese, Polish, and Russian, among other languages. Mark Bowden, author of Black Hawk Down, called In the Kingdom of Ice ‚Äúthe most dramatic polar mission you‚Äôve never heard of. Once you start, you won‚Äôt stop.‚Äù S.C. Gwynne, author of Empire of the Summer Moon called it ‚Äúan Arctic thriller . . . an authentic narrative masterpiece.‚Äù Efforts to locate the wreck of the USS Jeannette have been led by the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, for which Sides has served as a consultant. In the Kingdom of Ice is reportedly being developed for the small screen by Emmy Award winning screenwriter Kirk Ellis (John Adams). On Desperate Ground On Desperate Ground: The Marines at The Reservoir, the Korean War's Greatest Battle, was published on October 2, 2018. It is a multifaceted retelling of the Battle of Chosin Reservoir through the experiences of soldiers, commanders, pilots, Korean citizens and the Chinese. On Desperate Ground on a deeper level, is also an indictment of the overweening hubris of General of the Army, Douglas MacArthur. Through MacArthur's self-proclaimed expertise on the \\"Oriental mind\\" and what Sides referred to as MacArthur's \\"solemn regard for his own mind\\", MacArthur was thoroughly convinced of American victory; instead, and while completely ignoring the advice of leaders on the ground, MacArthur sent American troops into what could only result into a massacre.fHistorian Douglas Brinkley called the book ‚Äúa heart-pounding, fiercely written . . . one of the finest battle books ever.‚Äù A reviewer for Bloomberg, calling the book ‚Äú superb,‚Äù wrote that On Desperate Ground \\"should be required reading for negotiators on both sides of the DMZ.‚Äù The Washington Post named On Desperate Ground one of the ten best books of 2018, and the Marine Corps Heritage Foundation named it the year's best non-fiction book.

Armstrong left the band in June 1988, prior to the band signing with Shrapnel Records, in October 1988, and was replaced by Kim Nielsen, a student of John Alderete, bassist for Racer X and The Mars Volta. Phantom Blue recorded their self-titled first album with the help of producer Steve Fontano and fellow Shrapnel label mate, Marty Friedman. Couch and Meldrum also co-wrote a track on the album with Marty Freidman. Roadrunner Records, who owned the bands European distribution rights, were responsible for the band shooting a video for the single \\"Why Call It Love?\\" and a successful European tour followed. Upon returning to the States, Phantom Blue caught the attention of singer Don Dokken who introduced them to Tom Zutaut of Geffen Records. Other major labels were interested in signing the band, most notably Disney's Hollywood Records, but the band signed with Geffen. Couch and Meldrum began writing the material for the Geffen release. Couch left the band prior to recording and Meldrum successfully recorded all the guitar parts for Built to Perform. Guitarist Karen Kreutzer replaced Couch and the band embarked on another successful European tour and shot a video for the single \\"Time to Run\\". The band was eventually dropped from Geffen, sued by manager Byron Hontas and the management position was taken over by Mark Dawson, boyfriend of drummer Linda McDonald. Guitarist Michelle Meldrum was the first to leave due to disagreement as to the direction of the band under Dawson and vocalist Gigi Hangach soon followed. By 1996, McDonald was the only original member left and she continued to use the name Phantom Blue, enlisting a total of ten different members until finally calling it quits in early 2001. Post-disbandment (2001-present) Drummer Linda McDonald went on to form The Iron Maidens (billed as \\"The World's Only Female Tribute to Iron Maiden\\"), who released a self-titled tribute album worldwide and Japanese release version, the CD/DVD release Route 666 and the EP The Root of All Evil in Japan. In addition, she played drums in the cover bands Crabby Patty (I'm So Unclear!), Unholy Pink and Valley Dolls. She was also the drummer of the all-female Ozzy Osbourne tribute The Little Dolls from 2005 to 2010. Guitarist Karen Kreutzer (from the 1993-1997 lineups) retired after moving to West River, Maryland. She is currently married with one daughter and has worked as a data analyst for a content solutions company. Bassist Kim Nielsen (who, for a brief period, went by her married name Kim Nielsen-Parsons) worked in tour production and as an artist management assistant, working with many top bands in the music industry. Her most notable work outside of Phantom Blue is on Asia's 2004 album Silent Nation. She has been working with UK band, Wraith, and appeared on their 2017 album Revelation. Lead vocalist Gigi Hangach currently resides in Las Vegas, Nevada and is a supporter of animal rights. Guitarist Nicole Couch currently lives in New York City with her husband and two kids and has worked as a music teacher. Original bassist Debra ArmstrongEncyclopaedia Metallum: Debra Armstrong currently lives in Sioux City, Iowa with her husband. She left the music industry soon after being replaced by Kim Nielsen in 1988, and went on to pursue a career in 3D modeling and engineering, working for clients such as Disney Imagineering, DARPA and others. Guitarist Michelle Meldrum went on to form an international band called Meldrum. The band has toured with Zakk Wylde's Black Label Society, Mot√∂rhead, Sepultura, Nashville Pussy and Danzig. They have released a live DVD, Loaded Live, and two albums, Loaded Mental Cannon and Blowin' Up the Machine, the latter featuring her former Phantom Blue bandmate, drummer Linda McDonald. On May 21, 2008, Meldrum died as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage. She left behind her husband John Norum (of Europe) and their son Jake. Reunion (2009) On May 26, 2009, Linda McDonald, Gigi Hangach and Kim Nielsen reunited as Phantom Blue for the Michelle Meldrum Memorial Concert at the Whisky a Go Go in Hollywood, California. Meldrum's position was filled by Tina Wood (from the 1997 lineup), while Sara Marsh and Courtney Cox of The Iron Maidens filled in for Nicole Couch. Original members Gigi Hangach and Nicole Couch are constructing the website www.phantomblue.net in honor of Michelle Meldrum.

He was the first to perform spinal anesthesia and intravenous regional anesthesia. Early medical career Bier began his medical education at the Charit√© ‚Äì Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin in 1881, transferred to the Leipzig University in 1882, and transferred again to the University of Kiel in 1883. After receiving his medical degree from the University of Kiel in 1886, Bier worked as a general practitioner and ship's surgeon just outside the city of Kiel ‚Äì which is a major port on the Baltic Sea. Bier began his residency in 1888 at the surgical clinic at the University of Kiel, under the mentorship of Friedrich von Esmarch. After professorships in Greifswald and Bonn, Bier was appointed Chief Surgeon and Geheimrat Professor of Surgery at the Charit√© - Universit√§tsmedizin. Spinal anesthesia Cerebrospinal fluid flowing through a 25 gauge spinal needle during spinal anesthesia On 16 August 1898, Bier performed the first operation under spinal anesthesia at the Royal Surgical Hospital of the University of Kiel. The patient was scheduled to undergo segmental resection of his left ankle, which was severely infected with tuberculosis, but he dreaded the prospect of general anesthesia because he had suffered severe adverse side effects during multiple previous operations. Therefore, Bier suggested \\"cocainization\\" of the spinal cord as an alternative to general anesthesia. Bier injected 15 mg of cocaine intrathecally, which was sufficient to allow him to perform the operation. The subject was fully conscious during the operation, but felt no pain. Two hours after the operation, the subject complained of nausea, vomiting, severe headache, and pain in his back and ankle. The vomiting, back and leg pain improved by the following day, but the headache was still present. Bier performed spinal anesthetics on five more subjects for lower extremity surgery, using a similar technique and achieving similar results. After this series of six subjects, Bier was to receive a spinal anesthetic administered by his assistant, August Hildebrandt. Unfortunately, although Hildebrandt placed the spinal needle correctly, with cerebrospinal fluid flowing freely from it, the syringe was only then discovered to not fit into the hub of the needle. During the efforts to fit the syringe into the hub of the needle, a great deal of cerebrospinal fluid escaped, most of the cocaine to be injected was lost, and the spinal anesthetic was consequently a complete failure. Later that same evening, Bier performed a cocaine spinal anesthetic on Hildebrandt. After the injection, Hildebrandt was temporarily unable to move or feel any sensation in his legs. The profound anesthesia of his legs was demonstrated using increasingly painful stimuli, including a needle inserted down to the femur, a blow with an iron hammer to the shins, forceful avulsion of pubic hair, and \\"strong pressure and traction\\" to the testicles.https://www.woodlibrarymuseum.org/library/pdf/WLMREP_14_14.pdf Later that evening, they celebrated their success with wine and cigars. Like all of Bier's previous experimental subjects, Bier and Hildebrandt both experienced severe post-spinal headaches. Hildebrandt's symptoms lasted about four days, while Bier remained confined to bed for nine days. Intravenous regional anesthesia Intravenous regional anesthesia In 1908, Bier pioneered the use of intravenous regional anesthesia, a technique which is commonly referred to as a \\"Bier block\\". This technique is frequently used for operations of brief duration upon the hand, wrist, and forearm. It can also be used for operations of brief duration upon the foot, ankle, and leg. Charit√© ‚Äì Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin In 1903 he joined the faculty of the University of Bonn as a full professor, where he taught until 1907. Then he went to Berlin, where he was appointed Geheimrat Professor of Surgery and Chief Surgeon at the Charit√© ‚Äì Universit√§tsmedizin. Bier was elected President of the German Surgical Society in 1911. Bier treated many important people, such as Kaiser Wilhelm II, family members of Nicholas II of Russia, and Vladimir Lenin. Although he was arguably the most accomplished surgeon of his time, not all of his operations were successful. Hugo Stinnes (a Business magnate and politician who was among the wealthiest men in the world at that time) died on 10 April 1924, about a month after Bier performed a cholecystectomy on him. On 24 February 1925, Bier performed an appendectomy on Friedrich Ebert, the first President of Germany, who had signed the Weimar Constitution into law in 1919. Ebert, who had suffered from appendicitis for two weeks before it was diagnosed, died of septic shock four days after the operation. Upon Ebert's death, Paul von Hindenburg was elected as successor. Bier was Chief Surgeon at the Charit√© in Berlin until 1928, when Ferdinand Sauerbruch (18751951) assumed the position. Bier remained at the Charit√© as Professor Emeritus until his retirement in 1932. Sports medicine Bier is also considered to be a pioneer in the field of sports medicine, having played a pivotal role in establishing it as a discipline. Along with Arthur Mallwitz (18801968), Bier organized the first lectures in sports medicine at the University of Berlin in 1919. Bier served as director of the Deutsche Hochschule f√ºr Leibes√ºbungen (\\"German University of Physical Education\\") in Berlin from its founding in 1920 until 1932. Sauerbruch temporarily headed the Academy until 1933, when Karl Gebhardt (18971948) assumed the directorship. Gebhardt became the first professor of sports medicine in Berlin. Gebhardt expanded on Bier's methods, adopting an academic approach to sports medicine and awarding degrees. Awards In 1910, Bier was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh. The title of Geheimrat was bestowed upon Bier by German Emperor Wilhelm II. On 24 November 1936, Bier received the Eagle Shield of the German Reich. On 30 January 1938, Bier became one of only nine people to ever receive the German National Prize for Art and Science, an award created by Adolf Hitler that year as a replacement for the Nobel Prize, which he had forbidden Germans to accept.

The book ranks 55th on Publishers Weeklys All-Time Bestselling Children's Book List for the United States, with 2,209,774 copies sold as of 2001. This book is one of the \\"Original 10\\", generally considered by historians and critics of children's literature to be the best examples of all the Hardy Boys, and Stratemeyer Syndicate, writing. This book was written for the Stratemeyer Syndicate by Leslie McFarlane in 1927. Between 1959 and 1973 the first 38 volumes were systematically revised as part of a project directed by Harriet S. Adams, Edward Stratemeyer's daughter. While some volumes only had minor changes, the original version of this book had the plot significantly rewritten in 1959 by Adams. Plot summary The story begins with Frank and Joe Hardy barely avoiding being hit by a speeding driver, who they notice has bright red hair. Later, this same red-haired driver attempts a ferry boat ticket office robbery and successfully steals a yellow jalopy called Queen from the Hardys' friend, Chet Morton. Due to one witness reporting that the villain had dark hair, the Hardys assume he is using a red wig. It is learned that the thief returned to Chet's home to steal a tire, helping Frank and Joe to find Queen abandoned in a public wooded area. The excitement of finding Queen is quickly gone when it is reported that there has been a robbery of forty thousand dollars in securities and jewels from the Tower Mansion owned by siblings Hurd Applegate and Adelia Applegate. Hurd Applegate is convinced that the Tower's caretaker, Henry Robinson, is the guilty party. The Hardys are especially concerned by this accusation, because Henry's son, Perry, is a friend of theirs who will have to quit school to work since his father can no longer get a job as a result of Applegate's accusation. The only \\"proof\\" of Henry Robinson's guilt is that he was suddenly able to pay off a debt and refused to reveal where he got the money to do so. The Hardys suspect that the red-haired man may be involved with the Tower robbery and search the place where The Queen was found, finding the red wig. The Hardys' dad, detective Fenton Hardy, learns that the wig was manufactured in New York City. Fenton Hardy goes to New York and learns of a criminal named John \\"Red\\" Jackley who is fond of using disguises. Soon, Jackley is injured in a railroad handcar accident, causing him to be hospitalized. About to die, Jackley confesses that he committed the Tower Mansion robbery and put the loot \\"in the old tower...\\" Jackley dies before he is able to explain further. Frank and Joe decide to go to the railroad where Jackley used to work to find more information. While investigating, they see two water towers nearby. Inside the water tower they find the stolen items, but are locked in the tower by a man calling himself Hobo Johnny. Johnny believes that anything in the tower belongs to him. Frank and Joe break out of the water tower and return the missing securities and jewelry, whereupon they receive the $1,000 reward.In the original version of the book Henry admits that a man who owed him money repaid a debt to him, but he was not allowed to tell anyone in case the man's other debtors found out. This was revised in the 1959 version such that Adelia reveals that she loaned Henry Robinson the money to pay off his debt. Following the revelations and with the stolen loot returned, Hurd re-hires Henry with an increase in salary and Hurd builds the greenhouse that Henry has been wanting.

Today, due to its proximity to both Terre Haute's southern shopping district (along U.S. Route 41 for approximately two miles south of Interstate 70) and the Terre Haute Federal Penitentiary, it has mostly become a commuter town (State Road 63 provides Prairieton residents access to Terre Haute), with fewer than ten businesses within its \\"city limits\\". Prairieton is part of the Terre Haute Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Prairieton was laid out July 22, 1837, by Robert Hoggatt. Situated on Honey Creek, the town also was on the old Vincennes wagon road. Moses Hoggatt had established a post office and store there around 1818, and in its early years the town was known simply as Hoggatt's Store. Hoggatt and then his son Robert Hoggatt were the first shopkeepers. The Quakers were the predominating influence in this prairie in the pioneer days. It became incorporated as a town in 1870 and by 1890 had a population of approximately 236. A post office was established under the name Hoggatts in 1818.

The B field in the action is supposed to be a so(3, 1)-valued 2-form, i.e. taking values in the Lie algebra of a special orthogonal group. The term :B^{ij} \\\\wedge B^{kl} in the action has the same symmetries as it does to provide the Einstein‚ÄìHilbert action. But the form of :B^{ij} is not unique and can be posed by the different forms: *\\\\pm e^i \\\\wedge e^j *\\\\pm \\\\epsilon^{ijkl} e_k \\\\wedge e_l where e^i is the tetrad and \\\\epsilon^{ijkl} is the antisymmetric symbol of the so(3, 1)-valued 2-form fields. The Plebanski action can be constrained to produce the BF model which is a theory of no local degrees of freedom. John W. Barrett and Louis Crane modeled the analogous constraint on the summation over spin foam. The Barrett‚ÄìCrane model on spin foam quantizes the Plebanski action, but its path integral amplitude corresponds to the degenerate B field and not the specific definition :B^{ij} = e^i \\\\wedge e^j, which formally satisfies the Einstein's field equation of general relativity.

It can be used either by mouth, by injection into a muscle, or injection into a vein. It begins working within 15 minutes when taken by mouth and is faster in onset when used by injection. Effects last between 45 and 180 minutes. Common side effect include high blood pressure, vomiting, seizures, headache, and low blood pressure. Other serious side effects include ergotism. It was originally made from the rye ergot fungus but can also be made from lysergic acid. Ergometrine is regulated because it can be used to make lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Ergometrine was discovered in 1932. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Medical use It has a medical use in obstetrics to facilitate delivery of the placenta and to prevent bleeding after childbirth by causing smooth muscle tissue in the blood vessel walls to narrow, thereby reducing blood flow. It is usually combined with oxytocin (Syntocinon) as syntometrine. It can induce spasm of the coronary arteries. It is used to diagnose variant (Prinzmetal's) angina. Side effects Possible side effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, tinnitus, chest pain, palpitation, bradycardia, transient hypertension and other cardiac arrhythmias, dyspnea, rashes, and shock.Ergometrine drug information An overdose produces a characteristic poisoning, ergotism or \\"St. Anthony's fire\\": prolonged vasospasm resulting in gangrene and amputations; hallucinations and dementia; and abortions. Gastrointestinal disturbances such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, are common. The drug is contraindicated in pregnancy, vascular disease, and psychosis. Mechanism of action While it acts at alpha- adrenergic, dopaminergic, and serotonin receptors (the 5-HT2 receptor), it exerts on the uterus (and other smooth muscles) a powerful stimulant effect not clearly associated with a specific receptor type. History The pharmacological properties of ergot were known and had been utilised by midwives for centuries, but were not thoroughly researched and publicised until the early 20th century. However, its abortifacient effects and the danger of ergotism meant that it was only prescribed cautiously, as in the treatment of postpartum haemorrhage. Ergometrine was first isolated and obtained by the chemists C Moir and H W Dudley in 1935. Caroline De Costa has argued that the adoption of ergometrine for preventative use and for treating bleeding contributed to the decline in the maternal mortality rate in much of the West during the early 20th century. Legal status Ergometrine is listed as Table I precursors under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, as possible precursor compound for LSD.List Of Precursors And Chemicals Frequently Used In The Illicit Manufacture Of Narcotic Drugs And Psychotropic Substances Under International Control . As an N-alkyl derivative of lysergamide, ergometrine is also covered by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, effectively rendering it illegal in the United Kingdom.

The duck test is a form of abductive reasoning. This is its usual expression: The test implies that a person can identify an unknown subject by observing that subject's habitual characteristics. It is sometimes used to counter abstruse arguments that something is not what it appears to be.  History  Indiana poet James Whitcomb Riley (1849‚Äì1916) may have coined the phrase when he wrote: A common variation of the wording of the phrase may have originated much later with Emil Mazey, secretary-treasurer of the United Auto Workers, at a labor meeting in 1946 accusing a person of being a communist: The term was later popularized in the United States by Richard Cunningham Patterson Jr., United States ambassador to Guatemala in 1950 during the Cold War, who used the phrase when he accused Guatemala's Jacobo Arbenz Guzm√°n government of being Communist. Patterson explained his reasoning as follows: Later references to the duck test include Cardinal Richard Cushing's, who used the phrase in 1964 in reference to Fidel Castro. \\"Attributed to Richard Cardinal Cushing. Everett Dirksen and Herbert V. Prochnow, Quotation Finder, p. 55 (1971). Unverified.\\" Douglas Adams parodied this test in his book Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency: Monty Python also referenced the test in the Witch Logic scene in their 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail: A claimed recent application of the duck test was the denial of tax exempt \\"nonprofit\\" status to Blue Shield of California: The Liskov Substitution Principle in computer science is sometimes expressed as a counter-example to the duck test: Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov used a version of the Duck Test in 2015 in response to allegations that Russian airstrikes in Syria were not targeting terrorist groups, primarily ISIS, but rather West-supported groups such as the Free Syrian Army. When asked to elaborate his definition of 'terrorist groups', he replied: Professor Vladimir Vapnik, a pioneer and co-inventor of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and a major contributor to the theory of machine learning and many foundational ideas in statistical learning, uses the duck test as a way to summarize the importance of simple predicates to classify thingsVladimir Vapnik: Statistical Learning an MIT Artificial Intelligence (AI) Podcast. During the discussion he often uses the test to illustrate that the concise format of the duck test is a form of intelligence that machines are not capable of producing.

OfficeVision/2 IBM's initial answer was OfficeVision/2, a server-requestor system designed to be the strategic implementation of IBM's Systems Application Architecture. The server could run on OS/2, VM, MVS (XA or ESA), or OS/400, while the requester required OS/2 Extended Edition running on IBM PS/2 personal computers, or DOS. IBM also developed OfficeVision/2 LAN for workgroups, which failed to find market acceptance and was withdrawn in 1992. IBM began to resell Lotus Notes and Lotus cc:Mail as an OfficeVision/2 replacement. Ultimately, IBM solved its OfficeVision problems through the hostile takeover of Lotus Software for its Lotus Notes product, one of the two most popular products for business e-mail and calendaring. IBM originally intended to deliver the Workplace Shell as part of the OfficeVision/2 LAN product, but in 1991 announced plans to release it as part of OS/2 2.0 instead: > IBM last week said some features originally scheduled to ship in > OfficeVision/2 LAN will be bundled into the current release of the product, > while others will be either integrated into OS/2 or delayed indefinitely... > IBM's Workplace Shell, an enhanced graphical user interface, is being lifted > from OfficeVision/2 LAN to be included in OS/2 2.0... The shell offers the > capability to trigger processes by dragging and dropping icons on the > desktop, such as dropping a file into an electronic wastebasket. Porting > that feature to the operating system will let any application take advantage > of the interface. Users of IBM OfficeVision included the New York State Legislature. Migration IBM discontinued support of OfficeVision/VM as of October 6, 2003. IBM recommended that its OfficeVision/VM customers migrate to Lotus Notes and Lotus Domino environments, and IBM offered migration tools and services to assist. Guy Dehond, one of the beta-testers of the AS/400, developed the first migration tool. However, OfficeVision/MVS remained available for sale until March 2014, and was still supported until May 2015, and thus for a time was another migration option for OfficeVision/VM users. OfficeVision/MVS runs on IBM's z/OS operating system. Earlier PROFS, DISOSS and Office/36 OfficeVision/VM was originally named PROFS (for PRofessional OFfice System) and was initially made available in 1981. Before that it was a PRPQ (Programming Request for Price Quotation), an IBM administrative term for non-standard software offerings with unique features, support and pricing. The first release of PROFS was developed by IBM in Poughkeepsie, NY, in conjunction with Amoco, from a prototype developed years earlier in Poughkeepsie by Paul Gardner and others. Subsequent development took place in Dallas. The editor XEDIT was the basis of the word processing function in PROFS. PROFS itself was descended from an in-house system developed by IBM Poughkeepsie laboratory. Poughkeepsie developed a primitive in-house solution for office automation over the period 1970‚Äì1972; OFS (Office System), which evolved into PROFS, was developed by Poughkeepsie laboratory as a replacement for that earlier system and first installed in October 1974. Compared to Poughkeepsie's original in-house system, the distinctive new features added by OFS were a centralised database virtual machine (data base manager or DBM) for shared permanent storage of documents, instead of storing all documents in user's personal virtual machines; and a centralised virtual machine (mailman master machine or distribution virtual machine) to manage mail transfer between individuals, instead of relying on direct communication between the personal virtual machines of individual users. By 1981, IBM's Poughkeepsie site had over 500 PROFS users. In 1983, IBM introduced release 2 of PROFS, along with auxiliary software to enable document interchange between PROFS, DISOSS, Displaywriter, IBM 8100 and IBM 5520 systems. PROFS and its e-mail component, known colloquially as PROFS Notes, featured prominently in the investigation of the Iran-Contra scandal. Oliver North believed he had deleted his correspondence, but the system archived it anyway. Congress subsequently examined the e-mail archives. OfficeVision/MVS originated from IBM DISOSS, and OfficeVision/400 from IBM Office/36. IBM's European Networking Center (ENC) in Heidelberg, Germany, developed prototype extensions to OfficeVision/VM to support Open Document Architecture (ODA), in particular a converter between ODA and Document Content Architecture (DCA) document formats. Earlier ODPS in Far East OfficeVision/VM for the Far Eastern languages of Japanese, Korean and Chinese, originated from IBM Office and Document Control System (ODPS), a DBCS-enabled porting from PROFS, plus document edit, store and search functions, similar to Displaywrite/370. It was an integrated office system for the Asian languages, that ran on IBM's mainframe computers under VM, offering such functions as email, calendar, and document processing & storing. IBM ODPS was later renamed as IBM OfficeVision/VM and its MVS version (using DISOSS) was not offered. After IBM's buyout of Lotus Development in 1995, the ODPS users were recommended to migrate to Lotus Notes. IBM ODPS was developed in IBM Tokyo Programming Center, located in Kawasaki, Japan, later absorbed into IBM Yamato Development Laboratory, in conjunction with IBM Dallas Programming Center in Westlake, Texas, U.S., where PROFS was developed, and other programming centers. It first became available in 1986 for Japanese, and then was translated into Korean by IBM Korea and into Traditional Chinese by IBM Taiwan. It was not translated into Simplified Chinese for mainland China. IBM ODPS consisted of four software components:IBM enhances its integrated office work software, ODPS (in Japanese) * The Office Support Program, or OFSP, was PROFS enabled to process the Double Byte Character Set of the Asian languages and added some more functions.

He was illiterate and many believe that his tale was embellished by those who were writing on his behalf. Finally, some question the accuracy of this part of the legend. Life before the Alamo According to the most commonly told story, Rose was a French Jew who had served in the French army under Napoleon. He supposedly served in Italy, the French invasion of Russia and the Peninsular War. It seems clear that he was at the Alamo for some unknown portion of the 13-day siege and missed the massacre at dawn on March 6, 1836. He knew many details about the Alamo garrison and gave the names of some participants, and, whenever asked, admitted that he had left when given the chance before the final assault, because he was not ready to die. Presence in the Alamo It is known that the butcher Louis Rose, of Nacogdoches, Texas, testified on behalf of the estates of five men who may have been at the Alamo. In each of these cases he made statements similar to \\"left him in the Alimo [sic] 3 March 1836\\".Lindley (2003), p. 225. In none of his testimony did Rose explicitly state that he was a member of the Alamo garrison, or that he had entered the Alamo and later escaped. In at least one case, the man on whose behalf he testified had not been at the Alamo, although he had the same name as one of the known Alamo defenders; in a second case, the man (Henry Teal), was later proved to have died after the battle's conclusion. The affidavit evidence appears to be reliable, since there is corroborative evidence of the named men having been in the garrison, and Rose' own presence in the Alamo was noted by the survivor Susanna Dickinson. Rose was said to have been a member of Colonel James Bowie's forces and had fought during the siege of Bexar, and that he then joined Bowie in reinforcing the Alamo Mission in San Antonio de Bexar in late January 1836. The available records do not permit historians to confirm these accounts. Rose's name is not found on any muster rolls for the siege of Bexar. Neither a Louis nor a Moses Rose is listed on the muster rolls that James C. Neill compiled for the Alamo garrison on December 31, 1835, or February 1, 1836, although Bowie was listed on the latter document.Lindley (2003), p. 192. On the other hand, a man named \\"Rose\\" from Nacogdoches was listed as an Alamo victim in the March 14, 1836, issue of the Telegraph and Texas Register. This first attempt to name the men at the Alamo was compiled by John William Smith, one of the last couriers to leave the Alamo, and Gerald Navan, who probably also left the Alamo as a courier.Chariton (1990), p. 180. Alamo survivor Susanna Dickinson testified in 1853 and again in 1857 that the only man named \\"Rose\\" of whom she knew in the Alamo was James Rose, who accompanied Davy Crockett and who had died.Chariton (1990), p. 179. On the other hand, many of the known defenders from the roll accepted by historians are verified by less evidence than that supported Rose, and over the years names have been added or removed as evidence emerges. Historian Thomas Ricks Lindley speculates that Louis \\"Moses\\" Rose had intended to fight at the Alamo and had joined volunteers who attempted to reinforce the Alamo on March 4. According to Lindley, while fifty or so of the volunteers successfully entered the Alamo complex, the remainder were driven away by Mexican troops. Rose may have been in the group that was repulsed, and either had seen some of his comrades enter the Alamo, or assumed that they had successfully entered.Lindley (2003), p. 227. There is no other evidence that such a large group attempted to come to the aid of the defenders. Rose in the legend of the Alamo The traditional account of the battle includes the following description of Rose's actions. In March 1836, the Alamo was surrounded by the Mexican Army, which raised a \\"no quarter\\" flag, promising death to all defenders. Travis, the Texan commander, drew a line in the sand with his sword. He asked the defenders to cross over it, and thereby pledge to fight (and presumably die) in the Alamo. All did, except Rose. Crockett is supposed to have urged him to cross the line, but he remained standing. Later in the night, he is supposed to have slipped over the wall. If Rose fled the Alamo on the night Travis drew the line, it might have been March 3 or March 5, since by the evening of March 3 it was apparent that no further reinforcements were coming and Santa Anna had delivered both an ultimatum and a chance for noncombatants to leave safely. Rose managed to evade Mexican forces, and made his way to Grimes County, where he found rest and shelter at the home of one William P. Zuber. Rose made no attempt at hiding the true story of his journey, attributing his decision to a love for his family (including his children), stating that he \\"just wasn't ready to die;\\" or that he had the desire to fight another day rather than face a slaughter like those he had seen in previous failed battles. Rose did not fight another day, but moved on to settle in Nacogdoches, Texas, where he operated a butcher shop. He would unashamedly explain to customers or anyone who asked why he had decided not to die in the Alamo. Some historians have said that the story of the line in the sand was first told by Rose himself; however, it was standard frontier militia practice to give the men the choice to leave before battle, since they might leave on their own under fire anyway. In addition, other accounts of Travis \\"haranguing\\" the men or giving them the choice to stay were part of the record before the Zuber account surfaced, and similar ultimatums were given before other battles in Texas. Whether there ever was an actual line drawn in the sand is disputed, but the evidence does suggest that all Alamo defenders were at one point given a choice to stay or to go. When the legendary account is accepted, Louis Rose is sometimes portrayed as a coward, though he was 51 at the time and had seen the cost of futile warfare in conflicts on two continents. This is largely due to the pride Texans take from the Battle of the Alamo, and the contrast of Rose with the defenders who chose to stay and die. His alleged actions suffer further in comparison with the 32 volunteers who evaded the Mexican forces to join the garrison. Some advocates for Rose have noted that others also left during the battle, notably Juan Seguin (who was sent to seek reinforcements and is considered an Alamo hero), and at least twelve others who left as couriers during a brief armistice. Others note that Seguin and the other couriers were ordered to leave as part of their duty, while Rose chose to leave in order to save his own life. (In fact, Juan Seguin and other couriers returned to the scene, though the Alamo had fallen by the time Seguin arrived.) In the years following the fall of the Alamo, Rose was sometimes contacted by relatives of men that died at the Alamo, to help verify their deaths, so that their survivors could settle land disputes or property claims. He was also sometimes casually questioned about his actions at the famous battle, and never denied that he had been there. As noted above, on some lists of the participants in the Battle of the Alamo, Rose is not even listed; proponents of the legendary account believe this is so because Rose left before the climax of the battle. Reprortably Rose died about 1850 In LouisianaLouis Rose Find a graveIn 1927, relatives of Rose presented his musket to the Alamo Museum. The song Moses Rose of Texas, which was written by folk singer Steve Suffet and which uses the tune of the song The Yellow Rose of Texas, begins with the popular story of Rose, saying in parthttp://sniff.numachi.com/pages/tiMOSEROSE;ttYELLOWTX.html Suffet's parody, however, goes on to present a more nuanced interpretation of Rose's actions: The 1952 film The Man from the Alamo, starring Glenn Ford, is loosely based on Rose's story, and Ford's character is accused of having been a coward, even though he was selected to escape the Alamo to protect the families of the defenders from looters and bandits. The film is very poor on historical accuracy, though the opening scenes of the battle are well done; and the plot was criticized by some Texan traditionalist groups, such as the Daughters of the Republic of Texas. Identity \\"For the first thirty-eight years of the twentieth century,\\" wrote Thomas Ricks Lindley, \\"William P. Zuber's story of Moses Rose's alleged escape from the Alamo was an unsubstantiated tale accepted by few historians.\\" Then in 1939, Texas archivist Robert B. Blake uncovered land grant statements from the Nacogdoches County Courthouse containing elements that seemed to verify Zuber's story. Because Blake appears to have believed him, he assumed that a Stephen and a Lewis or Louis Rose who, in their day, had signed testimony about Alamo defenders to the Board of Land Commissioners, were but one and same old Frenchman whose real name was Louis Rose. According to Blake, it was the very Rose described in the Texas Almanac for 1873, \\"Moses\\" becoming a nickname given to him by the Alamo defenders for his great age, 50 (Gordon C. Jenning, 56, was the oldest Alamo fighter at the time). In 1982, Steven G. Kellman, professor of comparative literature at the University of Texas at San Antonio, brought fresh grist to the mill by publishing a short study, \\"The Yellow Rose of Texas\\". Kellman believed that the copies of military documents he had obtained from the Service Historiques de la D√©fense in Vincennes, France, showed that Lieutenant \\"Moses, n√© Louis\\" Roze was born in La F√©r√©e, Ardennes, on May 11, 1785. Two different first names ‚Äì Stephen and Lewis or Louis ‚Äì plus a nickname, Moses ‚Äì for the same man now explicitly identified by Professor Kellman as an officer in Napoleon's army brought questions to historian Gerard D√¥le's mind. In order to retrace the life of Louis Roze, he consulted Louis Roze's complete military records at the French Archives Historiques de la D√©fense in Vincennes, as well as the complete dossier on his L√©gion d'Honneur at the Archives Nationales in Paris. At the same time, his assistant St√©phane Vielle went to work collecting and studying various official documents concerning Lieutenant Louis Roze, born in La F√©r√©e, Ardennes, on May 11, 1785. D√¥le and Vielle concluded that there had been a case of mistaken identity. Louis Roze, born in La F√©r√©e, could not have been the Louis \\"Moses\\" Rose of Nacogdoches and the Alamo because he had never crossed the Atlantic, though he died about the same time as the Alamo Rose, on May 25, 1851 in Braine. The certificate was signed and witnessed by his friend Paul Masure, and again mentions that Roze was a Chevalier de la L√©gion d'Honneur and native of La F√©r√©e.

The station is located on the Swindon- Gloucester \\"Golden Valley\\" line. History A 1909 Railway Clearing House map of railways in the vicinity of Stonehouse, shown here as G.W. STA. The station was formerly called Stonehouse Burdett Road to distinguish it from a second station, Stonehouse (Bristol Road), on the line between Bristol and Gloucester. Stonehouse Bristol Road closed to passengers under the Beeching Axe in 1965 and to goods traffic the following year. Description The station has two platforms, and is operated by Great Western Railway. The station has a ticket office, located on the Gloucester-bound platform; it is normally only open in the mornings, until the end of the peak period. The platforms are short: only about each. This is long enough to accommodate the two-coach trains used on ‚Äì local services; but Class 800s running to or from London or Cheltenham Spa may be up to nine coaches. Since long trains cannot be accommodated entirely, such trains running towards Gloucester normally stop with the front two coaches in the platform, and those running toward London normally stop with the rear two in the platform. Passengers intending to alight at Stonehouse are advised earlier in their journeys to proceed along the train to the relevant coaches. Since trains from Cheltenham almost always reverse at Gloucester, this can lead to confusion for cyclists as to which end of the train in which to load their bicycles. Station Upgrade In December 2017 the station completed a ¬£300,000 upgrade. The work included ground levelling, improved access and a new footbridge. In 2018, improvements were made to the provision of service information for passengers, comprising the installation of LED dot-matrix passenger information screens and the provision of automated announcements. Works to extend the short platforms by around 100m were completed in 2019. These changes were required for introduction of Class 166 trains, which are longer than the previous rolling stock used on the line. Services Great Western Railway operate services from London Paddington to Gloucester and Cheltenham Spa using Class 800s, and limited local services from to Gloucester and Cheltenham using Class 165 two carriage sets. Trains call hourly in each direction Mon-Sat and also on Sundays (though with some two hour gaps).

The group was known as the Jazz Crusaders from its formation in 1960 until shortening its name in 1971. History The Crusaders at Knebworth Park, UK, Capital Radio Jazz Festival, 1982 High school friends Joe Sample (piano), Wilton Felder (tenor saxophone) and Nesbert \\"Stix\\" Hooper (drums) formed their first band together, the Swingsters, in Houston, Texas in 1954. They played a mixture of jazz and R&B;, and were joined by Wayne Henderson (trombone), Hubert Laws (flute), and Henry Wilson (bass). The group soon turned more to hard bop, and renamed themselves the Modern Jazz Sextet, but also recorded in a more R&B; vein as the Nighthawks (or Nite Hawks). In 1960, Sample, Felder, Hooper and Henderson moved to Los Angeles, and formed the Jazz Crusaders as a quintet with a succession of different bass players. Influenced by musicians such as Cannonball Adderley, Art Blakey and John Coltrane, the band signed to the Pacific Jazz label in 1961, and released 16 albums on the label over the subsequent eight years. With a front-line horn section of Felder and Henderson, the group's sound was rooted in hard bop, but with a slant towards R&B; and soul music. Their first two albums, with Jimmy Bond on bass, were Freedom Sound (1961), and Lookin' Ahead (1962), followed by the live album At the Lighthouse (1962) and Tough Talk, the first of several albums with bassist Bobby Haynes. In all, the group recorded five live albums in the 1960s, four of which were recorded at the Lighthouse Caf√© in Hermosa Beach. They also had their first chart entry, their treatment of Stevie Wonder's \\"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\\" reaching No.95 on the Hot 100 in 1966. The group's 1969 album, Powerhouse, was their first to reach the Billboard 200 album chart, reaching No. 184, and was also their last studio album for Pacific Jazz. The group then signed with the Chisa label, co-owned by trumpeter Hugh Masekela and producer Stewart Levine. Their 1970 album Old Socks, New Shoes reached No. 90 on the album chart, and was their last as the Jazz Crusaders. The decision was taken to call the group simply the Crusaders, so as not to limit their scope and potential audience. After a second album with Chisa, (Pass the Plate, 1971), and one album for the MoWest label (Hollywood, 1972) they signed with Blue Thumb Records, where they remained until the late 1970s. Their recordings increasingly adopted a jazz-funk style. They incorporated electric guitar and bass into their shows and recordings, as well as using Sample's electric piano and clavinet. Guitarist Larry Carlton joined, and featured on their albums in the early part of the decade. Bass duties were often handled by Felder, though Robert \\"Pops\\" Popwell joined later in the decade. According to jazz critic Scott Yanow at Allmusic, however, \\"after a few excellent albums during the early part of the decade... the group began to decline in quality.\\" Sample later commented that the group was under commercial pressure from record companies to record jazzed-up versions of contemporary popular songs. Henderson left to become a record producer in 1975, and the other musicians regularly and increasingly worked as session musicians with artists such as the Jackson 5, Marvin Gaye, Joni Mitchell, Steely Dan, and Randy Newman. With a growing crossover appeal, the group's most commercially successful recordings included the single \\"Put It Where You Want It\\" (No.52 pop, 1972), and the albums The 2nd Crusade (No.45 album, 1973), Southern Comfort (No.31 album, 1974), Chain Reaction (No.26 album, 1975), Those Southern Knights (No.38 album, 1976), and Images (No.34 album, 1978). The peak of the group's commercial success came with 1979's Street Life, with Randy Crawford as featured singer. The album peaked at No. 18 on the pop album charts and the title track made the Top 10 on the R&B; chart, No. 36 on Billboard‚Ä≤s Hot 100 chart, and No.5 in the UK. Later albums by the group featured singers Bill Withers and Joe Cocker. The live 1982 album Royal Jam featured guitarist B. B. King, bassist James Jamerson, and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Hooper left in 1983, and though Felder and Sample kept the group operating through the 1980s, the group's commercial success diminished. Felder and Henderson reunited in the mid-1990s as the Crusaders. Henderson later led a band called the Jazz Crusaders, in which Felder and Carlton also played, and Felder and Sample reunited as the Crusaders in 2003.Chris J.

Paradise Garage From 1969 to 1970, No. 430 was the premises of Mr Freedom. In October 1971, Malcolm McLaren and a friend from art school, Patrick Casey, opened a stall in the back of the Paradise Garage boutique at 430 King's Road in London's Chelsea district. On sale were items collected by McLaren over the previous year, including rock & roll records, magazines, clothing and memorabilia from the 1950s. Let It Rock Trevor Myles (who ran Paradise Garage), relinquished the entire premises to McLaren and Casey in November 1971. They renamed the shop Let It Rock with stock including second- hand and new Teddy Boy clothes designed by McLaren's school teacher girlfriend Vivienne Westwood. The shop-front corrugated iron frontage was painted black with the name pasted in pink lettering. The interior was given period detail, such as \\"Odeon\\" wallpaper and Festival of Britain trinkets. Bespoke tailored drape jackets, skin-tight trousers and thick-soled \\"brothel creepers\\" shoes were the mainstays. Let It Rock was soon covered in the London Evening Standard. Too Fast To Live, Too Young To Die In 1973 the outlet interior was changed and the shop was given a new name, Too Fast To Live, Too Young To Die, to reflect a new range of clothing from Britain's early 1960s \\"rocker\\" fashions. In the spring of 1974 the shop underwent another refurbishment and was rebranded with the name Sex. Sex The fa√ßade included a 4 ft sign of pink foam rubber letters spelling \\"SEX\\". The interior was covered with graffiti from the SCUM Manifesto and chickenwire. Rubber curtains covered the walls and red carpeting was installed. SEX sold fetish and bondage wear supplied by existing specialist labels such as Atomage, She-And-Me and London Leatherman as well as designs by McLaren and Westwood. Jordan (Pamela Rooke) was a sales assistant. Among customers at SEX were the four original members of Sex Pistols (the bass-player Glen Matlock was an employee as a sales assistant on Saturdays). The group's name was provided by McLaren in partial promotion of the boutique. In August 1975, nineteen-year-old John Lydon was persuaded to audition for the group by singing along to Alice Cooper's \\"I'm Eighteen\\" on the jukebox. Other notable patrons included occasional assistant Chrissie Hynde, Adam Ant, Marco Pirroni, Siouxsie Sioux, Steven Severin and the rest of the Bromley Contingent. The store's designs confronted social and sexual taboos, and included T-shirts bearing images of the Cambridge Rapist's face hood, semi-naked cowboys from a 1969 illustration by the US artist Jim French, trompe-l'≈ìil bare breasts by Rhode Island School of Design students Janusz and Laura Gottwald in the late 1960s, and pornographic texts from the book School for Wives (\\"I groaned with pain...in a soft corrosion\\") by the beat author Alexander Trocchi. Also featured were T-shirts with the slogan 'Prick Up Your Ears', a reference to the biography of influential proto-punk subversive Joe Orton, and text culled from the biography of Orton stating how cheap clothes suited him. Among the designs were clear plastic-pocketed jeans, zippered tops and the Anarchy shirt which used dead stock from the 1960s manufacturer Wemblex. These were bleached and dyed shirts and adorned with silk Karl Marx patches and anarchist slogans.Do It Yourself: Democracy and Design. Journal of Design History, Vol. 19, No. 1, (Spring, 2006), pp. 69‚Äì83 Seditionaries In December 1976, 430 King's Road was renamed Seditionaries, trading under that title until September 1980. Designs were licensed by Westwood to the operators of the boutique at 153 King's Road, Boy (formerly Acme Attractions)who issued them, some with alterations, over the next eight years. Boy London was founded by Stephane Raynor and Israel-based businessman John Krivine in 1976 on the King's Road. Krivine sold the company in 1984. World's End World's End In late 1980, the shop at 430 King's Road re- opened under the name World's End. The building was designed by McLaren and Westwood and realised by Roger Burton, aided by Jeremy Blackburn and Tony Devers, to resemble a mixture of the Olde Curiosity Shoppe and an 18th-century galleon. The fa√ßade was installed with a large clock which spun backwards with the floor raked at an angle. McLaren and Westwood launched the first of a series of collections from the outlet at the beginning of 1981 and collaborated for a further three years. World's End remains open as part of Vivienne Westwood's global fashion empire. Famous shop assistants Many people related with the punk scene worked at the shop in one way or another. A notable employee was Jordan (Pamela Rooke), whose provocative dress sense served as a walking advertisement for the shop. At various times, Glen Matlock, Chrissie Hynde and Sid Vicious also worked there.

The process of cleaving an optical fiber forms one of the steps in the preparation for a fiber splice operation regardless of the subsequent splice being a fusion splice or a mechanical splice; the other steps in the preparation being those of stripping and fiber alignment. A good cleave is required for a successful low loss splice of an optical fiber, often it is the case that fibers spliced by identical methods tend to have different losses, this difference can often be attributed to the quality of their initial cleaves. The general method of cleaving involves a general strategy known as the scribe-and-tension or scribe-and-break strategy. This strategy involves the introduction of a small crack into the fiber and the subsequent application of a tensile force in the vicinity of the crack that causes the fiber to cleave. Cleaving technique The scribe-and-tension strategy A general cleaving strategy that is employed is known as the scribe-and-tension strategy or the scribe-and-break strategy. This process involves introduction of a crack in the fiber, generally by means of cutting tool made from a material such as diamond, sapphire, or tungsten carbide, followed by the application of tensile stress in the vicinity of the crack. However, the specific implementations of the cleaving vary and result in cleaves of different qualities. Certain implementations may apply the tensile force uniformly across the cross section of the fiber whereas others might bend the fiber around a curved surface causing excessive tensile stress on the outside of the bend. The introduction of the crack in the fiber may also be generated in different ways; the crack may be introduced at a single point on the circumference or it may be generated all along the circumference of the fiber prior to the application of the tensile force. The circumferential introduction of the crack often allows fibers of considerably large diameters to be cleaved while maintaining high quality of the cleave. Tools A mechanical cleaver * Pen-shaped scribe (aka diamond-tip scribe or diamond wedge scribe) looks like a ballpoint pen, but has a small wedge tip made of diamond or other hard material. This tool is used with the \\"scratch and pull\\" technique. First the fiber is scribed perpendicular to its length. The fiber is then pulled, which breaks at the scribe. This tool requires an experienced operator to produce good cleaves. * Mechanical cleavers clamp the fiber in the correct position before a diamond wheel or blade scribes the fiber. Then, a force is applied and the fiber gives a nice break at the scribe. Mechanical cleavers give nicer and more repeatable cleaves. * Multifiber cleavers are used for ribbon fiber cables.

Patriarch Adrian was a staunch adherent of traditional norms and opposed Peter the Great's reforms (e.g., he criticized Peter's decree on mandatory shaving of beards).

LHON is only transmitted through the mother, as it is primarily due to mutations in the mitochondrial (not nuclear) genome, and only the egg contributes mitochondria to the embryo. LHON is usually due to one of three pathogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) point mutations. These mutations are at nucleotide positions 11778 G to A, 3460 G to A and 14484 T to C, respectively in the ND4, ND1 and ND6 subunit genes of complex I of the oxidative phosphorylation chain in mitochondria. Men cannot pass on the disease to their offspring. Signs and symptoms Clinically, there is an acute onset of visual loss, first in one eye, and then a few weeks to months later in the other. Onset is usually young adulthood, but age range at onset from 7-75 is reported. The age of onset is slightly higher in females (range 19‚Äì55 years: mean 31.3 years) than males (range 15‚Äì53 years: mean 24.3). The male to female ratio varies between mutations: 3:1 for 3460 G>A, 6:1 for 11778 G>A and 8:1 for 14484 T>C. This typically evolves to very severe optic atrophy and a permanent decrease of visual acuity. Both eyes become affected either simultaneously (25% of cases) or sequentially (75% of cases) with a median inter-eye delay of 8 weeks. Rarely only one eye may be affected. In the acute stage, lasting a few weeks, the affected eye demonstrates an oedematous appearance of the nerve fiber layer especially in the arcuate bundles and enlarged or telangiectatic and tortuous peripapillary vessels (microangiopathy). The main features are seen on fundus examination, just before or subsequent to the onset of visual loss. A pupillary defect may be visible in the acute stage as well. Examination reveals decreased visual acuity, loss of color vision and a cecocentral scotoma on visual field examination. LHON with demyelinating lesions or LHON Plus \\"LHON Plus\\" is a name given to a rare variant of the disorder with eye disease together with other conditions. The symptoms of this higher form of the disease include loss of the brain's ability to control the movement of muscles, tremors, and cardiac arrhythmia.cardiac arrythmia Many cases of LHON plus have been comparable to multiple sclerosis because of the lack of muscular controlMayo Clinic: Multiple Sclerosis and because of the presence of demyelinating lesions in the CNS. It is therefore a subtype of MS according to McDonalds definition.David Bargiela, Patrick F Chinnery, Mitochondria in neuroinflammation ‚Äì Multiple sclerosis (MS), leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) and LHON-MS, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2017.06.051 Genetics Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is a condition related to changes in mitochondrial DNA. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria have a distinct mitochondrial genome composed of mtDNA. Mutations in the MT-ND1, MT-ND4, MT-ND4L, and MT-ND6 genes cause Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. These genes code for the NADH dehydrogenase protein involved in the normal mitochondrial function of oxidative phosphorylation. Oxidative phosphorylation uses a series of four large multienzyme complexes, which are all embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane to convert oxygen and simple sugars to energy. Mutations in any of the genes disrupt this process to cause a variety of syndromes depending on the type of mutation and other factors. It remains unclear how these genetic changes cause the death of cells in the optic nerve and lead to the specific features of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.  Pathophysiology  The eye pathology is limited to the retinal ganglion cell layer especially the maculopapillary bundle. Degeneration is evident from the retinal ganglion cell bodies to the axonal pathways leading to the lateral geniculate nuclei. Experimental evidence reveals impaired glutamate transport and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells. Also, experiments suggest that normal non LHON affected retinal ganglion cells produce less of the potent superoxide radical than other normal central nervous system neurons. Viral vector experiments which augment superoxide dismutase 2 in LHON cybrids or LHON animal models or use of exogenous glutathione in LHON cybrids have been shown to rescue LHON affected retinal ganglion cells from apoptotic death. These experiments may in part explain the death of LHON affected retinal ganglion cells in preference to other central nervous system neurons which also carry LHON affected mitochondria.  Diagnosis  Without a known family history of LHON the diagnosis usually requires a neuro-ophthalmological evaluation and blood testing for mitochondrial DNA assessment. It is important to exclude other possible causes of vision loss and important associated syndromes such as heart electrical conduction system abnormalities. Treatment The prognosis for those affected left untreated is almost always that of continued significant visual loss in both eyes. Regular corrected visual acuity and perimetry checks are advised for follow up of affected individuals. There is beneficial treatment available for some cases of this disease especially for early onset disease. Also, experimental treatment protocols are in progress. Genetic counselling should be offered. Health and lifestyle choices should be reassessed particularly in light of toxic and nutritional theories of gene expression. Vision aids assistance and work rehabilitation should be used to assist in maintaining employment. For those who are carriers of a LHON mutation, preclinical markers may be used to monitor progress. For example, fundus photography can monitor nerve fiber layer swelling. Optical coherence tomography can be used for more detailed study of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Red green color vision testing may detect losses. Contrast sensitivity may be diminished. There could be an abnormal electroretinogram or visual evoked potentials. Neuron-specific enolase and axonal heavy chain neurofilament blood markers may predict conversion to affected status. Cyanocobalamin (a form of B12) may also be used. Avoiding optic nerve toxins is generally advised, especially tobacco and alcohol. Certain prescription drugs are known to be a potential risk, so all drugs should be treated with suspicion and checked before use by those at risk. Ethambutol, in particular, has been implicated as triggering visual loss in carriers of LHON. In fact, toxic and nutritional optic neuropathies may have overlaps with LHON in symptoms, mitochondrial mechanisms of disease and management. Of note, when a patient carrying or suffering from LHON or toxic/nutritional optic neuropathy suffers a hypertensive crisis as a possible complication of the disease process, nitroprusside (trade name: Nipride) should not be used due to increased risk of optic nerve ischemia in response to this anti-hypertensive in particular. IdebenoneClinical Idebenone trial recruiting at Newcastle University UK http://lhon.ncl.ac.uk has been shown in a small placebo controlled trial to have modest benefit in about half of patients. People most likely to respond best were those treated early in onset. Œ±-Tocotrienol- quinone, a vitamin E metabolite, has had some success in small open label trials in reversing early onset vision loss.Sadun, A et al. \\"EPI-743 alters the natural history of progression of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy\\". AOS meeting. May 2011 There are various treatment approaches which have had early trials or are proposed, none yet with convincing evidence of usefulness or safety for treatment or prevention including brimonidine, minocycline, curcumin,Clinical Curcurmin trial recruiting at ClinicalTrials.nlm.nih.gov glutathione, near infrared light treatment,Wisconsin near infrared trial and viral vector techniques. \\"Three person in vitro fertilization\\" is a proof of concept research technique for preventing mitochondrial disease in developing human fetuses. So far, viable macaque monkeys have been produced. But ethical and knowledge hurdles remain before use of the technique in humans is established. Idebenone Idebenone is a short-chain benzoquinone that interacts with the mitochondrial electron transport chain to enhance cellular respiration. When used in individuals with LHON, it is believed to allow electrons to bypass the dysfunctional complex I. Successful treatment using idebenone was initially reported in a small number of patients. Two large- scale studies have demonstrated the benefits of idebenone. The Rescue of Hereditary Optic Disease Outpatient Study (RHODOS) evaluated the effects of idebenone in 85 patients with LHON who had lost vision within the prior five years. In this study, the group taking idebenone 900 mg per day for 24 weeks showed a slight improvement in visual acuity compared to the placebo group, though this difference was not statistically significant. Importantly, however, patients taking idebenone were protected from further vision loss, whereas the placebo group had a steady decline in visual acuity. Further, individuals taking idebenone demonstrated preservation of color vision and persistence of the effects of idebenone 30 months after discontinuing therapy. A retrospective analysis of 103 LHON patients by Carelli et al. builds upon these results. This study highlighted that 44 subjects who were treated with idebenone within one year of onset of vision loss had better outcomes, and, further, that these improvements with idebenone persisted for years. Idebenone, combined with avoidance of smoke and limitation of alcohol intake, is the preferred standard treatment protocol for patients affected by LHON. Idebenone doses are prescribed to be taken spaced out throughout the day, rather than all at one time. For example, to achieve a dose of 900 mg per day, patients take 300 mg three times daily with meals. Idebenone is fat soluble, and may be taken with a moderate amount of dietary fat in each meal to promote absorption. It is recommended that patients on idebenone also take vitamin C 500 mg daily to keep idebenone in its reduced form, as it is most active in this state.  Estrogen Replacement Therapy  Estrogens have been shown to have a protective role in the pathogenesis of LHON. Experiments using LHON cybrids have demonstrated that the estrogen receptor localizes to the mitochondria where it directly mediates mitochondrial biogenesis. Estrogens upregulate the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 2 and mitochondrial DNA synthesis. These experiments helped to explain the mechanism behind the lower penetrance of disease among female carriers. While additional factors have been theorized, the protective role of estrogens appears to be a significant contributor. In addition to the experimental evidence, clinical data also points towards the protective role of estrogens. Penetrance among female carriers is substantially lower (between 3 and 8 to 1 male to female ratios depending on the mutation) while average age at onset is significantly higher. Multiple case series of various LHON pedigrees have described female carriers converting after menopause or cessation of hormone replacement therapies. Together, these form a shifting paradigm towards considering reduced estrogen states, such as menopause, as potential triggers of visual loss similar to smoking or excessive alcohol consumption. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is emerging as an effective therapeutic target for female mutation carriers. In one recent case study where the affected female converted following cessation of HRT, idebenone, and HRT were given together. Visual acuity improved much faster than is typically expected. The patient‚Äôs vision returned to 20/40 and 20/60 from 20/60 and 20/200 in the right and left eyes respectively after only one month and was back normal by 8 months compared to the months to years timeframe seen in most cases. While the balance between risks and benefits of HRT remains controversial, the decision to start HRT requires an individualized approach based on the patient‚Äôs context. While not applicable for all post-menopausal women, prophylactic (and therapeutic) HRT should be considered in all female carriers of a known LHON mutation given the substantial risk of vision loss associated with menopause. Epidemiology In Northern European populations about one in 9000 people carry one of the three primary LHON mutations. There is a prevalence of between 1:30,000 to 1:50,000 in Europe. The LHON ND4 G11778A mutation dominates as the primary mutation in most of the world with 70% of Northern European cases and 90% of Asian cases. Due to a Founder effect, the LHON ND6 T14484C mutation accounts for 86% of LHON cases in Quebec, Canada. More than 50 percent of males with a mutation and more than 85 percent of females with a mutation never experience vision loss or related medical problems. The particular mutation type may predict the likelihood of penetrance, severity of illness and probability of vision recovery in the affected. As a rule of thumb, a woman who harbors a homoplasmic primary LHON mutation has a ~40% risk of having an affected son and a ~10% risk of having an affected daughter. Additional factors may determine whether a person develops the signs and symptoms of this disorder. Environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use may be involved, although studies of these factors have produced conflicting results. Researchers are also investigating whether changes in additional genes, particularly genes on the X chromosome, contribute to the development of signs and symptoms. The degree of heteroplasmy, the percentage of mitochondria which have mutant alleles, may play a role. Patterns of mitochondrial alleles called haplogroup may also affect expression of mutations. History This disease was first described by the German ophthalmologist Theodor Leber (1840‚Äì1917) in 1871.Leber T. Ueber hereditaere und congenital angelegte sehnervenleiden (1871) Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol. 17:249‚Äì291 In this paper Leber described four families in which a number of young men suffered abrupt loss of vision in both eyes either simultaneously or sequentially. This disease was initially thought to be X linked but was subsequently shown to be mitochondrial. The nature of the causative mutation was first identified in 1988 by Wallace et al. who discovered the guanine (G) to adenosine (A) mutation at nucleotide position 11778 in nine families. This mutation converts a highly conserved arginine to histidine at codon 340 in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The other two mutations known to cause this condition were identified in 1991 (G to A point mutation at nucleotide position 3460) and 1992 (thymidine (T) to cytosine (C) mutation at nucleotide 14484). These three mutations account for over 95% of cases: the 11778 mutation accounts for 50-70% of cases, the 14484 mutation for 10-15% and the 3460 mutation for 8-25%. Research Currently, human clinical trials are underway at GenSight Biologics (ClinicalTrials.gov # NCT02064569) and the University of Miami (ClinicalTrials.gov # NCT02161380) to examine the safety and efficacy of mitochondrial gene therapy in LHON. In these trials, participants affected by LHON with the G11778A mutation will have a virus expressing the functional version of ND4 ‚Äì the gene mutated in this variant of LHON ‚Äì injected into one eye. A sham injection will be administered to the other eye for comparison. It is hypothesized that introduction of the viral vector may be able to rescue the function of the mutant gene. Preliminary results have demonstrated tolerability of the injections in a small number of subjects. Stealth BioTherapeutics is presently investigating the potential use of elamipretide (MTP-131), a mitochondrial protective agent, as a therapy for LHON. Elamipretide helps stabilize cardiolipin ‚Äì an important component of mitochondrial inner membranes ‚Äì and has been shown to reduce damaging reactive oxygen species in animal models. Clinical trials in LHON patients are planned for the future.

The wide area of the lake stretches from Bay City, Wisconsin, in the north, down to Reads Landing, Minnesota in the south. The villages of Pepin, Maiden Rock and Stockholm are on the Wisconsin side, while Frontenac State Park takes up a large part of the Minnesota side. The largest city on the waterfront is Lake City, Minnesota. The Canadian Pacific Railway now owns the former mainline of the Milwaukee Road on the Minnesota side, and the Burlington Northern's former Burlington Route mainline is lakeside on the Wisconsin side. Both were former racetracks for the premier passenger trains of their owners, and the CP rails still carry Amtrak's Empire Builder between Chicago and the Pacific Northwest. Lakeside highways are U.S. Route 61 on the Minnesota side, and across the lake Wisconsin State Highway 35 is just inland from the railroad. Both are National Scenic Byways and parts of the Great River Road. Maiden Rock, on Lake Pepin, is one site said to be the locale where a Dakota woman named Winona leapt to her death.  Geology  Lake Pepin occupies a valley carved by the waters of Glacial River Warren, which drained Lake Agassiz in a catastrophic flood at the end of the last Ice Age, and to a lesser extent from Lake Duluth, a smaller glacial lake which drained through the present valley of the St. Croix River. When the continental glacier's meltwaters found other outlets to the sea, River Warren was succeeded by the more modest Upper Mississippi, which drains a much smaller basin, and the St. Croix spillway became the present river. Over a long period of time, the deep valley was partially filled with sediments, forming a broad floodplain. In this plain Lake Pepin formed behind a delta comprising sediments deposited into the ancient lake bed by the Chippewa River near the present community of Wabasha at the southern end of the lake. The lake backed up behind this sediment dam as far north as the location of Saint Paul. In the 10,000 years since the lake's creation, ongoing sedimentation into Lake Pepin has caused its upper end to migrate downstream some 80 km (50 mi) to its present location east (river direction south) of Red Wing, Minnesota.Ojakangas, Minnesota's Geology, pp. 113-15; Waters, The Streams and Rivers of Minnesota, pp. 219-20. Ecology The process of sedimentation continues at an accelerated rate; particulates carried by the river upstream are deposited when the current slows where the river empties into the lake. Pepin's natural flora are threatened by these increased rates of sedimentation, leading the Lake Pepin Legacy Alliance to call the phenomenon a \\"wet desert.\\" Some theorize the lake is filling in at a rate of ten times greater than pre-colonization, due largely to increased run-off from farms along the Minnesota River. Other research maintains sediment accumulation is from a more diverse and complicated series of processes, including natural bank sloughing of large amounts of soil from steep river banks, a result of the geography of the area, composition and physical properties of the soil, man-made restriction of river flooding, access to flood plains and wetlands, and forced straightening an deepening of river channels. Research suggests these processes are being heightened due to increasing precipitation due to climate change.https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TfJsbo54HLFkCJhd3B_PaFDPlWZ9A4EA/view Human history The lake was first named in a map of New France made by Guillaume Delisle at the request of Louis XIV of France in 1703. The lake was named for Jean Pepin who settled on its shores in the late 1600s after exploring the Great Lakes from Boucherville. Nicolas Perrot erected the first of a number of fur trade posts, Fort Saint Antoine, in 1686. In 1727 Ren√© Boucher de La Perri√®re and Michel Guignas built Fort Beauharnois on the lake. In 1730 it had to be rebuilt on higher ground.Quimby, Mrs. Thomas Letter to Ms. Sackett. Manuscripts/Notebooks. Minnesota Historical Society, Saint Paul, Minnesota. Boucher was the military leader and Father Guignas was a missionary to the Sioux. In the nineteenth century the lake was used to transport freshly-cut trees for the lumber industry. Cut logs were floated across the lake, from the 1840s often with the assistance of steamboats to counter adverse winds and the sluggish currents in the lake. Large rafts were assembled at Reads Landing at the southern end, and towed downstream to mills at Winona and St. Louis.Waters, The Streams and Rivers of Minnesota, p. 206. In 1890 it was the site of one of the worst maritime disasters on the Mississippi, known as the Sea Wing disaster when the Sea Wing ferry capsized in a bad storm, killing 98 people. In 1922, Lake City native Ralph Samuelson invented the sport of water skiing on the lake,Ralph Samuelson, Water Ski Hall of Fame.A Look Back... , Water Ski Hall of Fame. and Lake City is known as \\"the birthplace of waterskiing.\\" The city celebrates with a festival called Waterski Days every year on the last weekend in June. Popular culture Pepin, Wisconsin, is the birthplace of author Laura Ingalls Wilder. In Little House in the Big Woods, the first book in her Little House series, Laura's father visits Lake Pepin in the first chapter and her family visits the lake in the \\"Going to Town\\" chapter. Laura's family and their covered wagon then cross the frozen Lake Pepin in the chapter \\"Going West\\", the first chapter of the second book, Little House on the Prairie.

Biography  Maria was the only child of Roman Sanguszko and his wife Natalia Potocka, Polish aristocrats and members of some of the wealthiest and most notable families of the former Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. Her mother died soon after giving birth to her and her father was absent during her childhood as he was imprisoned from June 1831 until 1838 due to his participation in the November Uprising against Russia, and travelled extensively afterwards. In order to prevent the confiscation of his ancestral lands and property during his imprisonment, Maria was given nearly everything. She was raised by her grandparents Eustachy Erazm Sanguszko and Klementyna Czartoryska, presumably at the Sanguszko family's Palace in Slavuta where they resided. On 18 March 1851 she married Alfred J√≥zef Potocki, her cousin and a man thirteen years her senior. Despite this, their marriage seemed to be a happy one and Maria flourished in her new position as a governor's wife. She was a naturally meticulous and organised person which made her duties of setting up events like balls and banquets all the easier for her. Maria and her husband had four children: Count Roman Potocki born in 1851, Countess Julia Potocka born in 1854, Countess Klementyna Potocka born in 1856, and Count J√≥zef Potocki born in 1862. In the 1880s, her husband finally began construction on a new palace in Lviv to replace one that had been knocked down in the 1860s. Alfred would not live to see it finished, however, as he died in 1889. The Potocki Palace, Lviv was completed by Maria and their son Roman. She then transferred the Potocki family's palace in Antoniny, Ukraine to her younger son J√≥sef.  Death  In her later years, she split her time between the palace in Antoniny in the summer and the palace in Lviv in the winter. She died in Lviv at the age of seventy-three.

Pharyngeal slits are filter-feeding organs found among deuterostomes. Pharyngeal slits are repeated openings that appear along the pharynx caudal to the mouth. With this position, they allow for the movement of water in the mouth and out the pharyngeal slits. It is postulated that this is how pharyngeal slits first assisted in filter-feeding, and later with the addition of gills along their walls, aided in respiration of aquatic chordates. These repeated segments are controlled by similar developmental mechanisms. Some hemichordate species can have as many as 200 gill slits. Pharyngeal clefts resembling gill slits are transiently present during the embryonic stages of tetrapod development. The presence of pharyngeal arches and clefts in the neck of the developing human embryo famously led Ernst Haeckel to postulate that \\"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\\"; this hypothesis, while false, contains elements of truth, as explored by Stephen Jay Gould in Ontogeny and Phylogeny.. Also (paperback) However, it is now accepted that it is the vertebrate pharyngeal pouches and not the neck slits that are homologous to the pharyngeal slits of invertebrate chordates. Pharyngeal arches, pouches, and clefts are, at some stage of life, found in all chordates. One theory of their origin is the fusion of nephridia which opened both on the outside and the gut, creating openings between the gut and the environment.The Nephridial Hypothesis of the Gill Slit Origin Pharyngeal arches in Vertebrates In vertebrates, the pharyngeal arches are derived from all three germ layers. Neural crest cells enter these arches where they contribute to craniofacial features such as bone and cartilage. However, the existence of pharyngeal structures before neural crest cells evolved is indicated by the existence of neural crest-independent mechanisms of pharyngeal arch development. The first, most anterior pharyngeal arch gives rise to the oral jaw. The second arch becomes the hyoid and jaw support. In fish, the other posterior arches contribute to the brachial skeleton, which support the gills; in tetrapods the anterior arches develop into components of the ear, tonsils, and thymus. The genetic and developmental basis of pharyngeal arch development is well characterized. It has been shown that Hox genes and other developmental genes such as dlx are important for patterning the anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral axes of the branchial arches. Some fish species have jaws in their throat, known as pharyngeal jaws, which develop using the same genetic pathways involved in oral jaw formation. Evolution of pharyngeal slits A phylogeny showing when gill slits may have arisen. It is thought that gill slits were subsequently lost in echinoderms. The presence of pharyngeal slits in hemichordates led to debates of whether this structure was homologous to the slits found in chordates or a result of convergent evolution. With the placement of hemichordates and echinoderms as a sister group to chordates, a new hypothesis has emerged-suggesting that pharyngeal gill slits were present in the deuterostome ancestor . Intriguingly, extant echinoderms lack pharyngeal structures, but fossil records reveal that ancestral forms of echinoderms had gill-like structures. Comparative developmental and genetic studies of these pharyngeal structures between hemichordates and urochordates have brought about important insights regarding the evolution of the deuterostome body plan. Comparative molecular biology has revealed that the Pax1/9 genes (which encode for transcription factors) are expressed in similar patterns between hemichordates and urochordates; In vertebrates, Pax 1 and Pax 9 are expressed in the pharyngeal pouches and are important for thymus development. applying excess retinoic acid (excess retinoic acid in vertebrates results in pharyngeal abnormalities) leads to the absence of gill slits in developing Amphioxus, suggesting that retinoic acid may act through the same mechanism in vertebrates and amphioxus. These studies indicate that the pharyngeal slits found in hemichordates and chordates are indeed homologous in a molecular sense.

These attractions, while different from one another, tell a similar story of a trip to the mythical land of Atlantis. Each one combines roller coaster elements, such as chain lift hills and steep drops, with boat-based attraction elements, such as splash-down landings. All three attractions were designed by Mack Rides of Germany. SeaWorld Orlando The original Journey to Atlantis made its debut in 1998 at SeaWorld Orlando. It is one of the five roller coasters at the park. Along with Wild Arctic, it was one of the park's only thrill rides until the arrival of Kraken in 2000. The two other roller coasters came after, Manta in 2009 and Mako in 2016. Journey to Atlantis features a small aquarium exhibit, \\"Jewels of the Sea\\", in its gift shop exit area. Inside, guests will find aquaria built into the floor and the ceiling of the exhibit, along with more traditional aquaria. In March 2017, the ride finished its usual seasonal maintenance but Sea World changed the ride's whole theming, taking out all effects of Allura the evil mermaid and Hermes the fiber-optic seahorse (audio and lighting). The musical score and sound effects that once narrated the emotional arc of the ride disappeared too, and The ride's score was replaced with a continuous loop of soothing, ambient, relaxing music (borrowed from the park's former cirque-style show, A'lure ‚Äì Call of the Ocean) with generic celebratory Greek music on any exterior parts. The original version of the ride received mixed reviews, with complaints from parents that some of scenes frightened small children and may have been too scary for a family-friendly attraction. The ride was sometimes criticized for its intensity ‚Äî much like the Magic Kingdom's \\"Snow White's Adventures,\\" at Walt Disney World. Vehicle design The ride vehicles on Journey to Atlantis are boats with wheels on the bottom and on the sides. Each boat carries eight passengers, arranged into four rows with two passengers each. Two lap bars secure both passengers in the row. Track layout Journey to Atlantis begins as the boat is propelled via friction drives into a water flume meant to resemble an underwater canal. A siren beckons the boat closer until the mythical realm of Atlantis comes into view. The boat enters the city and all appears well, but soon the siren's true form is revealed, and the boat is carried up and out of the temple on a roller coaster chain lift hill. After a left-hand U-turn the boat starts up a second lift hill, entering a dry flume at the top of the hill that carries the boat to the large splash- down drop. The attraction's on-ride camera captures the boat's photograph as it slides down to the water below. The boat makes a right-hand U-turn leading to a short drop with a large splash and a final lift hill that leads back into the temple for one final encounter with the siren. At the top of this lift hill, the boat is now on a roller-coaster-type track. The boat escapes from the siren into the darkness, down a spiraling drop to the left before swooping up and landing in a final splash-down pool. The boat makes one final U-turn to the right before returning to the station. SeaWorld San Diego The second Atlantis opened in 2004 at SeaWorld San Diego. This version lacks the large interior scenes that the Orlando version includes; but makes up for it with the addition of a much larger roller coaster ride. Also, the boats on this version have individual lap-bars. Track layout Riders advance out of the station slowly onto the chain lift hill that is covered in fog machines, which give the illusion of climbing up water. At the top of the lift hill, riders make a full U-turn on a roller coaster track, which wraps around the elevator tower which stands at a height of 95 feet, while traversing a small hump. This turn offers the riders a view of the main roller coaster portion and parts of the park, in which boats emerge above the U-turn. The boat heads toward the 83 foot tall plunge tower, which bares an arched portico with fountain pouring down directly onto the tracks. The boats slip under, plunging down a flume channel into a pool of water. During the plunge, photos are taken of riders. The boat then makes a left-handed U-turn in the water pool and meanders through the pond gently.The boat then enters the plunge tower building at the base. The building is dark inside. The boats enter a room which lights up dimly and begins to flood. (Water comes through crevices in the wall to achieve the effect). The boats roll out of the room into the darkness and onto a special track that works like an elevator, carrying two boats simultaneously. The elevator rocks from side to side while traveling up, as though being pushed by an ocean current. The elevator stops to reach the maximum height position on the ride's course. The boats drop down a 70-foot, 270¬∞ curved drop and rise element, followed by a small block brake section. The boat then drops again into another banked hill, followed by a banked bunny hop which lands into another pool of water. The boats then meander through the pool and up a small lift hill to the loading area. A sliding switch track enables high-capacity, faster loading and unloading process. SeaWorld San Antonio The newest version of Atlantis opened in 2007 at SeaWorld San Antonio. First announced in August 2006, this version is based on a different model than its cousins. Although initial plans had called for a more elaborate indoor station and \\"towers\\" to enclose the ride's two turntables, SeaWorld opted to reduce the number of drops and turns. Thus, this version more closely resembles a traditional Shoot-the-Chutes boat ride. It is based on the \\"SuperSplash\\" devised by Mack Rides. Track layout Upon leaving the station, riders ascend a lift hill. Once at the top, the boat enters one of two turntables that allows riders a 360¬∞ view of the park. After one full rotation, the boat is positioned to pass through its reverse camel back backwards. The second turntable provides riders with an additional 360¬∞ view of the park before the boat finally dives through a building and into the water. Additionally, SeaWorld added walkways and a \\"viewing area\\" next to the ride's splash zone and queue, enabling guests the option to get soaked. The boat makes a U-turn before climbing back into the station.

For the latter event, floats are decorated entirely in flowers or other plant material.(source FBS INDUSTRIES) Float history French Quarter Float Parade floats were first introduced in the Middle Ages when churches used pageant wagons as movable scenery for passion plays. Artisan guilds were responsible for building the pageant wagons for their specified craft. The wagons were pulled throughout the town, most notably during Corpus Christi in which up to 48 wagons were used, one for each play in the Corpus Christi cycle. They are so named because the first floats were decorated barges on the River Thames for the Lord Mayor's Show. Largest The largest float ever exhibited in a parade was a entry in the 2012 Tournament of Roses Parade that featured Tillman the skateboarding bulldog (and some of his friends) surfing in an ocean of water. The water tank held over on a float weighing more than . It broke the previous record for the longest single-chassis parade float, which was set in 2010 by the same sponsor. The dogs trained for three months prior to the float's debut at the Tournament of Roses Parade on January 2, 2012. A specially designed ‚Äúwave‚Äù machine was incorporated into the design of the float which created a wave every minute. Tournament of Roses Volunteers working on the 2007 Star Wars floats Members of Pasadena's Valley Hunt Club first staged the Tournament of Roses Parade in 1890. Many of the members of the Valley Hunt Club were former residents of the American East and Midwest. They wished to showcase their new California homes' mild winter weather. At a club meeting, Professor Charles F. Holder announced, \\"In New York, people are buried in the snow. Here our flowers are blooming and our oranges are about to bear. Let's hold a festival to tell the world about our paradise.\\" And so the Club organized horse-drawn carriages covered in flowers, followed by foot races, polo matches, and a game of tug-of-war on the town lot. They attracted a crowd of 2000 to the event. Upon seeing the scores of flowers on display, the Professor decided to suggest the name \\"Tournament of Roses.\\" Battle of Flowers The Battle of Flowers parade is in San Antonio, Texas is the only parade in the United States produced entirely by women, all of whom are volunteers. The parade is the oldest event and largest parade of Fiesta San Antonio. The original purpose of the parade was to honor the heroes of the Alamo. In keeping with this tradition, participants are asked to place a flower tribute on the lawn of the Alamo as they pass by. Dutch flower parades 'Booming city', the winning float of the Zundert flower parade 2008. In the Netherlands, flower parades (called 'Bloemencorso') are a popular tradition. The small country holds some 30 parades, large and small. The world's largest flower parade is held every year in Zundertthe eighth day of the fourth lunar month, a small town in the south of the Netherlands. In Zundert, and most other Dutch parades, floats are built entirely by volunteers, where hamlets compete with each other to build the most beautiful float, judged by an independent jury. Most Dutch flower parades are held in August and September and use mainly dahlia flowers. The dahlia fields are kept by volunteers as well.

Among his creations are the Comic Sans font, and the Trebuchet MS font. Besides text typefaces, he finalized and hinted the font Marlett which has been used for scalable User Interface icons in Microsoft Windows since 1995 and created portions of the font Webdings that was first shipped with Internet Explorer. Education Connare studied at Milford High School in Milford, Massachusetts and at the New York Institute of Technology where he received a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts and Photography. He later earned a master's degree in Type Design at the University of Reading.  Career = Microsoft  After graduating from the New York Institute of Technology, Connare began working as a photographer for the Worcester Telegram in Massachusetts. In 1993 he created a font pack for Apple and Microsoft, which led to a job with Microsoft. While working for Microsoft, Connare contributed to documents on font production as well as the fonts Trebuchet MS, Webdings, and most notably Comic Sans. Connare left Microsoft in 1999 to work towards his master's degree at the University of Reading in England.  Dalton Maag  While working at Dalton Maag, a typeface design company located in Brixton London, Connare created the Magpie font and designed the Ministry of Sound logo.  Comic Sans = Creating Comic Sans  When Microsoft launched Windows 1995, it featured a new program, Microsoft Bob, that included a cartoon that would talk with speech bubbles. Connare felt that the cartoons in Microsoft Bob needed a less formal looking font; something more suitable for kids. Inspired by DC and Marvel comic books, Connare created Comic Sans in 1994 by using a mouse and cursor to draw intentionally sloppy letters. Microsoft Bob inevitably faded into obscurity, but Comic Sans secured its legacy after quickly getting adopted by the Walt Disney Company.  Reception  Soon after Connare created Comic Sans the font was adopted by many notable companies including Apple, BMW, and Burberry. Despite the font's commercial success, it is controversial and its detractors are passionate. The hatred goes so far that a group of Canadians campaigned to ban the font in 2005. Connare has not been deterred by the negative backlash to his creation; in fact, at the Fourth Annual Boring Conference Connare said he found the contempt for his work to be \\"mildly amusing\\". Comic Sans has become very widely used in applications ranging from newspapers titles and store signs, to the Spanish world cup trophy and the Pope's photo album at the Vatican. Connare has stated that he is very proud of the font, offering different rationales. Arguing that \\"Comic Sans does what it was commissioned to do, it is loved by kids, mums and many dads. So it did its job very well. It matched the brief!\\" He has also referred to it as \\"the best joke I've ever told.\\" Comic Sans is a particularly popular font; in fact, Simon Garfield's new book on fonts, ‚ÄúJust My Type‚Äù, devotes the first chapter to Comic Sans. Comic Sans is also listed in the book ‚ÄúHow to Design a Typeface‚Äù by the Design Museum in London, which was reviewed in newspapers across London. Comic Sans has also featured on the front page of the Wall Street Journal.

Her album Stadtkind was dedicated to the city of Berlin, and she cites the culture of reunified Berlin as one of the main inspirations for her music. She sings in both German and English. Her music is best described as a blend of IDM and Techno music, which is dance-floor oriented and has noticeable experimental elements. She lives in Berlin.  History  Ellen Allien was born and grew up in West Berlin. During 1989, she lived in London where she first came into contact with electronic music. When she later returned to Berlin, electronic music had become increasingly popular in Germany. In 1992, she became resident DJ at the Bunker, Tresor, and E-Werk. She started her own show on the Berlin radio station Kiss FM and created her own record label, calling them both \\"Braincandy\\". Due to problems with distribution, she gave the Braincandy label up in 1997 and instead began organizing parties with the name, \\"Pitch Control\\". Allien created the label BPitch Control in 1999. She released her first album, Stadtkind, in 2001, and her second album, Berlinette, in 2003. In 2005, after releasing the album Thrills, Allien created a BPitch sublabel called \\"Memo Musik\\" for minimal tech and minimal house. Orchestra of Bubbles, a collaboration with Apparat, was released in 2006. During the same year, Allien launched her own fashion line, \\"Ellen Allien Fashion\\". After the minimalistic Sool in 2008, she released her fifth solo album, Dust, in 2010. Allien made a brief appearance in the 2009 electronic music documentary Speaking In Code. Then she worked on the music for the dance performance \\"Drama Per Musica\\", which has been premiered in Paris in March 2011 under the direction of Alexandre Roccoli and Sev√©rine Ri√®me. The accompanying album \\"LISm\\" was released in 2013 and, like her DJ sets, unites different musical styles into a homogenous whole. Also the successor \\"Nost\\" sets on variety, however within the electronic spectrum. Thus she returns to her technoid underground roots and stays true to her dancefloor principles after about three decades. In 2019 Ellen Allien launched her UFO Inc. label with an EP that features the epic ¬ªUFO¬´ which has been on heavy rotation in her DJ sets all summer long. Between ¬ªUFO¬´ and the hard-hitting Berlin acid belter ¬ªK√∂rpermaschine¬´ on the flipside, the ¬ªUFO¬´ EP perfectly captures the energetic hardware sound of Allien‚Äôs new imprint, which will be dedicated to a rough and raw approach to techno. Ellen Allien holds residencies in the clubs Nitsa, Barcelona and Circoloco at DC10, Ibiza and is a regular in clubs such as Madrid‚Äôs Mondo. She started her already infamous bi-monthly 'We Are Not Alone' raves at Griessm√ºhle in her beloved and vibrant native town Berlin that will guest in other cities around the globe too ‚Äì just as her in-store record shop happenings under the name Vinylism.

He is an Italian-Swiss scientist (born in Naples, Italy) who, after studying chemical processes and the decay of living beings, gains an insight into the creation of life and gives life to his own creature, often referred to as Frankenstein's monster, or often colloquially referred to as simply \\"Frankenstein\\". Victor later regrets meddling with nature through his creation, as he inadvertently endangers his own life, as well as the lives of his family and friends, when the creature seeks revenge against him. In the novel we are introduced to the character when he is seeking to catch the monster near the North Pole and is saved from near death by Robert Walton and his crew. Some aspects of the character are believed to have been inspired by 17th-century alchemist Johann Conrad Dippel. Certainly, the author and her environment were aware of the experiment on electricity and dead tissues by Galvani and his nephew Aldini or, perhaps, Alessandro Volta at the university of Pavia. Origin of the character One of the characters of 's novella Le Miroir des √©v√©nements actuels ou la Belle au plus offrant, published in 1790, is an inventor named \\"Wak-wik-vauk-an-son- frank√©ste√Øn\\",Original text on Gallica. then abridged as \\"Frank√©ste√Øn\\", but there is no proof Shelley had read it. History The character of Victor Frankenstein was born in Naples, Italy (according to the 1831 edition of Shelley's novel) with his Swiss family. He was the son of Alphonse Frankenstein and Caroline Beaufort, who died of scarlet fever when Victor was 17. He describes his ancestry thus: \\"I am by birth a Genevese; and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics; and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation.\\"Shelley, Mary. Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus Chapter 1 (first sentence) Frankenstein has two younger brothers‚ÄîWilliam, the youngest, and Ernest, the middle child. Frankenstein falls in love with Elizabeth Lavenza, who became his adoptive sister (his blood cousin in the 1818 edition) and, eventually, his fianc√©e. As a boy, Frankenstein is interested in the works of alchemists such as Cornelius Agrippa, Paracelsus, and Albertus Magnus, and he longs to discover the fabled elixir of life. He loses interest in both these pursuits and in science as a whole after seeing the remains of a tree struck by lightning; however, at the University of Ingolstadt in Bavaria, Frankenstein develops a fondness for chemistry, and becomes obsessed with the idea of creating life in inanimate matter through artificial means, pursuing this goal for two years. Assembling a humanoid creature through ambiguous means, Frankenstein successfully brings it to life, but he is horrified by the creature's ugliness. He flees from his creation, who disappears and, after several negative encounters with the locals, swears revenge on his creator. When William is found murdered, Frankenstein knows instantly that his creation is the killer, but says nothing. The Frankensteins' housekeeper, Justine, is blamed for the boy's death and executed; Frankenstein is wracked with guilt but does not come forward with the truth because he thinks no one will believe his story, and he is afraid of the reactions such a story would provoke. The creature approaches Frankenstein and begs him to create a female companion for him. Frankenstein agrees, but ultimately destroys this creation, fearing the idea of a race of monsters. Enraged, the creature swears revenge; he kills Henry Clerval, Frankenstein's best friend, and promises Frankenstein, \\"You have denied me my wedding night - I will be with you on yours!\\" The creature keeps his promise by strangling Elizabeth on her matrimonial bed. That same night, Frankenstein's father dies of grief. With nothing else left to live for, Frankenstein dedicates his life to destroying the creature. Frankenstein pursues the \\"fiend\\" or \\"Demon\\" (as he calls his creation) to the Arctic, intending to destroy it. Although he is rescued by a ship attempting an expedition to the North Pole, he dies after relating his tale to the ship's captain, Robert Walton. His creature, upon discovering the death of his creator, is overcome by sorrow and vows to commit suicide by burning himself alive in \\"the Northernmost extremity of the globe;‚Äù he then disappears, never to be seen or heard from again. Characterisation While many subsequent film adaptations (notably the 1931 movie Frankenstein and the Hammer Films series starring Peter Cushing) have portrayed Frankenstein as the prototypical \\"mad scientist\\", the novel portrayed him as a tragic figure. Percy Shelley, Mary's husband, served as a significant influence for the character. Victor was a pen name of Percy Shelley's, as in the collection of poetry he wrote with his sister Elizabeth, Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire. There is speculation that Percy was one of Mary Shelley's models for Victor Frankenstein; while a student at Eton College, he had \\"experimented with electricity and magnetism as well as with gunpowder and numerous chemical reactions\\", and his rooms at Oxford University were filled with scientific equipment. Percy Shelley was the first-born son of a wealthy, politically connected country squire, and a descendant of Sir Bysshe Shelley, 1st Baronet of Castle Goring, and Richard Fitzalan, 10th Earl of Arundel.Percy Shelley#Ancestry As stated in the novel, Frankenstein's family is one of the most distinguished of the Genevese republic and his ancestors were counselors and syndics. Percy had a sister named Elizabeth; Frankenstein had an adopted sister, named Elizabeth. On 22 February 1815, Mary Shelley delivered a baby two months premature; the child died two weeks later.\\"Journal 6 December ‚Äì Very Unwell. Shelley & Clary walk out, as usual, to heaps of places...A letter from Hookham to say that Harriet has been brought to bed of a son and heir. Shelley writes a number of circular letters on this event, which ought to be ushered in with ringing of bells, etc., for it is the son of his wife.\\" Quoted in Spark, 39. The question of Frankenstein's responsibility to the creature ‚Äì in some ways like that of a parent to a child ‚Äì is one of the main themes of the book. Obsession plays a major role in the development of Frankenstein's character. First, as a child, he is obsessed with reading books on alchemy, astrology, and many pseudo-sciences. Later, as a young man, he becomes enthralled with the study of life sciences - mainly dealing with death and the reanimation of corpses. Finally, after the monster is created, Frankenstein is consumed with guilt, despair, and regret, leading him to obsess over the nature of his creation. In other media=Books Besides the original novel, the character also appears or is mentioned in other books from pastiches to parodies. * In the book Frankenstein's Aunt, the Baron's aunt comes to Frankenstein's castle to put it back in order, following the chaos caused by her nephew's experiments. In the novel Frankenstein's Aunt Returns, Frankenstein has created a child for the monster and his bride. * In Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, Victor Frankenstein ‚Äì now going by the alias of Victor Helios ‚Äì has survived into the present, now living in New Orleans while arranging for the creation of his 'New Race' of humanity, now growing his creations in tanks after acquiring funding from the likes of Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Fidel Castro over the centuries. His creations are mentally and emotionally defective, however, and Helios is forced to kill them, all while convinced that it is due to a flaw in his process rather than being able to acknowledge that his own warped views are the reasons his creations break down due to the hopelessness of their lives and inability to find their own purpose. He is opposed in his 'quest' by his original creation ‚Äì now called Deucalion, who has mastered the ability to teleport due to the unique circumstances of his creation ‚Äì and two New Orleans detectives. * In Kenneth Oppel's novel This Dark Endeavor and its sequel Such Wicked Intent, Frankenstein is portrayed as a 16-year-old aspiring scientist who creates his own creature from the body of his deceased twin brother, Konrad. In the 2001 Curtis Jobling book, Frankenstein's Cat, it features Frankenstein, sometime before creating his monster, creating a cat called Nine (named because he was made out of nine cats). This book was later adapted into a television series in 2007. Film Victor Frankenstein (1910 film) * Victor Frankenstein's first appearance on screen was in a 1910 film (produced by Thomas Edison) in which he seemed more of a magician. * The character's first significant film appearance was in Universal Pictures' 1931 film adaptation, directed by James Whale. Here, the character is renamed Henry Frankenstein (a later film shows his tombstone bearing the name Heinrich von Frankenstein) and is played by British actor Colin Clive opposite Boris Karloff as the monster. Clive reprised his role in the 1935 sequel, Bride of Frankenstein, which reunited Clive, Whale and Karloff, as well as first giving Frankenstein the official title of Baron. Although the character is not present in the following sequels due to Clive's death in 1937, an oil painting of Frankenstein (as portrayed by Clive) appears in 1939's Son of Frankenstein; he is also the title character, in spite of having only a cameo, in The Ghost of Frankenstein (1942), where his ghost is portrayed by Cedric Hardwicke (who also plays Henry's son Ludwig Frankenstein in the film). * The character gained new life in 1957 when Peter Cushing first essayed the role in Hammer Films' The Curse of Frankenstein, opposite Christopher Lee as the Creature. Cushing went on to star as Victor Frankenstein, identified as a Baron, in five more films for the studio, with each subsequent movie in the series uncovering different aspects of the character; for example, in 1958‚Äôs The Revenge of Frankenstein he shows genuine concern for the patients of the poor hospital he controls, in contrast to the Baron as portrayed in Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed (1969), where Cushing is a ruthless megalomaniac who utilises blackmail, rape and murder to terrorise those around him. * The 1967 film Mad Monster Party? featured Baron Boris von Frankenstein (voiced by Boris Karloff) who is based on Victor Frankenstein. Boris discovers the secret to total destruction and plans to reveal it to the Worldwide Organization of Monsters while announcing his retirement. He has a nephew named Felix Flanken, whom he claims is the son of his youngest sister (an expert in witchcraft) and a medicine man, though the film's twist ending reveals him to actually be a sentient automaton built by Boris. * After Cushing temporarily retired from the role following 1969's Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed, Hammer decided to reboot the series for the 1970s. The Horror of Frankenstein was a tongue-in-cheek black comedy remake of The Curse of Frankenstein, which featured Ralph Bates as a younger, \\"hipper\\" Baron in the sinister mold of Cushing's interpretation. After the film failed to be the success Hammer had hoped for, they brought Cushing back for one final film, in 1974's Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell. * The 1972 TV film Mad Mad Mad Monsters (a \\"prequel of sorts\\" to Mad Monster Party?) featured Baron Henry von Frankenstein (voiced by Bob McFadden impersonating Boris Karloff). In the TV film, Henry and his assistant Igor construct and bring to life a female monster, intended to be the original creature's bride. Frankenstein goes to the Transylvania Astoria Hotel in order to make the wedding arrangements. * Udo Kier played Baron Victor Frankenstein in 1973's Flesh for Frankenstein. This version of the character is a serial killer who is married to his own sister. * Leonard Whiting played Victor Frankenstein in Frankenstein: The True Story (1973). * Robert Foxworth played Victor Frankenstein in a 1973 television adaptation Frankenstein. * In Mel Brooks' 1974 comedy Young Frankenstein, Gene Wilder portrays Frederick Frankenstein, grandson of Victor Frankenstein, who inherits the family estate, but is ashamed of his grandfather's work (to the point of insisting that his name is pronounced \\"Fronk-en-steen\\"). He is ultimately inspired to take up the work, eventually creating his own monster (played by Peter Boyle). * Barrett Oliver portrays a young version of Victor Frankenstein in 1984 short film Frankenweenie, directed by Tim Burton. Charlie Tahan plays Victor in the 2012 animated remake. * Sting appeared as \\"Charles\\" Frankenstein in 1985's The Bride opposite Clancy Brown as the monster. * Raul Julia portrayed Frankenstein in Roger Corman's Frankenstein Unbound (1990) based on the Brian Aldiss novel. * In 1992, a made-for-TV film adaptation of Frankenstein was produced by David Wickes for Turner Pictures. It starred Patrick Bergin as Victor and Randy Quaid as the monster. In this film, Victor clones himself instead of creating the creature from the dead. In this adaptation, Victor and the monster share a psychic link, and can sense each other's presence. * Kenneth Branagh reinterpreted the character along the lines of Shelley's portrayal in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1994) opposite Robert De Niro as the monster. * In the 1999 animated film Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein, Dr. Frankenstein is the main antagonist voiced by Michael Bell. After secretly creating the monster in a roller coaster, his lab is discovered by the Chipmunks and he sends his creation after them. After the creature had not returned, he goes to the Chipmunks' house and kidnaps Alvin. He then uses a formula that makes Alvin go out of control. After Alvin is returned to normal, Frankenstein, in disguise as the park's mascot Sammy the Squirrel, tries to electrocute him, but is electrocuted by his own creation. When he regains consciousness, he is unable to get the mask off him. Later near the end of the film, he appears as the theme park's entertainer. * In the 2004 film Van Helsing, Victor Frankenstein (portrayed by Samuel West) is hired by Count Dracula to create the monster for Dracula to use to bring his offspring to life. When Frankenstein refuses, Dracula kills him, only to be attacked by the monster. The monster takes Frankenstein's body to the windmill, but an angry mob outside of the castle sees the monster and chases it to the windmill. They set fire to the windmill in order to kill the monster, but are chased off by Dracula and his brides. The monster survives when the floor on top of the windmill caves in. The monster ‚Äì which refers to Frankenstein as his/its father ‚Äì is later used to bring Dracula's offspring to life, only to escape from the castle with help from monster hunter Gabriel Van Helsing. * The 2004 independent movie Frankenstein features a Victor Frankenstein known as Victor Helios (portrayed by Thomas Kretschmann), who has used his own research to extend his life into the modern day, where he continues his experiments to create life with the goal of replacing humanity with his own creatures. He is opposed by his original creation, who is determined to defeat his creator while being hampered by a mental 'block' Helios has installed in all his creatures to prevent them from harming him. * The 2004 made-for-TV Hallmark production of Frankenstein starred Alec Newman as Victor Frankenstein opposite of Luke Goss as the monster. * The 2007 film Frankenstein introduces Victoria Frankenstein. Instead of making the creature out of corpses, she uses stem cells, intending to use her experiment to save her dying son. The experiment goes wrong, however, and the creature escapes. When Frankenstein catches up with the monster, she comes to love it because it is her only remaining link to her son who has since died. * Victor Frankenstein briefly appears in the 2014 film I, Frankenstein, in which he is played by Aden Young. * Victor Frankenstein was portrayed by James McAvoy in the 2015 film Victor Frankenstein. In this version, he rescues Igor (Daniel Radcliffe) - formerly an unnamed hunchback from a circus who impressed Victor with his exceptional self-taught medical skills - to enlist him as his partner in creating life, later attributing his desire as a means of making up for a childhood incident where his elder brother died in a blizzard. Although Victor acknowledges that his first human creation has no true spark of life in it, the film concludes with him speculating how he shall improve on his project in the future. Television * Victor Frankenstein is mentioned as the creator of Herman Munster of the series The Munsters, but does not appear in the series. At Herman and Lily's wedding, Frankenstein gave Herman away \\"with his blueprints.\\" He is currently dead. In \\"A Visit from Johann,\\" (1966) the episode introduced the great-great-grandson of Victor Frankenstein named Victor Frankenstein IV (played by John Abbott). * In an episode of \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\", Guinan alludes that she knew Dr. Frankenstein. * In The World's Greatest Super Friends episode \\"The Super Friends Meet Frankenstein,\\" the Dr. Frankenstein (voiced by Stanley Ralph Ross) that is featured is depicted as the great-great-grandson of the original Dr. Frankenstein who carries on the \\"family tradition\\" of creating monsters. He is assisted by an Igor-like henchman named Gore (voiced by Michael Bell). Dr. Frankenstein uses his monsters to take revenge on the Transylvanians for what they did to his ancestor. When he unleashes the classic Frankenstein's monster to attack Transylvania, the Super Friends are called in to investigate. When Batman and Robin attack the monster, Dr. Frankenstein orders his creation to lure the Dynamic Duo to his castle in order to trap them. When Batman and Robin short- circuit Frankenstein's monster, Dr. Frankenstein arrives and traps them while thanking them for giving him an idea for his next creation. First, Dr. Frankenstein transfers Batman's abilities to the target body. Robin manages to escape and calls in Superman and Wonder Woman. When the arrive, Dr. Frankenstein unleashes on them a tentacled, Kryptonite-powered, tar creature. Dr. Frankenstein then transfers Superman and Wonder Woman's abilities into the target body for his next monster. Thus creating a composite monster who has Batman's head, cape, and genius-level intellect, Superman's body and super abilities, and Wonder Woman's magic lasso, magic bracelets, and telepathic powers. Dr. Frankenstein sends his Super-Monster to attack Europe while Robin and Gleek free Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. With help from the Austrian Energy Research Institute, Robin undergoes the same experiment that created the Super-Monster granting him the powers of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. Robin and the Super-Monster are evenly matched until Robin dons a lead suit and exposes the Super-Monster to Kryptonite. Robin defeats the Super- Monster while Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Gleek apprehend Dr. Frankenstein and Gore followed by them regaining their powers by reversing the experiment. * Victor Frankenstein appears in The Transformers episode \\"Autobot Spike,\\" voiced by Frank Welker. The Autobots see him in a Frankenstein movie. * The humorous TV series Frankenstein's Aunt features a Dr. Frankenstein who creates a typical Frankenstein's monster. As in the Universal Pictures' 1931 film adaptation, the character is renamed Henry Frankenstein (portrayed by Bolek Pol√≠vka). * In ABC's fairy tale drama series Once Upon a Time, Dr. Frankenstein (David Anders), originally from a fictional German-theme world called the Land Without Color, is one of many characters brought to the Storybrooke by the Evil Queen under the alias Dr. Whale, named for director James Whale,Once Upon a Time - Behind the Magic, Titan Books, London, October 2013, p. 162. Facsimile by Google Books. and serves as a recurring character throughout the show's run. He works at the local hospital, and was responsible for creating the show's version of the monster when he tries to resurrect his dead brother, Gerhardt. * The Adult Swim animated series Mary Shelley's Frankenhole features Dr. Victor Frankenstein (voiced by Jeff B. Davis) and other characters from both the novel Frankenstein and other classic horror films. Frankenstein is depicted as being a narcissist who, after drinking an immortality serum he invented, has lived for more than a thousand years. He has developed the technology to connect his village to various points in time, called Frankenholes, that allow various people from history to time travel to visit him in the hopes he will do some sort of miraculous surgery to fix physical and mental flaws. * The 2014 Showtime series Penny Dreadful depicts Dr. Victor Frankenstein (played by Harry Treadaway) as a young morgue worker in England during the late 1800s. He creates his monster \\"Caliban\\" (played by Rory Kinnear) by attaching a cadaver to a system of circuits and running electricity through it during a lightning storm. Unlike other adaptions, Victor creates two more creations: Proteus and Lily.

HBRY was formed by railroad holding company OmniTRAX in July 1997 to purchase former Canadian National Railway (CN) rail lines running north from The Pas on two branches, one to Flin Flon and on to Lynn Lake, the other to Thompson and on to the Port of Churchill on Hudson Bay. Operations began on August 20, 1997. At the same time, OmniTRAX also took over the operation and marketing of the Port of Churchill from Transport Canada. Previous owner CN had limited the allowable tonnage to operate on the lines as a result of the light rail and poor track base. However, the HBRY has been able to successfully operate heavier rail cars and longer trains in recent years without difficulty, resulting in increased business to the Port of Churchill and from various mines and pulp mills. HBRY is a vital transportation link in northern Manitoba, hauling ores and concentrates, copper, zinc, logs, kraft paper, lumber, and petroleum products. Via Rail Canada also uses HBRY tracks to operate its passenger train service between The Pas and Churchill. Major customers for HBRY include HudBay Minerals, Tolko, Vale, Gardwine North, Stittco Energy, Farmers of North America, and formerly, the Canadian Wheat Board. History The line was constructed by an earlier company of the same name. The Hudson Bay Railway was built starting in the early 1900s under Canadian Northern Railway before being taken over by the Government of Canada and completed in 1929. The lines were operated by Canadian National Railway from 1929-1997 before being sold to OmniTRAX. Route Port Nelson, required a long causeway, to the centre of the silty Nelson River. Originally, the Hudson Bay port where the rail line was to terminate was to have been Port Nelson, at the mouth of the Nelson River, which drains Lake Winnipeg. During World War One construction of the rail line was suspended, to divert resources to the war effort. When construction was recommenced the decision was made that maintaining a port on the Nelson River would have too many ongoing expenses, and that the port should be relocated to the mouth of the Churchill River. The Nelson River has a greater volume of flow, and contains more silt. A channel several miles long would have to be regularly dredged. In addition, the river's mouth was wide, and shallow. An artificial island had been built, to house the pier, with a causeway. The Churchill River's mouth was deeper, clearer, and required less on-going dredging. This change of port is the reason the rail line turns almost directly north. 2005 washout On July 27, 2005, heavy rains washed out part of the railroad between The Pas and Pukatawagan; all service over the line, including Via Rail trains 690 and 691, was suspended while repairs took place.Via Rail Canada (July 27, 2005), Hudson Bay Railway closes line - Via service form The Pas to Pukatawagan temporarily cancelled. Retrieved August 1, 2005. Service was restored on August 2, 2005, two days ahead of initial expectations.Via Rail Canada (August 2, 2005), Via resumes service between Churchill and Winnipeg. Retrieved November 20, 2005. 2006 sale of Keewatin Railway On April 1, 2006, the Hudson Bay Railway sold the former CN Sherridon Subdivision, between Sheritt Junction and Lynn Lake, to the three native tribes in the area, who now own and operate the railway, running twice- weekly mixed (passenger plus freight) trains. 2017 washout caused extended outage and economic impact On May 23, 2017, OmniTRAX announced that due to unprecedented flooding, the line was closed indefinitely between Amery and Churchill, pending evaluation of the damages and repairs. Loss of rail service, both passenger and freight, impacted the tourism industry and imposed other costs on Churchill's already fragile economy. Churchill, and other northern communities where cargo must now be delivered by air, faced skyrocketing prices for staples such as groceries and fuel. Due to a disagreement over what entity was responsible for repair costs, it was uncertain whether the line would ever be repaired. The Canadian government filed an $18 million lawsuit against OmniTRAX for breach of contract. The position of Canada's Natural Resources Minister, Jim Carr, was that \\"Omnitrax Inc. had legal obligations to repair the rail line and its tracks, citing a contract that required OmniTRAX to \\"operate, maintain and repair the entire Hudson Bay Railway Line in a diligent and timely manner until March 31, 2029.\\" The position of OmniTRAX was that the extensive flooding constitutes a force majeure that excused it from fulfilling the contract. Sale to Arctic Gateway Group In August 2018, the line and port was sold to the Arctic Gateway Group which contracted Cando Rail Services Ltd. and Paradox Access Solutions to begin repairing the line.Repairs to begin as Hudson Bay Railway sold Railway Gazette International September 3, 2018 The Group, a public- private partnership, is 50% owned by Manitoba communities and First Nations, and 50% owned by Fairfax Financial Holdings and AGT Food and Ingredients. On August 31, 2018, the Federal Government announced that they would be helping to fund the purchase of the railway, and port facilities, back from Omnitrax. $43 million of the $117 million the Federal Government committed is a grant to help cover operating costs, for the first three years of Arctic Gateway Group's operations. On November 1, 2018, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau helped welcome the first train to arrive in Churchill in 18 months. The first passenger train traveled the line a month later. Operations A train carrying liquid petroleum derailed on September 16, 2018. One member of the train's crew died, and two other crew members were hospitalized. The train consisted of 3 locomotives, and 27 tanker cars. The train was crossing a creek near Ponton, Manitoba when it derailed. Arctic Gateway Group reported no oil was spilled. There are two VIA Rail passenger trains a week each way between Winnipeg and Churchill, taking about 45 hours, and one from Churchill to The Pas.

The work involves a full orchestra, with particular emphasis on the brass section at climactic moments. The work is narrated with the reading of excerpts of Abraham Lincoln's great documents, including the Gettysburg Address. An orchestra usually invites a prominent person to be the narrator. History Conductor Andre Kostelanetz commissioned Copland to write a musical portrait of an \\"eminent American\\" for the New York Philharmonic. Copland chose President Abraham Lincoln, and used material from speeches and letters of Lincoln, as well as original folk songs of the period, including \\"Camptown Races\\" and \\"On Springfield Mountain\\". Copland finished Lincoln Portrait in April 1942. The first performance was by the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra on 14 May 1942, with William Adams as the narrator. Texts Together with some descriptive comments on Lincoln (\\"Abe Lincoln was a quiet and a melancholy man\\"), the work contains the following excerpts from his speeches: > Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this congress and this > administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal > significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us. The fiery > trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the > latest generation. We, even we here, hold the power and bear the > responsibility. (Annual Message to Congress [since the twentieth century, > State of the Union], December 1, 1862) The dogmas of the quiet past are > inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty > and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think > anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our > country. (Annual Message to Congress, December 1, 1862) It is the eternal > struggle between two principles, right and wrong, throughout the world. It > is the same spirit that says 'you toil and work and earn bread, and I'll eat > it.' No matter in what shape it comes, whether from the mouth of a king who > seeks to bestride the people of his own nation, and live by the fruit of > their labor, or from one race of men as an apology for enslaving another > race, it is the same tyrannical principle. (Lincoln‚ÄìDouglas debates, October > 15, 1858) As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This > expresses my idea of democracy. Whatever differs from this, to the extent of > the difference, is no democracy.

Aaron Copland had come to Caracas to conduct the first Venezuelan performance of Lincoln Portrait on March 27, 1957. A New York Times reviewer said it had a \\"magical impact\\" on the audience. As Copland recalled, \\"To everyone's surprise, the reigning dictator, who had rarely dared to be seen in public, arrived at the last possible moment.\\" On that evening Juana Sujo was the fiery narrator who performed the spoken-word parts of the piece. When she spoke the final words, \\"... that government of the people, by the people, for the people (el gobierno del pueblo, por el pueblo y para el pueblo) shall not perish from the earth,\\" the audience rose and began cheering and shouting so loudly that Copland could not hear the remainder of the music. Copland continued, \\"It was not long after that the dictator was deposed and fled from the country. I was later told by an American foreign service officer that the Lincoln Portrait was credited with having inspired the first public demonstration against him. That, in effect, it had started a revolution.\\" Popular culture The composition was lampooned by Peter Schickele (\\"P. D. Q. Bach\\") in his piece Bach Portrait on the album 1712 Overture and Other Musical Assaults. Another parody, \\"A Quayle Portrait\\" by Jeff Ehrhart, features quotes from former U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle.

It is a staple of comic opera, especially Gilbert and Sullivan, but it has also been used in musicals and elsewhere.\\"Patter song\\", OnMusic Dictionary, Connect For Education, Inc, accessed 2 May 2014 The lyric of a patter song generally features tongue-twisting rhyming text, with alliterative words and other consonant or vowel sounds that are intended to be entertaining to listen to at rapid speed. The musical accompaniment is lightly orchestrated and fairly simple, to emphasise the text.Fiss, Chapter 7 The song is often intended as a showpiece for a comic character, usually a bass or baritone. The singer should be capable of excellent enunciation, to sing the song to maximum effect. History=Etymology The word \\"patter\\" derives from the Pater Noster, or Lord's Prayer, \\"which Catholics recited in its original Latin. ... The habit of rushing through the words as quickly as possible gave rise in England to the term 'patter'\\".\\"Albert Bergeret's NYGASP keeps Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas pattering on\\", The Washington Post, 25 October 2013 Origins Rossini's \\"Largo al factotum\\" A form of rapid patter occurred in the parabasis in ancient Greek comedies.MacDowell, p. 27 The 16th-century French composer F. de Lys published a song \\"Secouhez moy\\" set in what the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians calls \\"a syllabic, patter- song manner\\". Dobbins, Frank. \\"Lys, F. de\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 2 May 2014 Rapid patter numbers are heard in Italian opera of the baroque era, specifically opera buffa. Alessandro Scarlatti's 1702 opera Tiberio imperatore d'Oriente contains an early instance in the duet \\"Non ti voglio\\".\\"Patter song\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 2 May 2014 . In the view of Grove, syllabic patter songs were among the components of the new comic idiom, developed in the early decades of the 18th century by composers including Pergolesi, Leo, Sarro, Hasse and Orlandini, and they became a basic part of the pre‚Äêclassical operatic style.Lazarevich, Gordana and Helmut Hucke. \\"Serva padrona, La\\", The Grove Book of Operas, Oxford University Press, 2006, accessed 2 May 2014 Patter was used sparingly until the second half of the 18th century, but then became an increasingly familiar feature of comic operas. An example is Bartolo's \\"La vendetta\\" in Act1 of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro, which contains the tongue-twisting \\"Se tutto il codice\\" section near the end. Patter numbers are found in the comic operas of Mozart's contemporaries, Haydn, Logroscino, Piccinni and Paisiello. In 19th century operas patter is prominent in the works of Rossini and Donizetti. In their works, the patter is reserved for the cabaletta section of a multi-part number. The best-known examples are:Balthazar, p. 281 * the \\"Tutti mi chiedono\\" section of Figaro's \\"Largo al factotum\\" in Act 1 of Rossini's The Barber of Seville (1816) and the \\"Signorina, un'altra volta\\" section in Bartolo's \\"A un dottor della mia sorte\\" in the same act; * the end (starting at \\"Mi risveglio a mezzogiorno\\") of Don Magnifico's \\"Sia qualunque delle figlie\\" in Act 2 of Rossini's La Cenerentola (1817) and the whole of the short sextet \\"Quello brontola e borbotta\\" in the same act; and * the last section of each of Pasquale's and Malatesta's verses in their duet \\"Cheti, cheti, immantinente\\" in Act 2 of Donizetti's Don Pasquale (1843), plus a reprise in which they sing their patter simultaneously. The musical scholar Gervase Hughes points to the patter number \\"Bin Akademiker\\" in Peter Cornelius's The Barber of Bagdad (1858) as a prototype of the later Gilbert and Sullivan model.Hughes, p. 79 Gilbert and Sullivan patter songs Major-General (a patter-singing character in The Pirates of Penzance by Gilbert and Sullivan) depicted in a drawing by W. S. GilbertCrowther, Andrew. The Life of W. S. Gilbert, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 15 April 2014. W. S. Gilbert wrote several opera parodies before he moved on to comic operas with Arthur Sullivan.Stedman, p. 62 Sullivan was also familiar with Italian opera and included a patter song in his first comic opera, Cox and Box (1867). George Bernard Shaw, in his capacity as a music critic, praised \\"the time-honored lilt which Sir Arthur Sullivan, following the example of Mozart and Rossini, chose for the lists of accomplishments of the Major-General in The Pirates or the Colonel in Patience.\\"Shaw, p. 492 Well-known examples of rapid-fire, tongue-tripping Gilbert and Sullivan patter songs are: * Major-General Stanley's song, \\"I am the very model of a modern Major-General\\" in Act 1 of The Pirates of Penzance (1879); * the Lord Chancellor's \\"Nightmare song\\", \\"When you're lying awake\\" in Act 2 of Iolanthe (1882); * the Sorcerer's song, \\"My Name is John Wellington Wells\\" in Act 1 of The Sorcerer (1877); * the trio \\"My eyes are fully open to my awful situation\\" in Act 2 of Ruddigore (1887), which contains the lines \\"This particularly rapid, unintelligible patter/ Isn't generally heard, and if it is, it doesn't matter\\"; and * the Colonel's song \\"If you want a receipt for that popular mystery\\" in Act 1 of Patience (1881). Some numbers in the Gilbert and Sullivan canon are classified as patter songs by aficionados, although they may not contain all of the attributes listed in the definition above. These are often songs telling how the character rose to an undeserved distinguished position, or they may contain a catalogue or list. A similar example is found in the middle section, starting ‚Äú√à questo l'odontalgico‚Äù, of Doctor Dulcamara's \\"Udite, Udite, o rustici\\" in Act 1 of Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore (1832), a work that Gilbert had burlesqued early in his career in Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack. This was not intended to be sung at great speed and is thus more of a precursor of, for example, \\"When I, good friends, was called to the bar\\" (Trial by Jury) or \\"As some day it may happen\\" (The Mikado), than are the examples of the \\"rapid-fire\\" patter above. Most of the Gilbert and Sullivan patter songs are solos for the principal comedian in the cast and were originally performed by George Grossmith. Anna Russell's \\"How to write your own Gilbert and Sullivan Opera\\" contains an affectionate parody of a Gilbert and Sullivan patter song.Shepherd, Marc. Review and analysis of Russell's G&S; parody , the Gilbert and Sullivan Discography. Later patter songs Apart from Gilbert and Sullivan tunes set to different words, such as Tom Lehrer's listing of the chemical elements to the tune of the Major General's Song, later patter songs can be found in early twentieth-century operettas, such as Edward German's Merrie England and in a number of musicals. Later examples include \\"Tschaikowsky (and Other Russians)\\" in Ira Gershwin and Kurt Weill's Lady in the Dark, \\"Getting Married Today\\" in Stephen Sondheim's Company and \\"Ya Got Trouble\\" in Meredith Willson's The Music Man.Fortner, Jason. \\"Pitter-Patter\\" , Broadway Cafe Society, November 2006, accessed 2 May 2014 See also *List of patter songs *Patter *Catalogue aria NotesReferences   External links *Peter Schickele on the history of the patter song *Definition from Classical Music at Humanities Web *\\"Patter Song\\" at TV Tropes Category:Gilbert and Sullivan Category:Song forms ","title":"Patter song"},{"id":"1892714","text":"Alveolar ducts are tiny ducts that connect the respiratory bronchioles to alveolar sacs, each of which contains a collection of alveoli (small mucus- lined pouches made of flattened epithelial cells).

The market holds two major shows each year, one in April and another in October, running one week in the Fall, and two weeks in the Spring. There are around 70,000-80,000 attendees from over 100 countries.Tony Mecia, \\"Debate on the table: Las Vegas or High Point?\\" The Charlotte Observer, October 15, 2006. The High Point Market Authority coordinates the exposition, whose showrooms have nearly completely filled what had been the historic downtown. A 2018 Duke University study showed that the market contributed $6.7 billion to the area's economy. History Photo of the International Home Furnishings Center in High Point, NC, USA The first formal Southern Furniture Market was held in High Point March 1‚Äì15, 1909. In 1921, the Southern Furniture Exposition Building opened for its first show June 20. Built in 19 months, the showroom cost approximately $1 million and held of exhibition space. Regular shows were held in January and July. With the exception of 1943, the market was put on hold from 1941 until the end of World War II. The $1 million 10-story Wrenn Wing was added to the Southern Furniture Exposition Building in 1950. The center's fourth expansion is connected to older parts of the building by glass walkways over Wrenn Street. During the 1950s, informal \\"in-between\\" markets began to emerge, hosting visitors in April and October. The main markets were still held in January and July. However, the size and scope of the mid-season marketing during April and October begin to surpass the January and July shows in the 1960s. In the 1970s, showrooms other than the Southern Furniture Exposition Building gained stature, both in size and importance. In 1980, organizers in Dallas made a bid to host the major national home furnishings market. In 1982, marking a complete transition, the January and July shows were discontinued, leaving the April and October shows. Also in 1982, Market Square opened in the renovated Tomlinson Chair complex. It is credited with starting the dramatic increase in showroom space that made High Point a major furniture exhibition center.Paul Muschick, \\"Market Square Opens Show Under New Owners,\\" Greensboro News & Record, October 16, 1998, p B2c. The Southern Furniture Market was renamed the International Home Furnishings Market in 1989. High Point's largest showroom, the Southern Furniture Exposition Building, changed its name to the International Home Furnishings Center, or IHFC. With nearly of furniture showroom space already available around the city, a decade-long showroom building boom began. In the 1990s, a construction boom added an additional of showrooms to High Point. Showroom expansion continued in 2000, with the addition of new temporary exhibit spaces: The Suites at Market Square and Showplace. A year later, the 12th floor of the IHFC opened, giving the building of space, more than 14 times its original size. In 2001, organizers announced the formation of the High Point Market Authority, the official organizer of the Market. The next year, the Authority approached the N.C. General Assembly for the first time in its history seeking state support for the trade show, the largest event in the state of North Carolina. In 2003, the Market Authority began a massive shuttle service that today Showplace exposition building in High Point, NC, USA supports over 300,000 riders per year. The N.C. Department of Transportation set aside $900,000 for each of the next two years so the Authority could offer free shuttles to and from 100 hotels and the Piedmont Triad International Airport, Charlotte Douglas International Airport, and Raleigh-Durham International Airport. In 2005, a new transportation terminal, the Mendenhall Transportation Center, opened in downtown High Point to anchor the Market. In 2011, IHFC Acquisition Co. bought the IHFC for $275 million. Bassett Furniture Industries was that company's largest stockholder.Richard M. Barron, \\"Investors to buy showroom,\\" Greensboro News & Record, March 2, 2011, p. A2. SEC reports from Bassett showed a connection with The Related Cos., an investor in World Market Center. The Related Cos. was rumored to be part of a deal which would bring most of High Point's showroom space under one owner, and there were fears that the industry would move more activity to Las Vegas. At a press conference May 3, 2011, World Market Center CEO Bob Maricich and other officials of a new company announced the consolidation of what had been competing showroom facilities. International Market Centers (IMC), owned by Bain Capital and Oaktree Capital, with headquarters in both High Point and Las Vegas, bought the IHFC, Market Square and Showplace, representing about two-thirds of the city's showroom space. In a deal completed September 26, 2017, Blackstone Real Estate Partners, Blackstone Tactical Opportunities and Fireside Investments purchased IMC, which at the time owned 14 buildings with 6.7 million square feet in High Point. Today, the Market's 70,000-80,000 attendees include exhibitors, buyers, designers, and media in the furniture industry. Among the High Point Market attendees transacting business are widely known figures from other arenas who participate in the home furnishings industry, including Martha Stewart, Kathy Ireland, Alexander Julian, Jonathan Adler, Oscar de la Renta, Candice Olsen, Paula Deen, Charles Spencer, and Donald Trump. On March 12, 2020, the spring event was moved from its intended April 25‚Äì29 date to early June as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; it was cancelled April 16.

Categories of beliefs  Foundationalism holds that all beliefs must be justified in order to be believed. Beliefs therefore fall into two categories: * Beliefs that are properly basic, in that they do not depend upon justification of other beliefs, but on something outside the realm of belief (a \\"non-doxastic justification\\") * Beliefs that derive from one or more basic beliefs, and therefore depend on the basic beliefs for their validity Description  Within this basic framework of foundationalism exist a number of views regarding which types of beliefs qualify as properly basic; that is, what sorts of beliefs can be justifiably held without the justification of other beliefs. In classical foundationalism, beliefs are held to be properly basic if they are either self-evident axioms, or evident to the senses (empiricism).Alvin Plantinga, Faith and Rationality, (London Notre Dame, 1983) pp. 39-44. Here Plantinga is basing his analysis on the ideas of Aristotle and Aquinas. However Anthony Kenny and others have argued that this is a self- refuting idea.Anthony Kenny, What is Faith? Oxford: OUP 1992 pp. 9-10. This particular chapter is based on a 1982 lecture, which may explain the shift in the meaning of the term \\"foundationalism\\" since then. * In modern foundationalism, beliefs are held to be properly basic if they were either self-evident axiom or incorrigible.Alvin Plantinga, Faith and Rationality, (London Notre Dame, 1983) pp. 58-59. Here Plantinga references John Locke and Ren√© Descartes. One such axiom is Ren√© Descartes's axiom, Cogito ergo sum (\\"I think, therefore I am\\"). Incorrigible (lit. uncorrectable) beliefs are those one can believe without possibly being proven wrong. Notably, the evidence of the senses is not seen as properly basic because, Descartes argued, all our sensory experience could be an illusion. * In what Keith Lehrer has called \\"fallible foundationalism\\",Keith Lehrer, Theory of Knowledge (Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press, 1990). See also also known as \\"moderate foundationalism\\", the division between inferential and non-inferential belief is retained, but the requirement of incorrigibility is dropped. This, it is claimed, allows the senses to resume their traditional role as the basis of non-inferential belief despite their fallibility.\\"It makes sense for people to believe what they perceive through their experience and therefore, individuals are justified in those beliefs. \\"Truth Awakens on Foundationalism * In reformed epistemology, beliefs are held to be properly basic if they are reasonable and consistent with a sensible world view. Anti-foundationalism rejects foundationalism and denies there is some fundamental belief or principle which is the basic ground or foundation of inquiry and knowledge.J. Childers/G.

He was guitarist with The Brogues, then most notably with Quicksilver Messenger Service, where the complex interplay between himself and fellow-guitarist John Cipollina did much to define the unique sound of that San Francisco based band. Early life and musical career Born in San Diego, Duncan grew up in Ceres, California, where (as Gary Grubb) he played guitar for the Ratz until they finished their performance itinerary as an opening act for the Byrds and the Rolling Stones at the War Memorial Auditorium in San Jose, California. It was in 1965 when, as Gary Cole, he joined the Brogues, in Merced, California, and met future Quicksilver Messenger Service drummer Greg Elmore. It was with the Brogues that he adopted the stage name Gary Duncan. He stayed with them until they broke up in 1965. Quicksilver Messenger Service In late 1965 Duncan received a call from John Cipollina offering an audition for himself and fellow Brogues member Greg Elmore to join Quicksilver Messenger Service. The group first performed in December 1965 at The Matrix. The complex guitar interplay between Duncan and John Cipollina had a big influence on the sound of psychedelic rock. In early 1969, after recording two albums, Duncan left Quicksilver and as he describes it, \\"I left for a year and rode motorcycles and lived in New York City and Los Angeles and just kind of went crazy for about a year.\\" By the beginning of 1970 Duncan rejoined Quicksilver Messenger Service along with singer/guitarist Dino Valenti which pushed the group toward a more folk rock sound. By 1971 the original group had splintered with Cipollina, David Freiberg and Nicky Hopkins all leaving while Duncan, Elmore and Valenti continued to perform as Quicksilver Messenger Service until the end of the 1970s. Later career In the mid-1980s Duncan revived the Quicksilver name and began touring with his own band even releasing an album, Peace by Piece. He released a few more albums into the 1990s with the Quicksilver name but was the only original member in the group (except David Freiberg who guested on some tracks). He began touring with a four-piece band up until 2001 when the World Trade Center was attacked. After that Duncan recalled there were no more shows to play and he tore down his home studio for financial reasons. He said: \\"I tore the Studio apart by myself... no help from any of my friends... in fact not even a word... they all came and got the stuff they had stored and left the stuff they didn‚Äôt want so I could haul it away and they just never spoke to me again...\\" Duncan walked away from the music industry for the next few years until 2004, when he began releasing music from his Quicksilver band in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2006 Duncan reunited with Freiberg and began touring again as the Quicksilver Messenger Service. They were still performing up to his death. Death On June 19, 2019, Duncan fell and suffered a seizure and multiple cardiac arrests. He fell into a coma, and died on June 29, 2019 in Woodland, California, never regaining consciousness.

Life Born at Uras in Kincardineshire, Scotland, on 7 February 1681, he was the second son of Alexander Keith and Marjory Keith (n√©e Arbuthnot). He was educated at Marischal College, Aberdeen between 1695 and 1699; graduating with an A.M. in about 1700. He was preceptor to George, Lord Keith (afterward the last Earl Marischal) from July 1703 to July 1710, and to his brother, James Keith. He was ordained a deacon on 16 August 1710, and from November 1710 to February 1713, he was Domestic Chaplain to Charles Hay, 13th Earl of Erroll and his mother Anne, the Dowager Countess. Three years later, he was ordained to the priesthood on 26 May 1713. On the same day, he was appointed curate at Barrenger's Close meeting-house in Edinburgh, and in 1733 he became Incumbent of the meeting-house; a post he kept until his death. In 1716, he and other clergy in Edinburgh were prosecuted by the Commission of the Justiciary for not praying for King George I. He was prohibited from the ministry and fined. In 1719, he married Isobel Cameron, daughter of the Reverend John Cameron, Incumbent of Kincardine-in-Menteith. They had two children: an unnamed daughter (died before 1757), and Catharine who married Stewart Carmichael, an Edinburgh merchant, in 1752. In March 1720, he was one of the clergy of Edinburgh who met to elect Arthur Ross's successor. In 1727, he was appointed coadjutor to the Bishop of Edinburgh, and consecrated to the Episcopate at Edinburgh on 18 June 1727. His consecrators were bishops Arthur Millar and Thomas Rattray. Four years later, he was appointed Bishop of Caithness, Orkney and The Isles in December 1731. Between 1733 and 1743, he was also Bishop of Fife. He was elected Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church on 20 August 1743. He was deeply versed in archeology, numismatics and Scottish antiquities. His published works include History of the Affairs of Church and State in Scotland and An Historical Catalogue of the Bishops of Scotland. He died in Leith on 20 January 1757, aged 75, and is buried in Canongate Churchyard on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. The grave lies slightly west of the church.

It was formed from scratch, with the majority of its original cadre coming from replacement units and conscripts, many of whom were Romanian Germans and French volunteers.Les SS Au Poing-De-Fer: La Division Gotz Von Berlichingen Au Combat En Normandie, Jean Mabire, / 9782213014203 / 2-213-01420-5 The division was granted the honour-title G√∂tz von Berlichingen. Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Otto Binge oversaw the formation of the division, with the newly promoted Brigadef√ºhrer Werner Ostendorff taking command in January 1944. The G√∂tz von Berlichingen was placed under the LXXX Army Corps, a part of Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt's Heeresgruppe D. As part of a plan to number all named SS divisions in early 1944, the division was re-titled the 17th SS-Panzer-Grenadier- Division \\"G√∂tz von Berlichingen\\". In February 1944, the division still lacked vehicles. During the same year, on the orders of LXXX Army Corps, the division began to round up French vehicles in an attempt to complete its mobilization. By March, most of the major combat formations were fully motorised, although two of the six infantry battalions were still on bicycles. On 1 June, the G√∂tz von Berlichingen found itself at Thouars in France, with no tanks (although the crews were fully equipped with 42 Sturmgesch√ºtz IV assault guns), only a few months' training, and below strength in officers and NCOs. Battles for Normandy After the Allied invasion of June 6, 1944, the G√∂tz von Berlichingen was ordered to Normandy to take part in the efforts to reduce the Allied beachhead. On June 10 the Division made contact with 182 paratroopers of the 3rd Battalion, 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment, part of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, and B Company, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, of the U.S. 101st Airborne Division, at the village of Graignes. This small group of paratroopers had been dropped mistakenly by the U.S. 9th Army Air Force Troop Carrier Command and had decided to try and hold their positions. The ensuing battle, and the criminal execution of wounded paratroopers and French civilians by the \\"G√∂tz von Berlichingen\\", has since been known as the Battle of Graignes. On June 11 the reconnaissance battalion engaged in combat near the town of Carentan with the paratroopers of the 101st Airborne Division. The Americans secured the town and were advancing south by the morning of June 13. SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment 37, supported by the assault guns of the division's Panzer battalion and Oberst (colonel) Friedrich August Freiherr von der Heydte's 6th Fallschirmj√§ger Regiment, attacked the advancing paratroopers. In what the Americans dubbed the Battle of Bloody Gulch, the Germans routed two paratroop companies before their attack was stopped by the arrival of Combat Command A of the U.S. 2nd Armored Division. For the rest of the month, the division was engaged in heavy fighting for the bocage country near Saint L√¥ and Coutances. During this period, the G√∂tz von Berlichingen suffered heavy losses and by the beginning of July, its strength was reduced to 8,500 men. The division was in the line of advance for Operation Cobra, and suffered heavy losses attempting to halt the Allied offensive. It was encircled by the U.S. 2nd Armored Division around Roncey where it lost most of its armored equipment.Zaloga p.3 It was then ordered to take part in the Mortain Offensive, codenamed Operation L√ºttich. After the failure of this offensive, the division was split into four Kampfgruppen, 'Braune', 'Gunter', 'Fick' and 'Wahl'. These small units managed to escape encirclement in the Falaise Pocket, but suffered heavy losses and remained in almost constant combat against the advancing Americans until the end of the month, when the division was transferred to Metz for a much-needed rest and refit. In July the reserve battalion of the division was involved in counterinsurgency action against Operation Bulbasket in the Vienne Department. Retreat to Germany USAAF on November 8, 1944 In early September, the division absorbed what was left of the SS Panzergrenadier Brigade 49 and SS Panzergrenadier Brigade 51, raising its infantry strength. However, replacements for missing tanks and assault guns arrived slowly. On September 8, the division was put back into the line and was tasked with destroying the newly formed bridgehead over the Moselle River held by the US 5th and 80th Infantry Divisions. After heavy fighting for the American bridgeheads at Dornot and Arnaville, the division fell back and began to prepare to defend Metz itself. Over the next two months, the division saw heavy fighting to the south and east of Metz, suffering very heavy casualties. On November 8, a USAAF air raid hit the divisional command post. With the G√∂tz von Berlichingen's combat units in tatters (the 38th SS Regiment had been reduced to a strength of about 800 men by November 15, 1944Cole, p. 432) and with no command structure, Hitler authorized the division to withdraw from Metz. The 38th SS Regiment was largely destroyed at Metz and reformed in November with troops from the SS training regiment \\"Kurmark\\".Stoves, p. 234 The remnants of the division pulled back to the Maginot Line, near Faulquemont to rest and refit. During this time, the G√∂tz von Berlichingen was transferred to SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer Max Simon's XIII SS Corps. US forces liberated Metz on November 22, 1944. Elements of the 38th SS Regiment defended Hilsprich against an advance of the American 35th Infantry Division on November 23. In the same defensive maneuver, the 38th Regiment succeeded in cutting up two American rifle companies that made an ill-advised attack against stronger German forces. Hilsprich fell to another, better supported, American attack the following day.Cole, pp. 477-478 During November 28/29, elements of the 17th SS Division successfully defended Far√©bersviller against an attack by the US 80th Infantry Division. By December 1, the SS division was deployed along a line extending from the Rosselle River to just south of Puttelange. The G√∂tz von Berlichingen was caught by surprise when US forces attacked again on December 4, capturing both Far√©bersviller and Puttelange.Cole, p. 527 Seriously weakened, the SS division fell back to Sarreguemines, which it defended for five days before the town's occupation by US forces on December 11, 1944. The 17th SS Division subsequently retreated across the German border and went into a defensive posture along the Blies River. Attacks by the US 35th Infantry Division against this line started December 12, resulting in heavy fighting for the control of Habkirchen, (southeast of Frauenberg) and the high ground overlooking the valley of the Blies. The US 134th Infantry lost half its strength in this clash with the 17th SS Division, but captured Habkirchen by December 15.Cole, p. 544 Under serious pressure because of infantry losses, the SS division was granted a reprieve when the Americans moved into a defensive posture on December 18. The Ardennes Offensive by Germany had begun to the north and US units from General George Patton's Third Army were ordered to either hold fast or move north to assist in the defense of the Ardennes.Cole, p. 547 Refit and Nordwind When the division pulled back to the Maginot Line in mid November, its strength had been reduced to around 4,000 men (of which about 1,700 were infantry) and 20 armored vehicles. Throughout the early days of December 1944, the G√∂tz von Berlichingen received resupply and reinforcement. Although the armored strength was only 17 assault guns by December 10, a further 17 were sent from Germany on December 28.Jentz, p. 201 The Panzergrenadier regiments were brought up to full strength with the addition of Volksdeutsche replacements. The quality of these replacements was far below that of the division's original elements. Despite this, at least on paper, the division was back up to strength by the end of 1944. As a part of Simon's XIII SS Corps, the division participated in Operation Nordwind, the ill-fated last German offensive in the West. The G√∂tz von Berlichingen, together with 36th Volksgrenadier Division, attacked the US 44th and 100th Infantry Divisions around the town of Rimling. For this attack, the division had been reinforced with a Panther tank company from the 21st Panzer-Division, the 352nd and 353rd flame-thrower tank companies (equipped with Flammpanzer 38(t)s), and the 653rd Heavy Panzerj√§ger Battalion (equipped with Jagdtigers). The German attacks did not gain much ground, possibly because of the extreme weather conditions during the offensive. After engaging in heavy combat with the U.S. 7th Army, with little success and having the divisional commander replaced five times, the majority of the divisional staff was relieved on January 3.Clarke and Smith, p. 510 Replacements, in the form of Army officers, were received the next day. On January 10, the divisional commander, Standartenf√ºhrer Hans Lingner, was captured by a patrol from the 114th Infantry Regiment, 44th Infantry Division, when his car overturned on the slippery roads. The driver was shot on the spot; Lingner, his aide-de-camp Untersturmf√ºhrer Jund, and another of his staff were brought to the US lines where they were interrogated. Oberst Gerhard Lindner, one of the Army officers recently transferred to the division, took command on January 15. The division remained engaged with the divisions of the US XV Corps until Operation Nordwind ended on January 30, 1945. Defense of Germany The G√∂tz von Berlichingen took part in the defense of the 'West Wall' until March 18, 1945, when the Americans broke through. At this time its armored vehicle strength comprised 62 assault guns (of which 47 were operational) as well as two Panzer IV tanks.Jentz, p. 248 On March 22, division commander SS-Oberf√ºhrer Fritz Klingenberg was killed in action. That day, the division abandoned all its vehicles and began to retreat, but only some 500 to 600 men escaped US encirclement in the Pfaelzer Forest and reached Wiesloch on the east bank of the Rhine. By April 1, the division's strength was rebuilt to roughly 7,000 men. It then took part in the Battle of Buchhof and Stein am Kocher and the Battle of Heilbronn.Timothy A. Malone (2014) The Battle of Buchhof and Stein am Kocher: The story of Second Battalion 253rd Infantry Regiment Subsequently, the division defended the Jagst and Tauber River valleys, as well as Bad Mergentheim. Although greatly reduced in numbers, it took part in the defense of Nuremberg, where the 38th SS Regiment was destroyed by April 20. The rest of the division continued fighting until the 24th, and then fell back to Donauw√∂rth on the Danube. The last organized engagement fought by the division was on April 29, 1945, at Moosburg, Germany. It was there that the division's commander attempted to use Stalag VII-A, the largest POW camp in Germany, as a sort of hostage to buy time to escape across the Isar River. Their effort was frustrated when the commander of the 14th Armored Division learned of the plan, and ordered his Combat Command A to take Moosburg, capture the bridge across the Isar River, and most importantly, secure and protect the Allied Prisoners of War. The American infantry and tank force advanced to Moosburg, and without delay attacked the defensive positions of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division in front of the town. It fell following a brief, but ferocious battle. That same day the 14th Armored Division took over 7,000 German POWs, mostly SS.\\"The 14th Armored Division and the Liberation of Stalag VIIA,\\" On Point: The Journal of Army History, Fall 2005. On May 5, five days after Hitler's suicide, and three days before Nazi Germany's surrender, elements of the division attacked the 13th-century castle Itter Castle in Tyrol, Austria. Castle Itter (administratively a part of the Dachau concentration camp complex) was a prison for high-ranking French VIPs, the so- called Ehrenh√§ftlinge (\\"honor prisoners\\"), including politicians Paul Reynaud and √âdouard Daladier, labor leader L√©on Jouhaux, and former commanders-in- chief Maxime Weygand and Maurice Gamelin. The SS force wanted to execute all such prisoners. The attack was defeated by the 23rd Tank Battalion of the US 12th Armored Division under the command of Captain John C. 'Jack' Lee, Jr., the former prisoners themselves, and anti-Nazi elements of the Wehrmacht under the command of Major Josef 'Sepp' Gangl, who died in the battle.Andrew Roberts, World War II‚Äôs Strangest Battle: When Americans and Germans Fought Together, The Daily Beast, 13 May 2013 The remaining members of the division surrendered to the US 101st Airborne Division at Rottach-Egern, south of Kufstein, on May 6, 1945.

The airmen were being held as prisoners of war and were executed in retaliation for the death of German soldiers who had been killed a few days earlier. The event occurred within the boundaries of Montmartin-en-Graignes in France on June 17, 1944. Erwin Schienkiewitz was tried at The General Military Court at Dachau. In addition to the aforementioned war crimes the accused was also a member of an organization declared illegal by the International Military Tribunal. Schienkiewitz was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.

Murrisk lies at the foot of Croagh Patrick and is the starting-point for pilgrims who visit the mountain. Every year, on the last Sunday of July, thousands of people converge on the village to make the pilgrimage. There is a small interpretative centre in the village, which focuses on Croagh Patrick. The name is also used for the entire district south to the fjord of Killary Harbour.

He is best known as a staunch spokesman for free market policies, and for neoliberalism or classical liberalism. Education and career Hannes was born in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland. Graduating from the Reykjav√≠k Grammar School in 1972, Hannes completed his BA in philosophy and history and his M. A. in history from the University of Iceland, before going on to study politics at the University of Oxford where he received his DPhil. in 1985 for a thesis on \\"Hayek's Conservative Liberalism\\". At Oxford, he was in 1984-5 the R. G. Collingwood Scholar at Pembroke College; and he founded, with some like-minded friends, the Oxford Hayek Society. From 1988, Hannes has taught at the University of Iceland, becoming professor of political theory in the Faculty of Social Science in 1995. In 1984, he became a member of the Mont Pelerin Society, serving on its board of directors in 1998‚Äì2004. He was also a member of the board of the Central Bank of Iceland 2001‚Äì2009. He has been a Visiting Scholar at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, UCLA, George Mason University in Virginia, Tokyo University of the Fisheries, LUISS in Rome and International Centre for Economic Research, in Turin. He has twice been a Fulbright Scholar in the U. S. A. and once a Sasakawa Scholar in Japan. In 2005, Hannes organised a regional meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society in Iceland, devoted to \\"Freedom and Property in the 21st century\\". Influence In 1984, from October 2 to 10, Hannes, with Kjartan Gunnarsson, operated an illegal radio station, to protest against the government monopoly of broadcasting. Police eventually closed the station down. Hannes and Kjartan were indicted and fined for breaking the law on broadcasting. But the operation of the station and its closure turned many in the leadership of the Independence Party towards supporting the abolition of the government monopoly. The Icelandic parliament abolished the monopoly in 1985, and the law came into effect in 1986. In early 1990, Hannes published a book on fisheries management, an important subject in Iceland whose main export is fish. It was entitled The Fish Stocks in the Icelandic Waters: The Property of the Nation or of the State? Hannes advocated a system of individual, transferable quotas, ITQs, in the Icelandic fisheries, where initially the quotas would be given free of charge to the owners of fishing vessels, in order to gain their support for what was tantamount to the enclosure of the Icelandic fishing grounds. The leadership of the Independence Party also supported the ITQ system. The Independence Party held the Ministry of Fisheries 1991‚Äì2009. Hannes H√≥lmsteinn Gissurarson and Dav√≠√∞ Oddsson at the 1996 general meeting of the Independence Party In 2002, Hannes published a book titled How Can Iceland Become the Richest Country in the World?suggesting that Iceland could become an international financial centre offering low corporate taxes and a stable political environment. He named, as precedents, Luxembourg and Ireland ‚Äì two other small European countries‚Äî and small islands, such as the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Caymans. The corporate incomes tax in Iceland has already been lowered in the 1990s from 50% to 18%, and the net wealth tax had been abolished. The free-market reforms under the reign of the Independence Party 1991‚Äì2004 were comprehensive, not only consisting in tax reductions, but also in privatization, liberalization and stabilization. Enjoying access to the European financial market because of Iceland's membership of the EEA and also enjoying the high credit ratings for Icelandic companies earned in the 1991‚Äì2004 period, the Icelandic banks could expand rapidly, especially in the period after 2004. In the 2008 international financial crisis, the Icelandic Central Bank, since 2005 under the governorship of Dav√≠√∞ Oddsson, was refused credit lines from the US and Europe, with the result that the banks collapsed. It was argued that the Icelandic bank collapse was also a collapse of the neo-liberal model imposed on Iceland by Hannes and Dav√≠√∞ Oddsson. Hannes, however, points out that the Icelandic banks were subject to the same legal and regulatory framework as other banks in the EEA, and that their rapid credit expansion mostly took place after 2004.

The Great Imperial Crown was first used in a coronation by Catherine the Great, and it was last worn at the coronation of Nicholas II. It was displayed prominently next to Nicholas II on a cushion at the State Opening of the Russian Duma inside the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg in 1906. It survived the 1917 revolution and is currently on display in Moscow at the Kremlin Armoury's State Diamond Fund. Background Tsar Michael Fyodorovich by Kremlin masters in 1627. The orb and sceptre are of Western European origin and may have been given to Tsar Boris Godunov in 1604. By 1613, when Michael Romanov, the first Tsar of the Romanov Dynasty, was crowned, the Russian regalia included a pectoral cross, a golden chain, a barmas (wide ceremonial collar), the Crown of Monomakh, sceptre, and orb. Over the centuries, various Tsars had fashioned their own private crowns, modeled for the most part after the Crown of Monomakh, but these were for personal use and not for the coronation. In 1719, Tsar Peter the Great founded the earliest version of what is now known as the Russian Federation's State Diamond Fund. Peter had visited other European nations, and introduced many innovations to Russia, one of which was the creation of a permanent fund (—Ñ–æ–Ω–¥) to house a collection of jewels that belonged not to the Romanov family, but to the Russian State. Peter placed all of the regalia in this fund and declared that the state holdings were inviolate and could not be altered, sold, or given away ‚Äî and he also decreed that each subsequent Emperor or Empress should leave a certain number of pieces acquired during their reign to the State, for the permanent glory of the Russian Empire. From this collection came a new set of regalia, including eventually the Great Imperial Crown, to replace the Crown of Monomakh and other crowns used by earlier Russian Tsars and Grand Princes of Muscovy, as a symbol of the adoption of the new title of Emperor (1721). Manufacture 1896 image of the crown (at bottom) The court jeweller Ekart and J√©r√©mie Pauzi√© made the Great Imperial Crown for the coronation of Catherine the Great in 1762. The beautiful crown reflects Pauzi√©'s skilled workmanship. It is adorned with 4936 diamonds arranged in splendid patterns across the entire surface of the crown. Bordering the edges of the \\"mitre\\" are a number of fine, large white pearls. The crown is also decorated with one of the seven historic stones of the Russian Diamond Collection: a large precious red spinel weighing 398.72 carats (79.744 g), which was brought to Russia by Nicholas Spafary, the Russian envoy to China from 1675 to 1678. It is believed to be the second largest spinel in the world. In formally adopting the Western term \\"Emperor\\" for the ruler of Russia, Peter the Great also adopted Western imperial symbols, including the form of the private crowns (Hauskrone) used by the Holy Roman Emperors (of which the only surviving example is the Austrian imperial crown of Rudolf II, the Imperial Crown of Austria), in which a circlet with eight fleur-de-lis surrounds a mitre with a high arch extending from the front to the back fleur-de-lis. Already in Austria some baroque representations of this type of crown found on statues of the saints had already transformed the two halves of the mitre into two half-spheres, and this is the type of imperial crown used in Russia. Peter‚Äôs widow and successor, Catherine I, was the first Russian ruler to wear this form of imperial crown. In the Great Imperial Crown which the court jewellers Pauzi√© and J. F. Loubierin made for Catherine II in 1762, these hemispheres are in open metalwork resembling basketwork with the edges of both the hemispheres bordered with a row of 37 very fine, large, white pearls. They rest on a circlet of nineteen diamonds, all averaging over in weight, the largest being the large Indian pear-shaped stone of 12‚Öù cts in front, set between two bands of diamonds above and below. Posier showed his creative genius by replacing the eight fleur-de-lis with four pairs of crossed palm branches, while the arch between them is made up of oaks leaves and acorns in small diamonds surrounding a number of large diamonds of various shapes and tints Including at the bottom of the arch in the front, a perfect diamond with a slight tint that had belonged to the Empress Elizabeth; above it another large brilliant of ; a four-sided brilliant of ; a pink pendant of and a bevelled four-sided oblong stone of , while from the back bottom is found a triangular Indian-cut brilliant of pinkish-blown tine of 17 3/16 cts; an oval boat-shaped bluish- white stone of 17‚Öõ cts; a long pendant with a light golden tint of 12¬º cts; a perfect, white rhomboid of 16¬Ω cts and a four-sided thick stone of pink water of 12¬º cts. running from the front pair of crossed palms to the back pair of crossed palms, while the basketwork pattern of the two hemispheres are divided by two strips of similar oak leaves and acorns from the two side pairs of palm branches stretching up to the rows of large pearls on their borders. At the center and apex of the central arch is a diamond rosette of twelve petals from which rises a large red spinel, weighing 398.72 carats (79.744 grams), one of the seven historic stones of the Russian Diamond Collection, which was brought to Russia by Nicholas Spafary, the Russian envoy to China from 1675 to 1678. It is believed to be the second largest spinel in the world.The largest and the fourth largest spinels weigh respectively 500 cts. and 270 cts. and are among the Iranian Crown Jewels; the third largest spinel is the Timur Ruby of 283 cts. in the Royal Collection of the British monarchy. This spinel, in turn, is surmounted by a cross of five diamonds, representing the Christian faith of the Sovereign, the God-given power of the monarchy and the supremacy of the divine order over earthly power. Except for the two rows of large white pearls the entire surface of the crown is covered with 4936 diamonds and is quite heavy, weighing approximately nine pounds (by contrast, the Crown of Monomakh weighs only two pounds).R. Monk Zachariah Liebmann, \\"Martyrology of the Communist Yoke: The Life of Tsar-Martyr Nicholas II\\", The Orthodox Word, 153 (1990), 193‚Äì4. It was unfinished in time for Catherine's coronation and the original colored stones (e.g., emeralds in the palm branches and laurel leaves) were replaced with diamonds for the coronation of Paul I in 1797. It was used at every subsequent coronation until that of Nicholas II in 1896 and was last in imperial period at the State Opening of the Duma in 1906. There was also a Lesser Imperial Crown, very similar in style and workmanship to the Great Imperial Crown, only smaller and entirely set with diamonds, made for Empress Maria Feodorovna, the consort of Paul I, that was used for the coronation of the Tsarina. At the coronation of Nicholas II in 1896, the smaller crown was worn by Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, as was her right as a crowned Empress. A second identical lesser Imperial Crown was made for the young Empress Alexandra Feodorovna to wear. Dowager Empresses outranked reigning Empress Consorts at the Russian Court. In 1900, the workshop of Peter Carl Faberg√© in St. Petersburg made a replica in miniature of the Imperial Regalia (the Great Imperial Crown, the Lesser Imperial Crown, the Imperial Orb and Sceptre) out of silver, gold, diamonds, sapphires, and rubies, the whole set on a marble pedestal. The work is now in the collection of the Hermitage Museum. Coronation Catherine the Great with the crown to her right, by Alexei Antropov, c. 1765 Following the tradition of the Byzantine Emperors, the Tsar of Russia placed the crown upon his own head. This left no doubt that, in the Russian system, the imperial power came directly from God. The prayer of the Metropolitan, similar to that of the Patriarch of Constantinople for the Byzantine Emperor, confirmed the imperial supremacy. A few days prior to the crowning service itself, the Tsar made a processional entry into Moscow, where coronations were always held (even when the capital was in St. Petersburg). Following this, the Imperial regalia were brought from the Kremlin armory into the Tsar's Kremlin palace, where they would accompany the new emperor on his procession to the Dormition Cathedral on the morning of his coronation. This procession commenced at the Red Porch and ended at the church doors, where the presiding prelate and other bishops blessed the Tsar and his consort with holy water and offered them the Holy Cross to kiss. After the Tsar entered the cathedral, he and his spouse venerated the icons there and took their places on two thrones set up in the center of the cathedral. After the sovereign had recited the Nicene Creed as his profession of faith, and after an invocation of the Holy Ghost and a litany, the emperor assumed the purple chlamys, and the crown was then presented to him. He took it and placed it on his head himself, while the Metropolitan recited: The Metropolitan would then make the following short address: Following this, the new Tsar crowned his consort, first briefly with his own crown (by touching it momentarily to her head before putting it back on his own), then with a smaller crown of her own. Further prayers and litanies were read, then the Emperor was anointed just prior to reception of Holy Communion during the Divine Liturgy. He was invited to enter the altar area through the Royal Doors (normally reserved solely to the clergy) and partake of Communion as a priest would. Further prayers and blessings concluded the service, which was followed by a special feast held in the Kremlin's Palace of Facets. Russia's last coronation was in 1896, for Tsar Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra. The last occasion on which the Great Imperial Crown was officially used was the State Opening of the Duma in 1906.The Imperial Crown of Russia (1763) , accessed 2007-06-18. First World War, revolution and the Soviet period Postcard with the crown, c. 1924 In 1913, Agathon Faberg√©, son of Peter Carl Faberg√© of the House of Faberg√©, the crown jewellers, recommended that the Imperial regalia be re-catalogued and overhauled. The tsar gave his approval and by July 1914, work on the Imperial orb and sceptre had been completed, and work was about to commence on the crowns. Rising tensions and the outbreak of the First World War put a stop to further work, and the regalia items were loaded into nine strong-boxes and sent from Saint Petersburg to Moscow for safekeeping. They were stored in the Kremlin Armoury. The crown remained there with the rest of the regalia during and after the February and October Revolutions in 1917. In 1922, they were re- catalogued and transferred to the State Treasury. The crown and other pieces of jewellery and regalia were collected into the State Depository of Treasures, later the Diamond Fund, and discussions were carried out with French and British experts as to the possibility of selling off some of the crown jewels to raise foreign currency. The experts advised against selling such pieces as the crown, orb and sceptre, arguing that they were unlikely to attract their historic worth. Nevertheless, the crown jewels were exhibited in 1922 for two journalists of the New York Times, who later wrote: > 'Here', says Begasheff [head of the jewellery commission], opening the box > with hands that tremble ever so little despite his air of unconcern, 'is the > crown of the Emperor, 32,800 carats of diamonds.' 'Is it heavy?' 'No', said > one of the workmen, '5 pounds at most - try it,' and placed it straight away > on my head.

The Great Imperial Crown was placed above the Imperial Cypher (monogram) ‚Äî but only after the coronation. Between ascending the throne and the coronation, the Imperial Cypher would bear the princely crown, but not the Imperial Crown.See for example, http://www.romanovrussia.com/MFcobaltEgg.html . The crown was also placed on the arms of Congress Poland, a puppet state ruled by the Russian Empire (1814‚Äì1915), and the Privislinsky Krai which was incorporated into the empire in 1831. Since December 20, 2000, the Imperial Crown has appeared on the coat of arms of the Russian Federation. Some cities and oblasts of Russia have their coat of arms depicting the Imperial Crown.

It currently holds 2,431 guests. *Banquet Hall is a ballroom that holds nearly 500 guests. History In July 1968, the Asheville City Council approved a civic center plan which would add an exhibition center, meeting space and an arena to Thomas Wolfe Auditorium. As downtown was declining due to suburban development and malls, the complex would be a way to help downtown make a comeback. The arena was the first venue of its type in the city. It was home to the Asheville Altitude basketball team in the NBDL, before the franchise moved to Tulsa in 2005 and the United Hockey League's Asheville Smoke and also the SPHL's Asheville Aces. The venue also hosted WCW SuperBrawl III, WCW Monday Nitro where the famed nWo wreaked havoc over the Ric Flair-led Four Horsemen and Fall Brawl (1995) as well as the 1999 and 2000 Big South Conference men's basketball tournament and 1984-1995 Southern Conference men's basketball tournament. The age and the condition of the facility helped lead to the Southern Conference's departure. Commencement exercises for the University of North Carolina at Asheville were last held in the venue in 1999. With the Civic Center losing money, improvements took place starting in 2010. Proposed renovations The City of Asheville and State of North Carolina have been pressured by many in the community to replace or renovate the aging Civic Center with more modern facilities. This debate has been going on for years, with no apparent end. City Council passed a measure funding basic maintenance and has earmarked $1.5 million for the implementation of a \\"living roof\\" to replace the aging conventional roof. The ultimate path for the Civic Center was unclear. A complete renovation was still an option. The most popular proposals from the community were to tear down and rebuild in the same location, or to rebuild in an area south of city hall, at the Biltmore Square Mall site, or near the Western North Carolina Agriculture Center. Naming history On November 22, 2011, Asheville City Council voted to name the facility for U.S. Cellular, provided no other companies made a higher bid by December 31. The name change was effective January 1, 2012. U.S. Cellular will pay $810,000 or more over five years and up to $1.35 million over eight years. The money will help with $5.5 million in renovations. On May 29, 2019, Asheville City Council approved a bid from Harrah's Cherokee. The five-year $3.25 million deal takes effect in 2020. Events The arena played host to the politically motivated Vote for Change on October 6, 2004, featuring performances by Gob Roberts, Death Cab for Cutie and Pearl Jam.

The Southern Conference brought the 2012, 2013, and 2014 basketball tournaments to the arena. In anticipation of the tournament, the city pledged a $3.2 million renovation of the facility. In February 2018 the arena hosted a Fed Cup tennis tie between the United States and the Netherlands, featuring Serena Williams and Venus Williams. On August 13, 2014, a major motion picture named Masterminds was filmed outside and inside at the arena standing in as a Mexico airport with palm trees everywhere.

From 2002 to 2011, he was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, initially representing the Christian Democratic Party until March 2009, and from November 2009 to 2011 was the Family First Party's lone parliamentary representative in New South Wales. Early life and career Moyes was born in Melbourne, Victoria, on 17 November 1938. His book When Box Hill was a Village recalls events from his childhood and youth. He first gained prominence in Australia as host of the weekly television program Turn 'Round Australia and radio program Sunday Night Live with Gordon Moyes. Prior to becoming superintendent of the Sydney Wesley Mission in 1979, he was an ordained Churches of Christ in Australia minister, serving at Victorian churches in Ascot/Newmarket, Ararat and Cheltenham, while graduating from the University of Melbourne with a Bachelor of Arts in 1961. He became a minister of the Uniting Church minister following his transfer to the Wesley Mission. In December 2005 he resigned after 27 years from his position at Wesley Mission, handing over to Keith Garner. Parliamentary career Moyes was appointed by the Christian Democratic Party (CDP) to take Elaine Nile's place in the New South Wales Legislative Council in 2002 following her resignation. Moyes subsequently stood for the CDP at the 2003 state election and was elected in his own right. In 2004, Moyes started questioning CDP leader Fred Nile's leadership after Nile's return to state politics following his unsuccessful attempt to win a seat at the 2004 federal election. Despite his previous support for Nile, Moyes argued that Nile's anti-homosexual, anti-abortion and anti-Muslim focus should be altered and that greater emphasis be placed on environmental issues. Tensions between the two men escalated following the 2007 election, when Nile was re-elected to the Legislative Council. In 2007, the president of the Legislative Council, Meredith Anne Burgmann, retired from public service and the council sought a replacement. Tensions flared when both Moyes and Nile applied for the position. Nile subsequently withdrew his application and nominated Moyes at Moyes' behest. Peter Primrose was confirmed as president on 8 March 2007, Moyes having received only two votes, Nile's and his own. After Nile was made Assistant Deputy President on 28 June 2007 and then Assistant President 28 November 2007, Moyes began to publicly attack Nile. In December 2007, Moyes said that Nile was going against his own party executive to oppose Islamic schools, saying that it was policy \\"made on the run\\" by Nile and was \\"certainly not democratic in its methodology or Christian in its theological application\\". He called for Nile to be replaced as party leader. In September 2008, Moyes said that Nile was too old to be a viable leader, accusing him of being \\"a pathetic figure\\" who was a \\"loner\\" with \\"no peers or friends\\". He also requested that his parliamentary office be moved, saying that his staff had been subjected to bullying and harassment. In February 2009, Nile wrote in his monthly newsletter that he regretted allowing Moyes to take his wife's place upon her retirement \\"because of his disloyalty and divisive actions and his frequent support of the Greens\\". Moyes stated that the \\"Greens\\" were \\"far more Christian\\". In March 2009, the members of the Christian Democratic Party voted to expel Moyes. Moyes responded by stating that the Party was \\"hypocritical\\", \\"anti-democratic\\" and exhibited \\"extreme fundamentalism\\". Moyes chastised party members for their literal interpretation of the Judeo-Christian Bible and made a point telling the Sydney Star Observer that the CDP stance against homosexuality was un- Christian. Moyes continued in parliament as an independent before joining the Family First Party in November 2009. On 26 March 2011, Moyes failed in his attempt to be re-elected to the Legislative Council at the 2011 New South Wales election. Other details Awarded a number of honorary degrees, Moyes was awarded a Doctor of Divinity (honoris causa) from the California Graduate School of Theology in 1985, a Doctor of Laws (honoris causa) also from the California Graduate School of Theology in 1989 and a Doctor of Letters (honoris causa) from Milligan College, Tennessee, also in 1989. Moyes was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia on 26 January 2002 for service to the community in the delivery and expansion of social welfare and outreach services through the Wesley Mission, for fostering networks and partnership arrangements with other agencies to make services more widely available, and to religion. He has also received the honours of Member of the Order of Australia (1986), was appointed a Paul Harris Fellow in 1978 by Rotary International, and received the 1986 Australian Father of the Year award. In 1994, Rotary International recognised Moyes with the president's \\"distinguished service\\" award. Moyes lived in Tumbi Umbi on the New South Wales Central Coast.

B. (1956). Kyoto: the Old Capital of Japan, 794‚Äì1869, p. 418. was a Japanese Neo-Confucian philosopher and writer, serving as a tutor and an advisor to the first four sh≈çguns of the Tokugawa bakufu. He is also attributed with first listing the Three Views of Japan. Razan was the founder of the Hayashi clan of Confucian scholars. Razan was an influential scholar, teacher and administrator. Together with his sons and grandsons, he is credited with establishing the official neo-Confucian doctrine of the Tokugawa shogunate. Razan's emphasis on the values inherent in a static conservative perspective provided the intellectual underpinnings for the Edo bakufu. Razan also reinterpreted Shinto, and thus created a foundation for the eventual development of Confucianised Shinto in the 20th century. The intellectual foundation of Razan's life's work was based on early studies with Fujiwara Seika (1561‚Äì1619), the first Japanese scholar who is known for a close study of Confucius and the Confucian commentators. This kuge noble had become a Buddhist priest; but Seika's dissatisfaction with the philosophy and doctrines of Buddhism led him to a study of Confucianism. In due course, Seika drew other similarly motivated scholars to join him in studies which were greatly influenced by the work of Chinese Neo-Confucianist Zhu Xi, a Sung-dynasty savant.Ponsonby-Fane, R. (1956). Kyoto: the Old Capital of Japan, 794‚Äì1869, p. 418. Zhu Xi and Seika emphasized the role of the individual as a functionary of a society which naturally settles into a certain hierarchical form. He separated people into four distinct classes: samurai (ruling class), farmers, artisans and merchants. Academician Razan developed a practical blending of Shinto and Confucian beliefs and practices. In particular, he argued that Shinto was a provisional and local form of Confucian ideas, enabling a Confucian interpretation of Shinto shrine rituals. This coherent construct of inter-related ideas lent themselves to a well-accepted program of samurai and bureaucrat educational, training and testing protocols. In 1607, Hayashi was accepted as a political adviser to the second sh≈çgun, Tokugawa Hidetada. Razan became the rector of Edo's Confucian Academy, the Sh≈çhei-k≈ç (afterwards known at the Yushima Seid≈ç) which was built on land provided by the sh≈çgun. This institution stood at the apex of the country-wide educational and training system which was created and maintained by the Tokugawa shogunate. Razan had the honorific title Daigaku-no-kami, which became hereditary in his family. It also happened that the position as head of the Seid≈ç became hereditary in the Hayashi family. Daigaku-no-kami, in the context of the Tokugawa shogunate hierarchy, effectively translates as \\"Head of the State University.Ponsonby- Fane, p. 418. In the elevated context his father engendered, Hayashi Gah≈ç (formerly Harukatsu), worked on editing a chronicle of Japanese emperors compiled in conformance with his father's principles. Nihon ≈ådai Ichiran grew into a seven-volume text which was completed in 1650. Gah≈ç himself was accepted as a noteworthy scholar in that period; but the Hayashi and the Sh≈çhei-k≈ç links to the work's circulation are part of the explanation for this work's 18th and 19th century popularity. Contemporary readers must have found some degree of usefulness in this summary drawn from historical records. The narrative of Nihon ≈ådai Ichiran stops around 1600, most likely in deference to the sensibilities of the Tokugawa regime. Gah≈ç's text did not continue up through his present day; but rather, he terminated the chronicles just before the last pre-Tokugawa ruler. This book was published in the mid-17th century and it was reissued in 1803, \\"perhaps because it was a necessary reference work for officials\\".Screech, Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, 1779‚Äì1822. p. 65. Razan's successor as the Tokugawa's chief scholar was his third son, Gah≈ç. After Razan's death, Gah≈ç finished work his father had begun, including a number of other works designed to help readers learn from Japan's history. In 1670, the Hayashi family's scholarly reputation was burnished when Gah≈ç published the 310 volumes of The Comprehensive History of Japan (Êú¨ÊúùÈÄöÈëë, Honch≈ç-tsugan).Brownlee, John. (1999). Political Thought in Japanese Historical Writing, p. 120 Razan's writings were compiled, edited and posthumously published by Hayashi Gah≈ç and his younger brother, Hayashi Dokk≈çsai (formerly Morikatsu): * Hayashi Razan bunsh≈´ (The Collected Works of Hayashi Razan), reissued in 1918 * Razan sensei issh≈´ (Master Razan's Poems), reissued in 1921 Razan's grandson, Hayashi H≈çk≈ç (formerly Nobuatsu) would head the Yushima Seid≈ç and he would bear the inherited title Daigaku-no kami. H≈çk≈ç's progeny would continue the work begun in the 18th century by the scholarly Hayashi patriarch. Political influence As a political theorist, Hayashi lived to witness his philosophical and pragmatic reasoning become a foundation for the dominant ideology of the bakufu. The political dominance of Hayashi's ideas lasted until the end of the 18th century. This evolution developed in part from Razan's equating samurai with the cultured governing class. Razan helped to legitimize the role of the militaristic bakufu at the beginning of its existence. His philosophy moreover encouraged the samurai class to cultivate themselves, a trend which became increasingly widespread over the course of his lifetime and after his death. Razan's aphorism encapsulates this view: :::\\"No true learning without arms and no true arms without learning.\\"Blomberg, Catherina. (1999). The Heart of the Warrior, p. 158. Hayashi Razan and his family played a significant role is helping to crystallize the theoretical underpinnings of the Tokugawa regime. In January 1858, Hayashi Akira, the hereditary Daigaku-no-kami descendant of Hayashi Razan, headed the bakufu delegation that sought advice from the emperor in deciding how to deal with newly assertive foreign powers.Cullen, L. M. (2003). A History of Japan, 1582‚Äì1941: Internal and External Worlds, p. 178 n11. This was the first time the Emperor's counsel was actively sought since the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate. The most obvious consequence of this transitional overture was the increased numbers of messengers which were constantly streaming back and forth between Tokyo and Kyoto during the next decade. In the 19th century, this scholar-bureaucrat found himself at a crucial nexus of managing political change, moving arguably \\"by the book\\" through uncharted waters with Razan's well-settled theories as the only guide.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 324.

The process follows fertilisation, with the transfer being triggered by the activation of a cyclin-dependent kinase complex. The zygotes of many species undergo rapid cell cycles with no significant overall growth, producing a cluster of cells the same size as the original zygote. The different cells derived from cleavage are called blastomeres and form a compact mass called the morula. Cleavage ends with the formation of the blastula. Depending mostly on the amount of yolk in the egg, the cleavage can be holoblastic (total or entire cleavage) or meroblastic (partial cleavage). The pole of the egg with the highest concentration of yolk is referred to as the vegetal pole while the opposite is referred to as the animal pole. Cleavage differs from other forms of cell division in that it increases the number of cells and nuclear mass without increasing the cytoplasmic mass. This means that with each successive subdivision, there is roughly half the cytoplasm in each daughter cell than before that division, and thus the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic material increases.  Mechanism  The rapid cell cycles are facilitated by maintaining high levels of proteins that control cell cycle progression such as the cyclins and their associated cyclin- dependent kinases (cdk). The complex Cyclin B/CDK1 a.k.a. MPF (maturation promoting factor) promotes entry into mitosis. The processes of karyokinesis (mitosis) and cytokinesis work together to result in cleavage. The mitotic apparatus is made up of a central spindle and polar asters made up of polymers of tubulin protein called microtubules. The asters are nucleated by centrosomes and the centrosomes are organized by centrioles brought into the egg by the sperm as basal bodies. Cytokinesis is mediated by the contractile ring made up of polymers of actin protein called microfilaments. Karyokinesis and cytokinesis are independent but spatially and temporally coordinated processes. While mitosis can occur in the absence of cytokinesis, cytokinesis requires the mitotic apparatus. The end of cleavage coincides with the beginning of zygotic transcription. This point is referred to as the midblastula transition and appears to be controlled by the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio (about 1/6).  Types of cleavage = Determinate  Determinate cleavage (also called mosaic cleavage) is in most protostomes. It results in the developmental fate of the cells being set early in the embryo development. Each blastomere produced by early embryonic cleavage does not have the capacity to develop into a complete embryo.  Indeterminate  A cell can only be indeterminate (also called regulative) if it has a complete set of undisturbed animal/vegetal cytoarchitectural features. It is characteristic of deuterostomes ‚Äì when the original cell in a deuterostome embryo divides, the two resulting cells can be separated, and each one can individually develop into a whole organism.  Holoblastic  In Holoblastic cleavage, the zygote and blastomeres are completely divided during the cleavage, so number of blastomeres doubles with each cleavage.In the absence of a large concentration of yolk, four major cleavage types can be observed in isolecithal cells (cells with a small even distribution of yolk) or in mesolecithal cells or microlecithal cells (moderate amount of yolk in a gradient) ‚Äì bilateral holoblastic, radial holoblastic, rotational holoblastic, and spiral holoblastic, cleavage. These holoblastic cleavage planes pass all the way through isolecithal zygotes during the process of cytokinesis. Coeloblastula is the next stage of development for eggs that undergo these radial cleavaging. In holoblastic eggs, the first cleavage always occurs along the vegetal-animal axis of the egg, the second cleavage is perpendicular to the first. From here, the spatial arrangement of blastomeres can follow various patterns, due to different planes of cleavage, in various organisms. =Bilateral= : The first cleavage results in bisection of the zygote into left and right halves. The following cleavage planes are centered on this axis and result in the two halves being mirror images of one another. In bilateral holoblastic cleavage, the divisions of the blastomeres are complete and separate; compared with bilateral meroblastic cleavage, in which the blastomeres stay partially connected. =Radial= : Radial cleavage is characteristic of the deuterostomes, which include some vertebrates and echinoderms, in which the spindle axes are parallel or at right angles to the polar axis of the oocyte. =Rotational= : Rotational cleavage involves a normal first division along the meridional axis, giving rise to two daughter cells. The way in which this cleavage differs is that one of the daughter cells divides meridionally, whilst the other divides equatorially. : Mammals display rotational cleavage, and an isolecithal distribution of yolk (sparsely and evenly distributed). Because the cells have only a small amount of yolk, they require immediate implantation onto the uterine wall in order to receive nutrients. : The nematode C. elegans, a popular developmental model organism, undergoes holoblastic rotational cell cleavage. =Spiral= : Spiral cleavage is conserved between many members of the lophotrochozoan taxa, referred to as Spiralia. Most spiralians undergo equal spiral cleavage, although some undergo unequal cleavage (see below). This group includes annelids, molluscs, and sipuncula. Spiral cleavage can vary between species, but generally the first two cell divisions result in four macromeres, also called blastomeres, (A, B, C, D) each representing one quadrant of the embryo. These first two cleavages are not oriented in planes that occur at right angles parallel to the animal-vegetal axis of the zygote. At the 4-cell stage, the A and C macromeres meet at the animal pole, creating the animal cross- furrow, while the B and D macromeres meet at the vegetal pole, creating the vegetal cross-furrow. With each successive cleavage cycle, the macromeres give rise to quartets of smaller micromeres at the animal pole. The divisions that produce these quartets occur at an oblique angle, an angle that is not a multiple of 90¬∞, to the animal-vegetal axis. Each quartet of micromeres is rotated relative to their parent macromere, and the chirality of this rotation differs between odd and even numbered quartets, meaning that there is alternating symmetry between the odd and even quartets. In other words, the orientation of divisions that produces each quartet alternates between being clockwise and counterclockwise with respect to the animal pole. The alternating cleavage pattern that occurs as the quartets are generated produces quartets of micromeres that reside in the cleavage furrows of the four macromeres. When viewed from the animal pole, this arrangement of cells displays a spiral pattern. D quadrant specification through equal and unequal cleavage mechanisms. At the 4-cell stage of equal cleavage, the D macromere has not been specified yet. It will be specified after the formation of the third quartet of micromeres. Unequal cleavage occurs in two ways: asymmetric positioning of the mitotic spindle, or through the formation of a polar lobe (PL). : Specification of the D macromere and is an important aspect of spiralian development. Although the primary axis, animal-vegetal, is determined during oogenesis, the secondary axis, dorsal-ventral, is determined by the specification of the D quadrant. The D macromere facilitates cell divisions that differ from those produced by the other three macromeres. Cells of the D quadrant give rise to dorsal and posterior structures of the spiralian. Two known mechanisms exist to specify the D quadrant. These mechanisms include equal cleavage and unequal cleavage. : In equal cleavage, the first two cell divisions produce four macromeres that are indistinguishable from one another. Each macromere has the potential of becoming the D macromere. After the formation of the third quartet, one of the macromeres initiates maximum contact with the overlying micromeres in the animal pole of the embryo. This contact is required to distinguish one macromere as the official D quadrant blastomere. In equally cleaving spiral embryos, the D quadrant is not specified until after the formation of the third quartet, when contact with the micromeres dictates one cell to become the future D blastomere. Once specified, the D blastomere signals to surrounding micromeres to lay out their cell fates. : In unequal cleavage, the first two cell divisions are unequal producing four cells in which one cell is bigger than the other three. This larger cell is specified as the D macromere. Unlike equally cleaving spiralians, the D macromere is specified at the four- cell stage during unequal cleavage. Unequal cleavage can occur in two ways. One method involves asymmetric positioning of the cleavage spindle. This occurs when the aster at one pole attaches to the cell membrane, causing it to be much smaller than the aster at the other pole. This results in an unequal cytokinesis, in which both macromeres inherit part of the animal region of the egg, but only the bigger macromere inherits the vegetal region. The second mechanism of unequal cleavage involves the production of an enucleate, membrane bound, cytoplasmic protrusion, called a polar lobe. This polar lobe forms at the vegetal pole during cleavage, and then gets shunted to the D blastomere. The polar lobe contains vegetal cytoplasm, which becomes inherited by the future D macromere. Spiral cleavage in marine snail of the genus Trochus.  Meroblastic  In the presence of a large amount of yolk in the fertilized egg cell, the cell can undergo partial, or meroblastic, cleavage. Two major types of meroblastic cleavage are discoidal and superficial. * Discoidal : In discoidal cleavage, the cleavage furrows do not penetrate the yolk. The embryo forms a disc of cells, called a blastodisc, on top of the yolk. Discoidal cleavage is commonly found in monotremes, birds, reptiles, and fish that have telolecithal egg cells (egg cells with the yolk concentrated at one end). The layer of cells that have incompletely divided and are in contact with the yolk are called the \\"syncytial layer\\". * Superficial : In superficial cleavage, mitosis occurs but not cytokinesis, resulting in a polynuclear cell. With the yolk positioned in the center of the egg cell, the nuclei migrate to the periphery of the egg, and the plasma membrane grows inward, partitioning the nuclei into individual cells. Superficial cleavage occurs in arthropods that have centrolecithal egg cells (egg cells with the yolk located in the center of the cell). This type of cleavage can work to promote synchronicity in developmental timing, such as in Drosophila.Gilbert SF. Developmental Biology 11th edition. Sunderland (MA): Sinauer Associates; 2014.

Differences exist between the cleavage in placental mammals and the cleavage in other animals. Mammals have a slow rate of division that is between 12 and 24 hours. These cellular divisions are asynchronous. Zygotic transcription starts at the two-, four-, or eight-cell stage. Cleavage is holoblastic and rotational. At the eight-cell stage, having undergone three cleavages the embryo goes through some changes. At this stage the cells begin to tightly adhere in a process known as compaction. Recently, it has been proposed that in placental mammals the cells become more likely to contribute to one of the first two cell types to arise, the inner cell mass or trophectoderm, depending on their position within the compacted embryo. A single cell can be removed from a pre-compaction eight- cell embryo and used for genetic testing and the embryo will recover. Most of the blastomeres in this stage become polarized and develop tight junctions with the other blastomeres. This process leads to the development of two different populations of cells: Polar cells on the outside and apolar cells on the inside. The outer cells, called the trophoblast cells, pump sodium in from the outside, which automatically brings water in with it to the basal (inner) surface to form a blastocoel cavity in a process called cavitation. The trophoblast cells will eventually give rise to the embryonic contribution to the placenta called the chorion. The inner cells are pushed to one side of the cavity (because the embryo isn't getting any bigger) to form the inner cell mass (ICM) and will give rise to the embryo and some extraembryonic membranes. At this stage, the embryo is called a blastocyst.

Biography=Early years and education Lord Milford Haven was born in 1919. He was the only son of George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven (who had been born as Prince George of Battenberg) and Russian Countess Nadejda (Nada) Torby, who wed in 1916. His paternal grandparents were Prince Louis of Battenberg and Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine. Therefore, he was a great-great-grandson of Queen Victoria. His maternal grandparents were Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich of Russia and Countess Sophie von Merenberg. He is also a descendant of the Russian writer Aleksandr Pushkin as well as Peter the Great's African prot√©g√©, General Abram Petrovich Gannibal. He grew up at the family home in Holyport, Berkshire and enjoyed a close friendship with his first cousin Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, later the Duke of Edinburgh. They both attended Dartmouth Naval College. He served as best man to the prince at Prince Philip's marriage in November 1947 to the Princess Elizabeth, later Queen Elizabeth II. With the death of his father on 8 April 1938, he became the 3rd Marquess of Milford Haven and head of the House of Mountbatten. Navy and postwar social life During the Second World War Milford Haven served in the Royal Navy. In 1942 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for taking the destroyer Kandahar through a minefield in an attempt to rescue the cruiser Neptune. In 1943 he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his work on Malta convoy operations. He retired from the Navy in 1948. He subsequently joined The Castaways' Club, which enabled him to keep in close contact with many of his naval contemporaries. He then played a prominent part in the London demi-monde of the 1950s, which brought together a colourful mix of aristocrats and shadowy social climbers like osteopath Stephen Ward. This hard-partying set formed the nucleus for the Profumo affair.'Honeytrap' (1987) by Anthony Summers & Stephen Dorril. Chap.2. Marriages Milford Haven was married twice: * 1) Romaine Dahlgren Pierce (17 July 1923 ‚Äì 15 February 1975), daughter of Vinton Ulric Dahlgren Pierce of the United States and his wife, Margaret Knickerbocker Clark, on 4 February 1950 in Washington, D.C.; formerly married on 23 May 1946 to William Simpson, son of a millionaire Chicago department store owner (by whom she had a daughter). They were divorced in 1954 in Mexico. She married, thirdly, to James B. Orthwein. Romaine was the great-granddaughter of the Admiral John A. Dahlgren and the writer Madeleine Vinton Dahlgren. They had no issue. * 2) Janet Mercedes Bryce (born Bermuda, 29 September 1937), daughter of Major Francis (Frank) Bryce and Gladys Jean Mosley (whose aunt, Mary Mercedes Bryce, married Colonel Joseph Harold John Phillips, the grandparents of Alexandra Hamilton, Duchess of Abercorn and Natalia Grosvenor, Duchess of Westminster) on 17 November 1960 at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Frognal, London. They had two children: # George Mountbatten, 4th Marquess of Milford Haven (born 6 June 1961) # Lord Ivar Mountbatten (born 9 March 1963) Death Milford Haven died of a heart attack, aged 50, on 14 April 1970 in London.

Spermatogonia undergo spermatogenesis to form mature spermatozoa in the seminiferous tubules of the testis. There are three subtypes of spermatogonia in humans: *Type A (dark) cells, with dark nuclei. These cells are reserve spermatogonial stem cells which do not usually undergo active mitosis. *Type A (pale) cells, with pale nuclei. These are the spermatogonial stem cells that undergo active mitosis. These cells divide to produce Type B cells. *Type B cells, which undergo growth and become primary spermatocytes. Anticancer drugs Anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin and vincristine can adversely affect male fertility by damaging the DNA of proliferative spermatogonial stem cells. Experimental exposure of rat undifferentiated spermatogonia to doxorubicin and vincristine indicated that these cells are able to respond to DNA damage by increasing their expression of DNA repair genes, and that this response likely partially prevents DNA break accumulation. In addition to a DNA repair response, exposure of spermatogonia to doxorubicin can also induce programmed cell death (apoptosis).

Historically, this travel class has been called tourist class or third class on ocean liners.''' Marine Third Class cabin on board the . Travel classes originated from a distinction between \\"cabin class\\" and \\"steerage\\" on sailing vessels in the 18th century. Cabin class, for wealthier passengers included small cabins and a shared dining room while \\"steerage\\" provided open decks with bunks often near the tackle to operate the Steer rudder in converted cargo space on the \\"between decks\\" area where passengers from poorer backgrounds cooked their own meals. With the arrival of steamships, competition between ocean liner companies led some companies like the Inman Line to offer additional options to economy passengers seeking to immigrate including small shared cabins and regular meals which were termed \\"Third Class\\". Many large liners evolved three and sometimes four segregated cabin, dining and recreation spaces for First, Second, Third and Steerage Class passengers. After immigrant travel dropped beginning in the 1920s, steerage class was abandoned and Third Class cabins were often upgraded, redecorated and offered to budget travelers as \\"Tourist Class\\".John Maxtone Graham, The Only way to Cross, New York MacMillan (1972), p. 169. This became the main low budget class for ocean travelers, gradually replacing Third Class especially during the boom in immigration after World War Two. Economy class on the ferry KM Awu (Pelni) in Indonesia As ocean liners adjusted to the loss of passengers to air travel and switched to recreational cruising in the 1960s, most ships became \\"one class\\" to save on separate recreational and dining levels.William H. Miller, Famous Ocean Liners, Patrick Stephens Ltd. (1987), p. 121. However the evolution of the cruise ship led to a variety of premium services and exclusive dining areas. Many ferries operating on shorter routes have continued to offer cabin fares and large open accommodation for economy travelers similar to the cabin/steerage divisions or earlier eras. Railways Kintetsu 16000 series train (Japan) In North America, it is known as coach class by companies such as Amtrak. Most European railways call it second class, except in the United Kingdom and Ireland, where it is referred to as standard class (abbreviated \\"STD\\" on tickets) instead. It has been re-branded in some cases to broaden expectations. In Canada Via Rail refers to coach as economy class. In India, the lowest class of service was branded third class under the British colonial rule. It was re-branded as second class following independence to avoid its former segregationist connotations. Today Indian Railways offers Economy AC-3 also in the same class. In Indonesia, the cheapest class for train is an economy class train and it is the highest percentage of train users in Indonesia for intercity and long distance travel. The economy class coach in Indonesia originally did not have air conditioning, but as the services of PT Kereta Api is developing, PT Kereta Api has launched an economy class coach with air conditioning, branded as \\"Ekonomi AC\\" (English: Economy with AC). Similar branding are also used by long distance bus companies through the country. Generally economy class seats consists of a seat, sometimes with a fold-down tray, that may recline. The seat may also include a pocket attached to the back of the seat in front for storage of small items such as magazines. Depending on the configuration of the passenger compartment, luggage can be stowed in overhead racks or at each end of the coach cars. Standard class seating on British intercity trains often includes seating around permanent tables. Power sockets are available and some services offer (chargeable) Wi-Fi Internet access. In continental Europe, second class mostly consists of open interior coaches with 2+2 seating arrangement, with or without air-conditioning, in rows or face to face, or (in some express trains) compartments of six to eight seats. Some commuter trains have a higher seating density, with 3+2 seating arrangement. In Spain 2nd- class cabins are called Tourist class on the AVE superfast trains. They offer electric sockets and there are video and audio services on most major routes. North American intercity passenger trains are separated into different coach classes by the type of car (e.g., sleepers). Economy seating on North American passenger trains typically does not include meal service in the fare. Economy class also exists on some sleeper services, most notably on most Russian Railways routes, which designates the class as \\"Platzkart\\", with cars featuring an open 9-bay layout, where each bay has six bunk beds in two tiers ‚Äì four transversally, and two longitudinally on the opposing side of the aisle, with the lower bunks functioning as seats in daytime. Several European railways also provide similar \\"coach class\\" sleeper cars, commonly dubbed Couchette cars. There is a debate, though, whether Platzkart class is a full tier down from the traditional second class/\\"coupe\\", or is just a cheaper variant, as there used to exist an even cheaper \\"hard bed\\" class with three- tier bunks and no bedding, which is long since discontinued in Russia, but is still employed in China.

A pocket on the seat in front will typically contain an airsickness bag, an inflight magazine, a duty-free catalogue, and a safety and evacuation card. Depending on the airline, extras might include a blanket, an amenities bag (e.g. ear plugs, toothpaste, eye mask), and headphones. In-flight entertainment in economy class is either a \\"mainscreen\\" mounted to the aircraft bulkhead providing the same viewing for all cabin passengers or individual screens for each seat that may show video on demand. For passengers sitting immediately behind a bulkhead or on the same row as an emergency exit, the in-flight entertainment screen may be contained within one of the armrests of the seat. Some low-cost carriers can charge a fee for headphones. However, economy standards vary between carriers. Aeroflot, Qantas, and Cathay Pacific offer in-flight audio and visual entertainment and meals on both international and selected domestic routes to all passengers, including those in economy, while other airlines such as Transaero may charge an additional fee for the in-flight entertainment. Availability of food also varies. Some major carriers no longer serve meals in economy for short flights. Meals are now only generally provided on international flights. Some airport vendors have started to offer packaged meals to economy travellers that can be carried on to flights. Low-cost carriers, such as EasyJet and Ryanair, charge for food and drinks on flights. In addition, many carriers, particularly within the United States and Canada, also make economy passengers pay for airport check-in, checked bags, pillows, blankets, and headphones. Many airlines have created a slightly enhanced Economy class with, for example, a slightly larger pitch between seats such as Economy Plus from United Airlines. Arguably, such enhanced Economy classes only restore some of the comfort and amenities that were lost over the past few decades. Perhaps the first cheaper-than-standard airline flights were United's Boeing 247s between San Francisco and Los Angeles (Burbank) in 1940. Their nonstop DC-3s carried full-fare passengers ($18.95 one way) and Boeings flew a couple of two-stop flights each way for $13.90. That ended in 1942, and low fares did not reappear on scheduled airlines until 1948 when Pan Am started one DC-4 flight a day from New York La Guardia to San Juan with a $75 fare instead of the normal $133. In 1949, a tourist seat on a Pan Am DC-4 from New York to Rio cost $382 instead of $460 on the standard DC-4 making the same stops. In late 1948, Capital Airlines started one DC-4 flight each way a day between Chicago and New York La Guardia. Each flight left at 1 AM and stopped for ten minutes at Pittsburgh (Allegheny County). Chicago-NY fare was $29.60 plus 15% federal tax; seats on all other flights cost $44.10 plus tax. Coach flights slowly spread (all domestic flights were one-class, coach or standard, until TWA started two- class 1049Gs in 1955); in 1961, domestic coach passenger-miles for the year exceeded first-class for the first time. Breakfast in Economy Class of a Pakistan International Airlines Boeing 777. IATA allowed transatlantic tourist fares in summer 1952: New York to London cost $270 one way instead of $395. In the next few years, tourist fares spread around the world. Premium economy class Several airlines offer a Premium Economy class to passengers willing to pay slightly more for better seats and, in some cases, better service. Premium Economy class is positioned as a middleground between Standard Economy class and business class in terms of price, comfort, and amenities. These include Air Canada, Air New Zealand, Alitalia, American Airlines, Lufthansa, Thai Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, All Nippon Airways, British Airways, South African Airways, Virgin Australia, Virgin Atlantic, EVA Air, Qantas, Delta Airlines, JetBlue Airways, United Airlines (United offers economy plus, which is different. See below), Scandinavian Airlines, Philippine Airlines, PAL Express, Air Vistara, Singapore Airlines (from 9 August), Pakistan International Airlines (only on 777 and A310 family), Aeroflot (only on 777), China Southern Airlines and Kuwait Airways (only on Boeing 777-300ER). The definition for Premium Economy class is not standardized and varies widely from airline to airline, from a slightly larger seat pitch with no other amenities, such as Economy Plus on United Airlines, to a true separate Premium Economy class with larger and more comfortable seats, better dining options, and better service. Basic economy Basic economy, a.k.a. fifth class (if premium economy is counted as third class and standard economy is counted as fourth class) or last class, is the class below regular economy. Basic economy was first provided by Delta Air Lines for America's domestic market in 2012, closely followed by American Airlines (AA) and United Airlines for some domestic routes. Both Delta Airlines and AA also plan to provide basic economy for international routes, which could see other airlines follow suit, leading to its global adoption. The class has been criticised as \\"a clever way to raise the price of standard economy fares\\" and for its poorly designed pricing algorithms.

Most of Druuna's adventures revolve around a post-apocalyptic future, and the plot is often a vehicle for varied scenes of hardcore pornography and softcore sexual imagery. Druuna is frequently depicted as sparsely clothed or nude, and Serpieri's high quality renditions of her are often reproduced as poster prints. Druuna starred in nine volumes of the Morbus Gravis (Severe Disease) series between 1985 and 2018. These stories were featured prominently in M√©tal hurlant and Heavy Metal magazines. Druuna has also been featured in Serpieri's numerous and popular sketchbooks, which have sold more than a million copies in twelve languages. Serpieri himself appears in many of the stories as the character Doc. Morbus Gravis= Plot  During the thirteen years of publication of Druuna's adventures in Morbus Gravis, the plot has evolved through several stages, differentiated with numerous jumps in the storyline, with some attendant inconsistencies. In the first volumes in the series, the action unfolds in a place called The City, a futuristic but degraded urban environment. Humans live in a cramped, hostile, and decadent society, controlled by a religious oligarchy based on the knowledge of \\"Truth.\\" In this society, books are banned and power is exercised by a corrupt and despotic militarized bureaucracy. Although never clearly stated, this current era, known as the \\"Age of Man\\", is presumed to be the aftermath of a war. As told by the priests, an incurable, infectious disease called Evil has spread among the population that transforms people in a progressive and rapid fashion into amorphous, tentacled mutants. As a precautionary measure, all of the City's inhabitants are forcibly injected with a serum periodically distributed in overcrowded health facilities. Many believe that those found to be \\"healthy\\" will be sent to the City's upper levels, a place inaccessible to the majority but where those selected enjoy a better life free from want and hardship. Similarly, those infected with \\"Evil\\" are sent to the lower levels. Druuna and her lover Shastar exist in this environment. After a series of adventures, Druuna discovers that the City is actually a giant spaceship which left Earth after an unspecified cataclysm and has drifted through space for centuries. At some point, Lewis, the ship's captain, delegated control to the computer Delta, which is responsible for creating the current state of affairs. (The Priests are actually androids operated by Delta.) Delta transformed Lewis into an immortal being, using organic parts from the healthy people who had been admitted to the upper levels of the City. Now, Lewis, tired of immortality, wants to die, which would eliminate Delta and destroy the City. This conflict is partially responsible for the gradual degradation of life on the ship/planetoid. Druuna is recruited by Lewis to help him destroy Delta. Unaware of fact that it would mean destruction of the City and all its inhabitants, Druuna finds Delta and carries out Lewis's plan. At the end Lewis reveals his true plan to destroy the City, but also confesses he fell in love with her and changes his mind about destruction. In turn, Lewis puts Druuna in a state similar to hibernation for centuries, waiting for an opportunity to improve conditions on the City. The story then introduces a man named Will, who commands another ship, similar to the City, which has become, thanks to the evolution of Evil, a super-organism. It is revealed that apart from the City, humanity is not entirely extinguished, but that other groups of humans survived, using genetic engineering to improve their abilities. Embarking on Commander Will's spacecraft, Druuna discovers that the minds of Shastar and Lewis have been merged and transferred to the new ship's computer. The disease called Evil appears among the new ship's crew, so Will and Doc (author Serpieri's alter-ego) telepathically introduce Druuna into the mind of Lewis- Shastar, discovering the elements that make up the antidote serum.Mandragora (Bagheera, 1995). When Druuna gets trapped in the computer mind, Will enters it to rescue her. Discovering that they actually have no means to develop a cure for the disease, they decide to destroy the ship and crew (as well as the computer that houses the merged minds of Shastar and Lewis). Druuna, Will, and a few others escape in a rescue capsule, where they are all put into a state of suspended animation. After the capsule crashes on an unknown planet,La Plan√®te oubli√©e (The Forgotten Planet) (Bagheera, 2000). Druuna awakens alone. She is soon caught in a war between two alien species, one of which is composed of parasitic beings who need organic specimens as hosts, and the other of intelligent robots pursuing the objective of creating organic life. Apparently, the planet is Earth thousands of years after a war between men and machines resulted in the extinction of the former. The machines want to recreate their creators to try to understand humanity. Will briefly reappears and is kidnapped. Shastar also reappears, now working with the machines in their aim to recover the human species. Toward that aim, they decide to clone Druuna.Clone (Bagheera, 2003).  Style and content  The Morbus Gravis series is noteworthy for featuring explicit content in terms of both graphic violence and sex. Volume 3, Creatura, in fact, features near-totally explicit sexual penetration, and the three subsequent books feature totally uncensored penetration. The Heavy Metal reprints differ from the stand-alones by having censored hardcore portions via oversize speech/thought balloons. In vol. 5, Mandragora, several pages were simply excised. The series returned to a non- explicit depiction of penetration in such scenes with vol. 7, The Forgotten Planet.  Character  In most cases, Druuna's role is that of a willing sexual object, submitting to sexual advances of all kinds with little or no complaint, other than the occasional sad pout, though she has been raped on more than one occasion in the series. Serpieri claims that the character's approach to sexual pleasures is a challenge to Judeo-Christian mores on sexuality. In the album Druuna X, Serpieri states that he styled Druuna as influenced by Val√©rie Kaprisky's appearance in the film La Femme publique, but because of the influence of the copious Western comics he had drawn at that point, in the first few pages of Morbus Gravis Druuna appeared to exhibit Native American facial features, compared to the later appearance to which she evolved.Serpieri, Paolo Eleuteri, foreword.

Ordnung is the German word for order, discipline, rule, arrangement, organization, or system. Because the Amish have no central church government, each assembly is autonomous and is its own governing authority. Thus, every local church maintains an individual set of rules, adhering to its own Ordnung, which may vary from district to district as each community administers its own guidelines. These rules are largely unwritten, yet they define the very essence of Amish identity. Conservative Mennonites refer to Ordnung by the English terms \\"discipline\\" or \\"standard\\" and are usually written. Purpose Anabaptists, such as the Amish, believe in a literal interpretation of the Bible. Thus the Ordnung is intended to ensure that church members live according to the biblical Word of God. The Ordnung is a set of behavioral rules, and all members within a church agree to have their lives ordered by that code. Each person is expected to live simple lives devoted to God, to family, and to the community, based upon God's laws. Outsiders may consider the Ordnung as legalistic, thereby resulting in harsh consequences when broken. But to the Amish, the Ordnung provides a strong sense of group identity; all of its rules are supported by scripture, meaning that any outside persecution is considered as the natural result of Christian discipleship. The ‚Äúworld‚Äù, with its grasping to gather possessions, is seen as in direct conflict with the teachings of Jesus. The Ordnung creates boundaries for the Amish, much like a children's schoolyard fence. Remaining within the enclosure allows them freedom, but to cross the fence would mean worldly danger. In Garry Schmidt's book, Early Anabaptist Spirituality, he indicates that a person who has learned to live within a respectful Ordnung was appreciating the value of freedom of heart, peace of mind, and clear conscience. Such a person had more freedom, more liberty, and more privilege than those outside the church. Some of the most common Ordnung rules are: separation from the world, hard work, a woman's submission to her husband, mode of dress, and refusal to buy insurance. Outsiders often think of the Ordnung in terms of restrictions (e.g., no electrical power lines, no telephone in the home, no personal ownership of automobiles). However, many of the Ordnung guidelines are for the purpose of guarding a person's character. The Ordnung attempts to prevent pride, envy, vanity, laziness, dishonesty, etc. Therefore, the foundations of the Amish life are: an unassuming character, the love of friends and family, and respect for the community. The purpose of the Ordnung is to guide Amish behavior into being more Christ-like, thus defining who they are. It intends that they be separate and different from the world. The world often exhibits the human tendency of self- exaltation, and the Ordnung provides a way for the Amish to refrain from such behavior. Anything viewed as disruptive to their society, such as personal power, wealth, and status, are funneled through the Ordnung into the social order of love and brotherhood. Disobedience to these lifestyle regulations is punished by discipline initiated by the church leaders. One of the more severe actions that the Amish bishop can mete out is Shunning (Meidung). Types Two types of Ordnung must be distinguished. # The special conference decisions throughout history, from the 16th century onward. # The contemporary rules defined by each church district.Amish Society by John A. Hostetler pp. 82‚Äì83 Fourth Edition The first are printed rules, the second are generally verbal and are universally understood by the local members. All rules guide the Amish believer in the application and practice of godly principles. Both types clarify what is considered worldly and sinful. To be worldly is to be lost. Any rule that is not directly supported by biblical references will be justified through reasoning as to why violating it would cause the believer to turn worldly. Separation from the world means to be different from the world, and the congregation must agree on how they are to be different. This is accomplished through the Ordnung. Two times each year the members come together (Ordnungsgemee) and express their unity before they partake in communion. Their concurrence on the Ordnung implies complete satisfaction with it. The agreement brings peace among members, and peace with God. If there is not group unity, then the Lord‚Äôs Supper is not observed. Obedience is a close associate to Ordnung, because it is a symbol informing the body of believers as to whether a member loves the church or does not. There is no middle ground. Gelassenheit An important part of Amish life is Gelassenheit (), yieldedness, letting be, or submission to the will of God (in modern German approximately: composure, tranquility, serenity). This concept derives from the Bible when Jesus said, \\"not my will but thine be done,\\" thereby making individuality, selfishness, and pride, abhorrent; see humility. \\"He submits to Christ, loses his own will, and yields (Gelassenheit) himself in all areas.\\"Leonard Gross, Golden Apples in Silver Bowls, Lancaster Mennonite Historical Society, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, 1999, p. 69 Serving others and submitting to God, therefore, permeates all aspects of Amish life. A person‚Äôs personality must be modest, reserved, calm, and quiet. The values which must be apparent in a believer‚Äôs actions are submission, obedience, humility and simplicity. Gelassenheit should be the overriding aspect for every person within the Amish community, and it must be viewable through actions and possessions. Lamentations 3:26 \\"quietly wait,\\" \\"in the Froschauer [German] Bible reads 'in Gelassenheit' (instead of quietly) ‚Äì one probable Biblical reference that helped to establish this important 'Anabaptist term.'\\"Gross, p. 314 The Ordnung is used to produce Gelassenheit, which is to be shown via a yielding of spirit to the traditions. The Amish glance back into the past and examine their traditions, treasuring them. The past is always the main resource for coping with the present. An Amish businessman may look forward to plan for new markets for his products; however, he never loses sight of the past and its precious legacy. To give yourself under the church means to yield, to submit. Modern culture's aggressive individualism sharply contrasts with the Amish gelassenheit. Through Gelassenheit, an Amish person yields to the Ordnung, the will of God, church, elders, parents, community, and traditions. The individual suppresses the will of 'self' in lieu of the Amish community. Levels of piety There are several levels of piety in the Ordnung moral code.Kraybill, \\"Riddle\\", p. 116 # Acceptable behavior ‚Äì Certain practices that are so widely accepted they are never discussed. # Esteemed behavior ‚Äì The way that church leaders and their spouses are expected to behave, but not necessarily the regular church members. # Frowned upon behavior ‚Äì Things that are discouraged but which are not a test of membership to the church. # Forbidden behavior ‚Äì Prohibited by the Ordnung. They can, and do, affect membership to the church. There could be another category that is so clearly wrong, it is not included in the Ordnung. Murder would be a prime example. Technology Modern technology is used selectively by the Amish for fear that it may weaken the family structure. If any equipment does not maintain principles of Gelassenheit, it is banned. Anything which could promote sloth, luxury or vanity is strictly prohibited. Because 120-volt electricity connects to the outside world, it violates the Amish idea of separation from society. Owning an automobile could be a sign of status and it would promote vanity and competition between the church members; a direct violation of Gelassenheit's value of modesty. A telephone in the house would be a temptation to stay at home speaking to a friend rather than walking or taking a buggy ride to visit a neighbor (though a 'community' telephone is often maintained at a suitable distance from the home to permit contact during emergencies). Although Amish home and social life has remained mostly unaltered, a new technology can be adopted once it has passed a rigorous examination. The Ordnung is used to examine any new proposed use of technology. A proposal may be accepted for business reasons, but never for personal wishes, for entertainment, or for self-indulgences. A proposal will likely be rejected if it could have negative social implications. A telephone in the home is prohibited among the Old Order Amish because it interferes with face-to-face visits with neighbors. However, a few of the more liberal districts have allowed the telephone. Any technology that is seen to be corrupting spiritual or family life is rejected out of hand. Television would never be considered because it brings unbiblical values into the home. Amish dairy farms have discarded the metal milk bucket and three-legged stool in favor of an automated milking system. The Food and Drug Administration and the United States Department of Agriculture demand that certain guidelines be followed before milk can be marketed. Thus, power equipment and refrigerated bulk tanks are a necessity and permitted. However, the electricity needed to run a modern dairy must be produced, typically using gas or diesel generators. This may be more expensive than grid electricity, but lacks the degree of intrusion on Amish values and households that would result if fixed-line external power were used. In farming, horses are used to pull wagons, buggies, and agricultural equipment. Gasoline engines may be allowed to run the machinery but horses are required for locomotion. The Old Order Amish are permitted to use modern transportation as long as they do not own or operate the equipment. All of these guidelines are set out in the Ordnung, creating a balance between tradition and change. Change A district‚Äôs Ordnung is meant to convey the community's rigid traditions, so whenever members begin exploring new things which raise concerns, the local church must decide if such activities should be allowed. Twice a year each Amish district holds a council meeting led by the bishop. After listening to a discussion on the issue in question, the adult church members, men and women (all are expected to attend unless they are ill), vote. To ensure that the idea is carefully considered, voting is designed to make any change difficult, because once a rule has been adopted it is difficult to have it rescinded. If two or more people reject the change, the Ordnung remains unaltered.*Jameson M. Wetmore ‚Äì \\"Amish Technology: Reinforcing Values, Building Community,‚Äù IEEE‚Äôs Technology & Society 26(2), June 2007, pp. 10‚Äì21. The Amish allow for change, but their emphasis centers on tradition. When considering a modification of the Ordnung, the members must also consider the implication to the districts around them. If neighboring districts believe a particular change is too radical, the offended district could break off communications and refuse to recognize them as fellow Amish. This threat is of concern, not only for community reasons, but because of family ties. For example, an Amish woman might decide that voting for a change is not worth the risk that she may never again talk to her daughter who married a young man from another district. Because of the threat of being shunned, change to the Ordnung is usually incremental and done in concert with other districts. No Ordnung of any Anabaptist subgroup remained totally unchanged. Many Old Order Amish, Old Order Mennonites, Old Colony Mennonites and German Baptist groups have changed their Ordnung during the last 150 years so much, that they shifted away from the Old Order type of Community. For example, even the most traditional Old Order Amish groups like the Swartzentruber Amish and the Nebraska Amish allow their members to ride in cars under certain circumstances, primarily in cases of emergency. The Amish have few written explanations why certain things are regulated by the Ordnung. Non-Amish are not allowed to attend their council meetings, and most Amish are hesitant to discuss the details with outsiders, therefore the precise reasons are difficult to explain. They formulate their rules with two interconnected goals in mind. First, is it compatible with their values? If a particular decision might disrupt their religion, tradition, community, or families, they are likely to prohibit it. The second purpose is to create a fence between themselves and Englishers. Most Americans see the Amish as different because they drive buggies, use horse drawn farm implements, dress plainly, etc. These differences are not accidental. When asked today why they have rejected a specific thing, many members of the church will simply reply: ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs not Amish.‚Äù Examples of Ordnung rules Because each Amish district is a separate church, Ordnung rules will differ from locale to locale. There are diverse groups among the Amish, thereby creating distinctions within their Ordnung. The following is a general list and not exhaustive.Readings from Mennonite Writings: New and Old  J. Craig Haas (Intercourse, PA: Good, 1992), 52. *Motorized vehicles are not to be owned or driven. The Amish may request a neighbor to drive them, or may hire a driver and rent a car. *The Amish may not travel on an airplane. *Clothing codes are to be followed: **Males are to wear hats when outside. Black is for the winter, straw color is for the warmer months. **Suspenders, not belts, keep up the trousers. **Once boys marry, they are expected to grow a beard but shave their upper lip. Unmarried boys must be clean-shaven. **Mustaches are frowned upon, because in German culture they have historically been associated with military officers. **Clothing must be home sewn. **Women are never to shave any part of their body nor to cut their hair. **Females must keep their head covered, usually with a prayer bonnet. The color denotes marital status (different colors may be used by different settlements). *Social Security or other commercial insurance is forbidden. *Children are to attend school through the eighth grade. After that, they are expected to work on the farm or in the home. A parent may find them a job to bring in additional income for the family. *Full-length mirrors are forbidden, because they are thought to promote vanity and self-admiration. *Jewelry is not to be worn, not even wedding rings. Other symbols (beards for men, and black bonnets for women) are used, in lieu of rings, to represent marital status. *An Amish person who has taken the church vow, and who has been found guilty by the bishop of breaking one of the Ordnung rules, can be punished by the Meidung (excommunication or shunning). *Mobile vehicles, such as buggies or farm implements, must not have rubber tires. *(Among the Old Order) Church members must not be photographed. *(Among the Old Order) Telephones are forbidden. *The use of batteries is allowed (in some districts) for emergency flashlights and similar devices, but discouraged in the home. *Word processors (powered by generator or DC) are allowed for school and church administrative use. Only non-electric typewriters are used in the home. *Electricity is not allowed in the home. Electrical energy is allowed in community dairy barns, but only generator power (not grid power). *Those who are able to work must do so from Monday through Saturday. On Sunday, however, no laborious work is to be done. *Amish young women and young men are expected to marry other Amish. *Electricity from utility companies is considered worldly. Bottled gas may be used to heat water, fuel ranges, and run refrigerators. Gas-pressured or kerosene lanterns provide lighting. Batteries power the red lights on buggies. Gasoline generators may provide energy for washing machines, water pumps, and agricultural equipment. *Telephones may be placed in booths, an unlocked barn, or an Amish school. Cellular phones and voice mail, may only be used by a business to compete, but this is permitted on a case by case basis. *The Amish travel in horse-drawn buggies, and use horses to pull farm machinery. The horse allows them to take life at a slower pace, and it puts limits on their lives, slowing their work, and requiring additional labor. If business or personal needs necessitate a longer drive, the Amish may hire a taxi. *The Amish complete their eighth grade education in a one-room private school, taught by an Amish teacher who also attended school through the eighth grade. The skills of spelling, English, Pennsylvania German, mathematics, geography, and health are taught. Some basic science may be taught about animals, stars, and planets. Religion is not taught as a subject, but is an important part of the school program, especially as it relates to behavior. \\"Amish practices evolve over time. As modernization takes place, the Amish negotiate to what degree they will accept and utilize technology and other practices of the outside world. This cultural compromise has allowed the Amish to remain a distinct group, yet survive economically.\\" See also * Amish terminology * Book of Discipline * Code of conduct * Convention (norm) * Lifeway * Religious law * Sacred tradition * Social norm * Traditionalist conservatism NotesReferences *Donald B.

The route travels from State Route 18 near Crestline to State Route 173 in Lake Arrowhead, serving Twin Peaks and Blue Jay along its way. Route description SR 189 begins at Lake Gregory Drive approximately twenty feet north of State Route 18, between the community of Arrowhead Highlands to the west and the community of Rimforest to the east. It wends its way northeastward to the community of Twin Peaks. It continues roughly eastward through Twin Peaks to the community of Agua Fria (Spanish, cold water), where it forms a tee with the northern terminus of Daley Canyon Road. It turns northeast and continues from there through the downtown section of the community of Blue Jay. It ends at State Route 173 in the Village area of the community of Lake Arrowhead. SR 189 is not part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. History In 1933, a road from Strawberry Peak to the road between Cajon Pass and Lake Arrowhead was added to the state highway system. It was given the number of Route 189 in 1935. The route was unchanged by the 1964 state highway renumbering.

Games = Hard Truck: 18 Wheels of Steel [31 Aug 2002]  The first installment in the series, released in 2002.  18 Wheels of Steel: Across America [23 Sep 2003]  This installment is very similar to Hard Truck: 18 Wheels of Steel except that the graphics were updated, more trucks and cargo were added, and a new map was created that enables users to travel across the entire continental U.S., through 30 cities. In this version, players can choose from 30 trucks and 40+ trailers. Time is made up of a total of 24 minutes in a day in the clock. This game focuses on the delivery of cargo. Players will also battle 3 AI drivers. Unlike in Hard Truck: 18 Wheels of Steel, the sleep timer was removed from the simulation. There is an improved traffic model as well as airplanes, helicopters, and trains with authentic sounds.  18 Wheels of Steel: Pedal to the Metal [30 Aug 2004]  In this installment, released in 2004, the user can travel across the entire continental US, and also through northern Mexico and southern Canada, through 30 cities. The sleep timer was brought back in this version. It has an improved traffic model. 18 Wheels of Steel: Pedal to the Metal requires OpenGL. It also has the fastest map to date besides Haulin' and is the first trucking game to feature more than one country.  18 Wheels of Steel: Convoy [1 Sep 2005]  In this updated installment, the player can travel through the United States, as well as southern Canada, though it differs from 18 Wheels of Steel: Pedal to the Metal in that Mexican cities are not present. The player can travel through 30+ cities and choose from 35+ rigs, 45+ cargoes and 47+ trailers. The player has to use the mouse to look outside of the cab at the mirrors. The graphics are also much improved in this version, and users can see drivers in other vehicles and when the trucks are \\"lugged\\" under 1500 RPM, they emit black exhaust much like older non-computerized trucks do. However, other graphical features such as dynamic dashboard gauges were replaced with simple inanimate textures, although this and minor bugs were fixed with a patch released by SCS Software in 2008. Players can also buy things to protect themselves.  18 Wheels of Steel: Haulin' [8 Dec 2006]  This installment adds more cities and has more realistic graphics, but Mexico is gone from this installment, as in Convoy. The ability to use custom soundtracks and save games during deliveries was added also. Users can choose from 32 rigs, 45+ cargoes and 47+ trailers in the game, including double trailers. The game does not require a very powerful computer to operate properly since it can run on most older PCs. The game's engine, Prism3d, may not respond on older graphic cards resulting in a game crash on the game's start-up. Countries include the United States and Canada.  18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul [3 Dec 2007]  This installment of the game is very similar to and has the same game play as Haulin' but with renamed companies, 2 new trucks, and 3 cities in Mexico added. The previous 9 cities [Chihuahua, Guaymas, Monterrey, etc.] from 18 Wheels of Steel: Pedal to the Metal have returned but the map for each was slightly updated.  18 Wheels of Steel: Extreme Trucker [23 Sep 2009]  Extreme Trucker lets the player deliver cargoes in any of the three main areas of the game: Yungas Road (also known as Road of Death), Tuktoyaktuk Winter Road, and the Australian Outback. This game is quite different from the previous installments as the whole concept was changed. The player can no longer drive around in free roam unless they decide to go around the map during a delivery, but they can only pick a job offer from the selection menu if users have met its requirements of having multiple new trucks and accomplished deliveries. The trucks and cars are modeled after real brands, although users can not own any vehicles through the game and are simply truck drivers seeking various jobs. Still, today's low to mediocre range computer will be able to run the game without getting low FPS. The game was mostly poorly received by critics. Game was criticised mostly for change of series concept. But it was well received by players and some reviews were positive towards the game and praised the game for its graphics and gameplay.  18 Wheels of Steel: Extreme Trucker 2 [6 Jan 2011]  Released in 2011, Extreme Trucker 2 is a sequel to 18 Wheels of Steel: Extreme Trucker. The game has two additional locations: Montana and Bangladesh, and a few new types of cargo.

Neuro-ophthalmologists initially complete a residency in either neurology or ophthalmology, then do a fellowship in the complementary field. Since diagnostic studies can be normal in patients with significant neuro-ophthalmic disease, a detailed medical history and physical exam is essential, and neuro-ophthalmologists often spend a significant amount of time with their patients. Common pathology referred to a neuro-ophthalmologist includes afferent visual system disorders (e.g. optic neuritis, optic neuropathy, papilledema, brain tumors or strokes) and efferent visual system disorders (e.g. anisocoria, diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, nystagmus, blepharospasm, seizures of the eye or eye muscles, and hemifacial spasm). The largest international society of neuro-ophthalmologists is the North American Neuro-Ophthalmological Society (NANOS), which organizes an annual meeting and publishes the Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology. Neuro- ophthalmologists are often faculty at large university-based medical centers. Patients often have co-existing diseases in other fields (rheumatology, endocrinology, oncology, cardiology, etc.), thus the neuro-ophthalmologist is often a liaison between the ophthalmology department and other departments in the medical center. Description Neuro-ophthalmology focuses on diseases of the nervous system that affect vision, control of eye movements, or pupillary reflexes. Neuro-ophthalmologists often see patients with complex multi-system disease and ‚Äúzebras‚Äù are not uncommon. Neuro-ophthalmologists are often active teachers in their academic institution, and the first four winners of the prestigious Straatsma American Academy of Ophthalmology teaching awards were neuro-ophthalmologists. Neuro-ophthalmology is mostly non-procedural, however, neuro-ophthalmologists may be trained to perform eye muscle surgery to treat adult strabismus, optic nerve fenestration for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and botulinum injections for blepharospasm or hemifacial spasm. Two neuro-ophthalmology fellows of Andrew G. Lee published reasons why they chose to pursue the discipline: Historical developments At the turn of the 20th Century, there was no textbook in the English language on neuro- ophthalmology. In 1906, Dr. William Campbell Posey, Professor of Ophthalmology in the Philadelphia Polyclinic and Dr. William G. Spiller, Professor of Neurology in the University of Pennsylvania, edited The Eye and Nervous System: Their Diagnostic Relations By Various Authors J.B. Lippincott & Co.. According to the Preface to this book, \\"Although it is generally conceded that a knowledge of neurology is indispensable to the ophthalmologist and that an acquaintanceship with ophthalmology is of the greatest service to the neurologist, there is no book in the English language which covers the ground where the two specialties meet.\\" Frank B. Walsh was a pioneer of neuro- ophthalmology, helping to popularize and develop the field. Walsh was born in Oxbow, Saskatchewan in 1895 and earned a degree from University of Manitoba in 1921. He joined the Wilmer Ophthalmological Institute at Johns Hopkins University and began organizing Saturday morning neuro-ophthalmology conferences. Walsh compiled the first neuro-ophthalmology textbook, which was published in 1947 and has been updated over the years by generations of his students. Future Doctors have been decreasing the time spent with a patient due to economic pressures, the use of nonphysicians, and increasing reliance on laboratory tests. Neuro-ophthalmology has been affected more so than other specialties due to the complexity of the patients and the time required to do a neuro-ophthalmic history and physical exam. Additionally, the current medical reimbursement system rewards quantity of service (performing assembly line procedures) rather than quality of service (making a correct diagnosis, patient education, and counseling), and seeing complex patients is not adequately recognized. Improved functional neuroimaging is paving the way for better understanding, assessment, and management of many neurologic and neuro-ophthalmologic conditions. As our understanding of neuroscience evolves, neuro-ophthalmologists are becoming increasingly better at treatment, rather than only diagnosis, and novel therapies are emerging to treat traditionally vision-devastating disease. For example, clinical trials began in February 2014 to use gene therapy to treat Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, which is one of the first uses of gene therapy in the central nervous system. Progress has also been made in understanding retinal ganglion cell regeneration and in re-establishing synaptic connections from the optic nerve to the brain, more than in other regions of the central nervous system. One of the goals of the National Institutes of Health is to use the visual system as a window to understand neural plasticity and regenerative medicine in the central nervous system, an area of neuroscience that has a promising future and is intimately intertwined with neuro-ophthalmology.

Retrieved on 21 December 2008. One of Hegg's finest moments came on 12 June 1996 when playing for Lancashire against Yorkshire in the semi-final of the Benson & Hedges Cup. Chasing 251 to win, Lancashire were 97/5 when Hegg arrived at the crease. Further wickets tumbled around him but Hegg scored 81 from 62 balls to help steer his county to victory by 1 wicket from the very last ball of the match. Hegg played two Test matches during the 1998‚Äì99 Ashes tour of Australia when Alec Stewart was moved up the order to play as a specialist batsman. Following Stewart's withdrawal from the winter tour of India in 2001, Hegg was recalled to the England squad for that tour and the one of which followed in New Zealand. Hegg never again played international cricket again, and was second choice to the younger wicket-keeper, James Foster, on the tour. Retrieved on 21 December 2008. Hegg was appointed captain of his county in 2002. Under his captaincy, Lancashire finished third and second in the County Championship in 2002 and 2003 respectively. Final seasons The 2004 season was an unsuccessful one for Lancashire, with the team being relegated to the second division of the County Championship for the first time in its history, despite having started as the bookmarkers' favourites to win the competition. The squad was severely depleted by injuries, at one point eight bowlers were unavailable, Retrieved on 4 October 2008. and Hegg himself suffered two hamstring injuries which meant he missed several matches, including the final match of the season which the team needed to win to stay in the first division. Retrieved on 21 December 2008. Following Lancashire's relegation at the end of 2004, Hegg stepped down as Lancashire captain. He was replaced by batsman Mark Chilton. Hegg said of his time as captain \\"It has been a great honour but now the time is right to step down and concentrate on helping the team recapture its position in the first division\\". Retrieved on 21 December 2008. On 15 May 2005, Hegg announced that 2005 would be his last year of cricket. Two weeks before the end of the 2005 season, a delivery from fast bowler James Anderson ricocheted off James Middlebrook's stumps, dismissing him, and hit Hegg on the thumb. The freak accident forced Hegg's season to end prematurely, and he finished with a total of 951 first-class dismissals, of which 919 were for Lancashire, just six short of George Duckworth's Lancashire record of 925.

Biography Mountbatten was born at Darmstadt in the Grand Duchy of Hesse, then ruled by his maternal uncle Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse. From birth, he was a prince of the Hessian royal family, albeit of a morganatic branch. His siblings were Princess Alice (mother of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, to whom he was a mentor in Philip's adolescence, a role assumed after his death by his younger brother Louis), Queen Louise of Sweden and Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma. George followed his father into the Royal Navy, and after passing out from the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth, was promoted to sub-lieutenant on 15 January 1913. He was promoted to lieutenant on 15 February 1914, and served in the First World War. In 1917, his father and several of his relations relinquished their German names, styles and titles in exchange for British peerages at the behest of King George V. Accordingly, Prince George dropped the style of Serene Highness and his surname was anglicised to \\"Mountbatten.\\" When his father was created Marquess of Milford Haven in late 1917, George received the courtesy title of Earl of Medina, succeeding to his father's peerage after his death in 1921. He remained in the Navy after the war; he was promoted to lieutenant-commander on 15 February 1922 and to commander on 31 December 1926. In 1932, he retired from active service at his own request, with effect from 9 December of that year.

(district), the city itself is also designated as a separate raion within the oblast, and is located approximately 80 km from the oblast capital, Khmelnytskyi, at around . Population: History Located in Volhynia, Slavuta was founded by a member of Zaslawski family in 1633. As the family extinguished, all its possessions were transferred to Lubomirski family. Eventually the town was passed on to Marianna Lubomirska who married Pawel Sanguszko who turned the town into the family seat of the Sanguszko princes. Between 1922 and 1939 it was on the Soviet border with Poland. In 1791 the Szapira family set up a Hebrew printing press in Slavuta, which published an influential edition of the Talmud. Moshe Feldenkrais was born in Slavuta on May 6, 1904.Feldenkrais.com Jewish history Slavuta has a rich Jewish history. The town had a prominent Jewish community since near its establishment in the 1600s. Town records show 246 Jewish families in 1765. The peak of the Jewish population of Slavuta is over 5100 in 1939, about 1/3 of the town's population. In the late 1890s the Jewish population of Slavuta was near 60% at 4900 people. The Jewish community consisted of farmers, traders, storekeepers, and rabbinical teachers. Slavuta at one point had nearly 200 Jewish owned shops, largely due to Slavuta being established as a prominent trading town and Jewish center. Slavuta also had three established synagogues. Slavita Shas A complete Talmud, known as The Slavita Shas was published in 1817 by Rabbi Moshe Shapira, \\"Av Bais Din and printer of Slavita.\\" The Shapira Press was given a 25-year license to be the soul publishers of the Talmud in their region by a Jewish court. World War II and beyond With WWII and the invasion of Nazis, the Jews of Slavuta had a fate similar as the Jews of hundreds of other villages near and far. Many hundreds were able to flee to Tashkent and Siberia. But over 2000 Jews were killed in the Slavuta ghetto and concentration camp. All but one synagogue remained, and the mass grave of Jews killed was left in a field. After WWII, the town still had a sizable Jewish community. The survivors of the ghetto and concentration camp, the Jews who fled to Siberia and Tashkent, as well as surviving Jews from surrounding villages that had been completely destroyed, came back and resettled. Synagogue papers, furniture, and scripts from the surrounding ravaged communities had been brought to the Slavuta synagogue. Slavuta also had many monuments established, dedicated to the Jews killed during WWII. Today, the Jewish population is nearly 700.http://jewua.org/slavuta/ Famous residents * Henryk Rzewuski was a Polish Romantic-era journalist and novelist. * Evsei Liberman was a Soviet economist. * Mosh√© Feldenkrais physicist and the founder of the Feldenkrais Method, designed to improve human functioning by increasing self-awareness through movement. * Chava Shapiro was a Hebrew writer and journalist * Oleksandr Zinchenko was a Ukrainian politician who was Director-General of the National Space Agency of Ukraine from 2009 to 2010. * Family Sanguszko (, ) is a Polish-Lithuanian noble family of the Ruthenian (now Ukrainian) stock from the Gediminid dynasty.

It is usually located just above the lens or on the electronic viewfinder (EVF) and communicates, for the benefit of those in front of the camera as well as the camera operator, that the camera is 'live' - i.e. its signal is being used for the 'main program' at that moment. For television productions with more than one camera in a multiple-camera setup, the tally lights are generally illuminated automatically by a vision mixer trigger that is fed to a tally breakout board and then to a special video router designed for tally signals. The video switcher keeps track of which video sources are selected by the technical director and output to the main program bus. A switch automatically closes the appropriate electrical contacts to create a circuit, which activates the tally unit located in the camera control units (CCU). If more than one camera is on-air simultaneously (as in the case of a dissolve), during the duration of the transition the tally lights of both cameras will remain lit until transition completion. This is also the case when multiple cameras are placed in 'boxes' on screen, sometimes referred to as \\"picture in picture\\" mode (PiP) .  Colours & usage  Tally (also known as the 'on-air' indication) lights are typically red, although some cameras and video switchers accept a preview tally signal, which is typically green. In addition to the tally lights, an additional light called ISO is sometimes used. ISO is the abbreviation for \\"isolated\\", and indicates that the video signal is isolated and recorded separately. When the camera's signal isn't used for the main program, but is being recorded for later video editing, a yellow light indicates to the camera operator that the content might be used at a later stage. So, although not 'on air', the operator should try to prevent making sudden moves etc. The ISO content is typically used for b-roll shots such as people's reactions when it's uncertain if, when, and how they will react.

History  The family appears in 1057 with Robbrath de Castello. The County of Castell was created in 1200, in the modern region of Franconia in northern Bavaria, Germany. Rulership of Castell was shared between the brothers Louis and Rupert II in 1223, and later with the brothers Albert II, Frederick II and Henry I in 1235. The County was partitioned into Elder and Younger lines in 1254, which were reunited in 1347 with the extinction of the Elder branch. Castell was repartitioned in 1597 into Castell-Remlingen and Castell-R√ºdenhausen. When Count Wolfgang Theodoric of Castell-Castell (itself a partition of Castell-Remlingen) died in 1709, the County of Castell was recreated as a partition.

Through the marriage of Count Alexander von Castell-R√ºdenhausen (1866‚Äì1928) with Baroness Ottilie von Faber (1877‚Äì1944), from a well-known family of industrialists, the branch of Faber- Castell was created in 1898. The current Faber-Castell company was founded in 1761 at Stein near Nuremberg by cabinet maker Kaspar Faber (1730‚Äì84), and it has remained in the family for nine generations.Faber-Castell International. The History of the Faber-Castell Company The company opened branches in New York (1849), London (1851) and Paris (1855), and then expanded to Vienna (1872) and St. Petersburg (1874). It opened a factory in Geroldsgr√ºn and expanded internationally, and it launched new products under Kaspar Faber's ambitious great-grandson, Lothar von Faber (1817‚Äì96). In 1900, after the marriage of Lothar's granddaughter with a cadet of the Counts of Castell, the A.W. Faber enterprise took the name of Faber-Castell and a new logo, combining the Faber motto (\\"Since 1761\\") with the \\"jousting knights\\" of the Castells' coat-of-arms.Faber-Castell International. The Company Logo Faber Castle at Stein near Nuremberg Faber-Castell works at Stein Faber-Castell works at Geroldsgr√ºn A descendant of the first Prince of Castell-R√ºdenhausen, Count Alexander von Castell-R√ºdenhausen (1866‚Äì1928), married Baroness Ottilie von Faber (1877‚Äì1944), heiress of the Faber pencil \\"dynasty\\", in 1898. Although the immensely wealthy Lothar von Faber had been ennobled in 1861 and titled as Freiherr (Baron) von Faber in the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1881, in the German Empire, a mediatised nobleman's marriage to Lothar's granddaughter would have been deemed morganatic, and the count's trafficking in commerce considered an act of social derogation for a member of the Hochadel, so Alexander renounced his birth rank prior to the marriage. He was granted the new hereditary title of Graf (Count) von Faber-Castell by Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria, for the descendants of his marriage to the Faber heiress. Although Alexander and Ottilie divorced in 1918, the Faber business trust had conferred headship of the company on Alexander, who even kept the Fabers' renovated palace at Stein (which would be commandeered to billet journalists during the Nuremberg trials, including Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck).Faber-Castell International. The Faber-Castell Castle In 1927, Alexander resumed his original name for himself, his second wife (born a countess, Margit Zedtwitz von Moravan und Duppau, 1886‚Äì1973), and their son, Count Radulf (1922‚Äì2004). Alexander's issue by his first marriage had never been considered dynasts of the House of Castell, but they inherited the vast Faber fortune and continue to include 'Castell' in their surname with the comital title. Alexander and Ottilie's only son, Count Roland Lothar Wolfgang Christian Ernst Wilhelm von Faber-Castell (1905‚Äì78), inherited the headship of the Faber-Castell companies from his parents.

The sons of his only son Wilhelm (1851‚Äì1893) (by his wife Bertha Faber {1856-1940}, daughter of Lothar's younger brother, Eberhard {1822-1879}, who had founded the New York branch of the company) having died young, a marriage for his granddaughter and heiress Ottilie was arranged with a scion of one of Germany's formerly ruling comital dynasties. Yet in the conservative German Empire of fin-de-si√®cle Europe, the marriage of a Faber into a family of the high nobility was regarded as too bold a leap upward socially. A morganatic marriage would have been required, and the Faber pencil works could not have remained in the hands of their descendants because trafficking in commerce was still considered an act of social derogation among members of the Hochadel. To resolve this dilemma, the chosen groom, Count Alexander von Castell- R√ºdenhausen (1866‚Äì1928) renounced his birth rank prior to the marriage. The Castell family had been Imperial counts in Franconia, known since the 11th century. When the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved under pressure from Napoleon I in 1806, the Castell lands were annexed by the Kingdom of Bavaria. Although deprived of sovereignty, in 1815 the Castells were mediatized, their rank with the reigning dynasties of Europe being formally recognized,Almanach de Gotha. 1910.

His issue by the first marriage had never been considered dynasts of the House of Castell, but they inherited the vast Faber fortune and continue to include Castell in their name with the comital title. Various branches of the family continued to flourish, but the Faber and Faber- Castell corporate holdings usually passed to the eldest male of the patrilineage. Alexander and Ottilie's only son, Count Roland von Faber-Castell (1905‚Äì78), inherited headship of the Faber-Castell companies from his parents. His eldest son, Hubertus von Faber-Castell left the family business after a dispute with his father and was succeeded by his younger brother, Anton- Wolfgang (1941-2016). As the first born, Count Hubertus inherited the majority of the family's assets, yet sold most of his company shares to his successor, after leaving the company.

Life Both of Riesser's grandfathers were rabbis; his paternal grandfather was Jakob Pinchas Katzenellenbogen, rabbi in Lemberg and later Oettingen, and his maternal grandfather was Raphael Cohen, Chief Rabbi of Altona-Hamburg-Wandsbek from 1775. Yet his father, having changed the family name from Katzenellenbogen to Riesser, chose to work as a secretary at the Jewish law court of Altona before he finally became a merchant in Hamburg. After his education at the renowned grammar school Johanneum, Gabriel Riesser went to Heidelberg and Kiel, where he studied law from 1824 to 1828, writing his doctorate dissertation in Heidelberg. He became a leading advocate of Jewish emancipation. He had himself suffered discrimination because of his religion: in Heidelberg and Jena he was denied the position of a university lecturer, in Hamburg in 1829 he was not allowed to practice as a lawyer. In his application he had recurred to a privilege of equal treatment that had been granted during the French occupation. His application, however, was refused because he formally was no citizen (which he as a Jew could not become) of the city of Hamburg. In reaction Riesser in 1830 published an essay \\"Stellung der Bekenner des mosaischen Glaubens in Deutschland\\" (On the Position of Confessors of the Jewish Faith in Germany). In 1832 he founded the journal Der Jude, periodische Bl√§tter f√ºr Religions- und Gewissensfreiheit (The Jew, Periodical for Freedom of Religion and Thought). He also wrote a note on the emancipation of Jews for the parliament of the German state Baden in 1833. From 1836 onwards he composed the \\"J√ºdische Briefe\\" (Jewish Letters) in Bockenheim near Frankfurt am Main, which were subsequently published in Berlin in 1840-42. Riesser was chairman of the Hamburg Temple Association from 1840-43. In 1840 the Senate of Hamburg (city-state government) passed a law stating that \\"k√ºnftighin auch ein oder zwei Mitglieder der hiesigen israelitischen Gemeinde, wenn sie sonst dazu qualifiziert w√§ren, Notare werden k√∂nnten\\" (in future also one or two members of the local Jewish community might become notaries, if they otherwise were duly qualified). This change of mind of the senate was brought about by the death of the Jewish notary Meyer Israel Bresselau, who had been installed during French annexation in 1811. Riesser applied for the vacant position. From 1840 to 1857 he practised as a notary in Hamburg. Politics In 1848 Riesser was a member of the revolutionary Frankfurt Parliament where he was vice-president. He was elected for the constituency of Saxe-Lauenburg. Riesser was a member of the Kaiserdeputation which offered the Prussian King Frederich William IV the German crown. Legacy When the civil rights of the \\"Paulskirchenverfassung\\" (Constitution of St. Paul's Church) came into effect in Hamburg on 21 February 1849, Riesser was able to become citizen of Hamburg, a rare and dear franchise at that time, which the bulk of the inhabitants did not hold. In 1859 he was elected to the B√ºrgerschaft of Hamburg (city-state parliament).Kraus, Hans- Christof (2003). \\"Riesser, Gabriel.\\" in: Neue Deutsche Biographie, vol. 21. Berlin: Duncker & Humblot. p. 608-609. In October 1860 he was appointed as a member of the city's new upper court (Obergericht), becoming the first Jewish judge in Germany. In 1861 Isaac Wolffson, Riesser's colleague and fellow advocate for Jewish emancipation, was elected president of the Hamburg parliament, becoming the first Jewish president of a German parliament. Riesser's grave at the Ohlsdorf Jewish Cemetery in Hamburg Riesser was buried at the Jewish Grindel cemetery in Hamburg. When the Nazis ordered its demolition in 1937, the Ashkenazi Congregation transferred the graves, including his, to the Jewish section of Ohlsdorf Cemetery in Hamburg. There is a street named after Riesser In Hamburg-Hamm.

The SWP uses rail branches that were acquired from CSX Transportation (originally the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad) and Conrail (originally the Pennsylvania Railroad). All of the track used by the SWP is in either Fayette or Westmoreland counties. SWP provides local service to many customers in the area, connecting them to the outside world via interchanges with Norfolk Southern, Wheeling & Lake Erie Railroad, and CSX. SWP has been vital in the location of several new industries to Fayette and Westmoreland Counties in recent years. The main line of the SWP railroad runs as far north as Radebaugh in Hempfield Township. It then passes Greensburg and Scottdale (the location of the railyard) to an interchange with NS and W&LE; in Everson. The SWP mainline passes through the coal towns of Owensdale and Broadford, before reaching a junction with CSX. It operates over CSX tracks through Connellsville, where it leaves CSX to run south through Dunbar and Mt Braddock to Uniontown. The route ends after passing through Fairchance and Smithfield. Near the end of the line in Smithfield is a new large fracking-sand facility owned by Hi-Crush Partners, which receives 40 ft covered hoppers. The railroad features several branch lines. One travels to Yukon (in South Huntingdon Township) to serve a box and packaging facility. Another branch runs from Everson to Mt. Pleasant, Pennsylvania and New Stanton. Here, the Westmoreland Rail Freight Terminal, a large bulk transload facility, is served. This location also has a new ethanol plant under construction. The Bullskin Branch serves a small coal loadout named Bullskin Tipple which actually is in Connellsville Township, Pennsylvania. It is only used occasionally. Southwest Pennsylvania Railroad's operational headquarters are located in Oakmont, Pennsylvania. The SWP is operated by Carload Express, Inc., which also operates three other shortline railroads: The Allegheny Valley Railroad (AVR) serving the Pittsburgh area, the Ohio Terminal Railway, and the Delmarva Central Railroad. The current SWP roster consists of SWP 4006 GP40-2 mated with SWP 406 slug, which in combination are referred to as an HD40-2 by Southwest Pennsylvania Railroad. This combination has 3000 HP, 8 powered axles and two fuel tanks. SWP 4006 was repainted and SWP 406 was rebuilt by Metro East Industries, Inc. of St. Louis, Ill in 2015. Other locomotives from sister railroad AVR are lent to SWP from time to time as needed. History The Southwest Pennsylvania Railroad began operations in June 1995 when Trimax (now Carload Express) was selected to operate of railroad by the Westmoreland County Industrial Development Corporation and the Fay-Penn Industrial Development Corporation. In May 2000, the Southwest Pennsylvania Railroad started service to the Westmoreland Rail Freight terminal near New Stanton. The railroad began service to the Hunter Panels plant in the Fayette Business Park in Fairchance in 2006. In 2011, the Southwest Pennsylvania Railroad commenced service to the Fayette Rail Freight terminal in Smithfield. This facility is now operated by Hi-Crush Partners and serves unit trains of sand for hydraulic fracturing.

Born in Italy on 30 June 1863, Father Alberico Crescitelli entered the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions in 1880 and was ordained a priest on 4 June 1887. The following year he went to China and began work in southern Shaanxi. Crescitelli was believed to have been killed in the Boxer Rebellion. Crescitelli's confreres, who had known him well and for many years, started his beatification cause in 1908, only eight years after his death. The testimony provided by the confreres was unanimous about the holiness of Crescitelli's life. At the Vatican, in St. Peter's Basilica on 18 February 1951, Pope Pius XII declared Alberico Crescitelli \\"blessed.\\" The Pope's speech was memorable especially for the passage in which he described Father Alberico's martyrdom: Pope John Paul II included him in the list of 120 Martyr Saints of China canonized in St. Peter's Square on October 1, 2000. This large group canonisation was bitterly opposed in China itself, with Bishop Fu Tieshan, the leader of the state-run Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association describing it as \\"intolerable\\". A statement released by the Chinese Foreign Ministry alleged that \\"some of those canonised by the Vatican this time perpetrated outrages such as raping or looting in China and committed unforgivable crimes against the Chinese people.\\" A further statement from China's State Administration of Religious Affairs singled out Alberico Crescitelli for special comment, alleging that he had been \\"notorious for taking the 'right of the first night' of each bride under his diocese.\\"Christopher Bodeen, \\"China says Vatican's newest saints were sinners, rapists\\", Associated Press, 1 October 2000 The Catholic Church's Holy Spirit Study Centre in Hong Kong has described the accusations as baseless.\\"Father Alberico Crescitelli a martyr to incredible and unproven accusations\\" In his homily at the canonisation ceremony on 1 October 2000, Pope John Paul II made a statement asking for forgiveness for any past wrongs by the missionaries to China: \\"There are those who with a partial and not very objective reading of history see only limits and errors in their action.

Ca tr√π is inscribed on the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in need of Urgent Safeguarding in 2009. History There are different myths and theories related to ca tr√π's conception. There is a theory points to a woman named ƒê√†o Th·ªã, a talented musician who was beloved by the L√Ω Dynasty imperial court. This theory also claims that ever since the time of ƒê√†o Th·ªã, in admiration of her, women who held a profession as singers (such as ca tr√π singers) were referred to as ƒê√†o n∆∞∆°ng (\\"n∆∞∆°ng\\" here refers roughly to \\"maiden\\" or \\"lady\\"). The latter is true although this term is no longer widely used in modern Vietnam.\\"Bao HA NOI MOI dien tu\\", HanoiMoi.com. What is known for sure is that ca tr√π started off like many of Vietnam's arts as being a form of entertainment for the royal court. Officially ca tru count the age of their profession since The Later Le dynasty (, 1010‚Äî1225), at that time musicians called performed only on religious court ceremonies.\\"Ca tru\\", CaTruThangLong.com. It was only later on that it branched out into being performed at small inns. Indeed, it was mainly scholars and other members of the elite who enjoyed the genere. In the 15th century ca tru spread through Northern Vietnam. The artists might be called to celebrate a son's birth, or to celebrate the signing of a contract. Ca tru were outside of the caste system, so they could entertain the most noble clients.–í–æ–∑–≤—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ –º—É–∑—ã–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∫—Ä—É–∂–∫–∞ . In the 20th century, ca tr√π nearly died out. When the Communists came to power after the 1945 August Revolution, Ca Tr√π was systematically suppressed, becoming associated with prostitution and the degradation of women.\\"The Exotic Sounds of Ca Tru\\", ThingsAsian.com. Consequently, before 1976 there existed only two ca tru: and .\\"Quach Thi Ho ‚Äî The woman faithful to Ca tru\\", CaTruThangLong.com. Later they both started to revive the tradition of ca tru. In actuality, men were allowed many wives in the past and having extramarital affairs was nothing shocking. Thus, it was commonly known that many famous ca tr√π singers did indeed have affairs with important men, but it was just something to be accepted as a part of society back then, and not a part of the profession itself. As of 2009, extensive efforts are being made to invigorate the genre, including many festivals and events where several types of ca tr√π (among other related arts) are performed. Vietnam has also completed documents to have ca tr√π recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage. By 2011 there were 140 ca tru from 23 clubs.\\"National fest honours art of ca tru singing\\", VietnamNews.VNAgency.com.vn. Instruments Ca tr√π, like many ancient and highly developed arts, has many forms. However, the most widely known and widely performed type of ca tr√π involves only three performers: the female vocalist, lute player and a spectator (who also takes part in the performance). Sometimes dance is also performed at the same time. The female singer provides the vocals whilst playing her ph√°ch (small wooden sticks beaten on a small bamboo bar to serve as percussion). She is accompanied by a man who plays the ƒë√†n ƒë√°y, a long-necked, 3-string lute used almost exclusively for the ca tr√π genre.Terry E. Miller, Sean Williams (2008). The Garland handbook of Southeast Asian music, p.262. . \\"This lute is the only stringed instrument used to accompany ca tr√π singing.\\" Last is the spectator (often a scholar or connoisseur of the art) who strikes a tr·ªëng ch·∫ßu (praise drum) in praise (or disapproval) of the singer's performance, usually with every passage of the song. The way in which he strikes the drum shows whether he likes or dislikes the performance, but he always does it according to the beat provided by the vocalists' ph√°ch percussion. The number of ca tru melodies is 56, they are called . New observers to the art often comment on how strikingly odd the vocal technique sounds, but it is the vocals themselves that are essential in defining ca tr√π. Ca tr√π inns Ca tr√π literally translates as \\"tally card songs.\\" This refers to the bamboo cards men bought when they visited ca tr√π inns, where this music was most often performed in the past. Men would give the bamboo cards they purchased to the woman of choice after her performance, and she would collect money based upon how many cards she was given. Scholar-bureaucrats and other members of the elite most enjoyed this genre. They often visited these inns to be entertained by the talented young women, who did not only sing, but with their knowledge of poetry and the arts could strike up a witty conversation along with serving food and drink. Besides these inns, ca tr√π was also commonly performed in communal houses or private homes. In modern Vietnamese media Along with efforts made to preserve the genre, ca tr√π has been appearing in much of recent Vietnamese pop culture, including movies such as the award-winning film M√™ th·∫£o: th·ªùi vang b√≥ng, \\"Tr√≤ ƒë·ªùi\\", \\"TrƒÉng t·ªè th·ªÅm lan\\" , \\"Th∆∞∆°ng nh·ªõ ·ªü ai\\".

The crown was made by Garrard & Co., the Crown Jeweller at the time, and is modelled partly on the design of Queen Mary's Crown, though it differs by having four half-arches instead of eight. As with Queen Mary's Crown, its arches are detachable at the crosses patt√©e, allowing it to be worn as a circlet or open crown. It is the only crown for a British king or queen to be made of platinum. The crown is decorated with about 2,800 diamonds, most notably the Koh-i-Noor in the middle of the front cross, which was acquired by the East India Company after the Anglo-Sikh Wars and presented to Queen Victoria in 1851, and a 17-carat (3.4 g) Turkish diamond given to her in 1856 by Abd√ºlmecid I, sultan of the Ottoman Empire, as a gesture of thanks for British support in the Crimean War. The Koh-i-Noor became a part of the Crown Jewels when it was left to the Crown upon Victoria's death in 1901. It had been successively mounted in the crowns of Queen Alexandra and Queen Mary before it was transferred to The Queen Mother's Crown. After the death of the king, Queen Elizabeth, known thereafter as the Queen Mother, did not wear the full crown, but wore it minus the arches as a circlet at the coronation of her daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, in 1953. It was placed on top of the Queen Mother's coffin for her lying-in-state and funeral in 2002.

It marks the second album of Donovan's children's music, after the For Little Ones portion of A Gift from a Flower to a Garden. HMS Donovan is the second double album of Donovan's career, and was released in the UK only, in July 1971 (Dawn Records DNLD 4001 (stereo)). History After the release of the 1970 album Open Road that Donovan recorded with the band of the same name, he and his bandmates embarked on an international tour, partially by boat. Intending to sail around the world for one year, Donovan became homesick and ended the tour early, returning to the UK where he married his longtime affection Linda Lawrence (once girlfriend of Brian Jones) in October 1970. When Linda became pregnant with their first child, Donovan began working to complete a children's album that would eventually contain recordings spanning from July 1968 to 1971. Donovan had started to conceive of this album as early as 1968. During a session with Paul McCartney that year, he outlined the start to the album by describing an echoey pump organ and a man shouting in Italian announcing a string of circus acts that would then fade out into \\"The Walrus and The Carpenter\\". He also played \\"Mr. Wind\\" and \\"The Unicorn\\" for McCartney, who had recently finished recording \\"Blackbird\\". A demo of \\"Mr. Wind\\" was recorded after the Barabajagal sessions in a lower register and without the voice effects. The original lyrics of the song were printed on the British version of Sunshine Superman, four years before the release of HMS Donovan. More than half of HMS Donovan's tracks are traditional folk songs, hymns, and classic poems for and about children, which Donovan set to original melodies. Many of the poems were from the book, One Hundred Poems for Children compiled by Herbert Strang. Other poems come from Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass. Of Donovan's original songs, most were newly written, many while staying on the isle of Crete and along other parts of Open Road's tour. \\"Lord of the Reedy River\\" was performed by Donovan in the 1969 film If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium. The album was produced by Donovan, save for \\"Homesickness\\", the record's sole electric rocker, produced by Mickie Most either from sessions in 1968 or 69, as Donovan and Most stopped working together after the Barabajagal sessions. Other songs backed by drummer John Carr and bassist Mike Thompson were recorded during the previous year's sessions for Open Road. Some of the songs on HMS Donovan share melodies with other songs in Donovan's canon. \\"Jabberwocky\\" has an acoustic arrangement with the same melody as \\"Celtic Rock\\" from Open Road. \\"The Owl and the Pussycat\\" and \\"The Unicorn\\" also have the same melody, but bootleg recordings suggest Donovan once sang these two songs together in a medley during late 1960s live performances. Sydney Carter's \\"Lord of the Dance\\" borrows the melody from the Joseph Brackett song \\"Simple Gifts\\". \\"The Star\\" is better known as \\"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\\". Despite the inclusion of Donovan's minor hit \\"Celia of the Seals\\", HMS Donovan did not sell as well as his previous releases and did not appear on the UK charts. Epic Records refused to release the album in the US and Pye Records only put the album out on its subsidiary label Dawn Records in the UK. This prompted Donovan to reunite with his old producer Mickie Most to try to find a hit-making formula for his next album. The fact that sales were the lowest of Donovan's career at the time eventually lead to HMS Donovan becoming the most rare and sought-after LP of Donovan's catalogue; in the 21st Century a search of Ebay reveals that original LP copies of HMS Donovan often trade hands for $100 or more, normally selling for five or ten times the price of any other Donovan LP.

Advocacy  Throughout his career, Munter has been at the forefront of numerous social change initiatives. In 2001, as head of the city of Ottawa's Health and Social Services Committee, he led the adoption of Canada's first big-city workplace and public place smoking ban on city council. The Ottawa by-law became a model for many other jurisdictions, including New York City, which invited Munter to present to its city health commission in 2002. While second-hand smoke prohibitions are now commonplace, Ottawa's regulations broke new ground and came only a few years after Toronto had been forced to repeal a similar by-law due to public protest. In 2003, Munter was approached by Canadians for Equal Marriage, a coalition of churches, professional groups and citizen organizations, and was asked to be the group's National Co- ordinator. In that role, he led a successful national campaign in support of Bill C-38: Civil Marriage Act, the federal legislation to entrench same-sex marriage rights in Canadian law. Since moving into health and social services administration in 2007, Munter has continued to be a national voice on important public policy issues like gene patenting, obesity, mental health and the future of health care. In 2014, Munter spoke for the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) when the organization launched a lawsuit against a private company, Transgenomic, challenging the legality of gene patents in Federal Court in Canada. CHEO argued that genes and other segments of the human genome should not be subject to patents for commercial purposes. CHEO declared victory in 2016, when it secured the right to use the disputed genes for all public hospitals and non-profit labs and created a public access framework that could be replicated for other genes. Munter called it \\"a historic day for Canada and Canada's health care system.\\" In 2012, Munter was appointed co-chair of a provincial expert panel on childhood obesity. Its 2013 report proposed a three-pronged strategy to reduce rates of childhood obesity: putting kids on the path to lifelong health, changing the food environment and building healthier communities. Recommendations included baby-friendly hospitals, better support for breastfeeding and restrictions on the marketing of junk food to children. Munter has also been a vocal advocate of improved access to mental health care and to champion the adoption of innovative technologies within Canadian hospitals, as well as is a frequent speaker on the future of Canada's universal medicare system. Career Munter's father emigrated from Germany to Montreal in 1966, his mother had arrived the year before. They met in a French class for immigrants, which his mother was teaching. His family then moved to the Ottawa region in 1977, and settled in the Katimavik-Hazeldean area west of the city. At age 14, Munter began publishing the Kanata Kourier from his basement as a monthly local paper for the suburban community of Kanata, Ontario. In four years, the paper had a staff of seven and a circulation of 10,000 in the town of 27,000. In recognition of his success in business, he received an award as \\"Young Entrepreneur of the Year\\" from then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in 1988. Munter was a City and Regional Councillor in Ottawa from 1991 to 2003. From 1997 onward, he headed the council committees responsible for health and social services with oversight of the city's $550 million human services budget. In that role, he led Council to adopt unanimously pioneering smoke- free regulations in 2001; helped open new child care centres, expand the number of child care spaces, and expand public health programs for children and youth; worked with provincial government to oversee the transfer of ambulance services and social housing to the municipal level; initiated Canada's first comprehensive public access defibrillator program; expanded long-term care for seniors; funded hospital expansions and worked with the Community Care Access Centre and community support agencies to improve at-home support services for seniors and people with disabilities. In 2012 and 2013, Munter served as co-chair of the Ontario Healthy Kids Panel along with Kelly Murumets, president and CEO of ParticipACTION. The final report recommended starting kids on the right path from conception to birth, changing the food environment, and creating healthier communities. Munter was Executive Director of the Youth Services Bureau of Ottawa (YSB), one of Ontario largest accredited children's mental health agencies. He was also the Chief Executive Officer of the Champlain Local Health Integration Network (LHIN), the provincial government agency responsible for planning, integrating and funding health services in the Ottawa Region with an annual budget of $2.2 billion. Munter holds a Bachelor of Social Sciences degree from the University of Ottawa, a Master of Science degree in Behavioural Science from the London School of Economics and a professional designation as a Certified Health Executive (CHE) from the Canadian College of Health Leaders. After leaving city government, he was a Visiting Professor in the School of Political Studies at the University of Ottawa, teaching there and at Montreal's Concordia University.  Politics  Munter became much involved in local politics in his role as editor of the Kanata Kourier. He was frequently at odds with Kanata Mayor Des Adam. In August 1989, he sold his paper to Runge Newspapers Inc. for over $300,000 due to competition from the rival paper Kanata Standard, but stayed on as publisher. In November 1989, Munter left the Kourier to focus on his ongoing studies in Political Science at the University of Ottawa. He became a political reporter for the Ottawa Citizen, but left to run as a candidate of the Ontario New Democratic Party in the 1990 provincial election, contesting the riding of Carleton. Munter placed third in this conservative riding, but received more votes than any previous NDP candidate in the area. Munter briefly returned to the Citizen, then worked for the Spicer Commission on Canada's Future before re-entering politics to run for Kanata City Council against incumbent Bev Read. After winning the election, Munter quickly became a prominent member of the council. He pushed through an initiative to install condom dispensers in some municipal buildings. He also chaired the Kanata Police Services Board. In 1993, he came out of the closet as the Ottawa area's first openly gay politician.Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives profile Canada.com article referring to Munter as 'well-known gay rights activist' The following year, he ran for a seat on the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton representing all of Kanata. He easily won the seat against two other Kanata politicians. During his time in office, Kanata was in the midst of an economic boom centred on the high-tech industry. Munter's main concern was managing the area's rapid growth. He supported creating the amalgamated city of Ottawa, and was acclaimed to the new Ottawa City Council when it was created. He also chaired the new city of Ottawa's health committee and, along with Medical Officer of Health Robert Cushman, worked to bring in Ottawa's no-smoking by-law. Munter was courted to run provincially or to challenge for the mayoralty against Bob Chiarelli in 2003, but instead took a hiatus from electoral politics. He became a visiting professor of Urban Studies and Communications at the University of Ottawa and resumed writing for the Citizen. The federal New Democratic Party (NDP) approached him to run in Ottawa Centre in the 2006 federal election to succeed Ed Broadbent but Munter declined. Munter was the co-ordinator for Canadians for Equal Marriage, a group that campaigned successfully in favour of legislation to enshrine same-sex marriage in Canada. Munter is not a member of any political party now. Locally, the Ottawa Sun reported Munter campaigned for candidates from all the major parties including Conservative, Liberal, and NDP. On February 13, 2006, Alex Munter announced his candidacy for mayor of Ottawa in the November 2006 municipal election. A 2005 poll by the Ottawa Sun had Munter as a front-runner, in a statistical tie with the incumbent Bob Chiarelli. Another public poll in April 2006 had Munter as the front runner with a significant lead over Chiarelli. Most polls made public in the early stages of the campaign showed Munter in first place, often by a small margin. A poll conducted between October 13 and 18 by UniMarketing and sponsored by Radio-Canada and Le Droit, had Munter ahead by 12 percentage points at 44% of decided voters. Larry O'Brien was in second place with 32% and Chiarelli third (24%). On election night, Munter finished second with 36.25%, behind O'Brien (47%) but ahead of Chiarelli (15.6%). 2006 mayoral campaign platform A map showing the concentration of Munter's vote. He won the downtown and his home region of Kanata while doing poorly in the rural areas Munter set out several key priorities in his mayor campaign: public safety, fiscal responsibility, local economy and public transit. He promised to limit tax hikes to the inflation rate. While he was a city councillor, he claimed he helped to bring in ten consecutive balanced budgets without any tax increases. His opponents claimed that the budget was balanced despite his votes to increase spending. He said he planned to improve public transit in the city of Ottawa, to review the O-Train project and to fix possible irregularities regarding the contract with Siemens. Munter said that the project could have been significantly better than the existing proposal, and that the costs could have been reduced. He did his own proposal of the north‚Äìsouth line by proposing the removal of the Barrhaven and downtown sections. Funding released would have redirected for the development of a future east‚Äìwest line.Chiarelli attacks Munter's light-rail alternative He criticized outgoing mayor Bob Chiarelli on several occasions for proceeding too quickly on the project, without proper information and consultation. He also criticized the mayor for allegedly providing incorrect information about the project, including saying that there would be additional costs because of an announcement made by John Baird, President of the Treasury Board, that the federal government's $200 million contribution would be delayed until after the November election.Chiarelli misled council on rail deal, Munter says After Larry O'Brien's election as the new mayor, the expansion project was completely cancelled by City Council on December 14, 2006. He promised to improve safety on the city streets with an increase of the number of police officers. He supported, along with mayors from other cities, increased gun control and stricter measures for drug dealing. He also proposed to give an easier access to leisure activities for kids with lower recreational fees. He wanted the city of Ottawa to be environmentally friendly. In addition to improvements for the public transit system, he also promised to close two landfill sites situated on Carp and Navan Roads in which there were expansion requests by private firms despite opposition by citizens.  Awards  Munter has won numerous awards from a wide range of organizations for his contributions to the community, including the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, the Canadian Institute for Child Health, United Way/Centraide Ottawa, the Federal Business Development Bank, l'Association Canadienne-Fran√ßaise de l'Ontario d'Ottawa, Leadership Ottawa and the Ontario Association of Social Workers.

He was a juvenile offender sentenced to death at age 16 by the state of Louisiana in 1945 for the murder of Andrew Thomas, a Cajun pharmacy owner in St. Martinville who had once employed him. He was 17 when he survived the first attempt to execute him, as the chair malfunctioned. After an appeal of his case taken to the US Supreme Court failed, he was executed in 1947 at age 18.  Arrest and trial  In 1944, Andrew Thomas, a pharmacist in St. Martinville, Louisiana, was shot and killed. His murder remained unsolved for nine months, but in August 1945, Willie Francis was detained in Texas due to his proximity to an unrelated crime. Police claimed that he was carrying Thomas' wallet in his pocket, though no evidence of this claim was submitted during the trial. Francis initially named several others in connection with the murder, but the police dismissed these claims. A short time later, while under interrogation, Francis confessed to Thomas' murder, writing, \\"It was a secret about me and him.\\" He had no counsel with him. The meaning of his statement is still uncertain. Author Gilbert King, in his book, The Execution of Willie Francis (2008), alludes to rumors in St. Martinville of sexual abuse of the youth by the pharmacist. Francis later directed the police to where he had disposed of the holster used to carry the murder weapon. The gun used to kill Thomas was found near the crime scene. It belonged to a deputy sheriff in St. Martinville who had once threatened to kill Thomas. The gun, and the bullets recovered from the crime scene and Thomas' body, disappeared from police evidence just before the trial. Despite two separate written confessions, Francis pleaded not guilty. During his trial, the court-appointed defense attorneys offered no objections, called no witnesses, and put up no defense. The validity of Francis' confessions were not questioned by the defense, although he had no counsel at the time. Two days after the trial began, Francis was quickly convicted of murder and was sentenced to death by twelve jurors and the judge despite Francis having been underage at 15 at the time of the crime.  Execution attempt, appeal, and second execution  On May 3, 1946, Francis survived an attempt at execution by the electric chair. Witnesses reported hearing the teenager scream from behind the leather hood, \\"Take it off! Take it off! Let me breathe!\\" as the supposedly lethal surge of electricity was being applied. Justice Burton cited an affidavit by Harold Resweber, witness to the botched execution, which reported Francis' outburst. The portable electric chair, known as \\"Gruesome Gertie,\\" was found to have been improperly set up by an intoxicated prison guard and inmate from the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. The sheriff, E.L. Resweber, was later quoted as saying: \\"This boy really got a shock when they turned that machine on.\\" After the botched execution, a young lawyer, Bertrand DeBlanc decided to take Francis' case. He felt it was unjust, and cruel and unusual punishment, as prohibited in the Constitution, to subject him again to the execution process. DeBlanc had been best friends with Thomas and his decision was greeted with dismay by the citizens in the small Cajun town. DeBlanc took Francis' case to the Supreme Court in Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459 (1947), citing various violations of his Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. These included violations of equal protection, double jeopardy, and cruel and unusual punishment. The US Supreme Court rejected the appeal. Subsequently, Willie Francis was returned to the electric chair on May 9, 1947. He told reporter Elliott Chaze a couple of days prior to the execution that he was going to meet the Lord with his \\"Sunday pants and Sunday heart.\\" He was pronounced dead in the chair at 12:10 p.m. (CST).  Documentary  Willie Francis' life was the subject of a 2006 documentary, titled Willie Francis Must Die Again, written and directed by filmmaker Allan Durand. The film, narrated by actor Danny Glover, chronicles the full story of his case and the unprecedented court battle that followed his failed execution. Produced by regional film director/producer Glen Pitre, the film includes first hand accounts of Francis' original trial, interviews with Sister Helen Prejean, author of Dead Man Walking, a book about the death penalty, and Gilbert King, author of The Execution of Willie Francis (2008); and cultural perspective provided by director Allan Durand.

The movie stars Humphrey Bogart and June Allyson, and costars Keenan Wynn and Robert Keith. The film is set in Korea during the Korean War. Bogart (in his only film for Metro-Goldwyn-MayerErickson, Hal. \\"Battle Circus (1953).\\" Allmovie. Retrieved: October 20, 2012.) plays a surgeon and commander of Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) 8666 (shortened to \\"66\\" in the dialogue), with Allyson playing a newly arrived nurse. Despite initial obstacles, their love flourishes against a background of war, enemy attacks, death and injury. Plot A young Army nurse, Lieutenant Ruth McCara (June Allyson), is newly assigned to the 8666th MASH, a mobile field hospital constantly on the move during the Korean War. Ruth's personal mission is to serve suffering humanity. She initially experiences an uncomfortable welcoming by the unit's hard-drinking, no-nonsense chief surgeon, Major Jed Webbe (Humphrey Bogart). Jed engages in a helicopter rescue of army casualties while under fire. He is a much-tried doctor by the continual movement of the outfit due to the changing battle lines. Responsible for the dismantling and re- pitching of the tent hospital is Sergeant Orvil Statt (Keenan Wynn), a former circus roustabout. At first, Ruth is a bumbling addition to the nurse corps, but she attracts the attention of Jed immediately because of the needless risks she takes. Against her resilience, he continues with sequential passes. After seeing that he is beloved by the unit, she agrees to his advances. He later cautions her that he wants a \\"no strings\\" relationship. Ruth is warned by the other nurses of his womanizing ways, and that he is probably married. When she asks him if he has someone else back home, he refuses to answer, and they separate. When a young Korean child needs special care, Ruth entreats Jed to perform an open-heart operation, despite the reservations of the unit commander, Lieutenant Colonel Hilary Whalters (Robert Keith). Jed ends up saving the life of the child. Jed is a relentless taskmaster, demanding Captain John Rustford (William Campbell) to fly desperately needed blood supplies at night, even in the teeth of a fierce storm. After the helicopter lands safely, Jed goes on a binge, forcing Whalters to make his chief surgeon either straighten up or ship out. When a now more assured Ruth treats some North Korean prisoners, a frightened prisoner (Philip Ahn) with a concealed grenade is calmly disarmed by her soothing words and manner. After a North Korean advance forces the MASH unit to escape through enemy lines, the lovers are temporarily separated. When the unit's commander is wounded in an attack, Jed has to take command to lead the unit out of danger. Traveling cross- country, he sets out on a perilous journey, attempting to meet up with the nurses who have gone on ahead by rail to a preset rendezvous. Eventually the two caravans safely negotiate the battlefield, and Jed and Ruth are reunited.

According to Richard Brooks (in an interview filmed for the 1988 Bacall on Bogart documentary), Battle Circus was originally called MASH 66, a title rejected by MGM because the studio thought people would not understand the connection to a military hospital. The title of the film actually refers to the speed and ease with which a MASH unit, with its assemblage of tents, and portable equipment, can, like a circus, pick up stakes and move to where the action is. The film's technical advisor, Col. K. E. Van Buskirk, had commanded one of the first MASH units in Korea, and ensured that the MASH and aerial scenes were authentic.\\"Battle Circus.\\" Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: October 18, 2012. Brooks also noted that Bogart agreed to do the film because the script's humor, set in a story showing the tragedy of war, would make the film seem more realistic to an audience. Bogart was teamed with an old pal, Keenan Wynn and June Allyson who was also a friend.Allyson and Leighton 1982, pp. 62‚Äì63. Allyson was initially afraid of acting with Bogart, but her recent roles in light romantic comedy had typecast her and she was encouraged by the studio to attempt more serious fare. In retrospect, Bogart did not enjoy working on the film, the least of which was when he burned his left thumb, a scene that was left in the final production.Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 461. His $250,000 fee was the sole compensation. Bogart told Brooks, a close friend, \\"let's not make any more movies together.\\"Porter 2010, p. 493. Principal photography took place on location in Calabasas, California, and Camp Pickett, Virginia, where MASH units trained.

The film's sets were designed by the art director James Basevi. Box office and reception While commending Battle Circus for being a revealing and engrossing wartime drama, reviewers noted that the tepid love story distracted. The review in The New York Times read, Bob Thomas of the Associated Press wrote: \\"'Battle Circus' is a war story that has everything but a plot. The purpose of the film is noble enough: to show the operations of the mobile hospital units in Korea. This is done graphically and with a great deal of excitement. Unfortunately, the only semblance of a plot is a rather whimsical romance between Humphrey Bogart and June Allyson. It's a change of pace for Bogart, who is seldom required to be grim-faced and is actually likable. Little is required of Miss Allyson, but she displays moments of her unique charm.\\"Thomas, Bob. \\"Hollywood,\\" Associated Press. Archived in the Santa Cruz Sentinel (29 January 1953). A retrospective review in TV Guide noted, According to MGM records, the film earned $1,627,000 in the US and Canada and $735,000 overseas, resulting in a profit of $265,000.

He is the author of the book F√ºhrer Ex: Memoirs of a Former Neo-Nazi (with Tom Reiss, also made into a movie directed by ), which has been translated into several languages. Furthermore he was co- founder of the German EXIT project, which helps people leave the neo-Nazi community. The project is modeled on a Swedish project with the same name. Hasselbach's parents were two Communist-party loyal journalists. His mother was an editor at the ADN (\\"Allgemeiner Deutscher Nachrichtendienst\\", the former GDR's news service), while his father was employed at the broadcasting service in East Berlin. He was raised mostly with his grandparents. After graduating he began an apprenticeship to become a stonemason, but by 1985 he was subjected to legal censure because of rowdyism. His public appeal \\"The wall must fall!\\" brought him a prison sentence of nine months in 1987. In 1988 he joined the neo-Nazi community and was again legally censured for \\"subversive activities\\". After a first attempt to escape in August 1989 failed, he was detained again for three months until November 1989. Three days before the Berlin Wall fell a subsequent attempt to escape to West Germany succeeded. In the years after German reunification he took a leading position in many right-wing extremist organisations, including the \\"National Alternative\\" (Nationale Alternative), and the \\"Comradeship of Social- revolutionary Nationalists\\" (Kameradschaft Sozialrevolution√§re Nationalisten). Then in 1993 he decided to break with the right-wing extremism community. By this point in time he had spent three years of his life in prison (one of the charges being for incitement to violence).  Post neo-nazism activities  His acrimonious departure from the neo-Nazi community and the publication of his books, Die Abrechnung: Ein Neonazi steigt aus written with Winfried Bonengel in 1993 and F√ºhrer Ex written with Tom Reiss in 1996, caused his former comrades to send him a letter bomb disguised as a book, which package was opened by his mother, without however sustaining injury. Hasselbach then confessed his accumulated knowledge about the neo-Nazi community to the German Federal Criminal Police Office. He did not only incriminate others but also himself. In 1997 he was given a two-year suspended sentence for an admitted fire-bombing of a left-wing, alternative youth club. After 1995 he traveled quite often to the U.S. where he began to work as a journalist in the immediate aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, focusing on local extreme right-wing terrorism.\\"Extremism: A Global Network\\", New York Times, 26 April 1995 p. A25 This helped publicize the English version of his first book Die Abrechnung, F√ºhrer-Ex. Having finished his second book Die Bedrohung - mein Leben nach dem Ausstieg (The threat - my life after the dropout) in 1996, Hasselbach lived for some time in the U.S. and the U.K. and campaigned publicly for the abolition of the death penalty and had numerous articles published in the news media on that topic. Following that period up until 2000 he worked together with Winfried Bonengel on the script for the movie \\"F√ºhrer Ex\\", with premiered in German cinemas at the end of 2002. Today Hasselbach lives in Berlin and works as a freelance writer and journalist. He lives together with German Photographer .

It is a comparatively new approach to the task of exploring the multitude of relations and linkages science, technology, and innovation have among the general public. While earlier work in the discipline had focused on augmenting public knowledge of scientific topics, in line with the information deficit model of science communication, the discrediting of the model has led to an increased emphasis on how the public chooses to use scientific knowledge and on the development of interfaces to mediate between expert and lay understandings of an issue.  Major themes  The area integrates a series of fields and themes such as: * Science communication in the mass media, Internet, radio, films and television programmes * Science museums, aquaria, planetaria, zoological parks, botanical gardens, etc. * Public controversies over science and technology * Fixed and mobile science exhibits * Science festivals * Science fairs in schools and social groups * Science education for adults * Science and social movements * Media and science (medialisation of science) * Consumer education * Citizen science * Public tours of research and development (R&D;) parks, manufacturing companies, etc. * Science in popular culture * Science in text books and classrooms * Science and art How to raise public awareness and public understanding of science and technology, and how the public feels and knows about science in general, and specific subjects, such as genetic engineering, bioethics, etc., are important lines of research in this area. Professor of communication, Matthew Nisbet, points up the challenge, for example, in terms of the paradox of the success of science and engineering creating the conditions that have led to the trust or distrust of experts among certain populations and that the correlation appears to be more socioeconomic than religious or ideological. The Bodmer report The publication of the Royal Society's' report The Public Understanding of Science (or Bodmer Report) in 1985 is widely held to be the birth of the Public Understanding of Science movement in Britain.http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD004707.html The report led to the foundation of the Committee on the Public Understanding of Science and a cultural change in the attitude of scientists to outreach activities.  The contextualist model  In the 1990s, a new perspective emerged in the field with the classic study of Cumbrian Sheep Farmers' interaction with the Nuclear scientists in England, where Brian Wynne demonstrated how the experts were ignorant or disinterested in taking into account the lay knowledge of the sheep farmers while conducting field experiments on the impact of the Chernobyl Nuclear fall out on the sheep in the region. Because of this shortcoming from the side of the scientists, local farmers lost their trust in them. The experts were unaware of the local environmental conditions and the behaviour of sheep and this has eventually led to the failure of their experimental models. Following this study, scholars have studies similar micro-sociological contexts of expert-lay interaction and proposed that the context of knowledge communication is important to understand public engagement with science. Instead of large scale public opinion surveys, researchers proposed studies informed by Sociology of Scientific Knowledge (SSK). The contextualist model focuses on the social impediments in the bidirectional flow of scientific knowledge between experts and laypersons/communities.  The deliberative turn  The scholarly debate on public engagement with science developed further into analyzing the deliberations on science through various institutional forms, with the help of the theory of deliberative democracy. Public deliberation of and participation in science practiced through public spheres became a major emphasis. Scholars like Sheila Jasanoff argues for wider public deliberation on science in democratic societies which is a basic condition for decision making regarding science and technology. There are also attempts to develop more inclusive participatory models of technological governance in the form of consensus conferences, citizen juries, extended peer reviews, and deliberative mapping.  Measuring public understanding of science  Social scientists use various metrics to measure public understanding of science, including:  1. Factual knowledge  Examples of measurement = * Recognition: Answering a specific question by selecting the correct answer out a list *Cued Recall: Answering a specific question without a list of choices *Free Recall: After exposure to information, the study participant produces a list of as much of the information as they can remember = Key assumptions = * The more individual pieces of information a person is able to retrieve, the more that person is considered to have learned  2. Self-reported knowledge, perceived knowledge, or perceived familiarity  Examples of measurement = * Scaled survey responses to questions such as \\"How well informed you would say you are about this topic?\\" = Key assumptions = * Emphasizes the value of knowledge of one‚Äôs knowledge  3. Structural knowledge  The nature of connections among different pieces of information in memory = Examples of measurement = * Asking study participants to assess relationships among concepts. For example, participants free recall concepts onto the first row and column of a matrix, then indicate whether the concepts are related to each other by placing an ‚ÄúX‚Äù in the cell if they are not. Participants then rank the remaining open cells by their relatedness from 1 (only very weakly) to 7 (very strongly related) * Study participants answer questions designed to measure elaboration involved in a task, such as ‚ÄúI tried to relate the ideas I read about to my own past experiences‚Äù = Key Assumptions = * The use of elaboration increases the likelihood of remembering information  Mixed use of the three measures  * While some studies purport that factual and perceived knowledge can be viewed as the same construct, a 2012 study investigating public knowledge of nanotechnology supports separating their use in communications research, as they ‚Äúdo not reflect the same underlying knowledge structures.\\" Correlations between them were found to be low, and they were not predicted by the same factors. For example different types of science media use (television versus online) predicted different constructs * Factual knowledge has been shown to be empirically distinct from structural knowledge  Project examples  Government and private-led campaigns and events, such as Dana Foundation's \\"Brain Awareness Week,\\" are becoming a strong focus of programmes which try to promote public awareness of science. The UK PAWS Foundation dramatically went as far as establishing a Drama Fund with the BBC in 1994. The purpose was to encourage and support the creation of new drama for television, drawing on the world of science and technology. The Vega Science Trust was set up in 1994 to promote science through the media of television and the internet with the aim of giving scientists a platform from which to communicate to the general public. The Simonyi Professorship for the Public Understanding of Science chair at The University of Oxford was established in 1995 for the ethologist Richard Dawkins by an endowment from Charles Simonyi. Mathematician Marcus du Sautoy has held the chair since Dawkins' retirement in 2008. Similar professorships have since been created at other British universities. Professorships in the field have been held by well-known academics including Richard Fortey and Kathy Sykes at the University of Bristol, Brian Cox at Manchester University, Tanya Byron at Edge Hill University, Jim Al-Khalili at the University of Surrey and Alice Roberts at the University of Birmingham.

Professional wrestling career=Early career (1979-1982) Gilbert started wrestling in 1977 in the Memphis, Tennessee- based Continental Wrestling Association as \\"Tommy Gilbert Jr.\\" in honor of his father, Tommy Gilbert. In 1980, he and his father won the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship.  World Wrestling Federation (1982-1984)  He spent a little bit of time wrestling in the World Wrestling Federation as an enhancement talent in 1982, before being promoted to mid-card status. He continued to work his way up the card when he was legitimately injured seriously in a car accident in 1983. He spent several months recovering before returning to the ring; upon his return, he stated on television that WWF Champion Bob Backlund had been a tremendous inspiration to him. Gilbert continued wrestling for the WWF until 1984. Continental Wrestling Association (1984‚Äì1986) Later, he began making a name for himself as Eddie Gilbert in CWA in Memphis, Tennessee. He teamed with his father and Ricky Morton in those years. In addition, he formed a team with Tommy Rich as \\"Fargo's Fabulous Ones\\", an attempt by Mid-South (Memphis) to bury and still cash in on the fame attained by the previous incarnation of the Fabulous Ones, Steve Keirn and Stan Lane, who walked out of the territory after a dispute. They held the AWA Southern Tag Team titles in 1984 until dropping them to Phil Hickerson and the Spoiler (Frank Morrell). The duo would break up soon after, with Gilbert turning heel. The two had a brief but intense feud, which memorably began on television when the two were presented with a \\"Tag Team of the Year\\" award by announcer Lance Russell and two guests. Gilbert, unaware his former partner was at the taping, badmouthed Rich, then the International Heavyweight Champion, until Rich came out to confront him. Rich immediately got the upper hand, running Gibert into the steel ringpost several times, bloodying him in the process before the cameras went to a commercial. After the commercial break, Gilbert told Russell he wanted Rich to come back out so he could apologize to him in person, stating he was wrong for still being bitter about the break-up of the team, and was fueled by jealousy of Rich's championship title reign and new found star status. When Rich accepted Gilbert's apology, Gilbert suddenly turned on him and, in front of a stunned audience and a speechless Russell, rammed Rich's head into the ringpost, just as Rich had done to him moments earlier. Gilbert then made his way to Bill Watts' Mid-South territory. Universal Wrestling Federation (1986-1987) In 1986, Gilbert went to work for Bill Watts at Universal Wrestling Federation, Eddie added the \\"Hot Stuff\\" to his name. He started a heel stable of wrestlers called \\"Hot Stuff International, Inc.\\" and he managed it and wrestled. His stable included Sting, Ultimate Warrior and Rick Steiner before they were stars. He was always a ladies' man and he stole Missy Hyatt from John Tatum in 1987, with his stable being renamed \\"H & H International, Inc.\\" He married Hyatt in 1988. Iceman Parsons and Dick Murdoch would also join his stable later on at different times as well. Sting would eventually leave \\"Hot Stuff International, Inc.\\" and feud with them. Eddie also worked as a booker, who came up with the famous Battle of New Orleans angle in late-1987 involving Chris Adams, Terry Taylor, Sting, and himself. Following a match in which Taylor defeated Shane Douglas due to interference by both Gilbert and Rick Steiner, Adams told referee Randy Anderson of the interference. As Adams pleaded his case with Anderson, Gilbert and Taylor attacked him, and Sting eventually evened the sides. The angle eventually spilled outside the ring into the stands, and near the concession area, featuring a huge brawl involving beer kegs, chairs, trash cans, tables, popcorn machines and other objects. Gilbert was awarded Best Booker of 1988 by the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. He would stay with the Universal Wrestling Federation until the Purchase from Jim Crockett Promotions Continental Wrestling Federation (1988) From there, Gilbert worked in Alabama's Continental Wrestling Federation (CWF), where he reformed Hot Stuff Inc. Gilbert also served as booker, with Paul Heyman as his assistant. The CWF was broadcast nationally on the Financial News Network, and Gilbert's creative work was widely praised by wrestling journalists.Profile of Eddie Gilbert, part 1. EddieGilbert.com However, Gilbert left due to conflicts with management. Jim Crockett Promotions / NWA World Championship Wrestling (1988‚Äì1989) Gilbert went to the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) -- which had purchased the UWF‚Äîand brought Hyatt, Heyman and his brother Doug Gilbert with him. Eddie teamed with Rick Steiner to feud with Kevin Sullivan and his Varsity Club. He also became involved in a feud with Ric Flair and Barry Windham in which he teamed with Ricky Steamboat and Lex Luger. Near the end of his stint there, JCP was renamed World Championship Wrestling, and Gilbert was featured in the first WCW video game. USWA and various promotions (1989‚Äì1995) Eddie left WCW in late 1989 and also divorced Hyatt. He went back to the independents where he could book again. He worked for the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) in Memphis (where he feuded with Jerry Lawler) and the Global Wrestling Federation (GWF), as well as Philadelphia's Tri-State Wrestling Alliance promotion. Gilbert also married Madusa at this time after having hit it off with Madusa on TWA promoter Joel Goodhart's radio show, but the marriage was brief. Gilbert's most famous feud in the Memphis territory involved an angle between himself and Lawler in 1990. Eddie and his brother Doug were \\"fired\\" from the promotion, and in retaliation hit Lawler with their car and fled the scene. Numerous home viewers, fearing for Lawler, immediately called the police to report what they had just seen as a legitimate vehicular assault. Lawler had to inform the police what was going on and Lawler was forced to appear on television (while selling his \\"injuries\\") sooner than intended out of concern that Gilbert would have been legitimately arrested if he didn't show on TV that he was all right. Gilbert quit the USWA in January 1991. The on air story was that he had chose to leave the promotion rather than be injured by Jim Cornette, Stan Lane, and Steve Keirn. Due to a pay dispute, Gilbert, along with his brother Doug (who wrestled under a mask as the Dark Patriot) left the GWF in 1992. Eddie Gilbert took with him the GWF North American Heavyweight Championship belt. He made a few defenses of the title in the USWA as the GWF World Heavyweight champion, despite being stripped of the belt and not being recognized as such by the GWF. He wrestled in (and booked) the successor to Tri-State Wrestling. Gilbert then returned to the USWA until early 1995 when he worked one night for Smoky Mountain Wrestling before traveling to World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico to wrestle and book. NWA Eastern Championship Wrestling (1993) In 1993 he wrestled for NWA Eastern Championship Wrestling, where he again teamed with Doug. He also served as head booker, but gave up his position in September 1993 to Paul Heyman, who eventually took the company national under the name Extreme Championship Wrestling. He would have a feud with Terry Funk. Looking For Mr. Gilbert Shoot Interview In early 1994, Gilbert sat down with Bob Barnett and conducted a filmed shoot interview titled \\"Looking For Mr. Gilbert.\\" Gilbert spoke openly about his life and career at a time when professional wrestlers rarely appeared on film out of character and almost never spoke publicly about the behind-the-scenes machinations of the wrestling business. The footage from the interview was later marketed on home video and sold through wrestling newsletters, as well as at independent wrestling shows, the first of its kind. \\"Looking For Mr. Gilbert\\" is now considered the first professional wrestling \\"shoot video\\", and in the decades since, countless professional wrestlers have conducted sit-down shoot interviews, most notably in RF Video's Shoot Interview series and Kayfabe Commentaries' YouShoot interview series. Personal life Gilbert married wrestling valet Missy Hyatt in October 1987. The couple divorced in 1989. Gilbert was also briefly married to Debrah \\"Madusa\\" Miceli in 1992. Death On February 18, 1995, Gilbert died of a heart attack in his apartment in Isla Verde, Puerto Rico. Ken Wayne and Jason The Terrible found Gilbert in his apartment. His father, Tommy Gilbert, stated that injuries to Eddie's chest and heart muscle had occurred in a serious car crash in 1983 and could have been a factor; Eddie's alleged use of painkillers since the accident could also have contributed to his heart condition.

Summary  The narrator questions where the waterfowl is going and questions his motives for flying. He warns the waterfowl that he could possibly find danger, traveling alone. But this waterfowl is not alone; it is being led by some Power. As the waterfowl disappears out of the narrator's sight, the narrator reflects on God's guidance in his own life. The narrator is sure that God has led this waterfowl, and that the waterfowl had faith in the narrator. Now, the narrator's faith is strengthened. He knows that God is guiding him as well.Cummings, Michael J. \\"To a Waterfowl.\\" Cummings Study Guides N.p., 2008. Web. 8 Feb. 2010. . As the narrator sees God directing the waterfowl, the narrator is reminded of God's guidance in his own life. Through his observance in nature, the narrator is reconnected with his faith in God.Cummings, Michael J. \\"To a Waterfowl.\\" Cummings Study Guides N.p., 2008. Web. 8 Feb. 2010. ./  Analysis  \\"To a Waterfowl\\" is written in iambic trimeter and iambic pentameter, consisting of eight stanzas of four lines. The poem represents early stages of American Romanticism through celebration of Nature and God's presence within Nature. Bryant is acknowledged as skillful at depicting American scenery but his natural details are often combined with a universal moral, as in \\"To a Waterfowl\\".Ruland, Richard and Malcolm Bradbury.

The duck, flying across the sunset, seemed to Bryant as solitary a soul as himself, inspiring him to write the poem that evening.The American Spirit in Literature: A Chronicle of Great Interpreters, Bliss Perry, Yale University Press, 1918 \\"To a Waterfowl\\" was first published in the North American Review in Volume 6, Issue 18, March 1818.The chronology of American literature: America's literary achievements from the colonial era to modern times, Daniel S.

Established in 1929 after the closure of the Guelph Radial Railway Company streetcar lines, Guelph Transit has grown to comprise over 70 buses serving 28 transit routes. The main terminus is located downtown at Guelph Central Station and at University of Guelph, with a smaller facility at Stone Road Mall and SmartCentres on Woodlawn Road. GO Transit buses and trains on the Kitchener corridor and Via Rail also stop at Guelph Central Station. Greyhound Bus service provides regional bus service as well. History The City of Guelph is located approximately west of Toronto. Nicknamed the Royal City (reflecting the House of Hanover, known in its native Germany as the House of Welf), Guelph's street railway operated from 1895 until 1939 along five routes. It was also the western terminus of the Guelph line of the Toronto Suburban Railway. Street railway By the late 19th century, Guelph had become such a size that public transportation had pretty much become a necessity. Serious discussion concerning a street railway began in 1875, and the Guelph Street Railway Company was formed in 1877. The company failed to get a franchise for its proposed horse-car line, and the idea was abandoned. =The Sleeman line= In 1894, Guelph City Council granted a street railway franchise to local businessman George Sleeman for a term of twenty years, for which the Guelph Railway Company was incorporated in April 1895. Construction began immediately thereafter, using 56 pound rail. The initial route of the GRC was south along Woolwich Street, through the downtown and along Dundas Road, with a second line running from the Sleeman owned Silvercreek Brewery on Waterloo Avenue, to the Canadian Pacific and Grand Trunk (later Canadian National) Railway stations. Total distance of these two lines was approximately . Electrical equipment for 600 volt operation, three closed and two open cars were supplied by the Canadian General Electric Company. A stone car-barn and powerhouse were also built. The carbarn later served as the garage for the Guelph Transportation Commission buses until the 1970s, and still stands today at 371 Waterloo Avenue. Sleeman operated a brewery on Waterloo Avenue and expected that his employees would travel back and forth to work on his system. He also built a skating rink and park behind his brewery. Operation began on September 17, 1895, with 20 minute service being provided between 5 am and 11 pm, Monday to Saturday. New lines were soon built including Suffolk, added in 1896, O.A.C (Ontario Agricultural College) in 1902 and York Road in 1911. The Company's charter was extended in 1901 to provide for a line to be constructed to Hespeler, forming a loop line with Puslinch Lake. =Guelph Radial Railway= George Sleeman continued to own the line until late 1902 when control passed to the Bank of Montreal and the Traders Bank of Canada. The name of the company was also changed to the Guelph Radial Railway Company, with authority to build lines to Mount Forest, Erin, Galt and Preston, but none of these lines were ever built. The City of Guelph was also authorized to acquire the company, which it subsequently did,1903 Act, s. 37 with related legislation being passed in 1905. Ridership doubled between 1902 and 1906 resulting in more rolling stock being purchased in 1906 and again in 1911. In 1903, the city of Guelph purchased the street railway for $78,000, which included eight miles of track, eight closed and three open cars. Freight service had been introduced in 1900 using a small four-wheel locomotive, with traffic being interchanged with the Grand Trunk Railway. This business increased to a point where in 1911 a new 27-short ton locomotive, #26, was purchased from Preston Car & Coach, along with two 2-truck 'Prairie' type streetcars, #60 and #70. In 1913, another 'Prairie' car, #80, was added with two more, #90 and #100, being acquired in 1914. The Prairie cars were in length and were double ended. All five 'Prairie' cars were transferred to the Toronto and York Radial Railway in 1925 and renumbered 151 to 155. A second freight interchange was added on Suffolk Street in 1915 and a connection was made with the new Toronto Suburban Railway line in 1917. =Ontario Hydro= Both the Canadian Pacific Railway and Ontario Hydro made offers to buy the Guelph system. Ontario Hydro won out and took title to the Railway, under the name Ontario Hydro Electric Railways-Guelph District, on May 21, 1921. Some lines were rebuilt and some extended, and Sunday service began July 25, 1921. Seven single-truck Birney cars numbered 219 to 225 were acquired in 1922. These were built by Canadian Brill at the former Preston Car & Coach plant in nearby Preston, Ontario. The first bus, a 29-seat Gotfredson, was placed in service in 1926 on Eramosa Road. This service was discontinued on October 31, 1927, due to significant losses, however, the service was reinstated the following year with a smaller bus. A second bus was used when streetcar tracks were under repair. Operating losses began to climb beginning in 1927. The Suffolk line was removed in 1929 due to its poor condition and the cost of rebuilding, being replaced by bus service. In 1926, Ontario Hydro tried to sell the system back to the City of Guelph, but were refused. Finally, in June 1937, City Council recommended the discontinuance of the streetcars, September 30, 1937, being the final day of operation, buses replacing them the next day. In 1939, the Ontario Legislature passed an Act transferring the system to the newly created Guelph Transportation Commission (now called Guelph Transit). Electric freight service continued to operate until May 26, 1939.Guelph Radial Railway Bus service to the present day Guelph Transit has bus routes that cover the entire city. Sunday service was added in 2001, new routes were added over the last five years. Guelph Transit's garage and other city works moved from Waterloo Avenue to 12 Municipal Street in the 1970s . In the late 1990s, a new transit facility was constructed on Watson Road. On June 20, 2007, Guelph Transit launched a web-based system known as Next Bus. Global positioning system (GPS) technology and advanced computer modelling allow riders to receive accurate, real-time arrival and departure information via the Internet, handheld devices (including Palms, Blackberries, and Web-capable cellular phones), or their telephones. This system has proven frustrating to some Guelph residents, as Guelph Transit no longer posted paper copies of bus arrival times at bus stops; a user standing at a bus stop without a cell phone had no way of determining when the next bus would arrive. Additionally, the system's predictions have been known to be wildly inaccurate.thecannon.ca The new system features web-based map displays with local streets and routes, and real-time information available on the web. It will also incorporate dynamic transit display signs at key locations around the city. One such sign is already in place at Stone Road Mall. However, the service is limited in that the time displayed is linked to the scheduled arrival on the applicable timetable, not the anticipated arrival based upon the current location of the bus. Guelph Transit added holiday service in 2007 as well as additional routes serving the south end of the city. Services on these routes (56, 57, and 58) were suspended in April 2008, and the 54 Arkell route was extended to St Georges Square in July 2008. In 2009 and 2010 Guelph Transit and Dillon Consulting developed a new Transit Growth Strategy and Plan for transit and mobility services. As identified in the 2010 budget, Guelph Transit is modifying frequency and service hours in order to achieve targeted savings. These savings will be realized by shifting from a 20-minute service frequency to a 30-minute frequency in June, July, and August. Holiday service has also been cancelled for 2010. On January 1, 2012, Guelph Transit launched a complete new system of routes and schedules to accommodate a growing demand for change within the transit system. The system includes new transfer points at Guelph Central Station and the University of Guelph. During peak service times, buses run on a 20-minute schedule. During non-peak service times, including Saturday and Sunday, service will continue to run on a 30-minute schedule. In December 2019, Guelph Transit announces that it will be launching a reloadable fare card (the OnYourWay card) in plans to phase out paper tickets. The system was launched on January 7th, 2020 and OnYourWay cards were given to transit users for free until May 1st, 2020, after which they are sold for $5.00. Cardholders are expected to pay when boarding the bus (at the front entrance) using a contactless card reader. The OnYourWay card can be loaded with money either through Guelph Transit's online portal or in person at one of the City of Guelph facilities listed on Guelph Transit's website. The OnYourWay card also provides transit users with balance protection in the event the card is lost or stolen. Guelph Transit has not yet announced any timeline of when it will stop accepting cash or ticket fares.  Future plans  In January 2020, The City of Guelph announced that it will be investing $177 million to purchase 67 electric transit busses and build a new bus storage facility. Guelph has received financial assistance from both provincial and federal governments. Federal Infrastructure Minister Catherine McKenna announced that The Government of Canada's contribution to the project will be $41 million, while the province of Ontario is expected to provide $35 million. The new fleet is expected to replace 30 existing diesel busses. The new bus storage facility will have the capacity for 200 busses and each parking space will be equipped with a charging apparatus. In addition, the city announced that select bus stops will also be fitted with bus charging stations. The City of Guelph has not yet provided a timeline for this project, nor has it specified from which bus manufacturer(s) the vehicles will be purchased from. Central Station Work was underway to convert the Guelph Central Station and current Greyhound Bus Terminal into a Regional Transit Facility by 2014. The terminal opened up to Guelph Transit Buses in May 2012. The opening of the bus portion of the station was delayed from October 2011 to May 2012 to allow time for the renovations of the railway station building to be completed. Additional renovations, with a $2.1 million budget, were completed in 2016-2017. The work also helped to preserve and restore heritage characteristics.http://stevenpetric.com/guelph-central-station-building-to-be- renovated/ The following is an April 2017 summary of the operations: \\"Guelph Central Train Station is a busy transit hub that accommodates Guelph Transit, GO Transit, Via Rail and Greyhound Canada operations. Each weekday, more than 5,000 passengers board Guelph Transit, to travel on one of the 15 different routes that operate out of the bus bays adjacent to the train station. In September 2016, Guelph Transit began offering early morning shuttle service for those connecting with early GO Trains. PRESTO cards could be used as a co- fare through all of the hours of GO service in Guelph.http://stevenpetric.com/guelph-transit-offers-earlier-morning-service- to-connect-with-go-train-as-well-as-co-fare-rate/ In September 2017, Guelph Transit realigned the bus routes and schedules around the 99 Mainline, which provides bus service every 10 minutes weekdays, every 15 minutes between Guelph Central Station and Clair Road and every 30 minutes from Guelph Central Station to SmartCentres on Woodlawn Road.http://guelph.ca/2017/08/passenger- input-ridership-data-drive-transit-route-changes/ Conventional Routes Maps & schedules Routes as of September 3, 2017: *1 Edinburgh College *2 College Edinburgh *3 Westmount *4 York Road *5 Goodwin *6 Harvard Ironwood *7 Kortright Downey *8 Stone Road Mall *9 Waterloo *10 Imperial *11 Willow West *12 General Hospital *13 Victoria Road Recreation Centre *14 Grange *15 University/College *16 Southgate *17 Woodlawn Watson *18 Watson Woodlawn *20 Northwest Industrial *99 Mainline *Community Bus North *Community Bus South Express Routes *40 Scottsdale Express University Routes *50 U Stone *51 U Janefield *52 U Kortright *56 U Colonial *57 U Ironwood *58 U Edinburgh *59 U Gordon Express Special Routes *Metro (Every second Tuesday) *Guelph Transit GO Shuttle Service Guelph Transit Bus Shuttle Service Late Night Bus Service Guelph Transit, in partnership with the Central Students Association at the University of Guelph, operate several late night drop-off only routes from the University Centre once regular bus service has ended.

Each circular brown structure is an individual sorus. A sorus (pl. sori) is a cluster of sporangia (structures producing and containing spores) in ferns and fungi. This New Latin word is from Ancient Greek œÉœâœÅœåœÇ (s≈çr√≥s 'stack, pile, heap'). In lichens and other fungi, the sorus is surrounded by an external layer. In some red algae, it may take the form of depression into the thallus. In ferns, the sori form a yellowish or brownish mass on the edge or underside of a fertile frond. In some species, they are protected during development by a scale or film of tissue called the indusium, which forms an umbrella-like cover. Sori occur on the sporophyte generation, the sporangia within producing haploid meiospores. As the sporangia mature, the indusium shrivels so that spore release is unimpeded. The sporangia then burst and release the spores. The shape, arrangement, and location of the sori are often valuable clues in the identification of fern taxa. Sori may be circular or linear. They may be arranged in rows, either parallel or oblique to the costa, or randomly. Their location may be marginal or set away from the margin on the frond lamina. The presence or absence of indusium is also used to identify fern taxa.

It instituted a number of far-reaching reforms in the process of electing popes. It set the maximum number of electors at 120 and restated in a more formal context the rule he had already instituted that cardinals over the age of 80 not participate in electing a pope.  Provisions  In November 1970 in Ingravescentem aetatem Pope Paul had prohibited cardinals over the age of eighty from participating in a Papal conclave to elect a pope. This new apostolic constitution incorporated that rule in the context of setting out regulations for the organization of a conclave. In March 1973, during a consistory to create new cardinals, Pope Paul had discussed plans to modify procedures for papal elections, including limiting the number of electors to 120 and adding as voters the patriarchs of the Eastern Rite churches, even if not cardinals, and the leadership of the Synod of Bishops. He abandoned all of those ideas except one, and in this apostolic constitution set the maximum number of cardinal electors at 120. When his 80-year-old limit had taken effect on 1 January 1971, there were 102 cardinals eligible to participate in a conclave. Pope Paul also imposed strict regulations on the physical organization of a conclave, including a requirement that the windows of the Sistine Chapel be boarded up. Cardinals found the restrictions excessive during the two conclaves of 1978 and Pope John Paul II dropped them in his 1996 apostolic constitution Universi Dominici gregis (1996). Pope Paul had been crowned in June 1963 following his election but abandoned the wearing of a papal tiara in November 1964. Nevertheless, in this apostolic constitution he wrote that a coronation would follow the election. His immediate successors John Paul I and John Paul II, chose not to be crownedHomily of His Holiness Pope John Paul II for the inauguration of his pontificate and the latter made no mention of a coronation when he revised the election process in 1996.

Its daytime power is 25,000 watts, which is reduced to 5,000 watts at night. The station's studios are located in the Victory Park district in Dallas, just north of downtown, and the transmitter site is in Coppell. The station is currently owned by Cumulus Media. KTCK's programs are simulcast at 96.7 MHz over KTCK-FM, licensed to Flower Mound, Texas. KTCK's current call letters and format only date back to 1994. However it is one of the oldest radio stations, including the oldest in Texas, having received its first broadcasting license, as WRR, in March 1922. In addition, prior to its first broadcasting license, WRR was issued an initial transmitting authorization in the summer of 1921, and the station evolved from even earlier work conducted by the Dallas Police Department. Station origin The genesis of what would become WRR began through the efforts of local amateur radio enthusiasts belonging to the Dallas Radio Club, in conjunction with Henry \\"Dad\\" Garrett, who was Dallas' superintendent of police and fire signals. Inspired by activities at the New York City police department, Frank M. Corlett, a local district manager for the American Radio Relay League, approached the Dallas police about setting up something similar.\\"Running Down Law Breakers by Radio\\" by Fred C. Kelly, Popular Radio, June 1922, page 81.A History of Station WRR: Pioneer in Municipally Owned Radio by Robin Leslie Sachs (thesis), May 1978, page 18. A short notice in the December 28, 1920, edition of The Dallas Morning News stated that Corlett was developing a system in cooperation with Police Commissioner L. E. McGee which would be used to \\"notify the near-by police of the escape of prisoners and to give a description of suspects fleeing from Dallas.\\"\\"Working Out Details for Police Wireless\\", Dallas Morning News, December 28, 1920, page 12. In early February, it was announced that the plan was now operational, consisting of nightly transmissions between 7 and 10 o'clock. The primary outlet was Corlett's Special Amateur station, 5ZC,The \\"5\\" in 5ZC's call sign indicated that the station was located in the Fifth Radio Inspection District, while the \\"Z\\" specified that it was operating under a \\"Special Amateur\\" license.

Two alternate sites were included: Bennett Emerson's Special Amateur station, 5ZG, located at 3720 Wendelkin Street, and John Dorea's station, 5JG, at 117 West Twelfth Street.\\"Police Wireless System Installed\\", Dallas Morning News, February 3, 1921, page 9. In early June 1921, it was again announced that the daily police bulletin transmissions had been inaugurated by Corlett and Emerson.\\"First Radio Bulletin is Sent From Police Station\\", Dallas Morning News, June 5, 1921, page 4. \\"Dad\\" Garrett was also involved in the developmental work. Garrett had had an early interest in radio communication. In 1912, a fire broke out that was being dealt with by a majority of the fire department. Meanwhile, a second major blaze occurred, but because the telephone lines were down, there was a delay in alerting crews at the site of the need to deal with the second emergency. Radio was still an unperfected technology, but Garrett recognized its future potential for speeding up communication during emergencies. In May 1921, it was reported that he had installed on a fire truck a radio receiver constructed by Corlett and had successfully received transmissions sent by Emerson and Garrett's son, Charles Garrett.\\"Portable Wireless Tests Get Excellent Results\\", Dallas Morning News, May 18, 1921, page 2. WRR Sunday Magazine article in the August 7, 1921 issue of The Dallas Morning News reviewed the police radiotelephone station that had just been licensed as WRR.\\"The Long Arm of the Dallas Police\\" by P. V. Keating, Dallas Morning News, Sunday Magazine, August 7, 1921, page 1.In July 1921, Bennett Emerson sold his transmitting equipment to the city for $250, and it was installed on the second floor of the Central Fire Station at 2012 Main Street, where it came under the oversight of \\"Dad\\" Garrett.Sachs, pages 18-19. On August 5, 1921, a Limited Commercial license with the randomly assigned call letters WRR was issued to \\"City of Dallas (Police and Fire Signal Dept.)\\", which authorized transmissions on the wavelengths of 400, 450 and 500 meters (750, 667 and 600 kHz),\\"New Stations: Commercial Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, September 1, 1921. Beginning with the introduction of U.S. radio station licensing in late 1912, it had been the practice to assign call signs starting with \\"K\\" in the west and \\"W\\" in the east. The original boundary line was located along the Texas-New Mexico border, and it wasn't until the shift in early 1923 to the Mississippi River that new Texas stations received K instead of W call signs. for communication with \\"Police and Fire Signal portable stations, general communication and broadcasting with amateur stations\\".WRR August 5, 1921 license, Limited Commercial license, serial #213, issued to the City of Dallas Police and Fire Signal Department for a one year period. An early review of the new station noted that in addition to broadcasting police reports, it had been used for a two-way conversation between the Chief of Detectives in Dallas and Houston. WRR soon expanded its offerings beyond police and fire reports. In mid- December, it ran a telephone line to the local First Baptist Church's auditorium in order to broadcast Dr. George Truett's Sunday services.\\"Dr. Truett's Father Hears Sermon Over Radio at Whitewright\\", Dallas Morning News, December 18, 1921, Part 3, page 3. By early February 1922 the station's daily schedule included entertainment programs, featuring sports reports and weather forecasts, plus piano, vocal and saxophone solos.\\"Schedule is Adopted on Radio News From Dallas\\", Dallas Morning News, February 3, 1922, page 4. \\"Dad\\" Garrett's assistant, Lynn B. Henson, took on the majority of the responsibility for running the station. From 1912 to 1927, the Department of Commerce regulated U.S. radio, and initially, there were no specific restrictions on stations broadcasting entertainment to the general public. The first formal standards were adopted effective December 1, 1921, which specified that broadcasting stations had to hold a Limited Commercial license that also authorized operation on the \\"entertainment\\" wavelength of 360 meters (833 kHz) or the \\"market and weather reports\\" wavelength of 485 meters (619 kHz).\\"Amendments to Regulations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 10. At the time this regulation was adopted a small number of stations already met the new requirements, although this did not include WRR, whose current Limited Commercial license did not have an assignment for either of the broadcasting wavelengths, and as of late January 1922 the station was reported to be broadcasting on 450 meters.\\"Radiomania Epidemic Spreads Rapidly Over Dallas and State of Texas\\" by Eugene Travis, Dallas Morning News, January 22, 1922, Part 1, page 15. In early February 1922, WRR was reported to now be on 360 meters, but it wasn't until March 13, 1922 that the station was issued a new Limited Commercial license that included an authorization to use both broadcasting wavelengths.WRR March 13, 1922 license Limited Commercial license, serial #213, issued to the City of Dallas on March 13, 1922 for a 3 month period for broadcasting on 360 and 485 meters. For this reason the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) records generally list March 13, 1922, as WRR's \\"Date First Licensed\\".\\"Date First Licensed\\", FCC History Cards for WRR/KAAM, card #1. In early April 1922, as WRR's focus turned toward general broadcasting, a second transmitter was installed, operating on 200 meters (1500 kHz) under the call sign of 5ZAQ, which took over the broadcasting of fire signals.\\"Fire Signals Broadcast\\", Dallas Morning News, April 4, 1922, page 21. The common use of 360 meters led to some unique cooperative experiments, including a June 1922 wedding where the three main participants were located at different radio station studios, with the groom broadcasting his responses over WRR, the bride's from WDAO (a short-lived station operated by the Automotive Electric Company), and the minister officiating through the Dallas Morning News' WFAA (now KLIF (AM)).\\"Wireless Wedding is Performed by Aid of 3 Stations\\", Dallas Morning News, July 1, 1922, page 5. On June 29, 1922, a cooperative radio wedding had the groom at WRR, the bride at WDAO, and the minister at WFAA.\\"Getting Married on the Radio ‚Äî 1922\\" by Paula Bosse, December 12, 2014. (flashbackdallas.com) As additional broadcasting stations were established, the joint use of 360 meters led to the need to develop timesharing agreements between the stations to avoid interference. By early July there were five local stations ‚Äî three in Dallas and two in Fort Worth ‚Äî and an agreement was concluded which allocated timeslots for the period from 8:45 A.M. to 10:00 P.M. on weekdays, and from 11:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M. on Sundays. Under this plan, WRR's weekday assignments included \\"Weather forecast on 485 meters. Lecture and music on 360\\" from 12:00 noon-12:30, \\"Baseball, markets, music\\" from 3:00-3:30, \\"Police bulletins\\" from 7:00-7:15, and music from 8:30-9:00. Its Sunday schedule consisted of police bulletins at 7:00 P.M., followed by a church service at 8:00.\\"New Broadcasting Schedule Adopted\\", Dallas Morning News, July 9, 1922, Part 1, page 14. By the end of 1922, the number of broadcasting stations licensed in the United States had ballooned to over 500. WRR stood out as one of fewer than ten stations operated by a municipality. In 1925, it was decided that the city could not afford the expense of operating a radio station, and WRR's license was allowed to lapse, leading to its deletion in late July. However, a committee of civic leaders, headed by Edwin J. Kiest, the owner of the Dallas Times Herald, and George B. Dealy, President of the Dallas Morning News, raised the funds needed to revive the station, which was relicensed in October.Sachs, page 22. Beginning in the mid-1920s, WRR started accepting advertising. The station became financially self-supporting and began providing surplus funds to the city government. Over the years, the number of available transmitting frequencies was expanded. The Department of Commerce and, beginning in 1927, the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) worked to accommodate a growing number of stations, and WRR experienced a series of frequency reassignments. In late 1928, under the provisions of a major reallocation resulting from the FRC's General Order 40, WRR was assigned to full-time operation using 500 watts on a \\"regional\\" frequency, 1280 kHz. On March 29, 1941, implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement resulted in all the stations on 1280 being shifted to 1310 kHz, which has been the dial position of WRR and its successors ever since. In 1948, WRR launched an FM station, which was assigned the call letters WRR-FM. Initially WRR provided more popular programming, while the FM station featured classical music.Sachs, pages 35-36. In 1975, WRR became the first station in the Dallas/Fort Worth area to adopt an all-news format when it became affiliated with NBC's new \\"News and Information Service\\" network. It continued with this format even after NBC ended the service in 1977.Sachs, pages 91-92. The Dallas government eventually decided to sell WRR while retaining WRR-FM, so after nearly 57 years ownership of the station was transferred to the Bonneville International Corporation in early 1978. KAAM Concurrent with the station sale, the call letters were changed as the station became the first of several incarnations of KAAM when it was owned by the same company that owned KAFM (92.5 MHz). KAAM dropped the all-news format and featured a variety of musical formats. KTCK \\"The Ticket\\" Reporting from a 2014 Dallas Stars fan-event at the Galleria Dallas In 1994, the station was sold to Cardinal Communications, which changed the call letters to KTCK and adopted a sports talk format as \\"The Ticket\\".\\"Bonneville Wasn't Looking to Sell Texas Station, Executive Says\\" by Lynn Arave, Deseret News, December 15, 1993. The Ticket's original lineup consisted of Skip Bayless, Curt Menefee, Mike Rhyner and Greg Williams, Chuck Cooperstein, and George Dunham and Craig Miller. Bayless was the first host to inaugurate the station's sports format. The Hardline (now with Mike Rhyner and Corby Davidson) and the Dunham and Miller Show have been part of the station's offerings since the introduction of \\"The Ticket\\" format.

As part of this transaction, it was necessary for Cumulus to divest one of its FM stations, due to limits on the number of stations an individual entity can control in a given market. The deal was to take effect once Cumulus completed the transfer of KTDK 104.1 in Sanger, which had been simulcasting KTCK, to Whitley Media.\\"Cumulus to LMA ESPN 103.3 Dallas\\" by Lance Venta, October 4, 2013 (radioinsight.com) However, the FCC disallowed the Whitley Media transfer, labeling it a straw purchase in which Cumulus would remain the de facto owner of the station, so Cumulus instead surrendered KTDK's license for cancelation.\\"104.1 KTDK To Be Restored?\\" by Lance Venta, October 29, 2013 (radioinsight.com) On October 7, 2013, it was announced that The Ticket would begin simulcasting on 96.7 FM, a station which, as WBAP-FM, had been simulcasting WBAP News/Talk 820 AM.

Of Pittsburgh's three losses, Friend was on the hook for two, racking up a 13.50 ERA over his three appearances. Friend led the NL in losses for the second time in 1961, going 14-19 with a 3.85 ERA (his win total ranked him 10th in the league). He started 35 games (NL fourth), completing 10 and using 236 innings (NL 10th). He was undefeated through his first five starts (4-0, 3.20). This includes his start on April 19, when he defeated the Cubs, 4-1, allowing three hits and striking out seven. The Pirates regressed to 75-79, finishing a distant sixth in the eight- team National League. In 1962, Friend went 18-14 (NL seventh in wins) with a 3.06 ERA (NL ninth) and a league-leading five shutouts. He had a 5.9 pWAR (NL fourth) with 13 complete games (NL ninth). His .984 fielding percentage at the position ranked him fourth in the NL. On opening day, April 10, he tossed a 6-0 shutout against the Phillies, allowing a walk with five hits while striking out five. On August 20, he blanked the expansion New York Mets, 2-0, whiffing six with two walks and four hits. Pittsburgh went 93-68, finishing in fourth place eight games behind the pennant-winning San Francisco Giants. In 1963 Friend went 17-16 (NL ninth in wins) with career bests in ERA, 2.34 (NL third), H/9, at 7.9 (NL sixth), and WHIP, a 1.042 (NL fifth). He had a 5.8 pWAR (NL fourth). He defeated the Mets, 10-1 on June 1, striking out eight and allowing two hits. The run was unearned. At 74-88, the Pirates were the only non-expansion team to register a record below .500, placing in eighth. Friend completed 13 (NL ninth) of 35 starts (NL seventh) with three shutouts (NL 10th), posting a 13-18 record with a 3.33 ERA in 1964. As in eight of the prior nine seasons, he ranked in the NL top ten in batters faced and in innings pitched. He went the distance on July 15 in a 3-0 shutout over the Phillies, allowing seven hits and striking out four. The Pirates finished tied for sixth at 80-82, 13 games behind pennant-winning St. Louis. 1965 marked the end of Friend's tenure in Pittsburgh, a season in which he went 8-12 with a 3.24 ERA over 34 starts. On July 23, he beat the Cubs 6-0, allowing a walk and two hits for his fifth win of the season. Pittsburgh closed out Friend's stay with a strong 90-72 campaign, seven games back of the Dodgers. Friend played one more major league season, splitting the year between the two New York clubs. He went 1-4, 4.84 with the Yankees and 5-8, 4.40 with the Mets. Friend wore #19 for the Yankees. After he was traded to the Mets, Fritz Peterson took over his uniform number. In 15 full seasons with the Pirates, Friend finished 27 games below .500 on a team that went 1066‚Äì1285. Although never considered a Hall of Fame-caliber pitcher, with Vernon Law, especially in 1960, he was considered part of the best 1-2 combination in baseball, with Friend #2. Personal life and death In 1957, Friend married Patricia Koval, a nurse in the office of the Pirates' team doctor. They have two children; son Bob Friend Jr. is a retired professional golfer who played on the PGA Tour. Friend served as controller of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania from 1967 to 1975. In 1976, he joined an insurance brokerage, eventually becoming a vice president. He was a three-time delegate to the Republican National Convention. He was a Freemason. Friend died unexpectedly at his home in O'Hara Township, outside of Pittsburgh on February 3, 2019 from cardiac arrest at the age of 88.

The game was released on May 31, 2005 for Xbox and on August 9, 2005 for Microsoft Windows. Its story was created by Donald and Geremy Mustard and featured a script written by science fiction writers Orson Scott Card and Cameron Dayton; the full orchestral soundtrack was done by Tommy Tallarico and Emmanuel Fratianni. As of September 14, 2006, Steam began offering Advent Rising for download. Much- hyped Advent Rising was the first in a planned trilogy which also saw the development of a game that would take place alongside Advent Rising, called Advent Shadow for the PSP. Despite a large advertising campaign including promotion in cinemas, the game's retail performance fell far short of expectations. By the end of 2005, Majesco had completely revised its business plan to focus towards handheld games and canceled plans for future Advent Rising games. A five-issue spin-off comic book series was produced and ran from October 2005 to November 2006. Plans for novel tie-ins by Orson Scott Card never came to fruition. In June 2006, Donald Mustard posted a statement on the website of his new venture, Chair Entertainment, stating that he \\"would be happy to finish the Advent series if the opportunity presented itself\\", but confirmed he does not currently hold the rights to do so. In 2008, Novint announced they are adding Novint Falcon support to this game and will sell it as Ascension Reborn for the Novint Falcon only.NOVINT official Website Plot=Story The game begins with Gideon Wyeth; the protagonist, escorting a group of human ambassadors from a space station to a meeting with an alien race called the Aurelians. At the meeting, the Aurelians tell the humans that they view them as gods and then warn them of another race of aliens called the Seekers who intend to destroy all humanity. Shortly thereafter, the space station is attacked by the Seekers. Gideon manages to board an escape pod and lands on the planet Edumea below. On the planet, Gideon aids the Marines in their battle against the Seekers, but soon learns that the planet will shortly be destroyed by a meteor shower. The planet is evacuated, and Gideon accepts an invitation from the Aurelians to board their ship. After learning that humans have untapped mystical powers, he begins training with the Aurelians. As Gideon is training, the ship is attacked by the Seekers. Gideon and some of the Aurelians evacuate to the Seeker vessel, though it is on a crash course with the Aurelian homeworld. Gideon and the remaining Aurelians find the planet overrun by Seekers. After liberating the planet, they travel to the Galactic Council to seek their help in combating the Seeker assault on humanity. When the Council calls the Seekers to explain themselves, a being materializes in the Council chambers claiming to be a ‚Äútrue‚Äù human and a god. The being, a Koroem, takes full responsibility for the human genocide and claims that it ordered the Seekers to exterminate humanity because they were physically imitating the Koroem. A battle ensues after the Koroem wounds one of the Aurelians, but it is ultimately killed when Gideon uses a previously unknown mystical ability. This opens a portal that Gideon is dragged into. He finds himself on an ice planet, where a horned creature dubbed \\"The Stranger\\" appears and says, \\"Come with me, human. There is much to be done.\\" It then beckons Gideon to follow. Characters * Gideon Wyeth (voiced by Will Friedle) ‚Äî The main character of the game. He is a member of one of the last human outposts. * Ethan Wyeth ‚Äî Gideon's hotshot older brother. Because of his celebrity following the Independence Wars, he is assigned the role of pilot for the mission of first contact with the Aurelians. He used his connections to instate Gideon as his co-pilot. * Olivia Morgan (voiced by Vanessa Marshall) ‚Äî Gideon's fianc√©, a scientist assigned to Luriam space station. * Marin Steel ‚Äî A decorated pilot from the Independence Wars, she encounters Gideon as he attempts to escape Bahr Han on her ship. She is captured by the Seekers and unsuccessfully imprisoned on the island of Teran, having developed her own psychic powers. * Kelehm Farwaters (voiced by Dwight Schultz) ‚Äî A ninth-tier Garhgon (an Aurelian religious caste), he has trained himself in the telekinetic arts. Kelehm belongs to \\"the old faith\\" which states that the discovery of humans is part of a prophecy and the Aurelians will gain greater psychic power through them. * Enorym Tenspur (voiced by Michael Bell) ‚Äî Ally to Gideon and the most highly trained of the Aurelian elite fighters, Enorym serves as a commander of the elite Felidic warriors. Enorym leads an assault on a Seeker ship shortly after Gideon learns how to use his psychic powers. * Bud - A troublemaking Marine that starts a bar fight with Gideon and later challenges him and Ethan to a training match. After losing, Bud fires a blaster at Ethan. The player then has the choice of either using a stungun to disable Bud or picking up a blaster and killing him, which determines whether his squadmates help you or abandon you in a later gameplay segment. * K'Chell ‚Äî A Seeker ambassador who interrupts the planetary ruling council and demands that the Aurelians hand over Gideon and Marin. When Kelehm refuses, K'Chell kills him, then escapes to the ansible to inform the Seeker armada. * Sevan ‚Äî A council member on Aurelia, he leads a rebellion to give the humans to the Seekers and avoid retaliation. After staging a coup, he co-opts the council, gives Marin to the Seekers, and puts Enorym on trial for treason. * Banath ‚Äî Originally serving as Enorym's best warrior, he is revealed to be a double agent for Sevan. Having planted a Seeker ambush inside the ansible, Banath becomes visibly angry after Enorym orders him to escort Marin back to the Aurelian capital. He returns with a dropship manned by other rebels after giving Marin to the Seekers and announces his betrayal by killing one of Enorym's warriors. Gideon kills Banath shortly after Enorym is put on trial. Soundtrack The Advent Rising Soundtrack of the game was released on June 28, 2005, under record label Sumthing Else Music Works. The music was composed by Emmanuel Fratianni and Michael Richard Plowman, whilst the additional music and orchestrations were performed by Laurie Robinson and Tommy Tallarico. Development The game's overall story was created by Donald and Geremy Mustard. The dialog and screenplay, however, was written by Orson Scott Card and Cameron Dayton. Card's influences are noticeable in the terminology which has been carried over from Ender's Game. The terms \\"vids\\", \\"Buggers\\", and \\"ansible\\" are all references from his critically acclaimed novels (though the term ansible was coined by Ursula K. Le Guin, and was not actually added to the script by Card himself, but by Donald Mustard).Card's comments on the use of \\"ansible\\" from his official website Reception Following its Xbox release, Advent Rising received mixed reviews from critics whose scores ranged from a high of 4.5 out of 5 (GamePro) to a low of 5 out of 10 (EGM). Reviewer scores averaged at a 68 on both GameRankings and Metacritic, while user scores averaged at 7.5. The most common complaints were the large number of bugs which caused a range of problems including freezing. Another common complaint regarded the difficulty in using the flick targeting system. Advent Risings visual design choice was noted by several reviewers, pointing out that the characters all appear fairly elongated, although it has been said that this was a deliberate stylistic choice. Upon the release of the PC version of the game a month after the Xbox counterpart, Advent Rising was slightly better received, earning a 72 on GameRankings, a 70 on Metacritic, and an 81 on Venting Gamer with user scores averaging at 82. Many reviewers felt that the month long delay had been put to good use as many of the glitches in the Xbox version had been fixed. Framerate was also improved, with slowdowns becoming rarer. A million dollars was offered in a contest via Xbox Live for the first player to find a set of hidden symbols spread throughout the levels of the game. On August 15, 2005, the contest was cancelled, due to concerns that there was \\"no technically feasible solution that would allow the contest to continue in a fair and secure manner\\". Majesco offered, as compensation to those players, the choice of two free games (BloodRayne 2, Guilty Gear X2, Psychonauts, Raze's Hell, and/or Phantom Dust) and an apology on its home page. Comics An avid comics fan, game creator Donald Mustard originally realized the story of Advent Rising in hand-drawn comic books. He revealed in a 2005 interview: \\"With Advent, from day one, we conceived it initially as a comic book itself. Back when I was getting out of high school, we were laying the foundation for Advent. I drew the first several hours of what would ultimately become the game as a comic book.\\" The release of the Advent Rising game was supported by a promotional one-shot comic book produced by DC Comics. The comic was written by Lee Hammock and drawn by Billy Dallas Patton as a direct tie-in to the action of the game. It was inserted free of charge within a handful of comic books published by DC. Another comic book, this time a series, grew out of the partnership between Majesco Entertainment and 360ep, a young entertainment properties management concern founded by former Marvel Comics CEO Bill Jemas. The new comic series, Advent Rising: Rock the Planet, was written by Rob Worley, with layouts by Arthur Dela Cruz, pencils by Cliff Richards, inks by Dennis Crisostomo, colors by Cris Delara, and letters by Simon Bowland. The comic was produced with oversight by Mustard and Jemas. This new series begins the franchise some ten years before the events of the game. It follows the adventures of Gideon, Ethan, and Olivia in their formative, teenage years. The first issue was published on October 26, 2005. The fifth and final issue was released on November 22, 2006. Unofficial patch An unofficial patch called Advent Revising for the game has been created to address a number of issues including subtitles, cinematic playback, cut content and various other fixes.

He came to be known for his greed and treachery. \\"A prominent eastern warrior\\", he supplied Yoshitsune with a number of ships after the Battle of Yashima. Originally from Suruga Province, Kajiwara entered the Genpei War fighting under ≈åba Kagechika, against the Minamoto. After the Taira victory at Ishibashiyama in 1181, he was sent to pursue the fleeing Minamoto no Yoritomo. Having discovered him, Kajiwara switched sides, leading his forces in another direction, and turning to Yoritomo's cause. Three years later, Kajiwara would lead the forces of Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Yoritomo into battle against their cousin Yoshinaka, and against the Taira. Attached to Yoshitsune's force, Kajiwara reported back to Yoritomo on Yoshitsune's actions, in order to satisfy Yoritomo's suspicion and distrust of his brother. In one particular episode related in The Tale of the Heike, Kajiwara suggests, during the Battle of Yashima, that Yoshitsune equip the Minamoto ships with \\"reverse oars\\" should they need to retreat quickly. Yoshitsune responds with distaste to Kajiwara's advice, humiliating him by saying such an act would be cowardice. From that point until Yoritomo's death, the resentful Kajiwara did as much as he could to raise tensions between the brothers. His slander led Yoritomo, already suspicious of his younger brother, to eventually accuse Yoshitsune of plotting against the bakufu, which then led to his exile and eventual death. Even after this, when the shogunate was successfully and firmly established, Kajiwara still caused tensions at court. He accused Yuki Tomomitsu of plotting against the Sh≈çgun Minamoto no Yoriie; a number of members of the court tried to get rid of him, who eventually left for Suruga. The following year (1200), he was defeated and killed in battle along with his son Kagesue. Kajiwara Heima, a senior retainer of the Aizu domain in the 19th century, claimed descent from Kagetoki. His formal name, Kagetake (ÊôØÊ≠¶) shares a character with Kagetoki's name. References *Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan. Tokyo: Kodansha Ltd. *Samurai-archives.com Biography of Kajiwara Kagetoki.

The show was originally broadcast on TLC, narrated by Peter Thomas, and produced by Medstar Television, distributed by FilmRise, in association with truTV Original Productions. It broadcast 406 episodes from its debut on TLC in 1996 until its final episode in 2011. Reruns shown on HLN were initially retitled Mystery Detectives before settling on the main title of the show in 2014. A version of the program was broadcast on Five in the United Kingdom, under the name Murder Detectives. Most of the 400 episodes are also available on the \\"Medical Detectives - Full Episodes\\" channel that is managed by distributor FilmRise. On October 1, 2019, HLN announced it had greenlit a revival of the show, titled Forensic Files II, which began airing on February 23, 2020. After long-time narrator Peter Thomas' death, the show has beens narrated by Bill Camp.  Overview  The show helped pioneer documentary-style crime-science shows. Its website says it profiles \\"puzzling, often baffling cases whose riddles are ultimately solved by forensic detection.\\" The cases and people are real. Scientists and forensic experts in many fields are interviewed. Not every case is a crime. In some cases, the investigation reveals that the suspects are innocent, and that a death was an accident or suicide. Several episodes profile people who have been jailed for or convicted of a crime and ultimately exonerated by forensic evidence. Other episodes focus on accidents where consulted experts relied on forensic evidence to explain why the incident occurred, such as the 1987 King's Cross fire and the 1993 Big Bayou Canot train wreck. Many of the accident investigation episodes were originally broadcast as a separate CourtTV program, Extreme Evidence, but are now rerun under the Forensic Files name and included in the Mystery Detectives rebranding. Although Medical Detectives also showed episodes about how outbreaks of mysterious illnesses were tracked (such as Hantavirus and Legionellosis), most of them have been dropped in favor of episodes about criminal cases (and occasionally civil cases).  Episodes  Narration and cast  Not every episode of Forensic Files was narrated by Peter Thomas, a well-known voice-over talent. Four special hour-long episodes (\\"Payback\\", \\"Eight Men Out\\", \\"See No Evil\\", and \\"The Buddhist Monk Murders\\") were narrated by Peter Dean due to a scheduling conflict. These episodes were originally broadcast on TLC in 2001 and all except for one (\\"Eight Men Out\\") aired for the first time on the HLN Network in 2016. Each episode had a new 'cast', including interviews with witnesses, investigators, and forensic scientists. Many of the world's most well-known forensic analysts have appeared on the show (often in more than one episode), including Henry Lee, Cyril Wecht, William M. Bass, Alec Jeffreys, Skip Palenik, and Richard Souviron. For the dramatic recreations, \\"lookalike\\" actors and models resembling the main figures in the story were found through a casting company in Allentown, Pennsylvania,\\"A model for success\\" Morning Call, April 12, 2004 or through \\"open\\" casting calls in New York and other cities. Forensic Files II is different in one respect: it does not show the faces of the people who are re- creating the situation. \\"We don‚Äôt use dialogue in our recreations and [unlike the original series] we don‚Äôt shoot faces, like lookalikes or actors,\\" Executive Producer Duffy said.Can Forensic Files II Recapture the Magic of a True-Crime Trailblazer?  Production and title sequences  Title card used during seasons 5 through 6 (including the retitled Medical Detectives episodes). The program began on the TLC Network in April 1996 as Medical Detectives.\\"Medstar's 'Medical Detectives Debuts Tonight\\" Morning Call, Allentown, Pa., April 21, 1996 Mcall.com Old episodes of Medical Detectives now air on TruTV under the Forensic Files label. Overseas, the show airs under these two titles, and others, on various channels in over 100 countries. It is distributed by CABLEready. For the first four seasons under the Medical Detectives name, the format of the show was generally the same as it would be in later seasons under its \\"Forensic Files\\" name, but there were slight differences. During the opening credits and after the title display of the show, the titles of the episodes appeared and they were each displayed distinctively. For example, \\"The Disappearance of Helle Crafts\\" depicted a jigsaw puzzle coming together that displayed a picture of Helle Crafts and this picture lead into the episode (under the Forensic Files name, this picture was replaced with another), and \\"Raw Terror\\" depicted the words in big red letters against a black screen. The titles were sometimes featured in a visual representation to accommodate the subject at hand. For example, \\"The Southside Strangler\\" depicted black and white buildings coming down the screen; the buildings were displayed there in order to represent the \\"southside\\" of wherever the crime happened in and Season 2's \\"The Common Thread\\" displayed the title through a use of small \\"thread\\" strands that dangled in full-view and formed the title. The re-enactment scenes for the first couple of seasons were displayed in black and white and an eerie music score with a tunnel-like echo voice was used in order to provide a more terrifying feel to the show. When CourtTV acquired the rights to the show for its fifth season, the decision was made to rename the show Forensic Files in order to emphasize the forensic science that was performed on the cases and connect it better with other documentary/reenactment crime shows with a similar title such as The FBI Files and Cold Case Files. A new opening was produced for Seasons 5 and 6 (and a couple of Season 7) and it depicted footage from the first four seasons. The title display \\"Forensic Files\\" is depicted in big blue and red letters with a background light beaming across the \\"Forensic\\" part. This opening was later used for the Medical Detectives episodes, removing their original openings and distinctive title displays. Some episodes such as \\"Raw Terror\\" were never incorporated under the Forensic Files name due to CourtTV's desire to have the show focus on crime-related episodes in favor of simple accidental virus ones (episodes that focused on bank robberies and attempts at poisoning, but no murders were incorporated). \\"Raw Terror\\" (along with a number of episodes from the \\"Medical Detectives\\" era) can be seen online under its original format when they were aired as Medical Detectives. In Season 7, a newer (and more well-known) opening sequence was made with an entirely new theme song, providing a more techo-feel and featuring a new title format. The titles of the episodes are quickly scanned underneath the title displays. No footage from actual episodes is used and everything displayed is made exclusively for the opening. This opening was used on a number of rebranded Medical Detectives episodes; replacing the opening for Seasons 5 and 6 that was originally given to them. Episodes such as \\"The Southside Strangler\\" and \\"Legionnaires' Disease\\" can be seen with all three openings. Season 7's \\"Reel Danger\\" can be seen with two. By Season 12, starting with the twentieth episode, the opening sequence was shortened entirely and as a result, just the title of the show is featured and the title of the episode was written beneath it. On October 1, 2019, HLN announced it had acquired the broadcasting rights from Medstar Television to produce a revival of the series, with the first season consisting of 16 half-hour episodes. The new show is titled Forensic Files II, and the first episode is scheduled to air on February 23, 2020 with Bill Camp serving as the new narrator.  Show format  The show takes a \\"whodunit\\" approach, making each case a mystery that needs to be solved. Every half-hour episode follows one case from its initial investigation until the suspect(s) conviction, acquittal, or some other legal resolution. Pathologists, medical examiners, police officers, detectives, prosecutors, defense attorneys, friends and families of victims or suspects (if their cooperation is given) are all interviewed about their roles. Video footage of the lab tests is shot in a modernistic film noir style, in dark, moodily lit settings with odd, glowing colors. The crimes and parts of the investigation are re-enacted with actors in dramatic recreations. These recreations are indicated by a change to a \\"filmized\\" look, as is done with many crime re-enactment shows. These recreations sometimes include alternate versions of the crime, which are eventually disproven by the science. This technique would later be appropriated, in a modified form, by the CBS television series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation‚Äîessentially a fictionalized big-budget version of Forensic Files. During the original run of the show as Medical Detectives, eerie vocal music was matched with the recreations in order to create a frightening atmosphere. This specific effect was discontinued after the move to Court TV. For privacy considerations, the names of some victims and their families are changed, and case evidence featured within the show is re-created in order to protect their true identities. That is unless consent is given by the persons who are being spoken to, the show is not allowed to use the family's (or families') real name(s). In 2006, Forensic Files \\"Advanced\\" episodes aired, which had older episodes interspersed with Pop-Up Video style factoids about the cases which were then being featured. Sometimes, another case is mentioned which is similar to the one being aired. For example: \\"Cold Hearted\\" on \\"Freeze Framed\\" and \\"Past Lives\\" on \\"A Squire's Riches\\". In another episode that involves DNA evidence, the name of a man shown on an older episode was mentioned again and this time he was revealed to have been the first person put to death in the United States based on DNA evidence. On re-runs of episodes on HLN, an update of the case is given on the criminals that were alive at the time the episodes were aired (deaths, parole, release, etc.).  Broadcast run and alternative titles  Premiering just as the O. J. Simpson murder trial had focused attention on the world of DNA and forensics, Medical Detectives became a hit. It was one of the first of the popular forensic science shows. A few years later, Court TV acquired rights to broadcast the show and it quickly became the cornerstone of its primetime schedule, increasing its annual production run to 42 episodes. The show was retained after the network was renamed TruTV in 2008. The show was so successful that, in 2002, NBC aired it as a summer replacement series, one of the first times in which a program produced for cable television was aired by a broadcast network in prime-time.\\"NBC Nabs Valley Crime Show\\" Morning Call, Allentown, Pa., Sept. 6, 2002 Mcall.com In 2009, truTV's sister network Turner Network Television (\\"TNT\\") began airing episodes in HD on Wednesday nights for the month of December. The vast majority of the shows are in a half-hour format. However, some hour-long specials have been produced. Several of these have re- investigated famous cases such as The Norfolk Four, or even historic murders such as the Lindbergh kidnapping and the John F. Kennedy assassination. Reruns were aired on Lifetime in the fall of 2011 under the Medical Detectives moniker. A year later, in October 2012, HLN began airing the reruns under the title Mystery Detectives. Beginning in January 2014, HLN switched to the \\"Forensic Files\\" title. On that network, it is increasingly being used to fill many time slots due to program cancellations by budget cuts. In fact, the program took up about 58% of the entire HLN channel each week. In June 2014, the program aired nightly from 2am through 5am on CNN, before being removed due to industry and viewer criticism, along with continuing international breaking news events, and replaced with a CNN International simulcast. Since November 7, 2015, HLN has retitled the program \\"Forensic Files: Digital Details\\" and aired episodes that did not air on the channel before. The show led HLN in ratings in early 2015. TruTV currently still holds the licensing rights to the Forensic Files name. The reruns were repackaged with a shorter intro, and (at the end of some episodes) updates on what became of the suspect(s) or parties involved since the final verdicts. (For example: At the end of the 1996 episode \\"The List Murders,\\" it is mentioned that John List, convicted of murdering his entire family in 1971 and sentenced to life in prison, died in 2008.) In late 2014, Investigation Discovery started airing episodes under the \\"Cause of Death\\" title. Reruns of the show also are carried over-the-air on Court TV, sister channel Court TV Mystery, AMGTV and in off- network syndication. In 2019 the entire catalogue of Forensic Files are available on Netflix and a \\"Best of Forensic Files\\" series is available on Amazon Prime. HLN advertised \\"brand new episodes of Forensic Files\\" intermittently since 2014, when the advertised \\"new\\" episodes are actually just old episodes that had never aired on the network before and were \\"new\\" to HLN. The advertisement of \\"new\\" episodes caused confusion, with some viewers taking to Twitter to ask the show's creator, Paul Dowling, if the show was going back into production. The show's narrator, Peter Thomas, died on April 30, 2016, five years after the program went out of production. Dowling stated that Thomas \\"can't be replaced,\\" thus eliminating any hopes of reviving the program. Despite this, the program was revived for an additional season for February 2020. Bill Camp was chosen to succeed Thomas as the show's narrator.https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/bill-camp-narrate-hln- forensic-files-ii  Home media  In 2004, Court TV released a limited number of episodes on DVD. As of June 26, 2009, Amazon.com says the DVD has been discontinued by the manufacturer. In August 2011, TGG Direct released 8 DVD collections each containing 12 episodes. These collections include \\"Historic Cases,\\" \\"Convictions Overturned,\\" \\"Death By Poison,\\" \\"Crimes of Passion,\\" \\"Kidnapping Cases,\\" \\"Medical Mysteries,\\" \\"Serial Killers\\" and \\"Sex Crimes.\\" As of February 2020, Netflix in the U.S. was streaming nine of the seasons; the last seven seasons were also streaming on Hulu.

The Houston Chronicle compared it to an episode of Unsolved Mysteries: \\"A criminal story is told ‚Äì the more bizarre the better; a mysterious element is introduced; and forensic experts solve the mystery. All that's missing is Robert Stack.\\" The Los Angeles Times gave this review: \\"Although \\"Forensic Files\\" ably extends this specialized field to the masses and deploys its slick reenactments effectively, its jarring voice-over is the overcooked antithesis of the meticulous science it depicts.\\"  Forensic Files II  The new series, which aired two of its 16 episodes on February 23, 2020, uses the same formula as the original, though with a new narrator, Bill Camp. \\"We are telling the same kinds of stories in the same way,\\" Executive Producer Nancy Duffy said in an interview. Instead of hiring actors to play the fictional roles, however, the new series uses \\"employees of CNN and HLN\\".Tuned In: HLN reopens true-crime series ‚ÄòForensic Files‚Äô  Other media  Cover of the first Forensic Files DVD. The Official Forensic Files Casebook was published in 2004. The book recaps and expounds on some episodes, explains how the show is produced, and details why some proposed episodes were turned down. In it, the show's Executive Producer/Writer Paul Dowling says he was inspired to create the show because he had been present in Philadelphia during the outbreak of Legionellosis in 1976, as well as by the murder of Helle Crafts. The CDC's legionellosis investigation eventually became an episode of Medical Detectives, while the Crafts case was filmed as the program's pilot episode.

It is in the care of the National Trust of Australia. It was added to the Australian National Heritage List on 11 August 2006.. The front gates of the Rippon Lea estate  History  Rippon Lea in 1880 The Rippon Lea Estate was built in 1868 for Sir Frederick Sargood, a wealthy Melbourne businessman, politician and philanthropist. Frederick and his wife Marion purchased Crown Allotment 253 and either all, or part of Crown Allotment 260 in the Parish of Prahran, Elsternwick giving them a total area of . Located about 8 kilometres from the Melbourne central business district, he contracted a two-storey, 15 room house be built. An extensive pleasure garden was laid out around the house, together with glasshouses, vegetable gardens and orchards. The gardens were designed to be self-sufficient as regards water, and the large man-made lake on the property was designed to store stormwater run-off from the surrounding area. By the late 1870s Rippon Lea was a total of with the kitchen garden alone taking up .Murray, Peter R. & Wells, John C. \\"From sand, swamp and heath...a history of Caulfield\\". City of Caulfield, 1980. p. 156. The Sargood family lived at Rippon Lea until Frederick's death in 1903, and over the years extended the house on several occasions. The greatest structural changes occurred in 1897 when the house was extended to the north, and a tower was added. The style of the house has been described as \\"polychromatic romanesque\\" and the architect, Joseph Reed, was said to have been inspired by the architecture of the Lombardy region of northern Italy. The house also contained many other innovations; it was one of the first in Australia to be lit by electricity, produced by its own generators, and Sargood employed a full-time electrician to maintain the system, and the fittings included an electrically powered bell system to communicate with the servants quarters and kitchens below stairs. On Frederick's death in 1903, the property was sold to a consortium of real estate developers who had plans to demolish the house and subdivide the land. Elsternwick at this time was a new suburb on the outskirts of Melbourne; 35 years earlier when the Sargoods bought the land, it had been well outside the built-up area of Melbourne. The house was empty for six years, while the developers sold off various parcels of land, particularly the orchards and paddocks. However, before the final carve-up of the estate could be undertaken, the leader of the consortium, Sir Thomas Bent, died and the property was put on the market in 1910. It was bought by Ben and Agnes Nathan, who owned the Maples chain of furniture stores in Melbourne. The Nathans lived there until Ben's death in 1935. The property then passed to their eldest daughter, Louisa, along with a legacy of ¬£1 million. Louisa (married name, Mrs Timothy Jones) was a leading figure in the Melbourne social set in the 1930s. She undertook extensive remodelling and renovation of the house to allow her to entertain on a lavish scale. The interior of the house was redecorated in a restrained classical 1930s style, drawing heavily on Hollywood film style of the 1930s and Syrie Maugham's \\"all white room\\" as influences. These renovations substantially altered most of the surviving Victorian features of the house‚Äîfor example, the wallpaper in the entrance hall and corridors (originally embossed in gold) was over-painted in white, as were the marble columns around the main entrance. The ornate iron- framed ballroom built by Frederick Sargood (which was converted from an earlier conservatory) was demolished to make way for a lavish \\"Hollywood style\\" swimming pool and ballroom and of gardens were maintained. Mrs Jones also installed a new modern kitchen on the ground level and the original basement kitchen and service areas were closed up, which preserved many of the surviving 19th century features of this section of the house, including the cool room, the wine cellar and the large fuel stove. In preparation for the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne, a section of the property was compulsorily acquired by the Victorian government to house a new television studio complex for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The Rippon Lea studio became the ABC's Melbourne studio and in later years were used as the production centre for many renowned ABC programs including Bellbird, Countdown, The Big Gig and The Late Show. Another section of the property was compulsorily acquired by the state government a few years later and Mrs Jones fought a long-running legal action against it. She eventually settled with the government, agreeing that, on her death the house and the land still in her possession would be bequeathed to the National Trust. With Mrs Jones death on 27 July 1972, the house and gardens were reunited with the disputed acquisition, saving the estate from the threat of sale and subdivision and allowing the public to enjoy the estate in perpetuity. During the 1970s and 1980s the Vernon Family resided in the gate house. Of particular note in the grounds are the lake, the spectacular iron-framed fernery, the swimming pool and associated ballroom (1939, now leased to Peter Rowland Catering for social functions) and the stable complex (1868). The rooms of the basement kitchen complex are also of special interest, having been built in the 1880s and then abandoned in 1938 following the installation of a modern kitchen on the ground floor. Today they are a rare surviving Australian example of a 19th-century kitchen suite; comprising kitchen, scullery, pantries, cool rooms, servants' hall and wine cellar.

She is the older sister of the Teen Titans member Crown Princess Koriand'r/Starfire and less- known youngest sibling and brother Crown Prince Ryand'r/Darkfire; the former of whom is her archenemy. Blackfire makes her live adaptation debut in the DC Universe and HBO Max series Titans starting in the second season, played by Damaris Lewis. Publication history Blackfire first appears in New Teen Titans #22 and was created by Marv Wolfman and George P√©rez. Fictional character biography Komand'r is the firstborn child and eldest daughter of Tamaran's royal family. The first princess born in over a century, she should have been courted and showered with honors. On the day she was born, the Citadel Empire attacked and destroyed the western Tamaranean city of Kysarr and killed three thousand citizens in her name. Though she was in no way at fault for what had happened, Komand'r was, for all time, inextricably linked with that terrible day. To make matters worse, Komand'r was crippled by a childhood illness that left her unable to harness ultraviolet light into energy to fly like most Tamaraneans. Because of Komand'r's naturally grim disposition, a stark contrast to the royal family's generally contented outlook, the subjects of Tamaran hated her. As a result, though first in the line of succession, she was denied her birthright to be the next Crown Princess of Tamaran to maintain the respect and prestige of the royal family. Her privileges, honors, and her royal style and dignity were transferred to her younger sister, Princess Koriand'r (who would later become known as Starfire). Inwardly, Komand'r's rage grew and her resentment turned to hatred for her own world, her people, her family, and lastly her younger sister who, in Komand'r's eyes, made the fateful mistake of being born. Komand'r's hatred continued and intensified when she and her sister were sent, per Tamaran's warlike custom, for warrior training with the Warlords of Okaara. Komand'r's true feelings were exposed when during a sparring exercise she attempted to kill her younger sister. As a result, she was expelled by the Warlords. Humiliated by her own transgression, Komand'r swore vengeance and joined the Citadel, quickly rising through their ranks to become a warrior-maiden fighting against the forces of her own world and, ultimately, her own family. Komand'r later betrayed her home world with detailed information about Tamaran's planetary defenses to the Citadel. They conquered Tamaran with ease, and the surrender conditions included the enslavement of Koriand'r. Koriand'r was never permitted to return, since that would mean the Citadel would devastate the planet for abrogating the treaty. Komand'r was her sister's master and made the most of her younger sister's bondage with years of horrific servitude and torture. When Kori killed one of her rapists, Komand'r decided to execute her as punishment, but not before the sisters were attacked and captured by the Psions. Psions, largely a species of sadistic scientists, performed a deadly experiment on both of the sisters to see just how much ultraviolet energy their Tamaranian bodies could absorb before exploding from the overload. During the procedure, Komand'r's forces attacked the Psion ship to rescue her and while the Psions were distracted, Kori broke free with her newly developed starbolts, highly destructive blasts of bright pink-colored ultraviolet energy, which were a result of the experimentation. Against her better judgment she decided to free Komand'r, who was still absorbing more and more ultraviolet energy. However, far from grateful, Komand'r had struck her younger sister down with the same (but much stronger) lilac-colored ultraviolet energy and had her restrained for later execution. Kori escaped and stole a spaceship to planet Earth, where she met a young group of heroes- Robin, Beast Boy, Bumblebee, Speedy and Kid Flash- and helped form the new Teen Titans. Komand'r appeared in the Rann-Thanagar War limited series, during which she killed Hawkwoman in her pursuit of a New Tamaran. She formed an uneasy alliance with the surviving players of the war in order to deal with more pressing concerns (Infinite Crisis). She was not seen during the Crisis series itself, but was featured in Hawkgirl and Hawkman comics as well as in JSA: Classified, attempting to kill Hawkman and Hawkgirl in order to further her own plans in the goings on & aftermath of the war. The Hawks defeated Komand'r, after which Hawkman used Psion technology to strip the villainess of her abilities. Blackfire has later resurfaced in The Outsiders (vol. 3) #31-32 (Infinite Crisis tie-in issues) with her powers already having been restored by the Psions and enhanced to the point of gaining flight. Further along the line in R.E.B.E.L.S. (vol. 2), When Vril Dox moved the planet Rann into the location formally held by Tamaran in the Vega System, Blackfire arrived with her army in attempt to seize the planet for her own people. Dox was able to quickly stop the hostilities, however, and brokered a treaty allowing Blackfire and her people to settle on the uninhabited southern continent of Rann. During these events, Blackfire gained a newfound sense of respect for Dox, realizing his egocentric personality was very similar to her own. The two went on an unofficial date disguised as a diplomatic dinner and after Dox was captured by Starro the Conqueror, Blackfire joined forces with Adam Strange and other members of L.E.G.I.O.N. to rescue him. Blackfire then subsequently claimed Dox as her king consort. The New 52 In The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), some people's origins and personalities have been changed to an unknown degree. While not at first referred to by name, it is said Starfire's sister sold her for the safety of their planet.Red Hood and the Outlaws Vol. 1 #1 It is revealed that a parasitic race known as the Blight has taken over Tamaran, their purpose unknown and Koriand'r fears the worst for her sister.Red Hood and the Outlaws Vol. 1 #10 Komand'r appears via flashback as her sister talks about their relationship, saying that they rarely get along and that Kori is embittered toward Komand'r and the people of Tamaran for letting her be enslaved. After Kori fought her way free, she was praised as a hero and given a ship named the Starfire by Komand'r, but the rift between the girls was still there. Komand'r appears to a captured Roy Harper and appears to be working with or under the Blight.Red Hood and the Outlaws Vol. 1 #11 Roy's capture, however, was revealed to be a mission to rescue Komand'r, as he successfully teleported her back onto the Starfire. Kom and Kori reconcile in a teary conversation as Kori forgivers her sister and the issue ends with the sisters preparing to take back Tamaran by themselves.Red Hood and the Outlaws Vol. 1 #12 Kom and Kori fight through the hordes of the Blight with Jason, Roy and a few of the members of Kori's ship. Komand'r is stabbed in the back by a spear thrown by the Blight's leader. Kori's emotions send an energetic shock wave, wiping out everything around her. When the smoke clears she holds the defeated Blight leader. After the battle, Princess Koriand'r is next to the throne and Crown Princess Komand'r stumbles next to her. She asks Kori to stay, but realizes she cannot. They hug and Crown Princess Komand'r gives them a ship to get back to Earth.Red Hood and the Outlaws Vol. 1 #13 Abilities and Powers Princess Komand'r (Blackfire) is a Tamaranean like her younger sister; her physiology is designed to constantly absorb and control pure ultraviolet radiation into destructive and powerful bolts of energy which she calls \\"blackbolts.\\" The radiation is then converted to pure energy which enabled her incredible feats of strength, speed, durability and the like; all on par or possibly greater than those of Starfire, having fought and bested her many times. This is not the case for flight, however, as she suffered a sickness in her youth which stripped her of this ability, but she found other means of circumventing this handicap. Being of royal blood and having fought in many wars, Komand'r also boasts impressive mortal combat skills superior even to her sibling, be it unarmed or with weaponry on hand, having battled and bested the likes of her own sibling (who is also a veteran warrior) and Thanagarian heroes Kartar Hol, Shayera Thal and Shayera Hol either in single combat or in pairs and win, as well as holding her own against the likes of a weakened Starro in his humanoid form (with some assistance from Starfire). Having undergone the same experiments conducted upon her by the Psions, Blackfire too has the ability to release her absorbed energy into incredibly powerful blasts called \\"starbolts\\". Hers by comparison, however, are considerably stronger enabling her to overpower her sister's starbolt energy. For a time Blackfire was stripped of all her powers by Hawkman using the same technology the Psions used in their experimentation upon her. Even without these strengths Komand'r is still a political activist and capable leader, being Queen of Tamaran she has access to a great many facilities, be it governmental or military in nature. Like any good politician, Blackfire is a skilled manipulator, able to utilize fear and misdirection to her advantage; even forging alliances with others despite her incredibly sociopathic nature. When her natural abilities were restored in full, however, she not only regained all the natural Tamaranian abilities she initially lacked, Princess Blackfire even gained a capacity she lacked, namely faster-than-light aviary travel.Outsiders Vol 3 #31-32 This accommodates her resilience against heat, radiation and the harsh vacuum of outer space coupled with a solar powered self-sustenance eliminating the need to eat, drink, sleep or an atmosphere to breathe, which enables the evil queen to travel interstellar distances unaided, though she can take in sustenance if she desires too.R.E.B.E.L.S Vol 2 #24 She can also actively absorb stellar and UV energy like her sister but has a unique ability her counterpart does not, which is the active absorption of stellar energies to copy off new abilities from another person, like when she drew energy directly from Starfire emulating her omni-directional energy burst; due to her greater stellar energy absorption abilities, however, Blackfire can recover faster than her sister when she uses her powers in such a way.Outsiders Vol 3 #32 Blackfire, like all Tamaraneans, can assimilate languages through physical contact with another person and is more fluent in the English language of humans than Koriand'r. She also does not need to eat or drink; though she can if unusually low on ultraviolet energy. In both animated shows, Blackfire can project her lilac-colored ultraviolet energy reserves as optic blasts, revealed to be facet received after her changes phase, in the episode Betrothed she had come into possession of a mystical artifact dubbed the Jewel of Charta, which greatly magnified her abilities tens of times greater, turning her normally lilac-colored \\"blackbolts\\" a bright red. Her enhanced durability and invulnerability were amplified as well, to the point of withstanding a barrage of Starfire's bright green starbolts and appear unscathed. She is also a master manipulator and deceiver, capable of using kind and friendly words to achieve her vile goals. In other media=Animated ShowsTeen Titans= Princess Komand'r (Blackfire) as seen in her debut episode of the Teen Titans animated series Blackfire appears in the 2003 animated series, voiced by Hynden Walch (the voice actress of Starfire in the same series). In the series, this version is depicted as a young woman, yet is shown to be a few years older than her sister Starfire. In contrast to the other Tamaraneans shown on the series, all of whom have auburn or brown hair and bright green eyes with green sclera, Blackfire is shown to have black hair with purple streaks, and purple eyes with white sclera - likely a reference to her comic counterpart being born deformed by Tamaranean standards. She possesses superhuman strength, durability, reflexes, agility, endurance, FTL flight (a natural Tamaranian ability she lacked in the comics), as well as the ability to generate bright lilac-colored bolts of ultraviolet energy from her hands that are quite powerful and destructive, which are called \\"blackbolts\\". In a contrast with her comic book depiction, Blackfire has the natural ability to fly faster-than-light through the air at will. Presumably, she has all of the same abilities as Starfire, as the two are quite evenly matched in combat. Her clothes in the series are quite similar to Starfire's as seen in the prequel episode \\"Go!\\", but Starfire's was purple; whereas Blackfire's outfit is black and Starfire's skin showed while Blackfire's is covered by a metal plating of sorts. Blackfire's debut appearance came in the first-season episode \\"Sisters\\", where Blackfire comes to Earth to visit Starfire. However, it is soon revealed that Blackfire is actually an infamous galactic criminal, and she has actually come to Earth in an attempt to frame her younger sister for her crimes. Fortunately, her plan was thwarted and the result ended in an epic fight between sisters. Their battle is interrupted when Blackfire is arrested by Centauri police forces. She vows that she will get out of galactic jail and get even with her little sister. In Episode 29, \\"Betrothed\\", Blackfire is revealed to have \\"got bored\\" and escaped galactic jail, and in control of Tamaran as the Empress. She used her authority to have Starfire married to a swamp alien in return for the magical Jewel of Charta, under the guise that Tamaran would be destroyed if Starfire did not comply. The Teen Titans soon discover that the elder sister's plan is a hoax, and Starfire proceeds to challenge Blackfire to a duel for the Tamaranean throne. The Jewel of Charta was shown to greatly enhance Blackfire's abilities (turning her starbolts from lavender to red at the time), until Starfire took the jewel from her sister by force and crushed it. After Blackfire was defeated by Starfire, Blackfire is then forced into exile; presumably one of the swamp moons of Drenfax 4. Blackfire hasn't been seen for the remainder of the show. The New Teen Titans animated short \\"Blackfire's Babysitter\\" depicts Blackfire as having quadruplets with the swamp alien she had attempted to force Starfire into marrying, but the animated short was created as a joke and is not considered canon. =Teen Titans Go!= Princess Komand'r (Blackfire in Earth's English language) appears as a supporting character, again voiced by Hynden Walch. She first appears in the Season 2 premiere, \\"Mr. Butt\\". After getting into trouble with the Galactic Police again, Blackfire seeks refuge with Starfire. After Starfire gave Blackfire delighted hugs, Blackfire is introduced to the rest of the Teen Titans, to which her little sister's teammates took an immediate disliking to her. After Blackfire flirts with Robin, the Titans try to tell Starfire that Blackfire was one of the most wanted criminals. Starfire then claims that she was going to give Blackfire one more chance, but if Blackfire crushed Starfire's sisterly feelings once more, a thoroughly enraged Starfire would destroy her. After Blackfire grudgingly does \\"sisterly stuff\\" with Starfire (making her little sister look exactly like her), the Galactic Police find Starfire (dressed as Blackfire), and take her prisoner where Starfire, both heartbroken and revenge-torn, swears to destroy Blackfire once and for all. After learning to listen to a sister's problems, and how to live with a younger sibling, Blackfire felt guilt for her horrible actions toward her younger sister, and becomes a better older sister. In the midst of this, a thoroughly enraged and revenge-torn Starfire breaks into Titans Tower, bent on destroying Blackfire once and for all. Blackfire tries to help with sisterly loving actions, but Starfire makes it clear that she would not fall for that again. Blackfire finally gets her sister to stop momentarily by showing the doll that she had stolen from Starfire as a five-year-old child, and apologizing for it, also stating 'I've changed, now.'. Starfire disintegrates the doll and says \\"So have I\\", before shooting Blackfire with a bright green laser eye blast. Later, in Titans Tower, Blackfire and Starfire appear in the main lounge, causing the Titans to jump up and ask how it went. After Blackfire faints from exhaustion and pain, Starfire cheerfully states that they had \\"worked things out\\". Finally being given major speaking roles since her debut episode, Blackfire reappears in the Season 5 two-part episode \\"Girls Night In\\" as the \\"new alien threat\\" coming to Earth, having a major role since her debut episode in the Season 2 premiere. Raven and Starfire, alongside their fellow girls, fight Starfire's elder sister in an all-out battle to stop her from conquering Earth. Starfire still wants to do sisterly bonding, obliviously regardless to her elder sister's intense dislike and hatred of her. Doing her favorite game of \\"Truth or Death\\", Blackfire further shatters her younger sister's heart by stating the hard truth: That she wished she did not have a sister. At this, the heartbroken and furious Starfire combines with her fellow girls- Raven, Bumblebee, Ravager, Jinx and Terra- and beats Blackfire once again by pushing her into the portal where her army was coming through. In \\"We're Off to Get Awards\\", she appeared in a cameo when she was awarded \\"Best Tamaranian Princess\\" which infuriated Starfire. =DC Super Hero Girls= Hynden Walch reprises her role as Crown Princess Komand'r/Blackfire in the web series as a supporting character. Unlike Princess Koriand'r/Starfire, her appearance is not modeled after her original comic looks. She appears in \\"The Day of Funship\\", where she and Starfire are having some sisterly fun, which she gets bored with. At the zoo, she and Starfire use a Tamaranian nursery rhyme to defeat King Shark. Blackfire is leaving to return to Koragar Academy, but promises to see her younger sister for Tamaran Sovereignty Day, and admitted that she did have fun hanging out with her \\"kinifster\\" after all. In the two-part Season 4 episode \\"Tamaranean Dance Club\\", she appeared as two cameos to do the traditional Tamaranian dance (translates to\\"domination battle\\" in Tamaranian) against her younger sister Starfire, Wonder Woman, Supergirl and Batgirl, who defeated her and her fellow Korugar Academy students. Live-ActionTitans= Princess Komand'r (Blackfire) appears in the second season of the live-action television series Titans as a supporting character, portrayed by Damaris Lewis. In this version, as seen in the episode \\"Atonement\\", she has succeeded in seizing the Tamaranean throne and murdering the entire royal court, including her own parents. Komand'r also sends a mind-controlling parasite to infect a Tamaraean emissary, Faddei, to manipulate her younger sister into returning home. When her game of deception was discovered by Kory, she appears as a hologram and expresses the intense resentment and jealousy she had always felt towards Koriand'r and her closer and more loving relationship with their parents. When Kory declares that she is coming for her, Komand'r merely replies \\"good\\" and detonates a bomb to destroy her sister's ship, leaving Kory stranded on Earth yet again. In the finale, \\"Nightwing,\\" she uses another parasite to take over a woman in a parking lot and alter her body to resemble her own, before using her strength to shove a man aside for approaching her. Her eyes are shown to glow a bright lavender as she walks away. Komand'r is set to become the primary antagonist of the upcoming third season, with the intent of defeating her sister personally. FilmsJustice League vs. Teen Titans= When a frustrated Starfire is complaining about Damian Wayne's (Batman's illegitimate son) negative behavior to Nightwing when brushing her reddish hair after a shower, she said that he reminds her of her sister. =Teen Titans: The Judas Contract= Princess Komand'r/Blackfire is again mentioned/referenced when Starfire was rescued from the Gordanians by Robin, Kid Flash, Arsenal, Beast Boy, and Bumblebee (in a flashback which took place five years ago). She revealed that Blackfire had staged a coup and seized the throne, forcing Princess Koriand'r to flee Tamaran and land on Planet Earth. In the present, Beast Boy had told Terra that Starfire was \\"a refugee being stalked by her homicidal sister\\". =Dc Super Hero Girls: Intergalactic Games= With Hynden Walch reprising her role, Blackfire debuts in the second movie of the animated series. Unlike Starfire, her appearance is not modeled after her original comic looks; having straight waist-length dark purple hair.

According to legend, while performing in a play that made fun of baptism, he had an experience on stage that converted him. He proclaimed his new belief, and he steadfastly refused to renounce it, even when the emperor Diocletian ordered him to do so. Genesius is considered the patron saint of actors, lawyers, barristers, clowns, comedians, converts, dancers, people with epilepsy, musicians, printers, stenographers, and victims of torture. His feast day is August 25. Legend One day Genesius, leader of a theatrical troupe in Rome, was performing before the Roman Emperor Diocletian. Intending to expose Christian religious rites to ridicule by his audience, he pretended to receive the Sacrament of Baptism.Mershman, Francis. \\"Genesius.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 25 Jan. 2013 As the play continued, however, Genesius suddenly lay on the stage as if very ill. Two performers asked what was wrong. Genesius said he felt as if a weight was on his chest and he wanted it removed. Two actors, dressed as a priest and exorcist, were called on stage. He said he had had a vision of angels bearing a book listing all of his sins. The \\"priest\\" asked, \\"My child, why did you send for me?\\" Genesius said he could still see angels and asked to be baptized right there. The \\"priest\\" did so. Enraged, Diocletian had him arrested and sent to Plautia, prefect of the praetorium, to be tortured. Despite his agonies, Genesius persisted in his faith, and he was finally ordered to be beheaded. Burial and legacy Genesius is said to have been buried in the Cemetery of St. Hippolytus on the Via Tiburtina. His relics are claimed to be kept in San Giovanni della Pigna, Santa Susanna di Termini, and the chapel of St. Lawrence. His legend was dramatized in the fifteenth century. It was embodied later in the oratorio \\"Polus Atella\\" of L√∂we, and more recently in a play by Weingartner. The accuracy of the Acts, dating from the seventh century, is very questionable, though it was defended by Tillemont (M√©moires, IV s. v. Genesius). Nevertheless, Genesius was venerated at Rome as early as the Fourth Century. A church was built in his honor, and it was repaired and beautified by Pope Gregory III in 741. A gold glass portrait of him dating to the Fourth Century also exists.Grig, Lucy, \\"Portraits, Pontiffs and the Christianization of Fourth-Century Rome\\", p. 219, Papers of the British School at Rome, Vol. 72, (2004), pp. 203‚Äì230, JSTOR  Contemporary relevance  The veneration of St Genesius continues today, and the actor-martyr is considered the patron of actors and acting societies, including those that assist actors. The British Catholic Stage Guild regards him as their patron saint, and the Shrine of St. Genesius in Saint Malachy's Roman Catholic Church in the New York City Borough of Manhattan, serves as a spiritual landmark for the city's acting community. As the patron saint of epilepsy, many thus afflicted turn to him for his help. Because he is associated with stagecraft, Genesius is also venerated by stage magicians and illusionists. He is one of the patrons of the Catholic Magicians' Guild. A Genesian Theatre in Sydney, Australia hosts six seasons each year and is the centre of a vibrant amateur acting community. Other amateur companies around the world also use his name, including the Genesius Guild of Hammond, Indiana, which hosts an average of four productions each year and an annual children's theater camp, the Genesius Theater of Reading, Pennsylvania, basis for the Lincoln Center production of Douglas Carter Beane's \\"Shows for Days\\"http://www.lct.org/shows/shows-days/ starring Patti LuPone, Saint Genesius Productions of Villa Park, Illinois, a youth theatre group that aims to build leadership and community through the theatre arts.

He is best known for his appearances with Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation in the late-1980s and early-1990s. Championships held by Garvin over his career include the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. He headlined the Starrcade 1987 pay-per-view event. Professional wrestling career=Early career (1962 - 1984) Barnes started wrestling in 1962 under his birthname. In the mid-1960s he adopted the ring name \\"Ron Garvin\\" and formed a tag team with Terry Garvin, who was billed as being his brother. The duo teamed throughout the late-1960s and early-1970s, winning several regional tag team championships. They were managed by their other \\"brother,\\" Jimmy Garvin (actually Ron's stepson in real life). In the mid 1980s, Ronnie and Jimmy had a heated feud with the Rougeaus in International Wrestling in Montreal, Garvin's hometown. Garvin made a name for himself as a singles wrestler in the Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, and Tennessee territories in the late 1970s after splitting with Terry and Jimmy. Garvin wrestled in the Ron Fuller (Welch)-owned Knoxville promotion (Southeastern Championship Wrestling) where he (in)famously threw the championship belt off of the Gay Street Bridge. He later wrestled in Angelo Poffo's International Championship Wrestling promotion where he was best known for his heated rivalries with Randy Savage and Pez Whatley. One of Garvin's best-known ICW moments was where he knocked Ox Baker's dentures out of his mouth, after which Garvin stomped on the dentures. Garvin is well known in the Southeast, he had feuds with such wrestlers as Andre the Giant, Bob Orton Jr., and Tony Charles. For a time, Garvin used a gimmick known as Mr. Knoxville and formed a tag team with Charles, but soon Garvin turned on him and started teaming with Orton, turning heel in the process. Garvin held the NWA Georgia Television Title (also known as the National TV Title) 5 times, including a feud with then Legion of Doom member, Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts. At one point during the storyline, Jake Roberts held the TV title and refused to give Garvin a rematch. Garvin had to mortgage his house to come up with $10,000 to pay Roberts for a rematch. Garvin would go on to win the rematch and once again become the NWA National TV champion. Jim Crockett Promotions (1984 - 1988) Initial years (1984-1987) = Garvin then joined the National Wrestling Alliance's Jim Crockett Promotions, where he would achieve his greatest success. He became known as \\"The Man With the Hands of Stone.\\" He feuded with Tully Blanchard and Black Bart. He also formed a tag team with Barry Windham and the duo won the NWA United States Tag Team Championship from Ivan Koloff and Kruscher Kruschev before losing the belts to Koloff and Dick Murdoch. In particular, Garvin feuded with Jim Cornette's \\"Midnight Express\\" team of \\"Lover Boy\\" Dennis Condrey and \\"Beautiful\\" Bobby Eaton. At Starrcade '85 Garvin teamed with Jimmy Valiant to face the Midnight Express in an Atlanta Street Fight; for this match Garvin wrestled in drag as \\"Miss Atlanta Lively.\\" Garvin also had a singles feud with Cornette's bodyguard, Big Bubba Rogers to whom he lost a Street Fight at Starrcade '86. In 1987 Windham and Garvin feuded with Cornette's Midnight Express (still composed of Condrey and Eaton) over the United States tag titles. During one televised match, after Cornette threw fire in Garvin's face, Garvin's \\"brother\\" \\"Gorgeous\\" Jimmy Garvin came to his rescue, turning both himself and his valet Precious babyface in the process. The Garvin \\"brothers\\" teamed for a while against the Midnight Express. In May 1987 Windham and Garvin reached the finals of a tournament for the vacant United States tag team titles but lost to the new Midnight Express lineup of Eaton and \\"Sweet\\" Stan Lane. The two teams continued to feud over the titles, with the Garvins getting pinfall wins in non-title matches, or DQ wins when the titles were on the line. = NWA World Heavyweight Champion (1987) = The Garvins next entered in a feud with NWA World Champion Ric Flair in 1987 over Flair's lust for Precious. On one occasion when Flair defeated Jimmy to win a date with Precious, he was instead ambushed by Ron Garvin once again in drag as Miss Atlanta Lively. During this feud, Flair once stated that Garvin had \\"hands of stone,\\" This eventually led to Garvin's first moniker in wrestling, \\"The Man With the Hands of Stone.\\" The two had intense matches that sold out arenas. The two traded victories, with Garvin winning non-title matches and getting DQ wins on title matches, and Flair getting victories when the title was on the line. The feud with Flair took a new twist on September 25, 1987, when Garvin was able to defeat Flair for the title. With the NWA holding the 1987 Starrcade the same day WWF was holding its first Survivor Series, Crockett chose to face the strong WWF competition by having Flair win the title. Flair therefore had to lose the title first and whoever beat him would only be a placeholder champion. Most wrestlers declined the offer, but Garvin, assuming that at 42 it may be his last chance to hold the major NWA title, accepted to fill the role. Indeed, Garvin held the title for two months before losing it back to Flair at Starrcade. = Final feuds and departure (1987-1988) = After the title loss, the Garvins entered into a feud with Kevin Sullivan and his Varsity Club. At the Great American Bash, the brothers teamed with The Road Warriors and Steve Williams and defeated Sullivan, Mike Rotunda, Al Perez, Russian Assassin and Ivan Koloff in a Tower of Doom match. Later that night however, Ron Garvin shocked fans when he became a heel by knocking Dusty Rhodes out with a punch to keep him from winning Windham's U.S. Title, thus reuniting the former US tag team champions as heels. Garvin was managed by Gary Hart but left after only a few months as a heel before the August 12th card in Norfolk, VA after a disagreement. American Wrestling Association and World Wrestling Council (1988) Still as a heel, Garvin wrestled in the American Wrestling Association in late 1988 and feuded with Greg Gagne over the AWA International Television Championship. He also feuded with Carlos Colon over the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship during trips to Puerto Rico. World Wrestling Federation (1988-1990) Garvin next went to the World Wrestling Federation wrestling as a fan favorite under the name \\"Rugged\\" Ronnie Garvin. At the Royal Rumble (1989) he competed in the Royal Rumble match but got eliminated by Andr√© the Giant. He lost to Dino Bravo at WrestleMania V on April 2, 1989. He then went on to feud with Greg Valentine. After a televised match between the two on April 22, 1989, which Garvin won, Valentine was interviewed immediately afterwards and challenged Garvin a retirement match the next week, which Valentine won. Garvin soon started portraying a referee, but during matches, he would fight with the wrestlers who would not listen to his orders, such as Dino Bravo and the Brooklyn Brawler. Despite warnings by WWF president Jack Tunney, Garvin punched Valentine during his match against Jimmy Snuka, which led to him being banned from refereeing. At SummerSlam, Garvin served as special ring announcer for Valentine's match against Hercules. Garvin stated during his foe's introduction that Valentine was underweighing himself by 30 pounds, and had two left feet. When Valentine pinned Hercules with his feet on the ropes, Garvin announced Hercules as the winner. Valentine knocked him out of the ring, but Garvin came back and punched him out. Irate at Garvin's antics, Valentine asked that Garvin be reinstated so that he could get his hands on him. For the next four months the two had house show matches all over the country, trading victories in the process. The two then battled at the 1990 Royal Rumble in a Submission match, which Garvin won to end the feud. At Survivor Series (1989), Garvin competed in a 4-on-4 Survivor Series elimination match where he was a member of The 4x4s (Jim Duggan, Bret Hart, Garvin and Hercules) but they were defeated by The King's Court (Randy Savage, Canadian Earthquake, Dino Bravo and Greg Valentine). After his feud ended with Valentine, Garvin was about to feud with Rick Martel. They cut promos on each other, but a televised match between the two never happened. They did, however, wrestle at house shows, with Martel winning most of the encounters. Garvin left the WWF in November 1990. Later career (1990 - 2011) In the early 1990s, he wrestled in Jim Cornette's Smoky Mountain Wrestling promotion where he feuded with Paul Orndorff and Kevin Sullivan, among others.List of Smoky Mountain Wrestling alumni In 1993, Garvin wrestled at Archer Park in Prestonsburg, Kentucky during the annual 4 July carnival. He returned to the independents, mainly in The Carolinas, on a semi-retired basis and could still be found in 2005 as a wrestler or special referee in the Mid-Atlantic area. In 2011, \\"Rugged\\" Ronnie Garvin competed in the Legends Battle Royale at JCW:Icons and Legends entering the match third before being eliminated by Viscera. Post-wrestling career Garvin owns several used car dealerships in Gaston County, North Carolina.

Education and career At nineteen he entered Indiana Asbury College (later DePauw University), where he graduated with the highest honors of his class. He was a member of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, as well. Before graduation he had been elected to an instructorship in the Thorntown, Indiana academy, and in 1864, he was made its principal. This office he held until 1867, when he was chosen to fill the chair of languages at Baker University, Baldwin City, Kansas. During the same period he served as superintendent of the Lawrenceburg, Indiana public schools. In 1869 he was elected professor of English literature in Asbury College, and two years later he was assigned to the chair of belles-lettres and history of the same institution. In 1879 he was elected vice-president of the university, and he was largely the originator of the measures by which that institution was placed under the patronage of Washington C. DePauw, and took his name. In 1880 he received the degree of LL. D. from Syracuse University. Author In 1885 Ridpath left his position at the University to devote himself more to writing. In the later 1890s, he was editor of a magazine called The Arena. He wrote biographies of James G. Blaine, James A. Garfield, William Ewart Gladstone, and James Otis. His popular volumes of history were successful, and reissued many times. His publications include: *Academic History of the United States (New York, 1874‚Äì5) *Popular History of the United States of America (1876) *Grammar- School History (1877) *Inductive Grammar of the English Language (1878‚Äì9) *Monograph on Alexander Hamilton (1880) *Life and Work of Garfield (1881) *Life of James G.

Although Lombardi was influenced by the pies of Naples, he was forced to adapt pizza to Americans.

He is best known as the founding guitarist and songwriter for the rock band Smash Mouth (1994‚Äì2008, 2009‚Äì2011, 2014, 2018‚Äì2019). Camp is credited as the primary songwriter, whose songs catapulted the band to acclaim with hits, awards, and multi-platinum albums. Camp left Smash Mouth after 16 years and has remained an active songwriter and music producer. Biography Camp was born in West Covina, California, but attended Lynbrook High School in San Jose, California. Before Smash Mouth, he had been a musician in the California rock scene since the 1980s. He was part of several bands including the Gents, when Steve Harwell and Kevin Coleman approached him to form a new band. Camp declined, but Harwell and Coleman persisted, including harassing Camp with a morning pounding on his apartment window, until Camp agreed to look at the songs they had written. They formed Smash Mouth soon after. Camp has written Smash Mouth's most memorable songs of the later 1990s and early 2000s, including \\"Walkin' on the Sun,\\" \\"All Star,\\" and \\"Then the Morning Comes\\". Camp's song Heave-Ho was about his experience living in San Jose's St Leo neighborhood. He was the guitarist and backing vocalist from when he co-founded the band in 1994 until he left in summer of 2008. After leaving Smash Mouth, Camp released a solo album, Defektor, on Bar/None Records. Guitar Player wrote that the album \\"weaves together everything you love about vintage guitar tones, tortured Farfisa, '60s frat- rock vocal hooks, and epic Morricone-esque soundscapes.\\" In June 2009 Camp played a couple of concerts with Smash Mouth, but never rejoined the band. He also plays guitar and sings with Santa Cruz rock band The Maids of Honor and Los Angeles The Selectrics. Camp currently works as a songwriter and producer in Los Angeles.

They teamed from 1989 to 1991 in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Career=Before the masks Butch Reed had signed with Jim Crockett Promotions in 1988 after leaving the World Wrestling Federation he was billed as 'Hacksaw' Butch Reed and feuded shortly with the Junkyard Dog. Simmons had been with JCP for a while teaming with Eddie Gilbert but had not achieved much notoriety. Woman‚Äôs masked team When Rick Steiner and Scott Steiner started to team in 1989 a female fan (Robin Green) started following them around, professing her love for the cute and dorky Rick. Steiner's brother Scott and their manager Missy Hyatt began to have suspicions after the woman suddenly changed to a new vampy look. When the woman tripped Scott in the ring, causing him and Rick to lose to champions The Fabulous Freebirds, it briefly caused dissension among the brothers. In the end, she turned on the Steiners, adopting the name Woman and vowed that the brothers would meet their \\"doom\\" at Halloween Havoc 1989 but never made it clear who or what ‚ÄúDoom‚Äù was. At the night of the PPV Woman unveiled the Steiner Brothers' Doom ‚Äì a couple of brawny, hard hitting masked wrestlers. Doom won their debut match against the Steiners when one of the members of Doom pinned Rick Steiner after a headbutt with an illegal object in his mask. Doom followed up on this success by defeating Eddie Gilbert and Tommy Rich at Clash of the Champions IX, looking very strong in the process. At Clash, Woman's new bodyguard Nitron debuted accompanying Doom to the ring. Unfortunately Doom's next PPV outing did not come with the same success. Along with the Steiner Brothers, The Road Warriors, and The Samoan Swat Team they were entered in a one night, tag-team round robin tournament but did not score a single point ending dead last in the tournament. Doom's misfortune continued as Woman soon dropped the team to manage The Four Horsemen. Then on February 6, 1990, at Clash of the Champions X, Doom hit rock bottom when they were defeated by Rick and Scott Steiner and as a result of the stipulation were forced to unmask. Unmasked Freed of the masks and now under management of former referee \\"The Godfather\\" Teddy Long, Doom began to prosper. Being free to use their full move sets and not trying to hide who they were, Doom earned another shot at the Steiner Brothers. At Capital Combat Doom shocked the world when they beat the Steiner Brothers, a team that at that point in time did not lose very often. Doom won the tag-team titles and quickly set about defending them against the former champions the Steiners as well the rest of WCW's very talented tag-team division. Doom defeated The Rock 'n' Roll Express at The Great American Bash 1990 and also mauled such teams as Flyin' Brian & The Z-Man and The Southern Boys. In the fall of 1990 Doom soon got their hands full with The 4 Horsemen after a backstage altercation that saw the arrogant Horsemen insult Doom by not wanting to share a dressing room with them (this of course was a storyline). Doom then turned face and began a feud with The Four Horsemen. At Halloween Havoc 1990 \\"The Soul Brothers\\" Doom held on to their tag-team titles against Ric Flair and Arn Anderson despite both teams being counted out. A no rules rematch was signed for Starrcade 1990 but on the night Ric Flair was replaced by Barry Windham since Flair was slated to wrestle as The Black Scorpion in the main event. Once again the result was a ‚ÄúNo Contest‚Äù, this time due to a double pin (Windham pinned Simmons and Reed pinned Anderson at the same time) but despite the non-definitive finish the Doom/Horsemen feud ended shortly afterwards. At Clash of the Champions XIV Doom lost a non-title match to Sting and Lex Luger in a match that foreshadowed the trouble that lay ahead for Doom. Break up and beyond On February 24, 1991 at WCW's 1991 WrestleWar PPV Doom took on former tag-team champions The Fabulous Freebirds and lost due to miscommunication between Reed and Simmons. After the Freebirds left the ring Reed turned on Simmons and beat him up, turning Simmons face and supposedly ended the team of Doom forever. A month later, however, Reed and Simmons teamed up one more time at Starrcade '91 at Tokyo Dome, losing to the team of Bam Bam Bigelow and Big Van Vader. After the match, Reed and Simmons started brawling, causing NJPW and WCW stars to separate them, indicating Doom was no more. Teddy Long sided with Butch Reed as the former Doom partners engaged in a short but intense feud. The feud culminated at SuperBrawl I where Ron Simmons pinned Butch Reed in a Steel cage match (referred to as a \\"Thunder-Doom\\" cage match). After the PPV, Reed left the company allowing Ron Simmons to focus on other opponents while Teddy Long turned face and started to manage other talent in WCW. Long would appear in Simmons' corner occasionally after Ron became WCW World Heavyweight Champion in August 1992. Reunion Doom was briefly reunited on WWE's SmackDown on a few occasions that involved Teddy Long's wedding. Both Reed and Simmons appeared at Long's bachelor party and both were ushers in the wedding. At both occasions, Doom was mentioned.

Its headwaters and upper are in Skamania County in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, and its lower are in Clark County. The river, which meets the Columbia near the cities of Washougal and Camas, is a popular stream for fishing, swimming, and boating. Explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark referred to the Washougal River as the \\"Seal River.\\" The name Washougal comes from the Cascades Chinook placename [wasiixwal] or [wasuxal], meaning \\"rushing water\\". It has been suggested that D. B. Cooper, who hijacked a Boeing 727 in 1971 then parachuted from the plane with ransom money, may have landed in the Washougal River basin. Watershed The Washougal River drains of land that is largely forested, especially in its upper reaches in the Cascade Range and its foothills. Of the total, are in Skamania County, and the remaining are in Clark County. Small farms and rural homes are found along the lower part of the basin, and two small Clark County cities, Camas and Washougal, are at the river mouth. About 63 percent of the watershed is forested; 21 percent is devoted to fields, pastures, bare earth, and shrubland, and 16 percent is developed or cleared for development. The water quality of surface streams in the basin is rated \\"excellent\\" to \\"good\\", with a few exceptions. State and county officials monitor the lower reaches of the river for signs of trouble such as harmful bacteria, elevated water temperatures, and bank erosion related to forest clearing and other development. Two of the river's tributaries, Jones Creek and Boulder Creek, supply drinking water to Camas. Recreation The Washougal River, which has no dams, has significant fisheries. The main stem and some of the tributaries support populations of Chinook, chum, and Coho salmon, steelhead, and coastal cutthroat trout. Dougan Falls, from the mouth, blocks most fish migration beyond the waterfall. The Washougal River Greenway in Camas has fishing access, a short walking trail, a boat launch, and picnic sites. Much of the recreation access, including Dougan Falls, now requires a Discover Pass, Washington state's recreation fee pass.http://discoverpass.wa.gov/ A separate parking pass is required for Naked Falls, which is on private land and was closed to the public for several years but has now reopened. A series of waterfalls, some of them associated with swimming holes, are found along the main stream. From lowermost to uppermost, the named falls include Salmon, Dougan, Naked, Reeder, Stebbins Creek, and Docs Drop. Dougan Falls is a total of high and the largest drop is .

Biography Growing up in a working-class family in the East End of London, Stringer's interest in anthropology began in primary school, where he undertook a project on Neanderthals. Stringer studied anthropology at University College London,Stringer, C. (2006), Homo britannicus, p. 183, London: Penguin Books, holds a PhD in Anatomical Science and a DSc in Anatomical Science (both from Bristol University.University of Bristol Alumni ‚Äì Faculty of Medical and Veterinary Sciences Stringer joined the permanent staff of the Natural History Museum in 1973. He is currently Research Leader in Human Origins. Research Stringer is one of the leading proponents of the recent African origin hypothesis or ‚Ä≥Out of Africa‚Ä≥ theory, which hypothesizes that modern humans originated in Africa over 100,000 years ago and replaced, in some way, the world's archaic humans, such as Homo floresiensis and Neanderthals, after migrating within and then out of Africa to the non-African world within the last 50,000 to 100,000 years. He always considered that some interbreeding between the different groups could have occurred, but thought this would have been trivial in the big picture. However, recent genetic data show that the replacement process did include some interbreeding. In the last decade he has proposed a more complex version of events within Africa, which he has termed ‚Ä≥multiregional African origin‚Ä≥. He also directed the Ancient Human Occupation of Britain project which ran for about 10 years from 2001.

Biography Axel Nielsen was born at Nyk√∏bing Mors on the island of Mors in Denmark. His parents were J√∏rgen Nielsen (1859‚Äì1928) and Amalie Jacobsdatter (1861‚Äì1926). His father was a factory owner. He was the second youngest of nine children. He attended Staby vinterl√¶rerskole 1915‚Äì1916. His mother was originally from Sandermosen at Maridalen in Aker, Norway. He changed his surname to Sandemose in 1921. Sandemose boarded a schooner for Norway at the age of seventeen. He was a sailor and lumberjack in Newfoundland. He worked as a teacher at Nyk√∏bing in 1916 and at Glyng√∏re in Skive during 1917. In 1930, Sandemose moved to Norway, and lived in Nesodden south of Oslo. After the Nazi German occupation of Norway during World War II, he fled to Sweden in 1941 due to his peripheral association with the Norwegian resistance movement. After the liberation of Norway, he moved back and settled in S√∏ndeled. Sandemose published his first book in Denmark during 1923. His most notable work was En flyktning krysser sitt spor (1933). The novel was translated into English and published under the title A Fugitive Crosses His Tracks in 1936 by Alfred A. Knopf. In this novel, Sandemose introduced the concept of the Law of Jante, a listing of ten cultural rules which describe a pattern of group behaviour towards individuals common to Nordic countries. He was also an essayist and journalist. For a number of years he had a regular column in the weekly magazine Aktuell. Sandemose was awarded the Dobloug Prize during 1959 and was one of six finalists for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1963.

He was noted for playing Poppie on the television sitcom Seinfeld and Chico Gonz√°lez in Dirty Harry. Early life Santoni was born in New York City on April 21, 1938. His family was of French (Corsican) and Spanish descent. He began his career in Off-Broadway theatre, writing the play Raisin' Hell in the Son which premiered in 1962. Career Santoni's first significant film role was an uncredited appearance in the 1964 film The Pawnbroker (starring Rod Steiger), in which he played a junkie trying to sell a radio to the title character (using anti-Semitic slurs to no effect). His first leading role was as a young actor in Enter Laughing. He was cast into the role of delivery boy David Kolowitz after being scouted by Carl Reiner; the film was a semi-autobiographical story about the latter. Santoni went on to play Inspector \\"Chico\\" Gonz√°lez in the 1971 film Dirty Harry. His character, who is a newcomer detective and college graduate in sociology, was initially dismissed by the title character as \\"a college boy\\". He ultimately uttered the memorable phrase, \\"No wonder they call him Dirty Harry; [he] always gets the shit end of the stick\\". Santoni again collaborated with Reiner in the comedic homage to the film noir genre, Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid (1982). His other film roles during this decade included prison official Ramon Herrera in Bad Boys (1983), as well as Detective Tony Gonzales in the action film Cobra (1986) opposite Sylvester Stallone. He featured in the short-lived series Sanchez of Bel Air and Manimal, in which he played Nick Rivera. He was described by Tracy Newman as having a completely different personality from the characters he played, which were most frequently cops, crime lords, or judges. She noted his reputation among friends as being \\"the funniest guy in the room\\". Santoni made guest appearances on television shows such as Barnaby Jones, Lou Grant, Hawaii Five-O, Hardcastle and McCormick, Hill Street Blues, The Odd Couple and Midnight Caller. In 1973, Santoni played a junior partner on Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law. His most notable later role was as \\"Poppie\\", the bombastic, antiabortion, neurotic, and very unhygienic restaurateur in Seinfeld. Personal life Santoni was married to Lisa James. He subsequently had a long-term relationship with actress and director Betty Thomas, and a son named Nick. Death Santoni died on August 1, 2020, at a hospice in Los Angeles at the age of 82. He had several health issues during his last years, including cancer.

It consists of Aceyalone, Myka 9, P.E.A.C.E., and Self Jupiter. They are part of the Project Blowed collective. History While in high school in the late 1980s, Aceyalone, Myka 9, and Self Jupiter formed the short-lived MC Aces, a precursor to Freestyle Fellowship, at the Good Life Cafe in Los Angeles, California. Subsequently, former high school friend P.E.A.C.E. was added to form Freestyle Fellowship. Freestyle Fellowship released the debut studio album, To Whom It May Concern..., in 1991. In 1993, the group released the second studio album, Innercity Griots. Freestyle Fellowship went on hiatus due to the incarceration of Self Jupiter. In 1998, the group reunited to record the Shockadoom EP, which would be released in 2002. The group released Temptations in 2001, and The Promise in 2011. Style and influences According to Los Angeles Times, Freestyle Fellowship incorporates \\"jazz rhythms into its raps, which have the improvisational ebb and flow and the random explosiveness of a jazz solo.\\" In a 1993 interview with Los Angeles Times, the group's member Myka 9 said, \\"What we are is liberators, liberating rap from its R&B;/funk structures--that 4/4 (time) prison.\\" The group has been described by LA Weekly as \\"the astral jazz-cracked geniuses of sherm-strafed South Central, rapping with caged bird cadences about sleeping on park benches, biblical books, and gangsta rap carpetbaggers.\\" Discography=Studio albums * To Whom It May Concern...

Terminology The neologism religiocentrism combines religio- (e.g., religiophobia) and -centrism (e.g., Eurocentrism). Derivations include religiocentric or religio-centric. Although the precise origins of religiocentrism and religiocentric remain unclear, the words have been used since the early 20th century. The American economist Adrian Augustus Holtz (1917:15) described how early German school reforms were \\"carried on in a way that allowed for a religio-centric educational system.\\" Sinclair Lewis's Main Street (1920:307) said, \\"Maud Dyer was neurotic, religiocentric, faded; her emotions were moist, and her figure was unsystematic.\\" The related term Christocentric theologically means \\"forms of Christianity that concentrate on the teaching of Jesus Christ\\", but is sometimes used as a near synonym of religiocentric. For instance (Hamilton 2002), \\"No matter where it appears, government-sponsored Christocentrism, or even religiocentrism, undermines this nation's ideals.\\" Academic studies Religiocentrism is commonly discussed in contexts of psychology, sociology, and anthropology. The Australian social psychologists John J. Ray and Dianne Doratis defined religiocentrism. > \\"Ethnocentrism\\" is the social scientist's value-neutral term for ethnic or > racial prejudice. It refers to ethnically-based sentiments of exclusiveness > without any implication of their moral worth or justifiability... By > analogy, the term religiocentrism is derived here to mean religiously based > sentiments of exclusiveness‚Äîbeliefs that one should marry within one's own > religion, work with members of one's own religion, and in general prefer > members of one's own religion above others. This will also entail ipso facto > devaluative judgments of other religions. (1971:170) Ray and Doratis designed a groundbreaking attitude scale to measure religiocentrism and ethnocentrism. Their religiocentrism scale comprises 33 items (for instance, \\"I think my religion is nearer to the truth than any other\\" and \\"Most Moslems, Buddhists and Hindus are very stupid and ignorant\\"), with five-point Likert scale psychometric response options from \\"Strongly agree\\" (Scored 5) to \\"Strongly disagree\\" (1). To verify internal consistency among respondents, 11 items were reverse scored (\\"It makes no difference to me what religion my friends are\\" is the converse of \\"I think that it's better if you stick to friends of the same religion as your own\\"), resulting in a reliability coefficient of .88 among 154 first-year university students. The authors tested attitudes among Australian fifth-form students in two Catholic and two public schools, and discovered that neither ethnocentrism nor religiocentrism showed any correlation with religious background. Ray and Doratis concluded (1971:178), \\"Ethnocentrism, religiocentrism and religious conservatism were all shown to be separate and distinct factors of attitudes in their own right. They are not just three aspects of the one thing. Religiocentric people do however tend to be both religiously conservative and ethnocentric.\\" The Hungarian-Jewish historian and anthropologist Raphael Patai mentions religiocentrism as a variable in relationships between religion and culture, > Each religion also has a definite outlook on its own value in relation to > that of other religions. Its relationship to other religions may range from > complete toleration to the complete lack of it, with a corresponding range > of self-evaluation. This variable, best called religio-centrism (on the > analogy of ethnocentrism), can serve as an additional avenue of approach to > the study of our subject. (1954:234) Comparing Middle Eastern, Far Eastern, and Western cultures, Patai finds, > Religion in the Far East is characterized by the absence of religio- > centrism: there is a marked toleration of other religions and a mutual > borrowing and influencing; in the Middle East and in the West there is a > high degree of religio-centrism, with intolerance and scorn of other > religions: each religion is exclusive and regards itself as the \\"one and > only\\" true faith. (1954:252) In a later survey of the potentials for world peace, Patai differentiated the major modern religions between \\"theistic\\" and \\"nontheistic\\". > The three great monotheistic religions of the Middle East and the West, > Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, are the foremost theistic religions and > the dominant faiths of about one half of mankind. Common to all theistic > religions is a pronounced religiocentrism, expressed most poignantly in the > conviction that one's own religion is the one and only true one, and that > all the other faiths are erroneous and hence depreciable. In this conviction > were rooted the great religious wars which pitted, not only Muslims against > Christians, but also various Muslim sects against one another, and likewise > made various Christian denominations bitter enemies... The situation is more > hopeful in the great nontheistic religions of South, Southeast, and East > Asia. These religions, notably Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, > Confucianism, and Taoism, lack the element of self-assurance and certainty > that each is the exclusive possessor of the only truth. (1987:24-25) In response, Andrew Wilson, Professor of Scriptural Studies of the Unification Theological Seminary, criticized Patai's opinion as theologically plausible but historically erroneous, citing examples (1987:28) of \\"rampant communal violence between Hindus and Buddhists in Sri Lanka and between Sikhs and Hindus in India.\\" Religiocentrism has a specialized meaning for sociologists (Chalfant, Beckley, and Palmer 1994:51). \\"This term is related to a common word used in sociological literature, ethnocentrism. Similarly, we might refer to feelings of rightness and superiority resulting from religious affiliation as religiocentrism. Religiocentrism inhibits the ability of a society to achieve adaptation, integration and goal-attainment.\\" Mohammed Abu-Nimer, the Director of the Peacebuilding and Development Institute at American University, distinguishes between religiocentrism and \\"religiorelativism\\". > A religiorelative person is firm in his/her belief that other religions have > the right to exist and be practiced, even if such norms and beliefs are > contradictory to one's own set of religious beliefs. Such a person is prone > not to engage in violence or discriminatory actions against the others. In > contrast, a religiocentric person is a believer who denies other religions' > \\"truth\\" and who holds an absolute truth that leaves no room for different > religious practices. Such a person becomes more prone to dehumanize, > exclude, and discriminate against other religious groups and individuals. > Often, as a result of negative and destructive exposure and experience with > conflict and war, religiocentric beliefs not only are exacerbated and easily > translated into violence against the enemy (that is, the different other), > but also actually grow and prohibit human and peaceful contact with the > other. However, there are conflict resolution and peace-building activities > and forums that can assist peace workers in such settings to transform a > religiocentric into a religiorelative believer. (2004:497) Abu-Nimer (2004:479-501) analyzes three typical reactions of a religiocentric person to another religion: denial (e.g., Israel not allowing Arabs to purchase or use state land), defense mechanisms (\\"There is no salvation outside the Church\\"), and minimization (\\"We are all the children of God\\").

History Paul Jones had previously managed The Barbarian (Sione Vailahi) in National Wrestling Alliance's (NWA) territories during 1985‚Äì1987, while The Warlord (Terry Szopinski) and joined the NWA in late 1986 where he was managed by Baby Doll. Soon The Warlord and Doll left the NWA and went to the Central States area where Jones was managing The Barbarian. A feud then took place between The Warlord and The Barbarian. Doll soon stopped managing The Warlord, and The Warlord and The Barbarian stopped feuding. Jones then started to manage The Warlord as well and teamed him up with The Barbarian as The Powers of Pain.Inside Wrestling, December 1988 issue, article:The Powers of Pain who they are and why you can't trust them. Later on Jones brought The Powers of Pain to the NWA in late 1987. Jim Crockett Promotions (1987-1988) After Paul Jones and the Powers of Pain came to the National Wrestling Alliance's Jim Crockett Promotions in late 1987, they were joined by Ivan Koloff. The Powers then began feuding with The Road Warriors. During their feud, they attacked the Road Warriors during a bench press contest between the two teams, ramming Road Warrior Animal's head into a stack of weights. A (legitimate) eye socket injury suffered by Animal at the time was attributed in kayfabe to the Powers' actions. Later during their feud, the Powers won the World Six-Man Tag Team Championship with Ivan Koloff from the Warriors and Dusty Rhodes. They feuded for several more months until the Powers left the NWA while still the champions with Koloff when the Powers refused to do scaffold matches. As a result, the Powers and Koloff were stripped of the titles. World Wrestling FederationTag Team Championship pursuit (1988-1989)= The Powers of Pain made their first appearance on June 18, 1988 on a house show in South Bend, Indiana and defeated WWF World Tag Team Champions Demolition (Ax and Smash) via countout in their first match. Upon their arrival, the Powers of Pain were faces managed by Tito Santana.Warlord and Barbarian - Demolition's Nightmare - Pro Wrestling Illustrated November 1988PWI Poll - The Powers Of Pain - Pro Wrestling Illustrated December 1988 They feuded with Demolition who had defeated Strike Force (Santana and Rick Martel) for the titles and then injured Martel (kayfabe). The Powers of Pain were introduced as mercenaries to help Martel and Santana gain revenge on Demolition for both the title loss and the injury to Martel. At the 1988 SummerSlam, The Baron debuted as their manager, leading them to victory over The Bolsheviks (Nikolai Volkoff and Boris Zhukov). The Baron would leave the WWF in early November. They became heels while Demolition became faces when Mr. Fuji attacked Demolition at the 1988 Survivor Series and aligned himself with the Powers of Pain. The Powers of Pain went on to win the match when they eliminated the foreign heel team The Conquistadors. The feud with Demolition ended at WrestleMania V when the Powers Of Pain teamed with Fuji and lost to Demolition when Ax pinned Fuji. =Various feuds and split (1989-1990)= Following their failure to win the titles, the Powers of Pain feuded with teams such as The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart), The Bushwhackers (Luke and Butch) and The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty). At the 1989 Survivor Series, they along with Zeus were a part of Ted DiBiase's \\"Million Dollar Team\\", losing to the \\"Hulkamaniacs\\" team of WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan, Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts and WWF Tag Team Champions Demolition. The Barbarian and The Warlord each eliminated members of Demolition, only to both be disqualified from the match for double teaming Hogan. In March 1990, the team split, with Mr. Fuji selling Barbarian's contract to Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan while selling Warlord's contract to Slick. Their final match as The Powers of Pain came on March 25 in Hershey, Pennsylvania when they were defeated by Hulk Hogan and the Big Boss Man. =Reunion (1991-1992)= They reunited in Japan at Super World Sports on October 28, 1991 defeating George and Shunji Takano. Although not officially reunited as a tandem, The Warlord and The Barbarian would team again on January 18, 1992 at a house show in Boston, Massachusetts, losing to The New Foundation (\\"The Rocket\\" Owen Hart and Jim \\"The Anvil\\" Neidhart). World Championship Wrestling (1995-1996) Upon returning to the independent circuit, The Powers of Pain won the WWWA Tag Team Championship together on the independent circuit in the early 1990s before later debuting for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in November 1995. The team was put under masks as the Super Assassins and were managed by Col. Rob Parker. They only had five matches together (two wins over The American Males and The State Patrol and losses to The Nasty Boys and Sting and Lex Luger) before The Warlord left WCW due to injuries and retired in early 1996, while Barbarian stayed and formed The Faces of Fear with former Heenan Family stablemate Haku, who by then went by the name, Meng. Independent circuit (2003-present) They lost to The Dream Team at the Road Warrior Hawk Memorial Show on November 11, 2003. They later reformed their team in 2005 for Gladiator Championship Wrestling (GCW). The Powers of Pain reunited on September 16, 2012, in Chikara, taking part in a gauntlet match, from which they eliminated their old WWF rivals, Demolition, before being eliminated themselves by 1-2-3 Kid and Marty Jannetty. The Powers of Pain continue to wrestle occasionally, including schedule matches for Big Time Wrestling (BTW) in February 2016. Other media They filmed a shoot interview in 2004 with RF Video and spoke about their careers. In 2008, they introduced an energy drink in association with Gladiator Championship Wrestling.

History Hyper was launched in 1993 by Next Media with Stuart Clarke as editor's. Clarke had previously edited Megazone; a then multi-platform magazine published by Sega Ozisoft, before being taken over by Mason Stewart publishing in September 1993 and being made Sega only. Clarke left Megazone at the time of the Mason Stewart takeover, when he was asked by Next Media publisher, Phil Keir, to start a new multi-platform gaming magazine. Clarke recounted the events in Hyper's 100th issue: > \\"Just as I was starting to relax, Phil Keir, owner of Next Media and > publisher of Rolling Stone, rang me at home one night to ask a few > questions. Before I knew it he had asked me to set up a brand new games > magazine ‚Äì one that I created and controlled completely! So after a few > nano-seconds of thought I said, 'Um, okay then'.

The population was 5,971 at the 2010 census. The town contains a village called Tupper Lake. Until July 2004, the town was known as \\"Altamont\\", not to be confused with the village of Altamont in Albany County. History In 1850 the Pomeroy Lumber Company began a logging operation in the area. A clearing left by clear-cutting the forest by Raquette Pond became the site of the village of Tupper Lake. In the 1890s, a large number of buildings were erected, but in 1899 a fire burned 169 of them to the ground. As the lumber business swelled, the village of Faust became a railroad hub, and so the village of Tupper Lake prospered. In the 1940s the villages of Faust and Tupper Lake combined to become the village of Tupper Lake. The former village of Faust began where Main Street meets Demars Boulevard and continued west beyond the cemetery. The former village of Faust is now known as \\"The Junction\\", still called to this day by the people of Tupper Lake. It was so named due to the junction of railroad lines located in Faust. The only reference left to the town of Faust is the Faust Motel, located on Main Street. The Faust Roundhouse (one of the largest buildings in the area at the time) was located behind Web Row and near the railroad station. It burned to the ground in the 1940s. The Oval Wood Dish Corporation mill was located in the area between the villages of Faust and Tupper Lake and was originally owned by the Sisson family of Potsdam, New York. The area encompassing the mill and the houses and apartments built across from the mill for the workers was called \\"Sissonville\\". Through neglect the buildings eventually went to ruin and were demolished. The large smokestack bearing the letters \\"OWD\\" in the center of town still stands as an icon of Tupper Lake's lumbering past. The town of Altamont was organized in 1890 from the town of Waverly and was the last town organized in the county. In 1913, a part of St. Lawrence County was added to the town of Altamont. In an effort to avoid confusion with other \\"Altamonts\\" around the state and to strengthen ties with the village of Tupper Lake, town councilors changed the town name from \\"Altamont\\" to \\"Tupper Lake\\" on July 16, 2004. As of 2013 logging remained a business/industry in Tupper Lake but the winter season, when roads are frozen and can support heavy logging equipment, has been growing shorter. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 9.80%, is water. The town is inside the Adirondack Park. The south town line is the border of Hamilton County, and the west town line is the border of St. Lawrence County. Tupper Lake is a water body in the southwest part of the town, and crosses the county line into St. Lawrence County. New York State Route 3 joins New York State Route 30 at Tupper Lake village; the highways are conjoined through the eastern part of the town. The Raquette River, a northwest flowing tributary of the St. Lawrence River, flows past Tupper Lake village. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 6,137 people, 2,429 households, and 1,530 families residing in the town. The population density was 52.2 people per square mile (20.1/km2).

It is also used for people with kidney stones who have high urine cystine levels, rheumatoid arthritis, and various heavy metal poisonings. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include rash, loss of appetite, nausea, diarrhea, and low blood white blood cell levels. Other serious side effects include liver problems, obliterative bronchiolitis, and myasthenia gravis. It is not recommended in people with lupus erythematosus. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. Penicillamine works by binding heavy metals; the resulting penicillamine‚Äìmetal complexes are then removed from the body in the urine. Penicillamine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1970. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical uses It is used as a chelating agent: * In Wilson's disease, a rare genetic disorder of copper metabolism, penicillamine treatment relies on its binding to accumulated copper and elimination through urine. * Penicillamine was the second line treatment for arsenic poisoning, after dimercaprol (BAL). It is no longer recommended. In cystinuria, a hereditary disorder in which high urine cystine levels lead to the formation of cystine stones, penicillamine binds with cysteine to yield a mixed disulfide which is more soluble than cystine. Penicillamine has been used to treat scleroderma. Penicillamine can be used as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) to treat severe active rheumatoid arthritis in patients who have failed to respond to an adequate trial of conventional therapy, although it is rarely used today due to availability of TNF inhibitors and other agents, such as tocilizumab and tofacitinib. Penicillamine works by reducing numbers of T-lymphocytes, inhibiting macrophage function, decreasing IL-1, decreasing rheumatoid factor, and preventing collagen from cross-linking. Adverse effects Bone marrow suppression, dysgeusia, anorexia, vomiting and diarrhea are the most common side effects, occurring in ~20‚Äì30% of the patients treated with penicillamine. Other possible adverse effects include: * Nephropathy * Hepatotoxicity * Membranous glomerulonephritis * Aplastic anemia (idiosyncratic) * Antibody-mediated myasthenia gravis and Lambert‚ÄìEaton myasthenic syndrome, which may persist even after its withdrawal * Drug- induced systemic lupus erythematosus * Elastosis perforans serpiginosa2nd edition. * Toxic myopathies * Unwanted breast growth Chemistry Penicillamine is a trifunctional organic compound, consisting of a thiol, an amine, and a carboxylic acid. It is structurally similar to the Œ±-amino acid cysteine, but with geminal dimethyl substituents Œ± to the thiol. Like most amino acids, it is a colorless solid that exists in the zwitterionic form at physiological pH. Of its two enantiomers, L-penicillamine (having R absolute configuration) is toxic because it inhibits the action of pyridoxine (also known as vitamin B6). That enantiomer is a metabolite of penicillin but has no antibiotic properties itself. A variety of penicillamine‚Äìcopper complex structures are known. History John Walshe first described the use of penicillamine in Wilson's disease in 1956. He had discovered the compound in the urine of patients (including himself) who had taken penicillin, and experimentally confirmed that it increased urinary copper excretion by chelation. He had initial difficulty convincing several world experts of the time (Denny Brown and Cumings) of its efficacy, as they held that Wilson's disease was not primarily a problem of copper homeostasis but of amino acid metabolism, and that dimercaprol should be used as a chelator. Later studies confirmed both the copper-centered theory and the efficacy of D-penicillamine. Walshe also pioneered other chelators in Wilson's such as triethylene tetramine dihydrochloride and tetrathiomolybdate. Penicillamine was first synthesized by John Cornforth (Somerville College, Oxford) under supervision of Robert Robinson. Penicillamine has been used in rheumatoid arthritis since the first successful case in 1964.  Cost  In the United States, Valeant raised the cost of the medication from about US$500 to US$24,000 per month in 2016.

Career In the summer of 1996, following a gig in a basement acoustic club in Wolverhampton, Round was given a three-night support at Ronnie Scott's club in Birmingham. This led to support slots with the likes of David Gray, Miles Hunt, Ben Christophers, Mark Eitzel, Cousteau, Elbow, I am Kloot, Turin Brakes, Ed Harcourt and Ryan Adams, who after she supported him in Birmingham, invited her to be his guest at his London shows. At these shows, they again performed their co-written song \\"Idiots Dance\\" and \\"Come Pick Me Up\\" as encores. The following months saw Round joined by Simon Jason Smith on double-bass, Marcus Galley on drums and guitarist Tom Livemore. Their first gig together was a special one-off supporting Coldplay at the Birmingham Songwriters Festival. This band recorded debut album The First Blood Mystery at Magic Garden Studios with friend and producer Gavin Monaghan. The album was recorded and mixed in ten days, and released in the UK through Animal Noise in 2001. Round then toured the UK with Glenn Tilbrook. She returned in 2003 with The Disconnection, again recorded at Magic Garden Studios with Gavin Monaghan. The album was released in the UK with a cover shot by Anoushka Fisz (wife of Dave Stewart from the Eurythmics who supported her since), then released in 2004 with a different, less visually disturbing cover photo, on Interscope in the US. The album garnered comparisons to Bj√∂rk, Jeff Buckley and Robert Plant. Round promoted The Disconnection with a tour of the UK in late 2003, and another tour in January 2004. This was followed by a month-long tour of the US before returning to the UK for another tour with Damien Dempsey and James Blunt. Round moved to LA in 2005 to produce Slow Motion Addict with Glen Ballard, which featured a more accessible, electronic-embellished sound. The album's release was delayed by a full year, but was eventually released in the US in 2007. That same year, she appeared on \\"Cruel Melody\\", the title track of the debut album of Black Light Burns, a band fronted by Limp Bizkit guitarist Wes Borland. Also in 2007, Round was chosen as Annie Lennox's support act for her US tour, which was followed by dates in the UK later that year and in early 2008. On 12 May 2009, Round released a five-track EP called Things You Should Know. The EP is available on general digital release, with physical copies available only at her shows. Pre-orders of the digital EP came with two extra tracks ‚Äì acoustic versions of \\"Do You\\" and \\"For Everything a Reason\\". A video and a remix are available for the first track on the EP, \\"Backseat\\". In fall 2009 Round became a touring member of Puscifer, Maynard James Keenan of Tool's Arizona based project, working on their album Conditions of My Parole and began opening the live shows. During this time, Round also sang on The Twilight Singers' album Dynamite Steps. She also worked with Ballard again and Oscar-nominated composer John Debney on a song composed for the film Valentines Day. She wrote with Academy Award nominee Marco Beltrami, as well as finishing up an album with her alt-country side project Early Winters, which was self-released earlier in the year. Her songs 'For Everything A Reason' and 'Do You' are featured in the FX series American Horror Story. In October 2011 it was announced that Round would be touring with Puscifer again. She opened for Puscifer at the Seattle, Washington opening show of the North American Conditions of My Parole tour on 7 November 2011. This was in addition to performing as a member of Puscifer. Carina Round released Tigermending, an 11-track album produced by Round and Dan Burns on 1 May 2012 via Dehisce Records and distributed through The Orchard. Collaborators include Dave Stewart and Brian Eno (\\"The Secret of Drowning\\") and Billy Corgan (\\"Got to Go (2000 Years BC Mix\\"). She also appears as a guest vocalist on Valleyheart, the 2013 album by Canadian singer-songwriter Justin Rutledge, who is one of Round's bandmates in Early Winters. She also contributed vocals to the song \\"Turn Around\\" from his album \\"Early Widows.\\" In April 2013 she performed with Puscifer at Coachella and Lollapalooza Chile and Brazil. In February 2014 she appears as a guest vocalist on the track, \\"I Feel\\" on Sierra Swan's album \\"Good Soldier\\", produced by Billy Corgan. She also appeared as a vocalist on tracks \\"In My Room\\" and \\"The Truth Is...\\" from Sierra Swan's album \\"Girl Who Cried Wolf\\" and collaborated with Sierra Swan in addition to Joel Shearer, Blair Sinta and Curt Schneider on a project called \\"Pushka,\\" contributing vocals. in 2014 she collaborated with Aiden Hawken on the song \\"Come Undone\\" from the album Making Patterns Rhyme: A Tribute to Duran Duran.

The village was settled during the town's lumber production period and grew after it gained railroad service. The early village was composed of two parts, Tupper Lake proper and Faust. The town for a time held the distinction as the top lumber producer in the state. The great fire of 1899 burned more than 169 structures in the village, two-thirds of them homes. The modern village grew out of this destruction and added all the amenities of a modern community earlier than many other villages in the state. Tupper had its own department store and synagogue, and its sprawling railway yards, driven by the lumber trade, made it a hub for the surrounding Adirondack communities.

The site is now known as Beaver Bank Villa. Base history RCAF Station Beaver Bank was approximately 40 km (25 mi) north of the twin cities of Halifax-Dartmouth.* The station sat on 430 acres (1.7 km¬≤) with about a half a mile (800 m) separation between the domestic and the operations site; both sites being divided by the county line between Halifax County (domestic site) and Hants County (operations site). The 22 Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron was the operational unit posted to the station, its colours having been created in 1953 and the unit made operational a year later in the fall of 1954. The radar unit itself was manually operated and reported to the Fredericton NORAD Sector at RCAF Station St. Margarets until September 1962 when this was changed to the Bangor NORAD Sector at Topsham AFS. The 22 AC&W; became SAGE-operational on January 1, 1964 however this capability did not last long as the station was closed and the squadron disbanded 4 months later on April 1, 1964 following a NORAD realignment and increasing focus being placed on the DEW Line. After the closure of the base, it had been used briefly as a cement factory. RCAF Station Beaver Bank occupied a unique location in proximity to Canada's largest Atlantic seaport and its biggest naval base, making it an important early warning radar during the manual environment of the 1950s. Since manned bomber raids by the Soviet Union in the area were considered quite likely, it was felt that RCAF Station Beaver Bank fulfilled a critical role in the early days of Canada's and North America's air defence. The station was originally financed by the United States Air Force, although operational responsibility rested with the RCAF, until 1962 when the RCAF assumed financial responsibility as well. Beaver Bank Villa In the mid-70s the base was converted to a concrete plant. This was only used for a few years before the base was abandoned, then resold. The base headquarters were turned into a nursing home called Ivy Meadows which is run by the Rosecrest family. The retirement home still stands, though the surrounding area is abandoned and most of the other buildings were demolished in 2004.

Career overview The most significant portion of Osteen's career was spent with the Dodgers. A \\"Bonus Baby\\" who never really received a season-long chance to start in Cincinnati, he was traded on Sept. 16, 1961, from Cincinnati to the Washington Senators for pitcher Dave Sisler. With the Senators, Osteen finally got a chance to start regularly in the big leagues, albeit with a consistently sub-.500 team. After posting a winning record (15‚Äì13) in 1964, he was in much demand that winter. On December 4, 1964, Osteen was traded by the Senators to the Dodgers in a 7-player deal, with five players (two of whom were Frank Howard and Pete Richert) going to the Senators. Osteen developed into one of the game's better starters in Los Angeles. After two years with an earned run average (ERA) under 3.00 (‚Äì), Osteen was considered a top-notch starter and a workhorse. In those two years, Osteen and the Dodgers reached two straight World Series (the only two he would reach in his career). In the 1965 World Series, the Dodgers went on to beat the Minnesota Twins in 7 games, with Osteen pitching brilliantly. He had a 0.64 ERA in the Series, with a 1‚Äì1 record including a shutout, which came after teammates Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax had lost their respective games (the first two games of the Series). In the 1966 World Series, the Dodgers were beaten by the Baltimore Orioles in four games. Osteen was charged with the loss, in a 1‚Äì0 pitcher's duel with Wally Bunker in Game 3, despite giving up only three hits in seven innings; a home run by Paul Blair accounted for the game's only run. Osteen's final postseason statistics include a 0.86 ERA with seven strikeouts in 21 innings pitched. Osteen, circa 1959 In , Osteen reached his first All-Star game. His season totals included going 17‚Äì17, with a 3.22 ERA, in 288 innings pitched. He hurled 14 complete games, with five shutouts. In , Osteen was one of the game's consistent hard-luck losers; despite a very respectable 3.08 ERA, he only won 12 of 30 decisions. The 12 victories would be his fewest in a season from 1964‚Äì1973; the 18 losses tied him with Ray Sadecki for the major league lead. In , Osteen won 20 games for the first time and set a number of career highs, including 321 innings pitched, 183 strikeouts, 16 complete games, and 7 shutouts. In the 1970s, Osteen was still pitching an average of 260 innings a year. In the 1970 All-Star game, Osteen pitched three shutout innings, notching the win, in a game most remembered for the play in which Pete Rose barreled into Ray Fosse to score the winning run in the 12th inning. Coincidentally, like Osteen, the pitcher and hitter involved in the walk-off single were also Tennessee natives: Jim Hickman (who had been a Dodger teammate of Osteen's in 1967) collected the hit off losing pitcher Clyde Wright (coincidentally, Hickman and Wright would become Comeback Players of the Year in their respective leagues). In , Osteen had a particularly strong year, finishing with 7 complete game victories in his last 9 starts. That year, he was 20‚Äì11, with a 2.64 ERA, in 252 innings pitched. Osteen in 1961 Osteen made his 3rd and final All-Star team in 1973, in what would prove to be his last real quality MLB campaign ‚Äî and his last season with the Dodgers. That year, while pitching for a 2nd-place Dodger team, Osteen went 16‚Äì11 and posted a 3.31 ERA, while logging 33 starts, 12 complete games, and 3 shutouts. He had achieved double-figure wins each year, for 10 consecutive seasons (1964‚Äì1973). Prior to the season, the Dodgers traded Osteen to the Houston Astros for outfielder Jimmy Wynn. Wynn helped the Dodgers win the 1974 NL pennant The Astros traded Osteen to the St. Louis Cardinals in August of 1974. On September 11, 1974 he pitched 9 innings of relief against the New York Mets in a 25 inning game, won by St. Louis 4-3. He did not figure in the decision. In April 1975, he was release by the Cardinals and was signed by the Chicago White Sox, for whom he played his final game on September 27, 1975. That following spring, when Osteen no longer fit in the ChiSox‚Äô future plans, the team released him. Over the course of an 18-year professional career, Osteen compiled 196 wins, 1,612 strikeouts, and a 3.30 ERA. As a batter, Osteen had a lifetime .188 batting average, with 8 home runs, and 76 runs batted in (RBI). He was used as pinch hitter on a number of occasions. Defensively, he recorded a .971 fielding percentage which was 18 points higher than the league average at his position. Beginning in , Osteen became a big league pitching coach for the Cardinals, Philadelphia Phillies, Texas Rangers, and Dodgers. He also coached various minor league teams.

The transport history is long and varied, with much of the road network still based on the Roman model, and the once extensive rail network a shadow of its former self.  Roads  Being on the economic periphery of England, Lincolnshire's transport links are less well developed than many other parts of the United Kingdom. The road network within the county is dominated by single-carriageway A roads and the minor B roads rather than motorways or dual carriageways ‚Äì the administrative county of Lincolnshire is one of the small number of UK counties without a motorway (the M180, the principal link between South Yorkshire and the North Sea coast, runs exclusively within the boundaries of North Lincolnshire). Three trunk roads are located in Lincolnshire, these are maintained by Highways England, a public owned company that is responsible for trunk routes across England. These are the A1, A46 & A52. Following a north-south axis, the most important route into and out of the county is the A1 (formerly the Great North Road) linking the county with London and south-east England as well as the important population centres of northern England and Scotland. The A1 is entirely a dual carriageway in Lincolnshire. The A46 reaches across the entire county, from Newick to Grimsby. The A46 is a trunk route between the county boarder near Newick to Lincoln, this section of road is almost entirely a Dual Carriageway, beyond Lincoln, the A46 is maintained by the local council and is entirely single carriageway. The A57 is entirely Single Carriageway in Lincolnshire, West of the A1 it is a trunk route, East of the A1 it is maintained by the local council. Other important routes in Lincolnshire include the A15, A16, A17 & A158. The A15 & A16 run on the north-south axis, the with A16 being near the West coast, while the A15 being between the A1 and A16. Both routes are almost entirely single carriageway with small amounts of dual carriageway in built up areas. The A17 & A158 run on the east-west axis, the with A158 being located north of the A17. The A17 has the most rural dual carriageway distance of any of the roads in Lincolnshire, with Dual Carriageways being present at Beckingham, Sleaford & Holbeach. Partly because of its fast and flat (but deceptively undulating) roads, Lincolnshire has one of the worst road accident records of the UK counties (as measured in terms of road fatalities per head of population). In a national effort to cut the number of speed-related deaths and injuries, the county's residents became early guinea pigs in a programme to roll out speed cameras across the country.  Bus  Bus services within the county are also limited in number, due to the inherent economic feasibility of serving a scattered population living across an area with low population density. Many smaller villages in the county have no regular bus service, making access to a private vehicle the only practical means of living in many parts of the county. The services that do exist almost exclusively serve the large population centres (e.g. Lincoln, Grantham, Boston, Skegness, Grimsby, Cleethorpes, Scunthorpe) and mid-sized market towns (e.g. Horncastle, Gainsborough) and a number of their dormitory and commuter villages. The main bus company in the county, Stagecoach in Lincolnshire, was bought out by Stagecoach in late 2005. Stagecoach Grimsby-Cleethorpes runs buses in North East Lincolnshire Smaller companies like the Delaine Buses and Kimes offer local services of considerable importance. A group of five of them offer integrated services under the InterConnect banner, including dial-up requested routings. Rail The low population density of the county means that the number of railway stations and train services is rather low considering the county's large physical size. A large number of the county's railway stations were permanently closed in the 1950s and 1960s, many following the Beeching Report of 1963. An early closure (in 1959) was the whole of the former Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway line through Sutton Bridge, Spalding, and Bourne and west to the Midlands. No obvious alternative to this route was available, and the loss has affected development and caused road congestion ever since. One of the first railways to close in Lincolnshire was the Earl of Ancaster's estate railway, which ran from the East Coast Main Line at Little Bytham, through the Grimsthorpe estate to Edenham. It operated until the 1870s.Pearson, R. E & Ruddock, J. G. Lord Willoughby's Railway (Willoughby Memorial Trust. 1986) A daily through train service operated between Cleethorpes and London King's Cross via Grimsby, Market Rasen and Lincoln until 1993 when it was discontinued due to issues with the length of the platforms at Lincoln not being long enough for InterCity 125 trains. This necessitated passengers changing trains at Newark North Gate when travelling to or from the capital. However, the East Coast Main Line passes through the county and so it is possible to catch direct trains to London, Leeds or Edinburgh from Grantham. In December 2008 a daily East Midlands Trains service from Lincoln to London St Pancras, via Nottingham was introduced. In the summer of 2008, a major refit of Lincoln station improved signalling and customer facilities but did little to change the platform length issue. TransPennine Express trains from Cleethorpes run to Manchester Airport, passing through Scunthorpe and connecting to the East Coast Main Line at Doncaster before continuing via Sheffield. East Midlands Railway services between Skegness and Nottingham pass through Boston, Sleaford and Grantham. Stamford station is served hourly with an east-west CrossCountry service between Peterborough and Leicester. An hourly East Midlands Railway service from Norwich to Liverpool stops at Grantham. Airports Lincolnshire has its own airport (Humberside Airport) in the north of the county at Kirmington (a former Royal Air Force bomber airfield), between Scunthorpe, Grimsby and Lincoln. Several others are fairly easily accessible by either road or rail. * Humberside Airport (HUY) * Doncaster Sheffield Airport (DSA) * East Midlands Airport (EMA) * Leeds Bradford Airport (LBA) * Stansted Airport (STN) * Manchester Airport (MAN) Canals Lincolnshire is served by the Foss Dyke canal, an ancient waterway of Roman origin, which connects the River Trent and the River Witham. Brayford Pool is the inland basin in the city, once a busy transhipment point. The Witham is navigable to Boston. Access between Brayford pool and the Witham is by the Glory Hole, a low medieval bridge spanning the river. The \\"Air Draught\\" under the bridge is given as 9 feet 2 inches. The River Ancholme is also navigable with the Caistor Canal branch (now disused), as are some of the larger drains in the Fens, such as the South Forty-Foot Drain and the Witham Navigable Drains. The Fens Waterways Link is a scheme for waterways improvement for leisure boating. It proposes a new navigation between the South Forty-Foot Drain and the River Witham. The new lock gates at Black Sluice in Boston were officially opened in March 2009. Much work remains to be done on the Forty-foot before the dream can be realised of travelling from Lincoln to Cambridge. The Horncastle Canal dates back to 1792, linking the town of Horncastle to the Witham and incorporating the route of the earlier Tattersal navigation.J.N. Clarke, The Horncastle and Tattershall Canal (Oakwood Press, 1990) At least a century before what is normally called the Canal Age the Stamford Canal and Louth Canal were in use with modern style locks and towpath construction. Bourne and Sleaford had navigable river access until well into the 20th century and there are plans afoot to re-open the Sleaford Navigation. The Grantham Canal ran for 33 miles (53 km) from Grantham through 18 locks to West Bridgford, where it joined the River Trent. It is currently under restoration.

Here, one of the Budweiser Clydesdales is wearing a horse blanket. A horse blanket or rug is a blanket or animal coat intended for keeping a horse or other equine warm or otherwise protected from wind or other elements. They are tailored to fit around a horse's body from chest to rump, with straps crossing underneath the belly to secure the blanket yet allowing the horse to move about freely. Most have one or two straps that buckle in front, but a few designs have a closed front and must be slipped over a horse's head. Some designs also have small straps that loop lightly around the horse's hind legs to prevent the blanket from slipping sideways.Price The Whole Horse Catalog rev. ed. p. 192-194 Protection from the elements Standard horse blankets are commonly kept on a horse when it is loose in a stall or pasture as well as when traveling. Different weights are made for different weather conditions, and some are water-resistant or waterproof. Modern materials similar to those used in human outdoor wear are commonly used in blanket manufacture. Blankets are sometimes used to keep the horse's hair short. If horses are blanketed at the beginning of the autumn, especially if kept in a lighted area for 16 hours a day, they will not grow a winter coat. Blankets also protect horses that are kept with a short clipped hair coat for show purposes. When a horse is given a full body clip, or even a partial \\"trace clip\\", it needs to have a blanket kept on at all times if the weather is cool because the horse no longer has the natural insulation of a longer hair coat. If a blanket is put on a horse at the beginning of the winter in order to suppress the growth of a winter coat, or if the horse is kept clipped in cold weather, the blanket cannot be taken off until warmer weather arrives in the spring. If a horse is subjected to cold weather without either a blanket or a natural hair coat to keep it warm, it may become ill, and vulnerable to sicknesses such as influenza. A hood, showing openings for eyes and ears Horses wearing knotted cord fly sheets, 1910 Heavy blankets for warmth make up the bulk of the horse blanket market, but lightweight blankets may be used in the summer to help the animal ward off flies and to prevent the hair coat from bleaching out. Such blankets are usually called a \\"sheet\\" or a \\"fly sheet\\". They are usually made of some type of nylon or strong synthetic fiber, but with the capacity to \\"breathe\\" so that the animal remains cool. Most have a smooth nylon lining in front to prevent hair from wearing off on the shoulders. They are becoming increasingly popular, particularly with the rise of insect borne diseases such as West Nile fever. A horse wearing a summer fly sheet with attached neck cover, light blankets ward off insects and prevent coat bleaching Any blanket may be supplemented with a neck cover or a full hood. Neck covers are often attached directly to the blanket. Hoods are a separate piece of horse \\"clothing\\", which cover the neck and come down the head to just above the muzzle of the horse, with holes cut for the eyes and ears. Summer weight hoods and neck covers help keep away insects and are also frequently used to keep a horse clean before a horse show. Winter weight hoods are used for warmth. Saddle blankets A police horse wearing a quarter sheet A blanket or pad used under a saddle when a horse is being ridden is called by many names, including a saddle blanket, saddle cloth, numnah, and saddle pad. They usually do not cover the horse's entire body, though a hybrid design that is a cross between a saddle blanket and a horse blanket, called a quarter sheet, is a blanket placed under the saddle but which covers the horse from shoulder to hip while riding. Quarter sheets are sometimes used in cold weather to keep a horse's muscles loosened up when warming up for competition, or on horses that may have to stand around when under saddle and run the risk of stiffening up if their muscles get chilled. Other designs A horse wearing a cooler A cooler or a mantle, is a large, nearly square blanket with ties that is draped over a horse that is hot and sweaty from an intense workout, or one that has just been bathed and is wet all over. It is commonly made of wool or synthetic fleece, though a few designs are made of woven cotton. It is worn as the horse is being walked to cool down and allows enough air circulation for the horse to dry, but slows the rate of drying to prevent the horse from becoming hypothermic. It is designed so it can be tied shut in front; most designs have a small browband which can be used to keep it positioned well up on the neck, and it may have a loose cord that goes beneath the tail to prevent the wind from blowing it off from the rear, but usually it has no other straps or attachments. It is intended to be used on a horse while the animal is being led or held by a person, and not left on an unattended horse. In windy weather, a loose surcingle may be added to prevent the cooler from blowing completely off. A traditionally-shaped blanket of loosely crocheted cotton, called an anti-sweat sheet, is used to absorb moisture.Anti-sweat sheet photo Often used alone to wick moisture from the surface of the horse, if placed under a cooler, it is removed when it becomes wet. A barrier blanket is sometimes used in Australian Thoroughbred racing. This blanket weighs about 40 kilograms and is placed over the horse prior to entering the starting stalls. It is then tied to the back of the stalls after the horse has been loaded and remains in the barrier as the horse jumps. Quite a few horses respond positively to it and are more easily loaded and are calmer in the stalls.Racing See also *Horse care *Horse tack *Rug (animal covering) NotesReferences * Price, Steven D.

These submarines saw their most extensive use during World War II, although their operational significance remained rather small. The most famous of them were the Japanese s and the , although small numbers of similar craft were built for other nations' navies as well. Most operational submarine aircraft carriers, with the exception of the I-400 and AM classes, used their aircraft for reconnaissance and observation. This is in contrast to the typical surface aircraft carrier, whose main function is serving as a base for offensive aircraft. Early history (World War I) SM U-12 with a seaplane on deck Germany was the first nation to experiment with submarine aircraft carriers, initiated by the Imperial German Naval Air Service commander Oberleutnant zur See Friedrich von Arnauld de la Peri√®re who commanded a unit of two Friedrichshafen FF.29 reconnaissance seaplanes in Zeebrugge. One of the first U-Boats to arrive at the Zeebrugge base was Kapit√§nleutnant Walther Forstmann's , which was to play the role of a submarine aircraft carrier. The unarmed FF-29 seaplanes were modified to carry bombs. On 25 December 1915, one of the newly modified aircraft flew across the English Channel and up the River Thames, dropping bombs on the outskirts of London, although they caused only minor damage. It was pursued by British fighters but returned to base safely. On this first bombing mission it was apparent that the aircraft suffered more from a lack of range. Encouraged by this success, Arnauld and Forstmann theorized that they could increase the range by carrying the aircraft off the British coast on the deck of submarine in a takeoff position, then launching an aircraft by partially submerging, allowing the seaplane to float off. On 6 January 1915, U-12 made a launch of an FF-29 off its deck in Zeebrugge within the safety of the breakwater Zeebrugge Mole. The aircraft was then lashed athwartships again and the submarine left the harbor, seemingly dwarfed by the wingspan of the biplane, which stretched almost ‚Öì of the length of the small coastal patrol submarine. U-12 carried the FF-29 for 30 miles before flooding the forward tanks and letting the seaplane float off the deck without much difficulty, after which the plane took off. Arnauld originally intended to rendezvous with the sub, but decided against it. After gaining altitude, Arnauld left for the British coast which he apparently flew along undetected before returning to Zeebrugge. Although the aircraft had been carried out to sea and had safely floated off the submarine's deck it was obvious improvements were needed in the procedure and setup. Arnauld and Forstmann proposed further experiments to the German Naval Command, but were vetoed as their project was considered impractical. The plans were reinvestigated in 1917 in the hope that they would increase the striking power of new German subs such as the long-range cruiser-type Unterseeboote, which were to be equipped with small scouting seaplanes that could be assembled and dismantled onboard and stored in special compartments on deck - but the idea was abandoned as the war came to an end. Two of the aircraft designs created for that purpose were the biplane Hansa Brandenburg W.20 and low-wing monoplane Luftfahrzeug Gesellschaft L.F.G. Stralsund V.19. The first type was designed in 1917 for use aboard the Cruiser submarines that never went into service. The British also experimented with the aircraft-carrying submarine concept when was fitted out in a manner similar to the German U-Boat but for the purpose of intercepting German airships as they crossed the North Sea. It was capable of launching two Sopwith Schneider floatplanes in 1916. However, just as in the German experiment, the aircraft were carried unprotected on the deck and the submarine was unable to submerge without losing them. Between the wars=France French submarine Surcouf Surcouf was a French submarine ordered in December 1927, launched 18 October 1929, and commissioned May 1934. At 4,000 tons (3,600 tonnes) displacement submerged, Surcouf was the largest submarine in the world at the start of World War II. Her short wartime career is laced with controversy and conspiracy theories. Surcouf was designed as an \\"underwater cruiser\\", intended to seek and engage in surface combat. For the first part of that mission, it carried an observation float plane in a hangar built into the after part of the conning tower; for the second part, it was armed with not only 12 torpedo tubes but also a twin gun turret forward of the conning tower. The guns were fed from a magazine holding 60 rounds and controlled by a director with a rangefinder, mounted high enough to view a horizon. In theory, the observation plane could direct fire out to the guns' maximum range. Anti-aircraft cannons and machine guns were mounted on the top of the hangar. Italy Italian submarine Ettore Fieramosca The Regia Marina (Italian Navy) ordered , a submarine with a waterproof hangar for a small reconnaissance seaplane in the late-1920s. In 1928 Macchi and Piaggio each received orders for suitable aircraft which resulted in the Macchi M.53 and the Piaggio P.8, but the program was cancelled, and the submarine's hangar was removed in December 1931, before Ettore Fieramosca was delivered. Japan The Japanese applied the concept of the \\"submarine aircraft carrier\\" extensively, starting with the J2 class I-6 and the J3 class of 1937‚Äì38. Altogether 42 submarines were built with the capability to carry floatplanes, one such vessel being . United Kingdom After the loss of the heavy gun-carrying and the Washington Naval Treaty which restricted the armament of vessels which were not capital ships, the remaining M-class submarines were converted to other uses. By 1927, had entered service with a waterproof hangar for a Parnall Peto seaplane with folding wings, which could be launched and recovered with the aid of a derrick. In October 1928, she was fitted with a hydraulic catapult which allowed the seaplane to be launched from a ramp on the forward casing. The submarine and her plane could then provide reconnaissance ahead of the fleet, submerging when threatened.Flightglobal Archive - Aviation History - Flight, July 31, 1931 (pp. 759-763) HMS M2 herself was lost in 1932, and plane-launching submarines were abandoned by the Royal Navy. United States Loening XSL-1 in Langley wind tunnel The United States began studying the concept in 1922 when two Caspar U.1 seaplanes were purchased from Germany for evaluation at Anacostia Naval Station. One aircraft was later lost during an exhibition flight in 1923, but they provided useful technical information. The United States Navy ordered six Cox-Klemin XS-1s and six Martin MS-1s, both small seaplanes that like the Caspar U-1 could be disassembled easily. Both were tested aboard S-1 during October and November 1923. Later, Cox-Klemm built the improved XS-2 model, and Loening built the XSL, but the Navy had lost interest in the concept by then.\\"New Fold Plane For Submarines\\", February 1931, Popular Science bottom of page 33\\"Airplane Folds Into Tube To Fit Submarine\\" Popular Mechanics, April 1931 page 535 Problems with launching and recovering the aircraft, and the limited military value caused interest in the concept to wane, and news that the British submarine M2 had sunk during trials in 1933, and damage to the XSL\\"Plane Folds To Fit Space In Submarine\\" Popular Science, June 1933, bottom of page 14 during testings on the sheltered waters of the Anacostia River ended further U.S. Navy development. World War II=Germany The Kriegsmarine (German navy) also started development of submarines capable of launching aircraft and ordered four very large \\"cruiser\\" U-boats in early 1939. These boats were to be twice as large as any existing U-boat and were to have had a crew of 110 while carrying a single Arado Ar 231 floatplane, but were canceled at the outbreak of war later that year. Although not strictly an aircraft, some U-boats carried the Focke-Achgelis Fa 330 (English: Wagtail). It was a type of rotary-wing kite, known as a gyroglider or rotor kite. They were towed behind German U-boats during World War II. =Type IX D 2-\\"Monsun\\"= Another German long range U-boat was the Type IX D2 \\"Monsun\\", used in the Indian Ocean and Far East Area based in Penang (Occupied Malaya). To aid such submarines the observation \\"Autogyro-Kite\\" Focke-Achgelis Fa 330 \\"Bachstelze\\" (Wagtail) was developed. This was used in the Indian Ocean and sporadically in the Southern Atlantic but its use hindered the submarine's ability to submerge quickly. The Flettner Fl 282A \\"Kolibri\\" reconnaissance-helicopter was also planned to be used from long range submarines. This single seat helicopter was manufactured of welded steel tubing and was sized so that it could be stowed with rotor blades and landing gear removed in a diameter by long pressured hangar on the U-boat's deck. The Fl 282 \\"Kolibri\\" was never deployed on a German submarine. Japan The Japanese applied the concept of the submarine aircraft carrier extensively. Altogether 47 submarines were built with the capability to carry seaplanes. Most IJN submarine aircraft carriers could carry only one aircraft, though a few types could carry two, and the giant I-400 class submarines could carry three. =Type B1 (20 units)= B1 type submarine. The Type B1 (I-15 Series) submarines (I-15, I-17, I-19, I-21, I-23, I-25, I-26, I-27, I-28, I-29, I-30, I-31, I-32, I-33, I-34, I-35, I-36, I-37, I-38, I-39) were the most numerous type of submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. In total, 20 were made, starting with number I-15, which became the name of the series. These submarines were fast, had a very long range, and carried a single Yokosuka E14Y seaplane, located in a hangar in front of the conning tower, which was launched by a catapult. The series was rather successful, especially at the beginning of the war. In 1942, I-26 crippled the aircraft carrier . I-19, on 15 September 1942, fired six torpedoes at the carrier , two of which hit the carrier and crippled it, with the remaining torpedoes damaging the battleship and the destroyer which sank later. I-25 conducted the only aerial bombings ever on the continental United States in September 1942, when an aircraft launched from it dropped two incendiary bombs on a forest near the town of Brookings, Oregon. =AM Type (I-13, I-14)= The AM (A Modified) type submarine was a large seaplane-carrying submarine, with a hangar space for two aircraft. These giant submarines were originally of the A2 type, but their design was revised after construction started so that they could carry a second aircraft. The seaplanes were to be the Aichi M6A1 bomber carrying bombs. The range and speed of these submarines was remarkable ( at ), but their underwater performance was compromised, making them easy targets. I-13 was sunk on 16 July 1945 by the destroyer escort and aircraft action from the escort carrier about east of Yokosuka. I-14 surrendered at sea at the end of the war, and was later scrapped. =Sentoku Type (I-400, I-401, I-402)= An I-400 class submarine, with its long plane hangar and forward catapult The I-400-class submarine displaced 6,500 tons (5,900 tonnes) and was over long, three times the size of ordinary submarines. It had a figure-eight hull shape for additional strength to handle the on-deck hangar for housing the three Aichi M6A Seiran aircraft. In addition, it had three anti-aircraft guns and a large deck gun as well as eight torpedo tubes from which they could fire the Long Lance - the largest, longest ranged and most deadly torpedo in use at the time. Three of the Sen Toku were built, I-400, , and I-402. Each had four engines and enough fuel to go around the world 1¬Ω times, more than enough to reach the United States from either direction. The submarines were also able to carry three Sei ran aircraft (the Aichi M6A), each carrying a bomb at . Its name was combination of sei (\\"clear sky\\") and ran (\\"storm\\"), literally \\"storm out of a clear sky,\\" because the Americans would not know they were coming. It had a wing span of and a length of . To fit the aircraft into the hangar, the wings of the aircraft were folded back, the horizontal stabilizers folded down, and the top of the vertical stabilizer folded over so the overall profile of the aircraft was within the diameter of its propeller. A crew of four could prepare and get all three airborne in 45 minutes, launching them with a catapult on the fore deck of the giant submarine. Postwar studies The US Navy produced sketch designs of rather fanciful submarine aircraft carriers in 1946 and 1952. The 1946 study had a projected hull classification symbol of SSV, and was initially envisioned to carry two XA2J Super Savage bombers for strategic nuclear strike, or four F2H Banshee fighters. Various watertight hangar and takeoff-landing ramp configurations produced potential lengths ranging from to , the latter with double the aircraft for a surfaced displacement of 34,000 tons (the Russian Navy's Typhoon-class submarine, the largest ever built, is a mere 24,000 tons surfaced). The 1952 study was slightly more realistic, carrying three F2Y Sea Dart seaplane fighters, with a topside launching ramp for rough seas (the Sea Dart could only take off on a calm sea). This would still be a large submarine, projected at long and 9,000 tons submerged, with a nuclear power plant to achieve . A more economical plan was also conceived to convert World War II fleet submarines to carry a seaplane version of the A4D Skyhawk in a similar manner to the Regulus missile-equipped SSGs, using hydro-skis for takeoff as the Sea Dart did. Future designs No submarine aircraft carriers remain in use, but the concept reappears periodically. The ability to make a stealth attack has an allure, but sustained air operations largely negate the advantage of being submersible, and the size limitations preclude sizable sustained aerial operations. Furthermore, any submarine large enough to be useful would be vulnerable to detection and counterattack. Combined with the cost for such a specialized vessel, it is unlikely that any navy would consider their construction worthwhile. In addition, submarine launchable cruise missiles increasingly incorporate limited surveillance capabilities, allowing them to serve as both strike weapons and disposable reconnaissance drones; this further reduces the value of operating aircraft from submarines. There are, however, several projects to develop UAV launch and recovery capabilities. There are three methods for doing so: launching out of a torpedo tube, out of a vertical ICBM launch tube, or from a custom designed unit either in the sail or mounted on the hull. The US Navy has recognized the need for more advanced littoral combat capability, to counter growing area-denial asymmetric threats that this type of vessel could provide. The German type 212 submarines have the capability to launch UAVs.

Yrj√∂ Kalervo Sotamaa (born 25 September 1942 in Helsinki) is a Finnish designer and design strategist. Sotamaa is Professor Emeritus of Design Innovation in the Aalto University School of Art, Design and Architecture and President Emeritus of the University of Art and Design Helsinki (TAIK). He served as the President of TAIK from 1986 until 2008. He earned his MA in Interior Architecture and Furniture Design from TAIK, where he studied with Kaj Franck and Antti Nurmesniemi. Career During his studies (1965‚Äì1969) in the Institute of Art and Design (later University of Art and Design and now Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture) Yrj√∂ Sotamaa was President of the Institute's Student Union TOKYO. He was pushing for reforms in design education, founded the Scandinavian Design Students Organization SDO in 1966 and organized by SDO a series of high-profile international seminars and conferences (Industry, Environment, Design in Suomenlinna, 1968, Finland and Working Environment in Otaniemi, 1967, Finland) to discuss the social, ecological, economical, environmental challenges facing the Nordic societies and reforms in design education. In 1967 and 1968 he invited to the seminars leading thinkers in design and architecture of the time including Victor Papanek, Buckminster Fuller, Christopher Alexander and Hans Palmstjerna. He also published their lectures and writings in the famous &/SDO Magazine 2/1968 in 1968, which has been recently included to two major exhibition of the cultural radicalism in 1960's: You Say You Want a REVOLUTION? Records and Rebels 1966‚Äì1970,V&A; Publishing, 2016. and Victor Papanek: The Politics of Design,Vitra Design Museum, 2018. . This led to a close friendship with Papanek and Fuller and later active cooperation with them. In 1969‚Äì1970 Sotamaa was a Visiting Professor at Purdue University (USA) by the invitation of Professor Victor Papanek and was a close collaborator of Papanek for several years.

President Sotamaa had also a visible role in the development of the Art and Design City, the Arabianranta area of Helsinki where the University is situated, under the notion of the Living Lab. The concept was first put forward by MIT Professor William Mitchell, in terms of a research methodology for sensing, prototyping, validating and refining complex solutions in multiple and evolving real life contexts.Living Lab Art and Design City become an international benchmark for innovation driven future city development. He has also played a visible role in renewing the Finnish university system and is the \\"father\\" of the Helsinki Innovation University project, named Aalto University, which started operating on 1.1.2010.Innovation University Sotamaa has also played a key role in the creation of the Finnish and Danish national design policies, the EU User Driven Innovation Policy and the reinforcement of the position of design in the Finnish Innovation System. Finnish Innovation System Sotamaa has held a number of expert positions. Sotamaa was elected in 2001 to be the first President of CUMULUS, the International Association of Universities and Colleges of Art, Design and Media (2001-2007). Cumulus is today the most important global association to serve art and design education and research. It is a forum for partnership and transfer of knowledge and best practices.

Production An underlining theme of Sotamaa's activities has been related to forwarding sustainable development through innovative design and international collaboration. The culmination of this work was the Kyoto Design Declaration in 2008 emphasizing the importance of human centered design thinking. Sotamaa has been also actively involved in university policies and produced numerous publications and articles on university autonomy, academic quality systems and internationalizing university education. The international design production of Sotamaa includes two major international exhibitions: Varde and Q - Designing the Quietness. Varde was produced by six major Nordic Design Universities with the support of the Nordic Council of Ministers. Over 300 students of the six schools were addressing the future challenges of the world and producing visions of the future through their works. The exhibition was first presented in the Royal College of Art in London and toured around the world in 1994‚Äì1996 in Rome, Berlin, Budapest, Barcelona, Sapporo, Taipei, Seoul, Linz and Helsinki. Q -Designing the Quietness was a major event of the Feel Finland program in Japan in 2003 and was first presented in the Living Design Center Ozone in Tokyo and later in 2004 in Fiskars Design Village, Finland. Books on the themes of the exhibitions were published in 1994 and in 2003. The most recent major projects chaired by Sotamaa were the Radical Design Week in Shanghai 2012, the largest Finnish-Chinese joint initiative since Finland participation to world Expo 2010, The Sino Finnish Challenge (main event in China celebrating 100th year of Finnish Independence in 2017), and the five year Life in Future Cities Program based on Finnish-Chinese cooperation. Sotamaa's major policy publications include works on university autonomy, academic quality, art and design policy. The Economic Autonomy of the Finnish Universities (Yliopistojen taloudellinen autonomia, Finnish University Rectors Council, 2002) laid foundations on the expansion of the autonomy and the reform of Finnish Universities in 2008. The other university publications include: Quality in Focus (Laatu polttopisteess√§, Finnish University Rectors Council, 2002). Sotamaa was chairperson of the expert groups writing both of the publications. The latest publication edited by Sotamaa, Jokinen and Haapoja, Out of the Box, deals with the 2010 Finnish University Reform.Keuruu 2017. .

City of Calgary - Calgary's +15 Skywalk The system is so named because the skywalks are approximately 15 feet (approximately 4.5 metres) above street level. (Some Plus 15 skywalks are multi-level, with higher levels being referred to as +30s and +45s.) History Centennial Place and the Canterra Tower in 2009 The system was conceived and designed by architect Harold Hanen, who worked for the Calgary Planning Department from 1966 to 1969. This development earned him the 1970 Vincent Massey Award for Merit in Urban Planning. Opening in 1970, the +15 network has expanded to include 59 enclosed bridges connecting dozens of downtown Calgary buildings. The central core of the system is a series of enclosed shopping centres, and the city's flagship department stores. New developments were required to connect to the walkway system; in exchange for this, they were offered more floorspace (the \\"bonus density\\"). When not physically able to connect to nearby buildings, developers contribute to the \\"Plus 15 Fund\\", managed by the city, used to finance other missing connections.City of Calgary - Plus 15 System Impact The system has been identified with a decline in street life in the Downtown Commercial Core.\\"+15 User Survey\\", a City of Calgary study published in 1998 Street life is instead concentrated on streets (such as Stephen Avenue) or in neighbourhoods where there are no bridges (such as Eau Claire and the Beltline). In 1998, the city began to re-evaluate the system. Part of the goal of these studies was reinvigorating decreased daytime street life on some downtown streets. The possibility of limiting expansion to encourage more pedestrian street traffic was raised. The system's bridges are integral to the buildings they serve. City planning by-laws now confer tax credits to owners who connect new buildings to the system. Businesses and the general public make extensive use of the system's enhanced flow of human traffic.

The yaw system is located between the wind turbine nacelle and tower. The yaw drive is an important component of the horizontal axis wind turbines' yaw system. To ensure the wind turbine is producing the maximal amount of electric energy at all times, the yaw drive is used to keep the rotor facing into the wind as the wind direction changes. This only applies for wind turbines with a horizontal axis rotor. The wind turbine is said to have a yaw error if the rotor is not aligned to the wind. A yaw error implies that a lower share of the energy in the wind will be running through the rotor area. (The generated energy will be approximately proportional to the cosine of the yaw error).  History  When the windmills of the 18th century included the feature of rotor orientation via the rotation of the nacelle, an actuation mechanism able to provide that turning moment was necessary. Initially the windmills used ropes or chains extending from the nacelle to the ground in order to allow the rotation of the nacelle by means of human or animal power. Another historical innovation was the fantail. This device was actually an auxiliary rotor equipped with plurality of blades and located downwind of the main rotor, behind the nacelle in a 90¬∞ (approximately) orientation to the main rotor sweep plane. In the event of change in wind direction the fantail would rotate thus transmitting its mechanical power through a gearbox (and via a gear-rim-to-pinion mesh) to the tower of the windmill. The effect of the aforementioned transmission was the rotation of the nacelle towards the direction of the wind, where the fantail would not face the wind thus stop turning (i.e. the nacelle would stop to its new position).Wind Power Plants, R. Gasch and J. Twele, Solarpraxis, The modern yaw drives, even though electronically controlled and equipped with large electric motors and planetary gearboxes have great similarities to the old windmill concept. They still use a means of mechanical energy ‚Äúproduction‚Äù (i.e. electric motor), a method to increase the torque (i.e. gearbox) and a gear-rim mounted on the fixed portion of the wind turbine and in constant mesh with the output gear of the said gearbox.  Types  The main categories of yaw drives are: * The Electric Yaw Drives: Commonly used in almost all modern turbines. * The Hydraulic Yaw Drive: Hardly ever used anymore on modern wind turbines.  Components  Schematic representation of a typical yaw drive  Gearbox  The gearbox of the yaw drive is a very crucial component since it is required to handle very large moments while requiring the minimal amount of maintenance and perform reliably for the whole life-span of the wind turbine (approx. 20 years). Most of the yaw drive gearboxes have input to output ratios in the range of 2000:1 in order to produce the enormous turning moments required for the rotation of the wind turbine nacelle.  Gear rim and pinions  teeth on the inner side. The gear rim meshes with four yaw drive pinions. The gear-rim and the pinions of the yaw drives are the components that finally transmit the turning moment from the yaw drives to the tower in order to turn the nacelle of the wind turbine around the tower axis (z axis). The main characteristics of the gear-rim are its big diameter (often larger than 2 m) and the orientation of its teeth. The gear-rims with teeth on the outer surface have the advantage of higher reduction ratios in combination with the pinions as well as reduced machining costs over the gear-rims with inner teeth. On the other hand, the former configuration requires the yaw drives to be mounted far apart from each other thus increasing the wind turbine main frame dimensions and costs.

Its lyrical structure is modeled after the question and answer form of traditional ballads such as \\"Lord Randall\\". The song is characterized by symbolist imagery in the style of Arthur Rimbaud, communicating suffering, pollution, and warfare. Dylan has said that all of the lyrics were taken from the initial lines of songs that \\"he thought he would never have time to write.\\" Nat Hentoff quoted Dylan as saying that he immediately wrote the song in response to the Cuban Missile Crisis, although in his memoir, Chronicles: Volume One, Dylan attributed his inspiration to the feeling he got when reading microfiche newspapers in the New York Public Library: \\"After a while you become aware of nothing but a culture of feeling, of black days, of schism, evil for evil, the common destiny of the human being getting thrown off course. It‚Äôs all one long funeral song.\\" History Dylan originally wrote \\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\\" in the form of a poem. The first iteration of the lyrics were written on a typewriter in the shared apartment of Dylan's friends Wavy Gravy and singer Tom Paxton, within Greenwich Village, New York City. Significant edits occurred after this time, for instance, an earlier draft which appeared in both Sing Out and Broadside folk magazines contained \\"a highway of golden with nobody on it\\" rather than the final lyric \\"a highway of diamonds\\". On September 22, 1962, Dylan appeared for the first time at Carnegie Hall as part of an all-star hootenanny. His three-song set marked the first public performance of \\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall,\\"It was the final song performed in the set. It followed a rendition of \\"As Long as the Grass Shall Grow\\", which consisted of music written by Dylan and lyrics by the noted Native American poet/singer/songwriter Peter LaFarge, recounting the US government's violation of its longstanding treaty with the Seneca nation in upstate New York. a complex and powerful song built upon the question-and- answer refrain pattern of the traditional British ballad \\"Lord Randall\\", published by Francis Child. One month later, on October 22, U.S. President John F. Kennedy appeared on national television to announce the discovery of Soviet missiles on the island of Cuba, initiating the Cuban Missile Crisis. In the sleeve notes on the Freewheelin' album, Nat Hentoff would quote Dylan as saying that he wrote \\"A Hard Rain\\" in response to the Cuban Missile Crisis: \\"Every line in it is actually the start of a whole new song. But when I wrote it, I thought I wouldn't have enough time alive to write all those songs so I put all I could into this one.\\" In actuality, Dylan had written the song more than a month before the crisis broke. The song was recorded in a single take at Columbia Records' Studio A on December 6, 1962. Analysis and reception Folk singer Pete Seeger interpreted the line \\"When the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison\\" as referring to when a young person suddenly wants to leave his home, but then qualified that by saying, \\"People are wrong when they say 'I know what he means.'\\" While some have suggested that the refrain of the song refers to nuclear fallout, Dylan disputed that this was a specific reference. In a radio interview with Studs Terkel in 1963, Dylan said: > No, it's not atomic rain, it's just a hard rain. It isn't the fallout rain. > I mean some sort of end that's just gotta happen ... In the last verse, when > I say, \\"the pellets of poison are flooding the waters,\\" that means all the > lies that people get told on their radios and in their newspapers.Reprinted > in Cott (ed.), Dylan on Dylan: The Essential Interviews, pp. 7‚Äì9. In No Direction Home, Martin Scorsese's documentary on Dylan, the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg talked about the first time he heard Dylan's music: > When I got back from India, and got to the West Coast, there's a poet, > Charlie Plymell - at a party in Bolinas ‚Äî played me a record of this new > young folk singer. And I heard \\"Hard Rain,\\" I think. And wept. 'Cause it > seemed that the torch had been passed to another generation. From earlier > bohemian, or Beat illumination. And self-empowerment. Author Ian MacDonald described the song as one of the most idiosyncratic protest songs ever written. Live performance Although Dylan may have first played the song to friends, \\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\\" was formally premiered at Carnegie Hall on September 22, 1962, as part of a hootenanny organized by Pete Seeger. Seeger recalled: \\"I had to announce to all the singers, 'Folks, you're gonna be limited to three songs. No more. 'Cause we each have ten minutes apiece.' And Bob raised his hand and said, 'What am I supposed to do? One of my songs is ten minutes long.'\\" Dylan featured the song regularly in concerts in the years since he premiered it, and there have been several dramatic performances. An October 1963 performance at Carnegie Hall was released on The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home, while another New York City performance, recorded one year later, appeared on The Bootleg Series Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964, Concert at Philharmonic Hall. Dylan performed the song in August 1971 at The Concert for Bangla Desh, organized by George Harrison and Ravi Shankar, for East Pakistan refugee relief (now independent Bangladesh) after the 1970 Bhola cyclone and during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. On December 4, 1975, at the Forum de Montr√©al, Canada,Set Lists:Forum de Montreal Bobdylan.com Dylan recorded an upbeat version of the song, which appeared on The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue. That rendition also appears on the box set The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings, along with a November 21, 1975 performance and a still earlier rehearsal. On May 23, 1994, Dylan performed the song at \\"The Great Music Experience\\" festival in Japan, backed by a 90-piece symphony orchestra conducted by Michael Kamen. At the end of 2007, Dylan recorded a new version of \\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\\" exclusively for Expo Zaragoza 2008 world fair, scheduled to open on June 8, 2008, to highlight the Expo theme of \\"water and sustainable development\\". As well as choosing local-band Amaral to record a version of the song in Spanish, Dylan's new version ended with a few spoken words about his \\"being proud to be a part of the mission to make water safe and clean for every human being living in this world.\\" Patti Smith performed the song with orchestral accompaniment at the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony on December 10, 2016, to commemorate Dylan receiving the Nobel Prize in Literature.

He dropped out of high school at 15 and for a time worked at a movie theater. In 1984, he began working in the shipping and receiving department of Turner Broadcasting System. He gradually worked his way through the programming department of Turner in the intervening years. He went to program TBS's animation block, running daily from 4:30‚Äì6PM Eastern time until 1993, when he became the first programmer in Cartoon Network's history.[Blog History of Frederator original cartoon shorts. http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/2006/12/30/blog- history-of-frederators-original-cartoon-7/]Space Ghost Coast to Coast Volume 2 \\"Sharrock\\" Episode Commentary By 1994, he was the vice president of programming for Cartoon Network. In 1994, Lazzo helped create the first animated late-night talk show, Space Ghost Coast to Coast, for the Cartoon Network. His production company, Ghost Planet Industries, created the spin-off of Hanna-Barbera's Space Ghost in 1995; Cartoon Planet debuted on TBS but moved to Cartoon Network the following year. Lazzo helped create The Powerpuff Girls before moving to Cartoon Network's adult-oriented network Adult Swim. In 1997, Lazzo and GPI began production on Toonami, an afternoon block of action cartoons on Cartoon Network. In 1999, Lazzo himself appeared in a rehearsal of the Space Ghost Coast to Coast episode \\"Fire Ant\\" in an episode \\"Table Read\\". In 2004, he served as the producer for Miguzi, another afternoon block of action programming, this time aimed at a younger audience. In 1999, Ghost Planet Industries changed its name to Williams Street, and the following year the studio started developing more non-Space Ghost-related comedy cartoons aimed at adult audiences. The Brak Show, Sealab 2021, Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, and Aqua Teen Hunger Force all premiered on Cartoon Network unannounced in the early mornings of December 2000, almost a year before Adult Swim officially premiered in September 2001. Keith Crofford has served as Lazzo's co-executive producer since 1994. Since 2006, Lazzo appeared in Seth Green's Robot Chicken nine times, in which he voiced a parody of himself from 2006 to 2007, and later Clark Duke voicing Lazzo from 2008 to 2018. In December 2019, Lazzo retired from the company.https://twitter.com/swimpedia/status/1206718664973725698 Lazzo has stated that his all-time favorite cartoon short is Nasty Quacks, which he has seen hundreds of times, and his favorite TV show is The Simpsons.
