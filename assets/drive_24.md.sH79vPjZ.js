The salon went on to become one of the most famous hair businesses in Houston. Tina's rise to prominence came as costume designer for Destiny's Child. In the early days of her daughter's career, when money was limited, she created outfits that the members wore on-stage and to events.

Matho Monastery, or Matho Gonpa or Mangtro Monastery or Mangtro Gonpa, from the Tibetan \\"mang\\" that means \\"many\\" and \\"tro\\" that means \\"happiness\\", is a Tibetan Buddhist monastery located 26 kilometres southeast of Leh in Ladakh, northern India, on the banks of the Indus River. The village of Matho is located at the mouth of a deep gorge running out of the Zanskar Range and across the Indus. It is directly opposite Thikse Monastery. Matho and Skidmang in the eastern Ladakh (130km to the east of Leh) are the only example in Ladakh of the Sakyapa sect of Tibetan Buddhism. Because Matho does not lie on the main highway from Leh, it sees fewer visitors than Hemis, Thiske or Shey. However, it is known to outsiders for its annual Oracle Matho Nagrang Festival, held on the 14th and 15th days of the first month of the Tibetan calendar. During this festival, two oracles, known as \\"Rongtsan\\", are said to inhabit for a few hours the body of two monks. The purpose of these oracles is to attempt to predict the fortunes of the local village communities for the coming year. Two monk that are to be the oracles vehicles are chosen every three years by the monks of the monastery for a duration of 3 years. The first year the monks will have to meditate for 9 months before the festival. The following two years the meditation will last 2 months. When the two monk come out from the retreat, all the monks will gather together to form a circle. The names of the two monks will be placed in a bowl. The bowl is then sealed and passed from one monk to the next until one name comes out from the bowl - this monk is chosen by the monastery's protector to perform the oracle. Matho is also home to a collection of thangkas dating back to the 14th century. History Founded in 1410 by Lama Dugpa Dorje, it belongs to the Sakya Order. It is noted for its six-hundred- year-old thangkas and its Matho Nagrang Festival. The gompa is the only one in Ladakh belonging to the Sakyapa and is said to be one of the few which is seeing an increase of monks in recent years.Rizvi (1996), p. 237. Description Most of the buildings are, apparently, rather dilapidated but there is a new assembly hall or du-khang which was built in 2005 and which has very colourful paintings and a Sakyamuni Buddha as main statue. There is a small chapel on the top story containing images of Sakya Pandita and other Sakya lamas. There is a 'museum' adjoining it with a number of very beautiful old thangkas, some of which are thought to have been brought from Tibet in the first half of the 15th century when the monastery was founded. Unfortunately, many of them are very worn. The masks and robes worn by the lamas in the annual dance festival may also be seen in the museum.Rizvi (1996), pp. 237-238. The festival of the oracles The annual festival of the two Rongtsan oracles takes place around the Buddhist new year, usually in the first half of March. Two monk are chosen every three years to get ready as the potential receptacles. They purify themselves with months of fasting and meditation to make themselves suitable receptacles for receiving the oracles spirits. When possessed they are said to be able to perform many astounding feats such as cutting themselves with knives and walking around the ramparts of the top storey blindfolded with no fear of falling down the precipice below. While in this trance state they answer questions about the prospects for Matho and Ladakh for the coming year as well as personal questions put to them by individuals. However, if skeptical questions are put to the oracle to test him, he is said to react \\"with a frenzied display of anger.\\"Rizvi (1996), p. 238. References * Rizvi, Janet. 1996.

Plot Small time criminal, Mahi gets released from prison early. He has a reputation of beating up his rivals in the darkness. Mahi wants to help fellow inmate Balan whose brother Satheesh is in need of money for a life saving operation. A fellow crook, Giri proposes an assignment for Mahi which will earn him enough money for the operation. Thottappally Surendran plans to murder Sivasankaran to settle an old score. Sivasankaran is serving life sentence for killing Surendran's father and is due to be released on short term parole. As part of a master plot, Surendran wants another man to accept the criminal charge and punishment. Mahi takes up the assignment and sets off to the island village along with Giri. During the boat service to the village, they meet Indu, the caretaker of Sivasankaran. During the trip, Indu gets harassed by Thottappally Sugunan, Surendran's brother. Mahi saves Indu with a single kick at Sugunan from the back which causes the boat to sink. Mahi saves the unconscious Indu from drowning and flees the scene immediately. On meeting Surendran, Mahi agrees to the task for Rs 8,00,000. Mahi and Giri are instructed to hang around the fishing village till Sivasankaran arrives on parole. Kannan Srank , a henchman of Surendran acts as their local contact. On Surendran's instruction, Kannan Srank plots to defame Indu by accusing her of having an affair with Mahi. Indu loses her job at the harbour. Aaranaimuttom Devaki saves Indu from further embarrassment. Mahi and Indu get to know each other. Mahi realises that Indu's younger sister Ammu is Sathessh's girlfriend. Sugunan tries to frame Ammu in a fraud charge. Mahi beats Sugunan up by covering Sugnan's face with Sugnan's mundu . He does the same with Surendran by mixing chilli powder and sand then throwing it at his face. Both of them do not get a clue who was the attacker. The villagers speculate about a \\"Mayavi\\" (magician) behind the attack. Kannan Srank's bogus claims of knowing Mayavi add further fuel for the speculations. Mahi in pretense of Mayavi uses Kannan Srank to prove the innocence of both Ammu and Indu and exposes Thottappally brothers. Indu joins back the job at the harbour. Mahi through Kannan Srank also offers protection for Sivasankaran in exchange for medical expenses for Satheesh. Kannan Srank go further on behalf by plotting a story in which Mayavi is in love with Indu. Sivasankaran arrives at the village knowing all about the plot to kill him. He commands Mahi and Giri to leave immediately. In the hospital meeting Satheesh, Sivasankaran mistakes Balan as Mayavi. Balan turns out to be a crook and he decides to play along even without knowing the entire story. Indu refuses to believe that Balan is Mayavi. Yatheendran, another convict identifies Mahi as Mayavi and Thottappally brothers entrusts Yatheendran to kill Mahi. Mahi beats up Yatheendran and Thottappally brothers and spoils the plot to kill Sivasankaran. Sivasankaran, however still believes Balan is Mayavi and decides to fix Indu's wedding with Balan and make Balan a partner in his businesses. Mahi tries to stop Balan from his activities which make him furious and turns againest him. How Mahi makes Sivasankaran believe the truth remains in the rest of the story.

Intended to be as fast as possible, it recorded a speed of 135 mph (217 km/h), which made it the fastest aircraft in the world in 1914, but no production followed and it was soon written off in a crash. Development and design In April 1913, Henry Folland, one of the talented pool of designers assembled at the Royal Aircraft Factory started the design of a high-speed development of the earlier Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.2 (designed by Geoffrey de Havilland), the S.E.3.Bruce 1982, p.468. The S.E.3 was abandoned in favour of the S.E.4, a more advanced aircraft intended to break the world air speed record.Bruce 1968, p.70. The S.E.4 was a tractor biplane powered by a closely cowled 14-cylinder, two-row Gnome rotary engine. The aircraft's fuselage was of wooden construction, and was carefully streamlined to reduce drag. Although it has been sometimes claimed to be of monocoque construction,Lewis 1979, p.37. the fuselage was in fact built around a wooden box girder, with formers fitted around the box girder to give the desired shape and skinned with plywood. The pilot sat in a cockpit under the trailing edge of the upper wing; unusually for the time, a transparent canopy made out of celluloid to fit the cockpit was made, but pilots refused to fly with it fitted and the canopy was never used. The aircraft had single-bay wings, of equal span and unstaggered. The wings were braced with a single \\"\\" section strut on each side, and were fitted with full span control surfaces on both the upper and lower wings. These could be moved differentially as ailerons or together as camber changing flaps, with the gaps between the wings and control surfaces covered in elastic netting to further reduce drag. The aircraft had a Conventional landing gear, with a tail skid, and the main wheels carried on each side of a leaf spring held on an inverted tripod.Bruce 1957, p.443. Operational history The prospective design, although yet to fly, was mentioned at a February 1914 meeting of the Royal Aeronautical Society by Brigadier General David Henderson, who said:\\"If anyone wants to know which country has the fastest aeroplane in the world-it is Great Britain\\".Bruce 1968, pp.69–70. The S.E.4 was first flown in June 1914, demonstrating performance every bit as good as hoped, with a maximum speed of 135 mph (217 km/h), making it the fastest aircraft in the world. The novel mounting of the mainwheels proved unstable during taxiing, and was replaced by more conventional V-struts.Bruce 1968, p.71. The engine was prone to overheating, so the propeller spinner had an opening cut into it and a fan installed inside the spinner to help cool the engine.Bruce 1957, p.441. Although it was praised by its pilots, including John Salmond, later to become Chief of the Air Staff, its landing speed of 52 mph (84 km/h) was considered too fast for operational use, and the engine was still too unreliable, being replaced by a 100 hp (75 kW) Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine. With this engine, speed fell to a less impressive 92 mph (148 km/h). The S.E.4 was badly damaged in a landing accident on 12 August 1914, with the type being abandoned.Bruce 1968, pp. 71–72. Although the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.4a had a similar designation, it was effectively a completely different aircraft.

Eusauropods represent the node-based group that includes all descendant sauropods starting with the basal eusauropods of Shunosaurus, and possibly Barapasaurus, and Amygdalodon, but excluding Vulcanodon and Rhoetosaurus. The Eusauropoda was coined in 1995 by Paul Upchurch to create a monophyletic new taxonomic group that would include all sauropods, except for the vulcanodontids. Eusauropoda are herbivorous, quadrupedal, and have long necks. They have been found in South America, Europe, North America, Asia, Australia, and Africa. The temporal range of Eusauropoda ranges from the early Jurassic to the Latest Cretaceous periods. The most basal forms of eusauropods are not well known and because the cranial material for the Vulcanodon is not available, and the distribution of some of these shared derived traits that distinguish Eusauropoda is still completely clear. Description Eusauropods are long-necked, strictly herbivorous, obligate quadrupedals. They have a highly specialized set of skeletal adaptions due to their large size, and are graviportal. Teeth and mouth Yates and Upchurch described eusauropod evolution as moving towards a “bulk-browsing mode of feeding”. They describe the development of lateral plates on the alveolar margins of tooth-bearing bones. These plates can be used to strip foliage, the eusauropod's “U-shaped” jaws create a wide bite, and their loss of “fleshy cheeks” increased the gape. The crowns of eusauropod teeth also have “wrinkled enamel textures”, but it is unclear what this meant for their feeding habits. Head and neck Reconstruction of selected sauropod necks, showing posture and length The skull length of the basal eusauropod, Patagosaurus is about . One of the most basal eusauropods, Shunosaurus, has two characteristic features of the eusauropod elongated neck: the incorporation of the equivalent of the first dorsal vertebra into the cervical region of the spine, and the addition of two cervical vertebra in the middle of the cervical vertebrae. Other synapomorphies of Eusauropoda includes a retracted position of the external nares. Unlike prosauropods and theropods, which have a snout with smooth, unprotruding alveolar and subnarial regions, eusauropods have snouts with “stepped anterior margins”. Further distinguishing features of eusauropods include the absence of the contact between the squamosal and the quadratojugal, the absence of the anterior process of the prefrontal, and a distally elongated anterior ramus of the quadratojugal. Separating the anteroventral process of the nasal from the posterolateral process of the premaxilla, eusauropods also have a long maxilla that forms the posteroventral margin of the external naris. Feet and limbs Eusauporoda are also hypothesized to have a semi-digitigrade foot posturem demonstrated by footprint evidence. Paleontologist Jeffrey Wilson explains that eusauropods differ from theropods and prosauropods that have digitigrade pes where their heel and metatarsals are lifted off the ground. Eusauropods show asymmetry in their metatarsal shaft diameters where metatarsal I is broader than the others, suggesting that their weight was mostly assumed by their inner feet. According to Steven Salisbury and Jay Nair, basal eusauropods retain four pedal unguals but reduce their phalangeal number in their fourth digit to three units. The metatarsus in eusauropods is less than a quarter of their tibial length, unlike sauropod outgroups that have long hindlimbs and metatarsus that are almost half of their tibial length. Distribution Eusauropods are found on all major continents, except Antarctica, with diplocodoids being widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, and titanosaurs being found in Southern Hemisphere. However, basal eusauropods that do not fall into either group are fairly well represented. Early eusauropods such as Volkeimeria and Amygdalodon, and more derived eusauropods such as Patagosaurus have been found in South America. Volkeimeria is classified as a basal eusauropod, though in 2004 Paul Upchurch was suspicious of its placement, because of its “opisthoceolous cervical centra, the absence of a femoral anterior trochanter, and laterally projecting cnemial crest of the tibia”, and instead thought it may be a generic sauropod. African eusauropods may include Spinophorosaurus, from Niger, although that taxon may instead be closer to Vulcanodon and outside Eusauropoda. Also, Atlasaurus was found in Morocco, and Jobaria was found in Niger. However, both genera have been found as possible Macronarians, but Atlasaurus was found to be a turiasaurian, and Jobaria a eusauropod, by a phylogenetic analysis of Xing in 2012. In Europe, the clade Turiasauria has been found in France, Spain, and possibly England, with multiple genera from the same locality in Spain. Cetiosaurus skeletons have also been found in England, along with the possibly eusauropod genera Cardiodon and Oplosaurus, known only from teeth. The family Mamenchisauridae is found widespread throughout Asia. A majority of the genera are found in China, although a possible specimen of Mamenchisaurus has been found in Thailand. Also in China, the basal eusauropod Nebulasaurus taito was found to be a sister taxon to Spinophorosaurus, and more derived than Mamenchisauridae, but less derived than Patagosaurus, and the genus Shunosaurus is likely one of the most basal eusauropods. The genus Barapasaurus has been found in India, and may represent a cetiosaurid, a basal eusauropod, or a genus outside Eusauropoda. Paleobiology The data around sauropods evolution, as Novas points out, is largely based on a few formations mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. However, other beds in places such as Tanzania, specifically the Canadon Asfalto and Canadon Calcereo formations reveal a more diverse and widespread peleobiology of eusauropods in the Late Jurassic period. Classification The following cladogram demonstrates hypothesized relationships within the Eusauropoda.. The basal eusauropods include the Turiasauria (Turiasaurus, Zby and others.

Governing body The Kuwait Rugby Football Union is the governing body, but is currently under the Arabian Gulf Rugby Football Union (AGRFU). The AGRFU was founded in 1977, and joined the IRB in 1990.Bath, Richard (ed.) The Complete Book of Rugby (Seven Oaks Ltd, 1997 ) p62 By the end of 2010, the AGRFU will be broken up, with new unions to be established in each member country, as announced in January 2009 by the IRB. The first national union to be formed from the AGRFU is expected to be that of the UAE. History Rugby was first brought to the region, by the British military around the mid 20th century. In addition, some Arabian royals and nobles have been sending their sons to English private schools for years, where they have picked up the game. The sport was reintroduced by Commonwealth ex-patriates working in the oil industry, and unfortunately, they continue to dominate the game.http://wesclark.com/rrr/islamic_rugby.html \\"Islam and Rugby\\" on the Rugby Readers review retrieved 2 July 2009 For example, the AGRFU website continues to be in English only. The sport experienced some expansion in Kuwait during the 1980s with the senior side becoming one of the most successful in the AGRFU and a thriving mini section begun. The club had always played at Ahmadi under the auspices of the Kuwait Oil Company, but due to company policy the ground was closed to the rugby club. This resulted in the members building a new ground in Fintas and changing the club’s name. The club returned to Ahmadi in 1989. Unfortunately the Gulf War in 1990-91, created many problems, from damage to physical infrastructure, and great hardship to residents. The war caused the deaths of around 1,000 Kuwaiti civilians killed during the Iraqi occupation in addition to 300,000 refugees. Many of Kuwaiti rugby's main supporters, i.e. white expatriates left shortly before or after the conflict. During the war Kuwait sent a side of players who had not been in the country when the invasion took place to play in the 1990 Dubai sevens. Kuwait currently has one adult rugby club, The Kuwait Scorpions, having recently reverted to the original name. The club was founded in 1946 and is one of the oldest rugby clubs within the Persian Gulf region. Original numbers dwindled as many players left the country due to the political situation within the region. The Kuwait Nomads were a fitting title for the group of players that gradually returned to the club from countries all over the world to play the game they loved. The renamed Kuwait Scorpions currently have Men's First XV, Vets and Ladies teams and regularly compete throughout the Persian Gulf region. The Kuwait Saracens RFC, the only youth rugby club in Kuwait, was established at the end of the 08/09 season after lack of funding and ever-dwindling player numbers in the former youth club threatened the future of youth rugby in Kuwait. The Kuwait Saracens RFC is one of the biggest expatriate organizations in the country with more than 150 members.

Jerry Snyder's Guitar School, p.28. . : features dampened downbeat downstrokes and staccato upbeat upstrokes. Though notated with quarter notes, the Ska stroke sounds like sixteenth notes due to muting or dampening. Damping is a technique in music for altering the sound of a musical instrument by reducing oscillations or vibrations. Damping methods are used for a number of instruments. Strings Damping is often necessary on string instruments such as the bass or violin where sympathetic resonance can excite other strings creating undesired noise. This phenomena can be remedied by keeping fingers such as the thumb on the strings where the vibration is unwanted. On guitar, damping (also referred to as choking) is a technique where, shortly after playing the strings, the sound is reduced by pressing the right hand palm against the strings, right hand damping (including palm muting), or relaxing the left hand fingers' pressure on the strings, left hand damping (or left-hand muting). Scratching is where the strings are played while damped, i.e., the strings are damped before playing. The term presumably refers to the clunky sound produced. In funk music this is often done over a sixteenth note pattern with occasional sixteenths undamped. Floating is the technique where a chord is sustained past a sixteenth note rather than that note being scratched, the term referring to the manner in which the right hand \\"floats\\" over the strings rather than continuing to scratch. Skanking is when a note is isolated by left hand damping of the two strings adjacent to the fully fretted string, producing the desired note (the adjacent strings are scratched). The technique is especially popular among ska, rocksteady and reggae guitarists, who use it with virtually every riddim they play on. Piano When a piano key is pressed, the damper for that note is raised and a hammer strikes the string. Unless the sustain pedal is depressed, releasing the key allows the damper to return to place, damping the note.  Percussion  Percussion instruments, such as timpani or cymbals, often resonate for a long time. To control the length of the notes, percussionists will often have to either place their hands on the instrument or use a pedal mechanism as in the case of tubular bells and pedal glockenspiels. Mallet dampening on the vibraphone is an important technique that facilitates legato phrasing on the instrument. It is accomplished by striking a note on one of the bars of the instrument while the pedal is depressed and then using the head of the same or another mallet to stop the vibrations of the bar without raising the pedal. There are many benefits of being proficient in this technique as a vibraphonist. As it allows a player to hold out one chord and add or subtract any individual pitch desired, a vibist can transition between chords much more smoothly than a pianist who cannot stop a string from vibrating without reaching inside the instrument when the pedal is down. Most modern vibraphonists are highly skilled in this technique. On cymbals, choking, is an important technique that can add punctuation or heighten musical tension. Hammered dulcimers While the keys on modern pianos control both the hammers and dampers, this is not possible with the hand-held hammers used to play some other members of the box zither family. Historical players such as Joseph Moskowitz sometimes used their coat sleeves as dampers, but pedal-operated dampers were one of the main distinguishing features of the concert cimbalom developed by Jószef Schunda in 1874 and are now often added to larger or more expensive American hammered dulcimers, Eastern European dulcimers, and Greek sandouris.

The name is derived from the Greek myth of the \\"seven sisters\\", also known as the Pleiades. A major force in 20th century American publishing, only three of the magazines are still published as physical magazines: *Better Homes and Gardens *Good Housekeeping *Woman's Day Another sister, McCall's, ceased publication in 2002 after an ill-fated attempt to rebrand itself under the name Rosie by teaming up with talk-show host Rosie O'Donnell. Ladies' Home Journal ceased monthly publication in April 2014. Publisher Meredith Corporation stated it would be \\"transitioning Ladies' Home Journal to a special interest publication\\". The last issue was in 2016. Hearst transitioned Redbook to a digital-only property in 2017. Meredith announced Family Circle published its last issue in December 2019. After a wave of consolidation and mergers, two companies now own the three remaining sisters: Meredith Corporation publishes Better Homes and Gardens and Hearst Corporation publishes Good Housekeeping and Woman's Day. While their circulation has slipped from their figures in the 1960s and 1970s, they are among the highest circulation magazines in the United States. History While all seven of the magazines were aimed at women, they all had divergent beginnings. Family Circle and Woman's Day were both originally conceived as circulars for grocery stores (Piggly Wiggly and A&P;); McCall's and Redbook were known for a text-heavy format focusing on quality fiction; Good Housekeeping was aimed at affluent housewives. Ladies' Home Journal was originally a single-page supplement to a general interest magazine, while Better Homes and Gardens began as a blending of woman's magazine and home design journal. Through the 1990s, in the face of declining readership and advertising revenue, the Seven Sisters attempted to differentiate themselves from each other and from the rest of the market, relying on either incremental tweaks to their formula or wholesale changes in the format of the magazine. In recent years, the focus has been on minor changes, such as updating the visual appeal or improving the paper stock on which the magazine is printed. The Seven Sisters formerly had much larger circulation figures than at present. In 1979, their combined circulation was 45 million; that figure dropped to 37 million a decade later. By 2008, the six surviving sisters had a combined circulation of 26 million. Much of the loss has been attributed to readers seeking out more specialized magazines. Despite the steep drop in readership, five of the sisters were among the top ten paid and verified circulation magazines in the United States in 2008, according to the Magazine Publishers of America, an industry trade group. Redbook was the only one of the sisters that did not reach the top ten; it was ranked number 29 in the MPA list for 2008. Controversy A sample of the top twelve selling women's magazines conducted by an intern at the Columbia Journalism Review in 1992 revealed that the Seven Sisters had published substantially fewer articles on the topic of abortion than other popular magazines oriented toward a female readership. Between 1972 and 1991, the Seven Sisters as a group published only 40 articles addressing abortion; the other five magazines had published 97 articles. In January 2000, a conservative media advocacy group, Morality in Media, criticized a number of women's magazines for what they deemed to be sexually explicit covers; Redbook was among the magazines cited by the group. The editor-in-chief of Redbook told The New York Times, \\"We are trying to pull away from the rest of the Seven Sisters. We are moving it slightly younger, to fill that gap between the younger fashion magazines and the older, full- fledged Seven Sisters.\\" As a consequence of its racier image, Wal-Mart began selling copies of Redbook from behind a blinder designed to obscure the text on the cover of the magazine.

He always used the title in his inscriptions but never actually converted to Islam.Arudra, Samagra Andhra Sahityam (A Comprehensive Review of Andhra Literature), vol II, page 86, Telugu Academy Press, 2003 The kingdom The entire Telugu speaking areas which now form the state of Andhra Pradesh (an area greater than the size of France) were united and saw an efflorescence of all the arts, culture and military might under the rule of the Kakatiya Emperors. They finally fell in 1323 to the invading forces of the Delhi Sultan, Mohammad bin Tughlaq, whose Deccan (southern) governor Alauddin Bahman Shah eventually rebelled in 1347 setting up the independent Bahmani kingdom ruling from Gulbarga. His dominions extended up to Golconda in the east. Meanwhile, further south, the mighty Vijayanagar empire had arisen from the Kampili-Hampi region, taking over much of what is now the Rayalaseema region of Andhra. In the far east, the rulers of Orissa occupied Telugu lands up to the banks of the Godavari and by the mid-15th century the powerful Gajapatis had replaced the Ganga dynasty. Fall of Kakatiya dynasty led way to the emergence of new kingdom Musunuri dynasty by Musunuri Prola Bhupathi, also called as Prolaya Nayaka. Prolaya brother Kapaya captured warangal and made it his capital. The three Telugu kingdoms of Warangal of Musunuri Nayaks, Rachakonda of Recherla Nayaks and Kondaveedu of Reddy dynasty, therefore, were boxed in by the three major powers and led a precarious existence for about a century with frequent internecine quarrels, alliances and counter-alliances with one or the other of the major powers. All three ceased to exist by the mid-15th century, Warangal absorbed into Bahamani and later by Gajapathi, Rachakonda and Devarakonda absorbed into the Bahmani and Kondaveedu into the Gajapati and Vijayanagarakingdoms. Musunuri kings of Warangal patronised many poets. By Shitab Khan's time the Bahmanis had recently acquired this important buffer state on their eastern frontiers. From 1480 to 1485, Shitab Khan was the governor of Rachakonda (near Narayanpur in modern Nalgonda district, Andhra Pradesh). He seems to have taken advantage of the internal turmoils of the Bahmanis and declared his independence in 1503, ruling from the Rachakonda, Warangal and Khammam forts from 1503 to 1512.Cynthia Talbot, Inscribing the other, inscribing the self: Hindu - Muslim identities in Pre- Colonial India, Comparative Studies in Society & History, vol 37, no 4, Oct 1995, pages 692-772, Cambridge University Press He appears to have been very popular and inscriptional evidence suggests that he undertook many public works including repairing irrigation tanks and reinstating ruined temples. His stated purpose was to re-instate the great glory of the bygone Kakatiya times. A 16x38x12 m building in fine Indo-Saracenic style still stands in the old Warangal Fort, called Kush Mahal or Shitab Khan Palace. He had the Pakhala tank repaired which still serves many farmlands in the area and is now a picturesque tourist spot.Stone inscription dated 1504 by Shitab Khan found at the south Torana, Warangal Fort, IAP-Warangal Sno. III, Andhra Pradesh Archaeological Series no. 31 He was also a patron of literature and Telugu poetry continued to flourish in his time. His prime minister, Enumulapalli Peddanna mantri, was the patron of Charigonda Dharmanna who wrote the Chitra Bharatam, a classic of Telugu poetry. Rich descriptions of his rule are in this work. In the turbulent regional politics of the time, Quli Qutb Shah ruler of Golconda Fort (in modern Hyderabad) was asserting his dominance and Shitab Khan had to face invasions from Golconda which was just shaking off the suzerainty of the Bahmanis.Hirananda Sastri, Shitab Khan of Warangal, Hyderabad Archaeological Series no.9 Warangal succumbed to the Golconda ruler and Shitab Khan had to flee, about 1512. He joined the service of Prataparudra Gajapati, King of Kalinga (Orissa). When the legendary Vijayanagar Emperor Sri Krishnadevaraya went on his Kalinga campaign, 1516–1517, his triumphal progress was effectively hindered by the archers of Shitab Khan at the mountain pass near Simhadri (modern Visakhapatnam district).

In 1975 RCA created Satcom 1, the first satellite built especially for use by the then three national television networks (CBS, NBC, and ABC). Later that same year, HBO leased a transponder on Satcom 1 and began transmission of television programs via satellite to cable systems. Owners of cable systems paid $10,000 to install 3-meter dishes to receive TV signals in C band. In 1976 Taylor Howard built an amateur system, which consisted of a converted military surplus radar dish and a satellite receiver designed and built by Howard, for home satellite reception. Taylor's system could be used for receiving TV programs both from American and Soviet communication satellites. In 1977 Pat Robertson launched the first satellite- delivered basic cable service called the CBN Cable Network. In 1979, the Satellite Home Viewers Act allowed homeowners in the US to own and operate their own home satellite system, consisting of C-band equipment from a multitude of manufacturers who were making parts for systems such as Taylor Howard's, and began a large controversy of which channels could be received by whom. USSB was a direct-to-home service founded in 1981. In the early 1990s they partnered with Hughes and continued operation until purchased in 1998 by DirecTV. In 1991 Primestar launched as the first North American DBS service. Hughes’s DirecTV, the first national high-powered upper Ku-band DBS system, went online in 1994. The DirecTV system became the new delivery vehicle for USSB. In 1996, EchoStar’s Dish Network went online in the United States and has gone on to similar success as DirecTV’s primary competitor. The AlphaStar service launched in 1996 and went into bankruptcy in 1997. Primestar sold its assets to Hughes in 1999. Dominion Video Satellite Inc's Sky Angel also went online in the United States in 1996 with its DBS service geared towards \\"faith and family\\" until they sold the license to EchoStar Communications Corporation in 2008 and switched to an IPTV platform. In 2004, Cablevision’s Voom service went online, specifically catering to the emerging market of HDTV owners and aficionados, but folded in April 2005. The service’s “exclusive” high- definition channels were migrated to the Dish Network system. Commercial DBS services are the primary competition to cable television service, although the two types of service have significantly different regulatory requirements (for example, cable television has public access requirements, and the two types of distribution have different regulations regarding carriage of local stations). 90cm multiple-LNA toroidal satellite dish The majority of ethnic-language broadcasts in North America are carried on Ku band free-to-air. The largest concentration of free-to-air programming is on Galaxy 19 at 97° W. Pittsburgh International Telecommunications and GlobeCast World TV offers a mix of free and pay-TV ethnic channels in the internationally-standard DVB-S and S2 formats, as do others. Home2US Communications Inc. also offers several ethnic channels on SES 1 at 101° W, as well as other free and pay-TV channels. Many religious broadcasters reach the DTH and distribution markets with unencrypted DVB-S television and radio channels on Galaxy 19. These channels are available as part of the Glorystar Satellite Service. Several U.S.-English language network affiliates (representing CBS, NBC, ABC, PBS, FOX, the CW (formerly the WB and UPN), ION Network and MyNetworkTV) are available as free-to-air broadcasts, as are the three U.S.-Spanish language networks (Univisión, Unimás and Telemundo). The number of free-to-air specialty channels is otherwise rather limited. Specific FTA offerings tend to appear and disappear rather often and typically with little or no notice, although sites such as LyngSat do track the changing availability of both free and pay channels worldwide.LyngSat tracking On October 7, 2009, NAB TV Board chair Paul Karpowicz planned to testify before the Senate Communications Subcommittee that broadcasters would be willing to allow subscribers of distant signals to continue to do so even if the digital transition resulted in those subscribers receiving stations that they could not before. The NAB did oppose offering new distant signals if a digital signal was available. The Satellite TV Modernization Act had to be passed by the end of 2009. The House bill also allowed Dish Network to offer distant signals. On November 5, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy said he hoped for a \\"short-time agreement\\" on the bill passed out of committee September 24. If the Senate approves, the House will have to approve the bill, and if the two versions cannot be reconciled, the license to import signals that expires at the end of the year could be extended. The House version included an agreement with Echostar that, where possible, all 210 markets could receive signals, and Echostar could once again deliver distant signals. The Senate Commerce Committee approved a version of the bill on November 19, without an amendment requiring local signals in all markets in three years, though a study would be conducted on why 30 markets still had a problem. Before Senate approval, the two versions of the bill will have to be reconciled; the Judiciary Committee had a short market fix, while the Commerce committee bill required PBS in HD sooner. The House approved the Satellite Home Viewer Reauthorization Act December 3. It included both the House Commerce Committee and House Judiciary Committee versions and renewed the ability to use distant signals for five years, allowed Dish Network to offer distant signals again, and required 28 markets to receive signals not available locally. The bill also dealt with some copyright issues and required Dish Network to offer HD noncommercial signals by 2011 instead of 2013. One potential problem: determining who cannot receive a signal is still based on analog rather than digital TV. On February 11, 2010, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the satellite reauthorization was part of a jobs bill. Rick Boucher, House chairman for communications and the Internet, believed the bill would pass. The deadline is March, since it has been extended 60 days. Sen. Jim Bunning blocked the legislation in the Senate on Feb. 25, even though it passed the House. On March 1, 2010, The Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010, scheduled to expire in 2014, became part of a jobs bill with help from Sen. Patrick Leahy.

The song was released digitally on 2 November 2009 and on 7\\" Vinyl on 23 November 2009. Debut Single: Vanity Kills It was re-released on 5 April 2010 with a brand new track \\"Midnight Love Song\\". Track listing Some digital download versions, including iTunes and Amazon have incorrectly listed the B-side track as \\"Delight and Disorder\\". \\"Delight In Disorder\\" was written by Lou Hickey. \\"Midnight Love Song\\" was written by Jon Lawler. Music video The band used a live studio version to promote the song, but have since created an official promo video for the song, in the style of a short film. The video starts with a prologue by band member Jon Lawler, where he says: \\"Vanity is defined as excessive pride in one's self, in your looks, and your job, and your achievements. Pride itself is not easy to pin down. In the bible, pride was known as the deadliest of the seven deadly sins. And now it's a virtue. Times change and that's about all you can count on, but still, I'm not casting stones, we all linger in the mirror sometimes.\\" The video shows the story of Miss Vanity and Mr Kills. Interview with Lou in the Daily Record Miss Vanity is seen lying on a bed, reading a magazine with a picture of a gentleman and his girlfriend, the headline reading \\"I won't let her down again\\". Mr Kills enters the room saying \\"Got you a little present\\", inside the present is a seductive dress, similar to the one worn by a woman in a magazine clipping. Mr Kills then says to her, \\"Hope he likes it\\". Later on, Mr Kills is seen working behind the bar in the club where Jon and Lou are playing, when Miss Vanity enters wearing the dress she was bought. The gentleman who was in the picture of the magazine is enticed by her as soon as she enters, even removing his wedding ring and approaching her at the bar. After talking and laughing, they are next seen in a bedroom, and begin to make out, before having intercourse, the gentleman unaware the entire thing is being filmed and watched by Mr Kills. They later meet him in a carpark, giving him the magazine clipping and a copy of the tape, wanting money from the gentleman to stop them from showing the video to his wife. Miss Vanity is then seen packing her bags at their home and appears to be waiting for someone. The gentleman meets Mr Kills in the car park with a briefcase, which he places down in front of him, as Mr Kills proceeds to collect the suitcase, the lights of the BMW parked turn on and a brunette woman appears, and shoots both Mr Kills and the gentleman and takes the suitcase, which is full of £20 notes, and Miss Vanity is shown looking pleased. Jon Lawler then gives an epilogue: \\"One thing I do know, flip Vanity's head, and the tail leads to envy. And she gets into your blood stream, she'll turn your grey matter green. And then you got problems, like these folk here\\". During this, Lou and Jon finish their performance at the club, and go and find Miss Vanity and her female lover in their hotel room, with Jon flashing a police badge.

The history of the area begins in Prehistoric times and the present importance of the town dates from the 19th century.  Prehistory = Stone Age  The back-filled remains of a mine shaft at the neolithic flint mines at Cissbury in the north of the borough of Worthing Within of Worthing's town centre lie four of Britain's 14 confirmed Neolithic flint mines. The oldest of these mines, at Church Hill in Findon, may be one of the earliest known mines in Britain.Castleden.Neolithic Britain: new stone age sites of England, Scotland, and Wales. p.189. Thought to date from the 5th millennium BC and 4th millennium BC, these mines represent some of the oldest mines in Europe, if not the world and predate the great neolithic sites of Stonehenge and Avebury. In the Neolithic period, the South Downs above Worthing was one of Britain's largest and most important flint-mining centres. These extensive flint mines which include the considerable mines at Cissbury are in many ways comparable to the vast flint mines of Spiennes in Belgium which have been given World Heritage Site status. The secondary southern escarpment of the South Downs close to Worthing, south of the main ridge of the Downs (formed by hills such as Steep Down, Cissbury, Church Hill and Harrow Hill) is most visible west of the River Adur and it is this flint which is especially hard and durable and hence valuable in Neolithic times. Flint from these early mines played a significant role in enabling the \\"Neolithic Revolution\\" to take place across southern Britain, gradually replacing the nomadic hunter-gatherer way of life of the mesolithic period with the settled agricultural way of life of the neolithic period as the extensive wildwood forest that covered much of Britain began to be felled. There is evidence that flint from the mines around Worthing was traded across southern Britain, particularly to the populous areas on the Wessex downland. The flint mines were at Harrow Hill in Patching (mined from 4250 BC to 3500 BC), Blackpatch Hill in Clapham (4350 BC to 3500 BC), Church Hill in Findon (4500 BC to 3750 BC)— all outside the present borough of Worthing—and Cissbury, which is within the borough and which had between 100 and 200 mineshafts, making it Britain's second largest after Grimes Graves in Norfolk. Tolmere, near Findon, has been identified as a probable site. Sites at High Salvington and Mount Carvey, within the borough, and at nearby Myrtlegrove and Roger's Farm in Patching and Findon, have all been identified as possible, but cannot be confirmed because of plough disturbance. The flints would have been used to make tools such as axes, scrapers and arrow heads. At Harrow Hill, dozens of ox skulls have been found, suggesting ritual slaughter—possibly each autumn, as many animals would not have survived the winter. In the mineshafts, drawings of an Earth Spirit and phalluses may have been used to protect the fertility of the mines. At Blackpatch, remains of what appear to be miners' huts have been found. At Cissbury, there were more than 270 pits, and the flint was used locally and exported—possibly as far as the eastern Mediterranean. Some shafts extended up to below the surface. Four engravings, of a bull and deer, have been found in a shaft of one of the Cissbury flint mines. This is significant as few pieces of representational art survive from the British Neolithic period. For much of the neolithic period of the Stone Age, it is likely that the Worthing area was at the borders of territory of two tribes, one based at the causewayed enclosure at Whitehawk Camp (in modern Brighton) and one centred on the causwayed enclosure at the Trundle (near modern Chichester). However the apparent absence of settlement in the area at this time and other evidence from the mines themselves adds to speculation that the mines were special places, with sacred areas surrounding the mines. Such an area may have existed between the rivers Adur and Arun where the mines were situated on a block of downland that does not appear to contain any other contemporary monument. The high status of this area, compared to the rest of Sussex, may have continued on into the Bronze and Iron Ages. Henges seem to have existed on the Downs near Worthing at Blackpatch, Church Hill, Cissbury and also at Cock Hill, midway between the neolithic mining areas of Harrow Hill and Blackpatch. At Cock Hill lies a henge dating from the late neolithic period, 48 metres in diameter, roughly circular, with a single entrance to the south-east. Various round barrows have been found on the Downs near Worthing close to Blackpatch and Church Hill. Neolithic axes from the mines have been found away from the Downs in various locations across the modern town of Worthing including at Homefield Park, Heene Road, Broadwater, Pond Lane and Seldens Way. A site near the summit of West Hill in High Salvington, between Honeysuckle Lane and the covered reservoir, has been identified as the possible location of neolithic huts, possibly used by flint miners.  Bronze Age  Bronze Age fort at Highdown Hill Several Bronze Age barrows have been found within the modern borough of Worthing, close to Cissbury on the Downs. The enclosures at Highdown Hill are believed to have been built at this time. Judging from the pottery and metalwork finds, Highdown Hill was a high status settlement at the time. Various artefacts, including tools, metal and pottery have been found in the Worthing area. In 1877 a large collection of Bronze Age cakes, palstaves and axes was found in a Bronze Age pot near Ham Road in East Worthing.  Iron Age  The hill fort at Cissbury Ring dates from the middle Iron Age. Covering an extensive 60 acres (24 ha), this is one of the largest Iron Age hill forts in Britain and indeed Europe. During the Iron Age and earlier, the area between the rivers Adur and Arun was a special area, with high status and ritual significance. From the Bronze Age, Highdown Hill had special status and the enclosures at Chanctonbury and Harrow Hill may have been important sites of ritual performance. In the middle Iron Age, Cissbury was built and in the late Iron Age, this sector of the downs housed the Lancing Down 'shrine'. In 1842 a boat made from a hollowed-out oak tree was found at low tide in the sand near to Heene Road. It was believed that the boat dated from the Iron Age.  Roman times  Roman coins, tiles and pottery have been discovered in several parts of the town. Several roads in the Worthing area date from the Roman era or earlier, including the Roman road from Noviomagus Reginorum (modern Chichester) to Novus Portus, (possibly modern Portslade near Brighton) which ran through Durrington and Broadwater. Tarring Road is one of several modern Worthing streets whose origins lie in the Roman grid system known as centuriation It is likely that several of Worthing's roads were laid out during this period in a grid form marking out a field system known as 'centuriation'. Worthing's High Street lies at the south of a long straight trackway that stretches from high on the South Downs to the sea and northwards into the Weald. The track would have been used as a droveway (for transhumance) and can still be walked today along much of its length. Coming off the Downs it is now known as Charmandean Lane, which turns into a footpath known as the Quashetts, which becomes High Street and finally the Steyne before reaching the sea. The track would have touched the western shoreline of the 'broad water' that is the sea inlet from which Broadwater gets its name. The inlet would have existed for centuries but disappeared in the 18th century. It is likely that Worthing's grid system would have been based on this ancient track. The grid system would have been used to demarcate plots of land for fields and development. The modern South Farm Road was once a track running north–south, parallel to the Quashetts path. It lies exactly 20 actus (about 710 metres) from the Quashetts path. 100 actus (about 3,550 metres) to the west of the Quashetts track lies the remains of a track that is probably Celtic in origin, also running north–south, by Stanhope Lodge, now on Poplar Road in Durrington. The track once marked the border between the parishes of Goring and Durrington. Today the line of this track marks the boundary between Clapham and Worthing. Another modern road that appears to be on the Roman grid system is Tarring Road (east–west), the ancient boundary between Heene and Tarring. South of Tarring Road (and the Teville stream is would have run alongside), the boundaries in the grid seem to be 24 actus apart from each other. The ancient boundary between Heene (later West Worthing) and Broadwater (later Worthing) lies 24 actus west of the Quashetts track. George V Avenue (north–south), the ancient boundary between Tarring (later West Worthing) and Goring lies 72 actus from the Quashetts track. There is evidence of several buildings from the Roman era in Worthing. The town's Museum and Art Gallery is built on the site of a Roman farmhouse. A Roman settlement existed along the modern Brighton Road between Merton Road and Navarino Road. Remains of a Roman villa and bath house have been found on the site of Northbrook College's main Goring campus. A Roman milepost was found in modern Grand Avenue in West Worthing, possibly indicating another Roman road. A Roman cemetery existed between Chesswood Road and the railway line and burials dating from the early 4th century have also been found near Park Crescent. Roman pottery and coins have been found at Stonehurst Road, at land south of Ringmer Road in Tarring and on the Upper Brighton Road. Some Romano- British houses have been excavated in the Titnore Woods area of Durrington. Several small houses at the hill fort of Cissbury Ring on the Downs north of the town would have been in use during the Roman period. Just beyond the boundaries of the modern town of Worthing, a Romano-British shrine existed at Muntham Court (now by the site of Worthing Crematorium). A Roman villa and bath-house also existed at Highdown and at nearby Angmering. The nationally important Patching hoard of Roman coins that was found in 1997 is the latest find of Roman coins found in Britain, probably deposited after 475 AD, well after the Roman departure from Britain around 410 AD. The hoard can be found in the town's Museum and Art Gallery.  The Middle Ages = Anglo-Saxon times  Around 450, Highdown was being used as a cemetery by the South Saxons. Almost 100 graves were found, possibly of Saxon warriors who died in the Saxon invasion of the area. Highdown continued to be used for some time for burials and cremations of Saxons. It is significant that Highdown was being used as a cemetery by pagan Saxons at the same time that Romano-British villa at nearby Northbrook, less than a mile away was still in use by local Celtic Christians. This suggests that Celtic Britons and Saxons were able to live side-by-side in relative harmony.Sally White. The Patching hoard published in Medieval Archaeology. pp.88-93Martin Welch. Early Anglo-Saxon Sussex in Brandon. The South Saxons. pp. 23-25. The Saxons settled nearby Goring and Sompting and by the 13th century the settlement, then known as Wortinge, was populated primarily by farmers and mackerel fishermen. The hamlet of Worthing was originally part of the larger parish of Broadwater. Other nearby villages to later become part of Worthing include Tarring, Salvington, Goring, Heene and Durrington, as well as small parts of the parishes of Findon and Sompting. Droveways (transhumance trackways) that extend from Tarring, Broadwater and nearby Sompting to grazing areas in the Weald via Cissbury Ring and Buncton near Wiston are believed to date from this period or earlier.  Medieval times  Portrait of Anthony Brown, 1st Viscount Montague. After the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539, the manor of Worthing was held by Montague and his descendants for over 200 years Following the Norman conquest, William de Braose gave the manor of Worthing (then known as Ordinges) to Robert le Sauvage, whose descendants held Worthing for around 200 years. Worthing is first mentioned in the Domesday Book as two separate hamlets, Ordinges and Mordinges, when it had a population of just 22. By 1218 the Ordinges had become known as Wurddingg.Stenton. The Place-names of Sussex. p.194. - Ordinges, Mordinges 1086, Wurddingg 1218, Wording(e) 1240, Worthing(e) 1244. The county of Sussex was divided into administrative divisions known as 'rapes'. The manor of Worthing, in common with most of the modern borough of Worthing, was part of the rape of Bramber. In the 13th century, the manor of Worthing was owned by Margaret de Gaddesden, a descendant of Robert le Sauvage. Margaret de Gaddesden later left her husband, John de Camoys, to live with Sir William Paynel, who she later married. It is likely that as a consequence of leaving her first husband for another man she then gave the manor of Worthing to Easebourne Priory near Midhurst, while in 1332 Sir William gave the nearby manor of Cokeham to Hardham Priory near Pulborough. By giving away their property to the church it is likely that Margaret and Sir William were acting in fear of their souls as the medieval church taught damnation was likely. In 1300 and again in 1493, Worthing is recorded as having a harbour, possibly in the estuary of the Teville stream. Worthing harbour was a member of Shoreham Port in 1324. Worthing was owned by the Easebourne Priory until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539. It then became the property of Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu, whose family held the manor of Worthing for over 200 years.  The modern period = 18th and 19th centuries  After founding the Province of Pennsylvania two years earlier, William Penn landed at Worthing in 1684 on his way from Lewes in Sussex County in the Delaware Colony, across the Atlantic to his home in Warminghurst, about north of Worthing. Penn actually wrote Worden in some letters and in the beginning of an autobiography, which is how Worthing would have been pronounced by the people of Sussex at this time. It was in the late 18th century that Worthing began to attract visitors. John Luther, from London, started the trend, building a large lodging house around 1759History at the south end of High Street. In 1789, George Greville, 4th Earl of Warwick, bought the house and renamed it Warwick House. With a warm climate and calm seas, it benefited from the Edwardian fashion for sea cures. Over the course of the next century Worthing became a fashionable resort on the circuit along with the towns of Bath, Brighton, Bognor Regis, Cheltenham and Margate. Portrait of Princess Amelia in 1797. Her visit to Worthing in 1798 was the first of several royal visits which did much to make the town fashionable Royal visits from Princess Amelia in 1798, Princess Charlotte in 1807 and Princess Augusta in 1829 did much to make the town popular. The Prince of Wales visited his youngest sister Princess Amelia in Worthing from nearby Brighton. In 1814, Queen Caroline visited Worthing on her way back to live in Brunswick in northern Germany. In addition, Queen Adelaide, wife of King William IV stayed in the town in 1849 and in 1861 Queen Marie Amelie of France, wife of King Louis-Philippe of France stayed in the town when exiled from France. Notable visitors to the fashionable town of Worthing in the 19th century included novelist Ann Radcliffe, the Duke of Northumberland in 1802, Henry Dundas in 1804, Jane Austen in 1805, Lord Byron in 1806, the Duke of Cumberland in 1817, George Eliot in 1855, Oscar Wilde in 1893 and 1894, who wrote his masterpiece The Importance of Being Earnest while staying in the town in 1894, and the future Emperor Maximilian of Mexico. In 1803 Worthing's population was approximately 2,500 and the hamlet was given town status. Cross Lane was renamed Montague Street and went on to become one of the new town's key thoroughfares. A turnpike road was built around this time linking Worthing directly to Horsham and London for the first time. In the early 19th century, a wall was built separating the fashionable town of Worthing from Heene just to the west. The wall was built from the sea to the banks of the Teville Stream, which could only easily be crossed at one point – the bridge at the top of the High Street, close to the Anchor public house (today's Jack Horner). Since the Teville Stream flows east and south to the sea, this effectively gave the town just one point of entry and exit, allowing 'undesirables' to be kept out. The Rosetta Stone in the British Museum In 1814, polymath Thomas Young, who had a practice in Worthing, took a copy of the Rosetta Stone inscription to his summer home in Worthing to study. Here he \\"made a number of original and insightful innovations\\"Dictionary Of National Biography in the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs. In 1815, two infants' schools opened, mainly through the efforts of the Revd. W.

Date accessed: 21 August 2007. from the new St Paul\`s Church In the early hours of February 22, 1832, a major smuggling foray took place when 300 kegs of contraband spirits were unloaded at the beach opposite the Steyne. Excise officers chased a group of some two to three hundred men, one of Sussex's last smuggling gangs,Brandon, Peter (2006), Sussex up the town's High Street and alleyways (known in the Sussex dialect as twittens) towards Broadwater. As the group slowed down to climb the gate guarding the bridge over the Teville Stream that would take them out of Worthing into open fields, horse-mounted excise officers opened fire at point- blank range on the crowd, who were armed only with wooden staves. They shot dead William Cowerson of Steyning and injured several others. Civil unrest was feared and the military were brought into the town for two years to ensure peace was kept. As with many towns and villages in Sussex and Kent, close proximity to the Continent made the trade of smuggling a lucrative and popular business. In 1845 the railway was extended from Shoreham to Worthing, linking the town by rail with London and the railway network. On November 25, 1850 eleven local fishermen were drowned as they set out from the town's beach to save the crew of the barque the Lalla Rookh, a trading vessel of around 700 tons. The boat was in distress in a storm three miles (5 km) off the coast, and eleven fishermen set out onbaord a small ferry, the Britannia. The Britannia capsized, and a second boat was launched, returning with the news that the Britannia was lost with all lives. Soon afterwards the town's inhabitants subscribed for the town's first lifeboat.'A Town's Pride, Rob Blann, published by Rob Blann 1990 The Skeleton Army at Worthing in 1884 In the 1880s, Worthing was the scene of several riots and violent incidents as the Salvation Army's work in the town aroused much anger among the local population. Objecting to the militant anti-drinking stance taken by the Salvation Army, many formed a group known as the Skeleton Army that rioted in the town. In 1890 the town received its Royal Charter and became the borough of Worthing. Worthing absorbed the neighbouring area of West Worthing and parish of Heene. The first meeting of the new Borough Council (replacing the Worthing Local Board and the West Worthing Commissioners) took place on 10 November 1890, when Worthing elected its first mayor, Alfred Cortis. In 1893 an outbreak of typhoid fever caused 200 fatalities in the town, after 1,416 people caught the disease. The relatively young council took swift action, and by 1895 the town had a new drainage system.  20th century  A map of Worthing from 1946 The 20th century saw a continual expansion of the town, as it expanded to include local villages. In 1902 the borough of Worthing expanded to include parts of Broadwater and West Tarring. In 1929 the borough of Worthing expanded to include Goring and Durrington. And in 1933 the borough of Worthing expanded again to include the west of Sompting and the south of Findon. Between 1908 and 1910, King Edward VII visited Worthing several times to stay at Beach House with the Loder family. On 31 March 1930, Charles Bentinck Budd was elected to the Offington ward of the West Sussex County Council. Later that year, Budd, who lived at Greenville, Grove Road, was elected to the town council as the independent representative of Ham Ward in Broadwater. At an election meeting on 16 October 1933, Budd revealed he was now a member of the British Union of Fascists (BUF). He was duly re-elected and the national press reported that Worthing was the first town in the country to elect a fascist councillor. Street confrontations took place culminating on 9 October 1934 when anti-fascist protesters met outside a Blackshirt rally at the Pavilion Theatre in what became known as the Battle of South Street. Following Italy's invasion of Abyssinia in 1936, Emperor Haile Selassie and his family were forced out of Ethiopia to the United Kingdom. They spent their first six weeks in the UK at the Warnes Hotel, one of the town's top hotels at the time. During World War II, a hole was blown through Worthing Pier to prevent it being used as a landing stage in the event of an invasion. Barbed wire was spread across the beach, which was also mined. Canadian soldiers stayed in several parts of the town, including the former site of the town's rugby club in Tarring and at Park Crescent in the town centre. Courtlands, an impressive country house in the Goring area of the town was used as headquarters of the First Canadian Army. In February 1944, the British Army's 4th Armoured Brigade set up headquarters in the Eardley Hotel by Splash Point. 200 tanks arrived and troops were billeted in and around Steyne Gardens. Historic Beach House was used by the Air Training Corps. During World War II, food supplies were scarce and rationed. The United States Army Air Forces began construction of a training centre on a site north of the railway near Durrington station, however construction ended when the War finished.Butler, Chris (2008). West Sussex Under Attack, Anti-Invasion Sites 1500–1990. The History Press. The people of Timaru in New Zealand donated food parcels to the people of Worthing. After the war, the people of Worthing donated a stained glass window to the people of Timaru in thanks for their efforts. Liberated Soviet Prisoners in Worthing in 1945 Immediately post-war, Worthing expanded with the Maybridge estate, planned by Charles Cowles-Voysey. The redbrick housing estate used Prisoner of War labour, and was built between 1948 and 1956. In the late 20th century many of the town's historic buildings were demolished by planners eager to 'modernise' the town. Notable losses included the town's Theatre Royal, the Old Town Hall, dating from 1834, medieval Offington Hall, the mansion at Charmandean, a medieval fig garden in Tarring and dozens of Victorian villas throughout the town. The Daewoo Nubira was engineered at the company's Worthing Technical Centre (now defunct) in the 1990s In the late 20th century, Worthing had a significant motor industry. In 1979, Octav Botnar founded Datsun UK, later Nissan UK, in the West Durrington area of the town. In the 1970s and 1980s, Dutton Cars produced kit cars from their Worthing headquarters, and for a time was the largest manufacturer of kit cars in the world. The company went on to produce two models of amphibious car, that could be 'driven' across land and sea.Dutton Cars International Automotive Design (IAD) was one of the UK's major design houses for cars, producing prototypes for manufacturers such as Mazda, including the first Mazda MX-5. In 1994, the company was bought by Daewoo who continued to develop cars at their Worthing Technical Centre, including the Daewoo Nubira and the Daewoo Matiz plus trucks and vans, one of which became the LDV Maxus. In 2001, the Worthing centre was bought by TWR Racing which went out of business in 2003.  21st century  The town's council approved Worthing Evolution, a Masterplan for the town's regeneration, in 2006 after extensive public consultation. Since May 2006, environmentalist protesters have been tree sitting at Titnore Wood, in the Durrington area of the town. The action is in protest at plans to build houses and a road-widening scheme through ancient woodland on the edge of the town. From February 2008, Worthing will host the reopened public inquiry into the proposed national park for the South Downs. In July 2009 Transition Town Worthing (TTW) was established to engage the Worthing community in responding to the twin challenges of climate change and the end of cheap oil, and encourage participation in projects to enable Worthing to become more self-reliant and sustainable. In the first decade of the 21st century, Worthing was one of the only towns in the UK to have had various illegal cannabis \\"cafés\\", all of which were subsequently closed. Chris Baldwin (a Legalise Cannabis Alliance activist) first opened one in a back room of his shop, \\"Bongchuffa\\", on Rowlands Road. It was named \\"The Quantum Leaf\\" and there was so much demand that he opened another called \\"Buddies\\", and simultaneously set up \\"The Herb Connection\\". Both cafés were subject to continual police raids. The first was shut when the landlord withdrew the lease for the property shortly followed by the second which closed due to police intercepting users on their way out of the property. Another such establishment, operating in a less obvious, but still public manner was also opened and operated freely in Worthing for over two years, by a group not associated with the LCA and was continually raided. The site of this cafe was reduced to rubble within months of the last raid, and is now the site of modern flats.

VHHS has experienced widespread success with this schedule since it was implemented in the fall of 1998. Most students have 4 classes per 10 weeks terms, each class lasting for 77 minutes. Semester courses are now 10 weeks in length and previous year-long courses are now 20 weeks. Athletics, band, and other activities have been moved to an optional 4th period. This gives an opportunity for a student to accomplish more before graduation. In addition, students taking the optional fourth period every semester can graduate a semester, or more, early. Students not opting to take a fourth period are released at 1:12 every day, allowing more time to complete homework or to work an after-school job.  CIF Champions  On Saturday, June 2 - Charlie Rocca, an MLB prospect at the shortstop position, powered the Dons (23-13 overall and a co-East Valley league title with Polytechnic High School) to their 1st-ever CIF-LACS Division 1 title in a 4-2 extra-inning contest over the first-ranked Carson Colts at Dodgers Stadium. Junior starter Nick Rodriguez poured in eight fantastic innings and senior center-fielder Dakota Gray scored the game- winning run in the top of the 9th, in which Gray caught the final out. Junior Nick Masumoto, the CIF D1 Pitcher of the Year, finished the season with a 0.95 ERA and overall record of 8&4 in 88 1/3 innings, striking out 62 to nine walks. Rocca ends his Dons career with 25 bombs (14 of which came in 2018).  Notable alumni  * Corey Allen, actor and director * A.

She has been working as a solo artist since 2006 and in 2008, joined Jon Lawler from the Fratellis in a band called Codeine Velvet Club which disbanded in 2010. Since then, Lou has recorded her debut album.  Musical career = New Shoes and Do It Yourself (2006–08)  Lou began her time as a musician building up her solo career, which involved performing with Club Noir, the world's biggest burlesque club, as a singer. She spent many years in the Glasgow music scene building up her profile and recording two EPs in this time. As a student, Lou learned about engineering and mixing and took this into her \\"Do It Yourself\\" ethic when recording her EPs, which were entitled New Shoes and Do It Yourself (released December 2007). New Shoes cannot be found on any digital download or physical form and is hard to obtain, whereas Do It Yourself remains on iTunes but cannot be bought physically. During this time, Lou was given a grant by the Scottish Arts Council to record her debut album, but this was eventually put on hold so Lou could pursue a new project called Codeine Velvet Club.  Codeine Velvet Club (2008–10)  Lou met fellow Glaswegian musician Jon Lawler in 2008 thanks to her friend Heather Donnelly (Lawler's wife). Donnelly told Lawler about Lou and asked if he wanted to write a song with her for her debut album; Lawler agreed and the pair met and wrote the song \\"Vanity Kills\\". As Lawler was unable to give the song away, he suggested the pair see how many more songs they could write and form a band. The duo recorded their debut album in 2009 while Lawler's band, The Fratellis, were taking a break. They recruited various session musicians to help record the album and eventually recruited a live setup in the form of Lewis Gordon, Ross MacFarlane and Will Foster. They toured the UK during the end of 2009 and did a brief tour of the US in early 2010, before Lawler announced he would be giving the project up, leaving Lou to go onto his solo work. Disappointed with the end of the band, Lou went back to her solo work.  True Love Ways (2010–present)  After the demise of Codeine Velvet Club, Lou used her grant from the Scottish Arts Council to record her debut album in May 2010. She had a week-long session to record most of the album, with extra sessions being squeezed in when she could. As with her previous EPs, Lou has produced, engineered and mixed the album. The album was delayed for various reasons during 2011 and 2012, before it was confirmed that the title of the album is to be True Love Ways, with a digital release date of Monday 13 May, with a CD release to be confirmed. There was an analog release of an edition of 550 records by Vinyl Frontier Records on Record Store Day, 29 November 2013.

He was responsible for developing standard methods for reconstructing scrolls.  Life  Stegemann began working of the scrolls in 1957 at the Qumran Research Center in Heidelberg. (He later became director of the Center.) In 1963 he was awarded a Ph.D. Semitic studies and Religious Studies from the University of Heidelberg. This was also the year that he finished his reconstruction of the Thanksgiving Hymns scroll. Stegemann obtained his doctorate in Theology from Bonn in 1971.
