It is around long and discharges into the Main at the town of Hafenlohr. The Hafenlohr is located in the districts of Aschaffenburg and Main-Spessart in the Lower Franconia region. The stream is known for its scenic valley, the Hafenlohrtal, and the eponymous nature preserve providing a habitat for many endangered plants and animals. In the past, for centuries the area was on the border between the territories of the Archbishop of Mainz and the Prince-Bishop of W√ºrzburg. Past agricultural and industrial activities along the stream have been largely discontinued. Today, the area mainly offers recreation for hikers, bikers and other visitors. However, the Hafenlohr still feeds numerous ponds supporting fish farms and the forestry business of the nearby F√ºrstlich L√∂wensteinscher Park is located in the valley. A government project to turn most of the valley into a water reservoir by damming the Hafenlohr was abandoned in 2008 after decades of controversy. Etymology The name Hafenlohr is derived from the Middle High German determiner word Havenaere (relating to Hafner or \\"potter\\"). Lohr is derived from the Celtic L√§r meaning \\"broad\\" and \\"shallow\\".Wolf-Armin Reitzenstein:Lexikon bayerischer Ortsnamen. Herkunft und Bedeutung (German) The river gives the town Hafenlohr its name, which has for centuries been a centre of the pottery trade using locally found clay. Course The Hafenlohrquelle The Hafenlohrquelle (source) of the Hafenlohr river is in the village of Rothenbuch, next to the wall of Rothenbuch Castle (Schloss Rothenbuch). It was set in sandstone when the road ST2317 was broadened. The Hafenlohr flows through the castle moat and after around 100 m joins the Tiergartenbach which at that point is already 1.6 km long. However, since this rivulet often carries no water at all during the summer, it is not generally considered the main tributary. Flowing south out of Rothenbuch, the Hafenlohr is next joined by the Breitenbach. The Hafenlohr then continues to the southeast and at the Ahlmichdamm it is joined by the Steinbach. It then turns east-north-east into a steep-sided valley without any larger settlements whose floor is the \\"Nature Preserve Hafenlohrtal\\". Before it reaches Rothenbuch- Lichtenau the Hafenlohr is joined near the small Eichensee by the M√§usbach coming from NNW. It then continues through the Lichtenauer Grund, passes several small ponds and reaches the \\"Nature Preserve Mainzer Eck\\" where the valley starts to meander. The hill Klosterkuppel (552 m) blocks the Hafenlohr's by now easterly course and it turns into its final direction towards the south east at Rothenbuch-Erlenfurt. The Hafenlohr then passes several forester's lodges, Alte and Neue Diana, Einsiedel, Lindenfurterhof and goes on into an unspoilt natural valley bordered on the south by the ', a large, privately owned woodland. Further downriver are the Forsthaus F√ºrstenbr√ºcke and Hubertus (formerly known as Bahnbr√ºckenm√ºhle). At that point lies the youth camping site Windheim of the Main-Spessart district and the Hafenlohr is joined by its largest tributary by far, the Wachenbach (also known as Wagenbach) coming from the south west. It then passes several small ponds fed by water from the Hafenlohr, crosses the town of Windheim as the valley widens and then flows past the solitary hill Achtelsberg (235 m), formerly located within a meander of the river Main. The Hafenlohr now flows through the Gro√üe Au, past several more small ponds and through the Kleine Au which is already bordered on the left and right by the outskirts of the town of Hafenlohr. Finally, it flows beneath the main street of Hafenlohr and at the town's eastern end discharges into the Main. Watershed The mouth of the Hafenlohr The Hafenlohr and its tributaries drain an area of around 147 square kilometres of mainly wooded hills and partially cleared valleys of the region known as Spessart. It is roughly bordered in the west by Weibersbrunn, Rothenbuch in the north, Bischbrunn and Esselbach in the south and Hafenlohr in the east. Geologically, the whole area is made of red sandstone. =Water quality= The water is classified as G√ºteklasse 1. Natural history The Hafenlohrtal features two nature preserves. Most prominent is the \\"Oberes Hafenlohrtal\\", created in 1988. It covers around 71 hectares and stretches along a roughly 4 km long section of the valley from the Ahlmichdamm to Lichtenau. In this part of the valley, the Hafenlohr meanders through meadows of various degrees of wetness. These are kept clear of trees by regular mowing and by removing bushes. The Hafenlohrtal A Eurasian beaver A kingfisher This environment offers a habitat to a large number of plant and animal species. These include the beaver, which was reintroduced to the area. 18 species of birds that are on the IUCN Red List can be found in the Hafenlohrtal, including the kingfisher which nests in the valley and the European dipper. Other birds found along the stream are: common snipe, woodcock, corn crake, little grebe, gray heron, little owl, barn owl, hawk, Eurasian hobby, black kite, spotted woodpecker, whinchat, common warbler, common redstart, oriole and wryneck. Among the migratory birds stopping here is the osprey. Fish living in the creek include various types of trout (brook trout, rainbow trout), grayling, European bullhead, spined loach, European brook lamprey and common nase. Several of these are also on the Red List. The valley is also a habitat for numerous amphibians and reptiles: alpine newt, palmate newt, common water frog, common toad, fire salamander, grass frog, marsh frog, blindworm, grass snake, and common lizard. Although the Spessart in general does not boast great diversity of species of trees, there are more than twenty varieties of trees in the valley. After 1945, the irrigated meadows lost their economic importance and were planted with spruce monoculture, a tree inappropriate to the local environment, on a significant scale, especially downriver of Erlenfurt. In 2007 to 2009, around 10 hectares of spruce forest was removed by logging. The area is now kept clear of trees by goats or cattle. Among the animals used for the purpose are water buffalo. Where the terrain is too wet for grazing, wetland forests of mixed hardwood trees are being created. History A weir on the Hafenlohr Today's appearance of the Hafenlohrtal is due to hundreds of years of human interaction with nature. The water of the stream powered paper and saw mills, supplied glass foundries, meadows and fish ponds, helped create electricity and supplied drinking water for men and beasts. In the Hafenlohrtal the territories of two powerful ecclesial princes met: the Archbishop of Mainz and the Prince-Bishop of W√ºrzburg. The former's sphere of influence extended via his holdings in Aschaffenburg into the area, whilst the latter had acquired the properties of the Benedictine abbey Kloster Neustadt am Main in the late 10th century. Until the end of the 19th century, firewood from the Spessart was rafted down the stream (which was dammed for the purpose in places) to Hafenlohr where it was loaded on ships. From the 19th century through the mid-20th century, the meadows of the Hafenlohrtal were irrigated by a system of artificial streams, some of which remain today. Following the stream's course from origin to mouth: * Rothenbuch: The spring from which the Hafenlohr originates, is presumed to have been a meeting point for medieval hunters. Rothenbuch was first mentioned in written documents in 1318. In 1342, construction of a hunting lodge for the Archbishop of Mainz began and the spring was used to fill the castle moat with water. Later trout ponds were added. Rothenbuch was the local seat of the Archbishop's forest administration, which was also in charge of supervising the glass foundries in the area and the use of wood by the local population. The around 20 men working for the administration were also responsible for supplying game to the court at Aschaffenburg and organising hunts within the Spessart. In 1485, the Forstmeister of the Spessart moved his seat from Aschaffenburg to Rothenbuch. From here the rafting of firewood down the Hafenlohr‚Äîthrough the territory of the rival Bishop of W√ºrzburg‚Äîwas organised. Today's castle structure partially dates to 1567 and was built as a hunting lodge for the Archbishop of Mainz Daniel Brendel von Homburg. It was expanded in the late 17th century. * At Lichtenau the lands owned by Mainz and W√ºrzburg met. To secure the border, in 1462 the Echter family, feudal retainers of the Archbishop of Mainz, established a stud farm at Lichtenau. However, the fief was soon integrated into the direct property of the Archbishopry and became a stud farm raising horses for the Archbishop's stables. From 1657 to 1790 it was the official Staatsgest√ºt for the Erzstift Mainz, property of the Archbishop. However, after 1775 the closure of the stud was considered due to high costs. In 1813, it was acquired under Erbpacht by the Rexroth brothers who installed a hammer mill. After the Rexroths moved to Lohr in 1850, activity here was reduced. The mill was finally closed in 1871. In 1896, Julius Rexroth sold the property to the Eich brothers of next door Hoher Knuck. Initially used only for agriculture, they later opened a tavern and hotel which is still in operation. In 1927, journalist and writer Kurt Tucholsky stopped here whilst on a walking tour of the region and commented very favourably on the experience in his writing. Today, the border between the two administrative districts of Aschaffenburg and Main-Spessart still follows the old territorial borders and after running parallel to it for a while the Hafenlohr passes it at Erlenfurt (see below). * Erlenfurt marks the boundary between two dialects: Rhine Franconian and Main- Franconian. It also borders the area known as Haderwald (\\"Forest of Strife\\"), subject of 200 years of strife between the Prince-Bishops of Mainz and W√ºrzburg that ended in 1583. * Einsiedel was founded in 1260 as a hermitage named \\"Ryffendal\\" by one Frater Radnoldus. In 1264 it became a priory of the Benedictine abbey Neustadt am Main. In 1483, it was transformed into a dependent farmstead and leased out. After Einsiedel became property of the family of L√∂wenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg in the secularization of 1803, glass was manufactured here (1807‚Äì1889). Although the foundry Karlsh√ºtte has since been torn down, dating back to the time of industrial production here (the glass foundry had up to 50 employees) is the neogothic church, constructed in 1866 by Princess Sophie L√∂wenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. Since 1977, Einsiedel has been the centre of the local forestry business of the L√∂wenstein Estate. * The Lindenfurter Hof was mentioned for the first time in 1264 and belonged to the Kloster Neustadt. Until 1790 it served as a stud farm for the Bishop of W√ºrzburg. From 1850 to 1977 the administration of the L√∂wenstein forestry and game business was located here. Today it is leased out by the L√∂wenstein Estate. * Hafenlohr was mentioned first in 1324 but its origins (and those of Windheim just to the north west) probably go back to around the year 1000. It was a centre of the pottery industry. The area was property of the Kloster Neustadt since the late 8th century. From the mid-12th century it belonged to the Counts of Rieneck until their male line died out in 1333 and the property reverted to the Hochstift of the Bishop of W√ºrzburg. Economy From 1978 to 2008, the Bavarian government considered building a dam in the valley of the Hafenlohr and use the stored water as a supply of drinking water. This would have created a 15 km long lake in the valley, covering about 250 hectares, and resulted in the destruction of roughly 300 hectares of forest. After decades of protests by local residents, environmentalists and other groups the plan was finally shelved in September 2008. Today, tourism plays a role in the local economy, with several establishments in the Hafenlohrtal providing gastronomical services including accommodation, such as the Schlosshotel Rothenbuch, Gasthaus im Hochspessart and Hoher Knuck. There are also active fish farms (trout) at the ponds of Erlenfurt and Lindenfurterhof. The L√∂wenstein Estate conducts forestry business in the area, although the Estate's administrative headquarters is in Amorbach. =Recreation= The area provides numerous signposted paths for biking and hiking. The nature preserve Hafenlohrtal was originally off-limits to visitors but since 2004 has been opened up by a looping path of around 3 km that includes a boardwalk leading into the valley and crossing the stream on a small wooden bridge. The most prominent trail is the \\"European Culture Trail Hafenlohrtal\\", set up as part of the project \\"Pathways to Cultural Landscapes\\" supported by the European Union.

The song is included on the 1990 boxset Lennon, the 2005 two disc compilation Working Class Hero: The Definitive Lennon and the 2010 album, Gimme Some Truth. Lyrics and music \\"Out the Blue\\" is one of several songs on Mind Games devoted to Yoko Ono. It was recorded at a time when Lennon and Ono were separated, and reflects Lennon's resulting self- doubt. It states Lennon's gratitude for Ono appearing in his life \\"out the blue\\" and providing his \\"life's energy.\\" According to authors Ken Bielen and Ben Urish, the theme of the song is \\"the awe of finding true love unexpectedly.\\" Music critic Johnny Rogan finds some of the metaphors \\"gruesome,\\" for example \\"All my life's been a long, slow knife,\\" and some of the similes \\"wacky,\\" for example \\"Like a UFO you came to me and blew away life's misery.\\" Pop historian Robert Rodriguez regards the UFO line as \\"idiosyncratic\\" as well. Andrew Grant Jackson, however, finds the UFO metaphor to be apt for Ono, since at the time Ono came into Lennon's life she was as surprising a love interest for him as anyone could be. Bielen and Urish praise the \\"long, slow knife\\" image one of Lennon's most poetic of emotional anguish. The title phrase has multiple meanings during the song; Ono came to him \\"out the blue\\" and also cast \\"out the blue\\" of Lennon's melancholy. \\"Out the Blue\\" moves through several musical genres, starting with a gentle, melancholy acoustic guitar and moving through gospel, country and music portions. The sound grows as the song progresses, while Lennon's vocal becomes more assured, going from its original restraint to an expression of \\"joyful contentment.\\" After the initial acoustic guitar, the piano, pedal steel guitar, bass guitar and drums enter, and eventually a \\"heavenly choir\\" is included. Author John Blaney describes the song's piano motif as \\"majestic\\" and compares the bass guitar line to those of Lennon's ex-bandmate Paul McCartney. Rodriguez praises the way Lennon's vocal manages to \\"stay atop the waves\\" of sound, and project both gratitude and tenderness. Keith Spore of The Milwaukee Sentinel described it as having a \\"haunting minor key melody in the best Beatle tradition.\\" Rolling Stone Magazine critic David Fricke praised the production as being \\"fascinating and moving,\\" comparing it to Phil Spector's production of The Beatles' \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" but \\"with the emphasis on poignance.\\" The backing instrumental part for the final released version was cut down from the original recording, eliminating the second break as well as all but the final coda of the reprise of the refrain. The full recorded instrumental, with a guide vocal, was released as part of The Lost Lennon Tapes and on bootleg albums. Reception Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine considers \\"Out the Blue\\" to be a \\"lovely ballad,\\" while Blaney describes it as \\"an exquisite ballad.\\" Blaney goes on to say that \\"it reveals more than a glimpse of Lennon's genius.\\" Mandinger and Easter call it a \\"truly beautiful love song\\" and feel it deserves more attention than it has received, and could have made a good follow up single to \\"Mind Games.\\" They also claim that it shows Lennon had not lost his ability to put \\"the simplest emotions across in the most affecting manner possible.\\" Jackson considers it the best of Lennon's apology songs to Ono. He particularly praises the arrangement, in which he maintains interest by building up the instrumentation gradually. Urish and Bielen opine that it delivers \\" a more satisfying emotional impact than might be supposed.\\" Lennon biographer John Borack calls it a \\"highlight\\" of Mind Games. Los Angeles Times music critic Robert Hilburn calls it \\"one of the unquestioned highlights\\" of Mind Games, calling it a \\"lovely song\\" and praising its \\"tender, effective lyrics.\\" PopMatters regards it as Lennon's \\"only lighter waving 70s monster ballad,\\" and believes that it should be included on Lennon's greatest hits compilation albums. Pop historian Robert Rodriguez regards it as one of the \\"best unsung John\\" Lennon songs, one of Lennon's \\"finest performances\\" and one of his best \\"standard-worthy ballad(s).\\" Personnel The musicians who performed on the original recording were as follows: *John Lennon ‚Äì vocals, acoustic guitar *David Spinozza ‚Äì guitar *Pete Kleinow ‚Äì pedal steel guitar *Ken Ascher ‚Äì keyboards *Gordon Edwards ‚Äì bass guitar *Jim Keltner ‚Äì drums *Something Different ‚Äì backing vocals References External links * Category:John Lennon songs Category:Songs written by John Lennon Category:1973 songs Category:Song recordings produced by John Lennon Category:Rock ballads Category:1970s ballads ","title":"Out the Blue (John Lennon song)"},{"id":"33012672","text":"Henry IV of Neuhaus (also known as Henry IV of Hradec; ; 13 April 1442 ‚Äì 17 January 1507), was a member of the Telƒç branch of the noble von Neuhaus family.

Retrieved 2012-05-06. It is one of the Revenue circles and developmental blocks in the Kokrajhar district. History At close of the Bhutan War of 1864, the British and the Bhutani signed the Sinchula Agreement in 1865. Under the agreement, the 18th Bhutan Duars were divided into the Eastern and Western Duars. The portion of the land lying between the Manas and Sankosh rivers was formed into the Eastern Duars district and was administered by Deputy Commissioner with headquarter at Dotma. By the government notification of 3 December 1866, the Eastern Duars were added to Goalpara and along with this Goalpara was separated from province of Assam and placed under the Commissioner at Coochbehar division in all matters. Due to administrative convenience the civil and criminal jurisdiction of Goalpara was re-transferred to Judicial Commissioner of Assam on 10 August 1868, but executive control remained with the commissioner of Coochbehar. Goalpara along with Dotma was finally incorporated in the new province when Assam was created as a separate administration in 1874. The Headquarters of the District initially located at Goalpara was transferred to Dhubri in 1879. In the 19th century the British accepted it as a commercial place and constructed a narrow gauge railway in the heart of Dotma to reach Kochugaon, for carrying timber logs from the Kochugaon Forest division. These timber logs had been placed at Dotma at Thulungapuri the burial ground of Upendra Nath Brahma, father of the Bodo people, from which these were dispatched to Fakiragram for selling. Besides there was a legendary hero called Jaolia Dewan or Sikna Mech. When a war took place between the British force and Bhutias, Sikna Mech sided with the Bhutani force. He left his capital Siknajhar and sheltered at the Dangarkuti village of Dotma, hiding his pregnant wife in neighbouring Bhalukmari village. He was defeated by the British who had the use of cannons. Later he was killed by the British force at Ali Khungri river in Bengal.

It is located in a valley area of the Rio Castelo, between the villages of Cunha Baixa and Espinho. History From artifacts discovered in and around the archaeological excavations, scientists have determined that it was constructed between 3000 and 2500 BC. and like numerous other similar sites, is believed to be an ancient Beaker monument. It was discovered in 1892, by Leite de Vasconcelos, who first documented the dolmen, under the authority of Dr. Pais da Cunha, then owner of the property. He found the dolmen damaged, with the interior chambers full of dirt, brambles and rocks of various sizes, some eroded or damaged from the dolmen itself. They proceeded to clean out the chambers and excavate to about 1.17 metres, discovering the first archaeological objects, and then continuing to the table rock. In these excavations Leite de Vasconcelos found in the interior of the dolmen, axes and polished trapezoidal-shaped polished stone adzes; rudely carved flint blades, trapezoidal microliths, triangular and semi-lunar, fragments of red and black pottery, some with ornaments; yellow ochre for body painting; burnt berry seeds; burnt pieces of substances from a forge or furnace; and a human bone. At the entrance, was an inclined rock slab 1.2 metres by 0.2 metres, with 15 grooves along its edge on both sides. Also in the adjacent terrain, a flint axe, a polished stone implement, six small blades (some jagged) and flint arrowheads, were also discovered. The artifacts were transferred to the National Archaeological Museum () in Lisbon. It was declared a National Monument () on 16 June 1910. In 1934, the Leisners carried-out a plan of the site, and cut a section from the dolmen. By 1955, I. Moita encountered the dolmen surrounded by scrub and the corridor obstructed by rocks. A restoration and cleaning of the site, under Raquel Vila√ßa and Domingos Cruz (1987), solicited the A.C.A.B. and the Central Region Archaeological Service (), with authorization from the IPPC. A similar cleaning was undertaken in 1994 that included cleaning the monument and the area circling the site. Architecture Located along the municipal roadway connecting Cunha Baixa with Espinho, the site is 0.8 kilometres along a footpath to a bridge: 300 metres by foot between two properties in the locality of Orca, or Casa da Moura. It is situated in a rural, fertile plain alongside a river, isolated from view and encircled by vineyards to the south and east, and pine forests to north and northwest, delimited by a wood and wire fence. Cunha Baixa comprises a main chamber and corridor, although there are no remnants of body within its chamber. The dolmen, is a large polygonal shape enclosure, covered by a great slab of rock, of similarly large dimensions. This main chamber is 3 metres wide, and 3.2 metres high, formed from 9 vertical slabs, some fractured or incomplete. The entrance rock is parallel to the main stone and inclined towards the interior. The roof-stone is a long rounded rectangular slab, 4.5 metres in diameter. The corridor is 7.20 metre long, at a height of 1.40 metres, oriented along the southeast of the main chamber. It is built from 8 vertical slabs on either side (a few reinforced by steel beams), forming side-walls that are wider in the mid-area and converge slightly towards the main chamber entrance. The vertical slabs are largely square, although some trapezoid and triangular rock pieces are located in the chamber. At the middle of the corridor, another trapezoidal roof slab, smaller than the first covers only the middle part of the corridor. The pavement of the dolmen is regular, composed of granite rock, with a total surface area of 10.4 metres. In some places there are remnants of carvings (or vestiges), such as pitting or scaring.

Assessments of teacher quality are currently used for policymaking, employment and tenure decisions, teacher evaluations, merit pay awards, and as data to inform the professional growth of teachers. Qualifications, credentials, and teacher characteristics Teacher qualifications include a range of variables affecting teacher quality, including type of teaching certification, undergraduate major or minor, undergraduate institution, advanced degree(s) or certifications (such as certification through the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards AND Centre for Teacher Accreditation (CENTA), type of preparation program (traditional or alternate route), test scores (various subject matter, licensure, or verbal skills tests), and years of teaching experience.Goe, L. (2007).The link between teacher quality and student outcomes: A research synthesis. Washington, DC: National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality. Retrieved 21 Feb 2013. In many countries, teaching credentials represent the main measure of teacher quality.Sclafani, S., & Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development. (2009). Evaluating and rewarding the quality of teachers: International practices. Paris: OECD. In the United States, one goal of the No Child Left Behind law is to ensure that all teachers meet state-defined standards of highly qualified teachers. Demographic characteristics such as a teacher's gender, race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic background may also be characterized as elements of teacher quality as variables impacting student outcomes.Zumwalt, K., & Craig, E. (2005). Teachers' characteristics: Research on the indicators of quality. In AERA Panel on Research and Teacher Education, M. Cochran-Smith & K. M. Zeichner (Eds.), Studying teacher education: The report of the AERA panel on research and teacher education (pp. 157-260). Mahwah, N.J. These indicators of teacher quality are relatively straightforward to ascertain, as opposed to the student achievement and teacher observation measures described below. Student achievement measures Teacher quality with regard to student achievement‚Äîalso known as \\"teacher effectiveness\\"‚Äîis measured in terms of student achievement gains. Most extant research on teacher quality pertains to observable attributes, preparation, and credentials (Goldhaber, 2002; McCaffrey et al.,2003; Neild and Ripple, 2008). Probably the most widely studied attributes are experience and education levels, in part because the data can be readily obtained because of their use in salary placement (Goldhaber, 2002). There is mixed evidence, however, that experience and education levels are associated with student learning (Goldhaber, 2002; Goldhaber and Brewer, 1997, 2000; Hanushek, 1997; Wenglinsky,2002). Student achievement is measured through the use of standardized tests to determine the academic growth of students over time. Recently, a type of analysis of this growth termed \\"value-added modeling,\\" following the 1971 approach of Eric Hanushek,Eric A. Hanushek, \\"Teacher characteristics and gains in student achievement: Estimation using micro data.\\" American Economic Review 60, no. 2 (May): 280-288.has sought to isolate the fraction of student achievement gains attributable to individual teachers, or in some cases groups of teachers.Harris, D. N. (2011). Value- added measures in education: What every educator needs to know. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Education Press. However, it has been argued that student achievement measures do not necessarily correlate entirely with teacher quality, given that there are various factors that influence a student's performance which is not under the control of a teacher. Teacher practice Assessments of teacher quality may also draw upon evidence collected from observations of teachers' work that lead to the empowering of effective teachers. This evidence may be collected from in-person or video-recorded observations of teaching, pre- and post-observation conferences with teachers, and samples of teachers' work with students. Assessments of teacher practice may examine teacher quality for a single lesson or over an entire school year. Such assessments may be holistic or narrative in form, but in rubric-based systems of teacher assessment like the Framework for Teaching, and Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS)Teachstone.org. About the CLASS have become increasingly more common in the United States in order to align with state and federal accountability requirements. Many school districts have developed their own rubrics for this purpose, such as the IMPACT system used in the District of Columbia public schools.District of Columbia Public Schools. \\"An Overview of IMPACT\\" Other practice-based assessments of teacher quality require teachers themselves to assemble evidence and self-assess their own indicators of teacher quality according to rubrics as part of the process. Examples include the Performance Assessment for California Teachers (PACT).pacttpa.org. \\"What is PACT?\\" and its national successor the edTPA,American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education. \\"About edTPA\\" the Oregon-based Teacher Work Sample.Western Oregon University. Teacher Work Sample Methodology and the collection of assessments required by teachers seeking certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. Teacher experience The way that most current teacher compensation systems are set up is to reward teachers with salary increases for every year of additional experience they gain. The research literature on the predictive power of teacher experience for student achievement gains, however, reveals modest effects of experience limited to the first few years of a teacher's career.Jacob, A. M. (2012) Examining the Relationship between Student Achievement and Observable Teacher Characteristics: Implications for School Leaders. International Journal of Educational Leadership Preparation, 7(3). Research by Hanushek, Kain, O'Brien, and Rivkin (2005), Kane et al. (2006), and Rockoff (2004) suggests that teacher effectiveness grows in the initial four or five years in the classroom and then begins to level off.  Teacher evaluation approaches  Teacher evaluation is a process used to measure teacher effectiveness based on students learning and success. Evaluations of teachers over the years have changed. In earlier years, teacher evaluations were based on personal characteristics of the teacher, however, starting in the early 1950s until the 1980s, teacher evaluations took a shift and started to focus on teachers' teaching, observed through students' outcomes. After the 1980s, teacher evaluations were measured based on increased professional development, accountability, and school improvement. Teacher evaluation has taken numerous approaches that observed teacher practices. Measures of Effective Teaching (MET), Danielson's Framework Model, Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS), and the Value added Model (VAM) are all evaluation tools that aim to measure student achievement using teacher evaluation. MET evaluates teacher effectiveness through five measures: students' gains in standardized testing, recorded classroom sessions and teacher reflections afterwards, teachers' knowledge in the pedagogical content, students views of the classroom and instruction of the teacher, and the teachers own views on their working conditions and the support of the school. While the MET approach uses five measures to evaluate teacher effectiveness, the Danielson Framework model evaluates teachers using four domains: planning and preparation, classroom environment, instruction, and professional responsibilities. In this framework of evaluation, teachers are evaluated through a rubric that contains these four domains. They can either be ranked or measured as unsatisfactory, basic, proficient, or distinguished. In this rubric, teachers are being evaluated through critical attributes and examples when being observed. Teacher responses to this evaluation system have been positive because the evaluation system presented clear and specific standards. Robinson, M. A. (2019). Perceptions of the Danielson Framework on student performance & classroom instruction (Order No. 13806847). . Administrators generally perceive the Danielson Framework as positive because of the rigorous and specific statement of standards. One concern that administrators have about using the Danielson Framework as the sole evaluation model is that teachers may alter their behavior only around observable classroom behaviors, limiting the how representative the evaluations truly are. Robinson, M. A. (2019). Perceptions of the danielson framework on student performance & classroom instruction (Order No. 13806847). The CLASS approach, by Robert Pianta, evaluates teachers based on their interaction with students. To do this, the CLASS model evaluates teachers' interactions using three domains: emotional support, classroom organization, and instructional support. This approach is much more flexible, as the domains used within the approach vary based on students' grade levels. On the other hand, the VAM approach uses students' test score gains to reflect teachers' effectiveness. Unlike the other approaches that evaluate particular characteristics or style of teaching for teacher evaluations, VAM does not directly evaluate the teacher. Although many of the approaches for teacher evaluations are debated, VAM is said to be inconsistent in its approach due to variation in classes, years, or test since its effectiveness measures are not based on teachers. However, it said that VAM measures are retroactively effective due to teacher practices that influence learning of students. Finally, an organisation in India called Centre for Teacher Accreditation (CENTA) uses two main steps in teacher certification and evaluation. The first step is an Objective Test which is based on the subject chosen, classroom practice, logical ability, communication etc. The second step is a Practical assessment which consists of an e-portfolio submission and a proctored assessment + interview. This evaluation and certification is based on CENTA standards http://centa.org/centastandards that have been developed after several years of research and feedback.

He was also known for his long series of races against the Champion Hurdler Brave Inca. He was put down after breaking a leg in a race at Cheltenham in December 2007. Background Macs Joy was the best horse sired by the American-bred stallion Religiously. He was trained throughout his career by Jessica Harrington (officially Mrs John Harrington) near Moone, County Kildare. His most regular jockey was Barry Geraghty who rode him in twenty-two of his thirty-one races. Racing career =2003/4 season= Macs Joy began his career by running in two National Hunt flat races in June 2003. He won on his debut at Tralee beating nineteen opponents and finished third in a similar event at Tipperary three weeks later. When the jumping season proper began in autumn, Macs Joy was campaigned as a Novice Hurdler, running five times in minor events before Christmas. He showed some promise by winning a small race at Downpatrick and finishing second to the future Cheltenham Gold Cup winner War of Attrition at Navan. After Christmas he was moved out of Novice company, racing instead in Handicap races against more experienced opposition. He made rapid improvement, with his official handicap rating rising from 111 to 142 in the next five months. After a second place in the valuable Pierse Hurdle in January he finished first in a handicap at Leopardstown only to be disqualified for interfering with the runner-up when drifting left in the closing stages. In April Macs Joy recorded his first notable win, carrying 11‚Äì0 to victory in the Menolly Homes Handicap Hurdle at Fairyhouse, after which he was sent to England for the first time to compete in the Swinton Handicap Hurdle at Haydock. Held up in the early stages he made progress to lead approaching the last hurdle and ran on strongly to win by two and a half lengths. According to the Racing Post he \\"oozed class\\" and was \\"one to follow\\". =2004/5 season= Leopardstown Racecourse. The site of Macs Joy's two Grade I wins in 2004/5 After warming up with third place in a flat race Macs Joy won the Anglo Irish Bank Hurdle at Down Royal, beating the Supreme Novices' Hurdle winner Brave Inca \\"comfortably\\" This was to be the first of twelve meetings between the two horses over the next eighteen months (the final score was 7‚Äì5 in Brave Inca's favour). Although he was carrying ten pounds less than the runner-up, his performance attracted the attention of the bookmakers, who offered him at odds of 14-1 for the Champion Hurdle immediately after the race. After a third place to Harchibald in the Morgiana Hurdle in November he was sent to Leopardstown for the Grade I December Festival Hurdle. He produced his best performance to date, taking the lead before the last hurdle and going clear to beat Brave Inca by three lengths, with the Champion Hurdler Hardy Eustace two lengths further back in third. Macs Joy confirmed his superiority over Brave Inca and Hardy Eustace in the Irish Champion Hurdle at Leopardstown, and although the margins were much closer on this occasion, with the three horses crossing the line almost as one, he had established himself as a leading contender for the Champion Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival. Geraghty was confident, saying,\\"That is as good a Champion Hurdle trial you will see in a long time.\\". At Cheltenham, Macs Joy went off third favourite at odds of 7‚Äì1, but after challenging two hurdles from the finish, he could make no further impression and came home fifth to Hardy Eustace, beaten five lengths. He moved up to two and a half miles at Aintree where he finished fourth to Al Eile in the Aintree Hurdle, and ended his season with a third place to Brave Inca and Harchibald at Punchestown. =2005/6 season= Macs Joy took some time to find his form in the autumn. He finished last of five to Brave Inca in the Morgiana Hurdle, and a remote fourth to the same horse at the Punchestown December Festival. In the new year he began to improve, getting to within a length of Brave Inca when second in the Irish Champion Hurdle, before recording his first win for over a year in the Red Mills Trial Hurdle. Starting at odds-on, he was never under pressure and was eased down in the closing stages to beat the staying mare Asian Maze by four and a half lengths. He returned to Cheltenham for the Championship, in which his improving form saw him sent off 13-2 third favourite behind Brave Inca (whose rider Tony McCoy had referred to Macs Joy as his \\"main danger\\") and Hardy Eustace, who was seeking his third consecutive win in the race. The three Irish horses dominated the race, but although Macs Joy was always in touch and challenged strongly in the closing stages, he was unable to catch Brave Inca, who beat him by a length, with Hardy Eustace third. On his final start of the season, Macs Joy produced his best performance. The Punchestown Champion Hurdle attracted only four runners, but they included the first three from Cheltenham. Macs Joy tracked Hardy Eustace in the early stages before moving smoothly into the lead and pulling away to win by an \\"impressive\\" four lengths from Brave Inca. Jessica Harrington acknowledged that the faster ground and slower earlier pace had allowed had enabled Macs Joy to use his greater natural speed to his advantage. \\"We got him at last\\" she said, referring to Brave Inca. =2006/7 season= Macs Joy's return to the racecourse was delayed by a series of \\"niggly muscle injuries\\" and he did not run again until January 2007. He was quite promising when taking third to Hardy Eustace in the Irish Champion Hurdle, but was disappointing when beaten at odds-on in the Red Mills Trial Hurdle. He was still being prepared for a third attempt at the Champion Hurdle, but was forced out by a recurrence of his muscle problems four days before the race. He was re-routed to the Punchestown Festival in April, and after a warm up race on the flat, was made favourite for the Punchestown Champion Hurdle. Macs Joy overtook and then pulled clear of his main rival Hardy Eustace, but was caught in the closing stages and beaten a neck by the 20-1 outsider Silent Oscar. Death Macs Joy began the 2007/2008 season with a third place in the Morgiana Hurdle before being sent to England for the Grade II Boylesports.com International Hurdle at Cheltenham on 15 December 2007. Macs Joy broke down with a serious leg injury approaching the third last hurdle. The injury, which proved to be a broken tibia, was untreatable and he was quickly euthanized. It was the only time that he had failed to complete the course in a race. Jessica Harrington praised Macs Joy saying Barry Geraghty called him \\"a great horse... he'll be sadly missed\\" Assessment Macs Joy's highest official rating was 167, after his win in the 2006 Punchestown Champion Hurdle. This was equal to the highest rating achieved by the Champion Hurdler Brave Inca, and higher than the best rating achieved by the subsequent champions Sublimity (166), Punjabi (164) and Katchit (166).

The technology will primarily provide defense against shoulder-fired, heat- seeking missiles, or MANPADS. The program is being developed to replace older suites such as the Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures (ATIRCM). The CIRCM system will be designed to meet Tri-Service \\"common\\" Army, Navy, and Air Force requirements. The Department of Defense‚Äôs (DoD) strategy is to competitively develop a lightweight and cost-effective jammer subsystem for installation on all DoD rotary-wing and slow moving fixed-wing aircraft. The Army took delivery of its first CIRCM systems from Northrop Grumman in 2016.  Infrared Countermeasures (IRCM)  Infrared guidance systems in heat- seeking missiles are designed to track strong sources of infrared radiation ‚Äì heat ‚Äì such as aircraft engines, helping missiles to home in on their targets. IRCM systems are based on a modulated source of infrared radiation with a higher intensity than the target itself. When a missile seeker observes this modulated radiation, it interferes with or obscures the modulated signal from the aircraft and renders the missile incapable of maintaining a lock on the target.  Directional Infrared Counter Measures (DIRCM)  Directional IRCM, or DIRCM, allows for a countermeasures laser to be targeted directly at an incoming IR threat. This makes possible a more powerful and effective defense than previous, non-directional infrared countermeasures, as the threat is directly addressed rather than the system essentially painting an area with IR disruption, which results in a weaker signal in any given direction. As IR seeking technology has improved and diversified, standard IRCM systems have become less effective at defeating heat-seeking missiles. Measures such as flares have begun to give way to lasers, which, when fitted on a directional pivoting mount, allow for more effective, concentrated and energy-efficient directional targeting of IR radiation at incoming missile seekers.  CIRCM Program Background  CIRCM was authorized in April 2009 by the U.S. Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD (AT&L;)), as a next generation program to replace the combined Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures/Common Missile Warning System (ATIRCM/CMWS) program. The program was designated as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1D program, also in April 2009. The CIRCM system, (along with the older LAIRCM and ATIRCM systems) provide a directional infrared countermeasure, which employs both threat-tracking capabilities, as well defensive measures employing modulating laser pulses to confuse missiles' guidance systems causing them to miss their target. The Army issued a draft request for proposals for the CIRCM contract in May 2009, opening the competitive phase for a deal to develop and install the missile jammer on thousands of helicopters and tiltrotors in US military inventory. The winning contractor will provide an initial 1,076 systems to supply AH-64 Apache, UH-60 Black Hawk, CH-47 Chinook and future armed scout helicopters. Currently, the DoD plans to award two or more 21-month technology development contracts first, followed by a two-year engineering and manufacturing development phase, with production to begin in 2015 and deployment in 2017. The program has an expected value of $1.5 billion. Competition is fierce for the CIRCM program, with four established industry teams vying for what seems to be one of the few new starts the armed services will pursue in a \\"bleak\\" budgetary environment.  Current Systems in Operation  The CIRCM system is intended to be an improved, lighter-weight version of the ATIRCM system. CIRCM lowers the weight of the system and therefore brings with it the opportunity to deploy this kind of laser counter- measure across a wider portion of the fleet.  Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures (ATIRCM)  Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasures, or ATIRCM, is the most recent attempt at an infrared countermeasures capability. The Army began fielding the ATIRCM Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) system on 83 CH-47s supporting operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2009. The USD (AT&L;) limited the ATIRCM QRC program to these specific aircraft, due to the current combined weight of the ATIRCM/CMWS suite. DoD planners set the CIRCM target weight at 85 pounds for the jamming B-kit with two turrets, while the supporting A-kit is capped at 70 pounds for large rotorcraft like the Chinook and V-22 Osprey tiltrotor, or 35 pounds for smaller helicopters like the Black Hawk. Service officials have said they want to field a cheaper, lighter system for their remaining helicopters, which will integrate smoothly with systems like CMWS and the Joint and Allied Threat Awareness System (JATAS), across all branches of the military. = ATIRCM Nunn-McCurdy Breach = The Nunn-McCurdy provision introduced in 1982 by Senator Sam Nunn and Congressman Dave McCurdy requires that any defense program that increases in cost by more than 15% over its acquisition cycle must be reported to Congress and either restructured or fully explained by the Office of the Secretary of Defense. In June 2010, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Dr. Ashton Carter made such a report on the ATIRCM program. In a June 2010 letter to Representative Ike Skelton, D-Mo., Carter explained how restructuring the ATIRCM/CMWS program caused a breach of the Nunn-McCurdy statute, since, when military officials determined the ATIRCM system to be too heavy for any helicopter except the CH-47, the purchase quantity had to be substantially reduced - down to 83 units. This caused the unit cost to rise above Nunn- McCurdy limits. As part of the Nunn-McCurdy certification process, in which the Pentagon explains the cost growth to Congress and reaffirms why the program is still essential to national security, officials have to show that lower-cost alternatives are not available. This is partly why the DoD has stipulated that the CIRCM system will need to integrate with existing and future detection systems while also dramatically reducing unit weight.  Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM)  The Department of the Navy (DoN) also operates an infrared countermeasures program called LAIRCM, which is fielded exclusively on large fixed-wing aircraft, and uses a laser pointer- tracker to defeat IR-guided threats. LAIRCM systems such as the AAQ-24, delivered to the DoN by Northrop Grumman, are directed IR countermeasures designed to defend large fixed-wing aircraft from IR-guided threats. LAIRCM was devised to protect planes by automatically detecting missile launches and activating a high-intensity system of pulsed lasers to track and defeat the threat by confusing its guidance system.  Integration with the Common Missile Warning System (CMWS)  The Common Missile Warning System, or CMWS, consists of missile warning sensors operating in the solar-blind ultra-violet wavelengths capable of detecting incoming missile threats and an electronic control unit that informs the aircraft crew of the threat, automatically triggering flare/chaff countermeasures. As of the end of 2009, the production CMWS, coupled with chaff/flare dispensers was deployed on approximately 1,000 Army CH-47 Chinooks, UH-60 Blackhawks, AH-64 Apaches, [R]C-12 Hurons, UC-35 Citations and C-23 Sherpa Aircraft. In the future, the military will utilize the integrated CMWS/CIRCM suite to enhance threat warning and improve defensive countermeasures for helicopters and small, slow-moving fixed-wing aircraft, whose size precludes the use of LAIRCM. The systems will protect aircraft and crews from shoulder-fired, vehicle-launched, and other advanced infrared-guided missile threats during dangerous low-altitude operations. CIRCM will integrate with CMWS, which will identify an incoming threat (i.e. whether it is a missile or tracer fire, etc.), and then integrate with CIRCM‚Äôs onboard tracking system.  Additional CIRCM Specifications  The DoD requires that CIRCM implement a Modular Open System Approach (MOSA) to integrate jamming lasers, missile trackers and missile warning receivers. US military helicopter losses to MANPAD systems prompted Army Aviation to field the BAE Systems AAR-57 Common Missile Warning System (CMWS), to locate incoming missiles accurately. The Navy is continuing development of JATAS to integrate Missile Warning Receiver, Hostile Fire Indicator and Laser Warning Receiver functions. MOSA interfaces will make it possible for CIRCM to take cues from either warning system. It is important for reasons of expediency and cost that when a CIRCM system is chosen and fielded on US aircraft, it is backward compatible with CMWS, and forward compatible with JATAS, according to Army Lt. Col. Raymond Pickering, product manager for infrared countermeasures at the Program Executive Office-Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEWS). The program is currently in the technology demonstration phase.

It was first screened on Channel 4 on 12 March 1988 and also stars Adrian Edmondson and Peter Richardson. It features a brief appearance by Lily Allen, Keith's daughter, then a toddler, and subsequently a pop star. In the story, pretentious music video director Patrick Church (Keith Allen) is at UB40 concert, where he inadvertently steps into a matter-transportation pod, believing it to be a portable toilet. His brain patterns and those of a football hooligan are transposed and he turns into an ape-like Arsenal supporter to comic effect.

The song is also the B-side of the single of the same name, and is included on the 2010 album, Gimme Some Truth. Lyrics & music Lennon began to write \\"Meat City\\" soon after he moved to New York City. The song began as a boogie entitled \\"Shoeshine\\" but by late 1971 it began to take its final form, albeit with improvised lyrics. A demo was made by Lennon on 10 September 1971, called \\"Just Give Me Some Rock 'n' Roll\\", while Lennon was recording the soundtrack to an unreleased film, Clock. By late 1972, Lennon had rewritten the lyrics and finished developing the melody. Authors Ben Urish and Ken Bielen suggest that \\"Meat City\\" \\"has no deep meaning but demonstrates that Lennon could still fashion a perfectly fine rocker if he wanted.\\" The first part of the song reflects Lennon's excitement over the vitality of New York, America, and rock 'n' roll, despite being repulsed by some of the city's madness. Music critic Johnny Rogan interprets some of the lyrics as a parody on jive talk as well as on American consumerism. As an example, he gives the lines: :Freak City :Chickensuckin mothertrucking Meat City shookdown USA :Pig Meat City The second part of the song reflects Lennon's view of China, which to Lennon was \\"the next frontier\\" of rock 'n' roll, and possibly an opportunity to use rock music as a means of liberation, as Lennon discussed in a 1972 quote: :I shall go there. I will take the opportunity to try to see Mao. If he is ill or dead or refuses to see me, too bad. But if I go there I want to meet people who are doing something important. I want to take a rock band to China. That is really what I want to do. To play rock in China. They have yet to see that. Lennon used some of the backward recording techniques from his Beatles days on the song. On the album version of the song, after the first refrain of \\"Just gotta get me some rock and roll\\" there is a \\"squeaky\\" vocal which when played backwards has been deciphered as \\"Fuck a pig.\\" On the single version released in the US and UK, an alternative backwards message says to \\"check the album.\\" The song begins with Lennon yelling \\"Well!\\" in rockabilly style. However, the rockabilly style is not continued. Rather, the song is driven by a riff described by authors Ben Urish and Ken Bielen as \\"aggressive\\" and \\"funky.\\" Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter describe the song as \\"an absolute cacophony of sound,\\" suggesting that this is a welcome contrast to the \\"mellow\\" tone of most of Mind Games. Lennon developed the riff for his later instrumental \\"Beef Jerky\\" by toying with variations on the music of this song and \\"Tight A$.\\" Critical reception According to rock journalist Paul du Noyer, \\"Meat City\\" is a \\"satisfying\\" complement to the single's A-side \\"Mind Games.\\" Whereas \\"Mind Games\\" is \\"ethereal and contemplative,\\" \\"Meat City\\" is \\"earthy and physical.\\" Author John Blaney sees evidence of duality within \\"Meat City\\" itself. According to Blaney, \\"Meat City\\" shows Lennon excited and disturbed by the \\"abandonment of reason rock 'n' roll could elicit from its audience.\\" Although Lennon tested the boundaries of convention, such as with sex and drugs, he was disturbed by \\"total abandonment to hedonism.\\" Music critic Johnny Rogan calls the song \\"playfully acerbic and thankfully rocking.\\" PopMatters describes the riff as one of Lennon's nastiest. Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine considers \\"Meat City\\" to be a \\"forced, ham-fisted rocker.\\" Journalists Roy Carr and Tony Tyler do not regard the song highly, but suggest that it is \\"rescued\\" by its \\"peerless unison guitars and jived-up beat.\\" Personnel The musicians who performed on the original recording were as follows: *John Lennon ‚Äì vocals, guitar *David Spinozza ‚Äì guitar *Ken Ascher ‚Äì keyboards *Gordon Edwards ‚Äì bass guitar *Jim Keltner ‚Äì drums *Rick Marotta ‚Äì drums *Arthur Jenkins, Jr. ‚Äì percussion References External links * Category:John Lennon songs Category:Songs written by John Lennon Category:1973 songs Category:Song recordings produced by John Lennon Category:1973 singles Category:Apple Records singles ","title":"Meat City"},{"id":"33013283","text":"The Calabar River in Cross River State, Nigeria flows from the north past the city of Calabar, joining the larger Cross River about to the south. The river at Calabar forms a natural harbor deep enough for vessels with a draft of . The Calabar River was once a major source of slaves brought down from the interior to be shipped west in the Atlantic slave trade. Slaving was suppressed by 1860, but the port of Calabar remained important in the export of palm oil and other products, until it was eclipsed by Port Harcourt in the 1920s. With improved roads into the interior, Calabar has regained importance as a port and is growing rapidly. The tropical rain forest in the Calabar River basin is rapidly being destroyed, and pollution is decreasing fish and shrimp catches in the estuary. Those that are caught have unsafe levels of contaminants. Location The Calabar River drains part of the Oban Hills in the Cross River National Park. The geology of the river basin includes the Pre-Cambrian Oban Massif, Cretaceous sediments of the Calabar flank and the recent Niger Delta sedimentary basin. The basin is about wide and long, with an area of At one time it was entirely covered by tropical rainforest. The region has a rainy season from April until October, during which 80% of the annual rain falls, with peaks in June and September. Annual rainfall averages . Average temperatures range from in August to in February. Relative humidity is high, between 80% and 100%. The basin has 223 streams with a total length of . This is a small number given the size of the basin. Drainage is poor, so the basin is subject to flooding, gully erosion and landslides. A 2010 study said that flooding had increased in recent years. In 1862 the Zoological Society of London received a description of a new crocodile named Crocodilus frontatus that had been taken from the Old Calabar River, with a much broader head than in Crocodilus vulgaris. A new bat called Sphyrocephalus labrosus was also reported. The river system formed by the Cross River, Calabar, Great Kwa and other tributaries forms extensive flood plains and wetlands that empty into the Cross River estuary. The system has an estimated area of As of 2000 about 8,000 tonnes of fish and 20,000 tonnes of shrimp were being caught annually. Shrimp provide a relatively cheap form of protein to the people of Calabar. The fishermen land their catches at Alepan's beach on the Calabar River, and the catch is sold in the surrounding markets. Slave trade Map of the Cross River estuary c. 1820, Calabar River to NE. It was not known then that the Cross River was the larger, so the estuary was named after the Calabar. The modern city of Calabar was founded by Efik families who had left Creek Town, further up the Calabar river, settling on the east bank in a position where they were able to dominate traffic with European vessels that anchored in the river, and soon becoming the most powerful in the region. In 1767 there was a massacre when the crews of six British slavers intervened in a dispute between the rulers of two competing slaving centers on the river, Old Town and New Town, or Duke's Town: 400 men were killed. Akwa Akpa (Duke's Town) became a center of the trade where slaves were exchanged for European goods. Due to public petitions against slave trading, the British House of Commons held a hearing on the 1767 massacre in 1790. The British banned the slave trade in 1807 and began to actively intervene in suppressing the trade by ships of other nations. Between 1807 and 1860 the West Africa Squadron seized around 1,600 ships involved in the slave trade. HMS Comus appears to have been the first warship to have sailed up the Calabar River as far as Akwa Akpa in 1815. Her boats captured seven Portuguese and Spanish slavers carrying some 550 slaves. On 6 January 1829 the Brig Jules was captured by HM Eden on the bar of the Old Calabar River with 220 slaves on board, who had been shipped in the river. On 26 February 1829 the Hirondelle was captured by the Eden within the entrance of the river with 112 slaves on board. On 5 January 1835, boats from HMS Pelorus captured the Spanish polacca-bark Minerva, which was armed with two 18-pounder and two 8-pounder guns. The ship's boats had sailed up the Calabar river and laid in ambush. Skillful handling resulted in the capture of the slaver with no casualties to the boarding party although the vessel's guns were double-shotted and the crew and the boarding party exchanged small arms fire. The slaver had some 650 slaves aboard. Later history With the suppression of the slave trade in the 1850s, palm oil and palm kernels became the main exports of the river. The chiefs of Akwa Akpa placed themselves under British protection in 1884. From 1884 until 1906 Old Calabar was the headquarters of the Niger Coast Protectorate, after which Lagos became the main center. Now called Calabar, the city remained an important port shipping ivory, timber, beeswax, and palm produce until 1916, when the railway terminus was opened at Port Harcourt, 145 km to the west. Calabar Port in November 1981 Calabar today has regained its importance as a port with the completion of roads providing good access to southeastern Nigeria and western Cameroon. Exports include palm produce, timber, rubber, cocoa, copra, and piassava fibre. Industries include sawmills, a cement factory, boat builders and plants to process rubber, palm oil and food. Artisans make ebony artifacts for the Lagos tourist market. Since 1975 the city has been home to the University of Calabar. The development of the port, and the neighboring Calabar Free Trade Zone and Tinapa Free Zone & Resort has been held back in recent years by bureaucratic problems, and also by poor power supply, poor roads and lack of dredging of the shallow Calabar River channel. Environmental concerns Calabar river 10 December 2005 The city of Calabar is bounded by the Calabar River to the west, Great Kwa River to the east and the wetlands of the Cross river estuary to the south. It can only grow to the north, into the Calabar River catchment area, and this has been happening. The Calabar river watershed was originally covered by tropical rainforest. Much has now been replaced by agriculture, road construction, forestry, industry and housing for the growing population of Calabar. For example, the National Integrated Power Project covers a large area of land besides the Calabar-Itu highway at Ikot Nyong in Odukpani Local Government Area. A study of changes in land use in the Calabar river catchment between 1967 and 2008 showed that the area covered by high forest decreased by almost 30% during that period. In 1967, high forest covered almost 70% of the basin area. By 2008 it covered less than 40%, mostly in the north. Industrial quarrying began in the 1980s and now affects a significant area. It may be causing stream siltation and flooding as well as air and water pollution. The built-up area more than doubled from 3.5% to 7.6% of the land area in the study period. Calabar Municipality has no waste treatment facilities. Human wastes and those from cottage industries are dumped in surface sites or into open drains. The torrential rains wash most of the wastes into the Calabar and Great Kwa Rivers. Urban pollution and oil exploration activity in the near shore area both threaten the ecology of the estuary, greatly reducing the numbers and diversity of the species that provide food for shrimps and fish. A 1999 study of fish caught in the Calabar and Kwa rivers and in the estuary showed levels of copper and hydrocarbons were above the World Health Organization permissible levels in all samples. Iron content was above permissible levels in 20% of samples. The rate of accumulation of hydrocarbons was greater in the wet seasons, probably because of higher levels of contaminated material washed from vehicle maintenance shops by the torrential rains. Calabar Municipality and Calabar South had a combined population of 371,000 in 2006. The population of Cross River State has been growing at the rate of about 3% annually since 1991. Growth rates are considerably higher in Calabar city. The state government faces a serious challenge in accommodating this growth while maintaining income levels and avoiding ecological disaster.

Actor Ganesh cancelled his participation in the conference citing professional reasons, though it is believed that the cancellation was because he was not impressed with the facilities provided by the Karnataka government. The Government of Karnataka sent a 48-member delegation to participate in the conference. Critics of this move opined that the government should not have spent public money in sending a delegation arbitrarily selected by the government without a proper selection process.

It has its source at the homestead \\"Heimliswald\\" in the district R√∂tenberg of Aichhalden at an elevation of 699 m above sea level and flows first in southeast direction.

At km 4,7, the Seltenbach also comes from the right, before it runs along the northeastern edge of the Schramberg town of Heiligenbronn. The Mollenmoosgraben flows towards it at km 6,13. At km 8,1 it reaches the center of Seedorf in the community Dunningen at the turning point of a loop to the east, after which it continues south. At km 11,47 the Eberbach, also called Aitenbach, flows from the right. Shortly afterwards it underruns the B 462 and reaches Dunningen itself, almost entirely on the left side of the river. After it has meandered around several hills, it flows on its 20th kilometre along Lackendorf. In the now formed valley it then passes the villages Stetten ob Rottweil and Fl√∂zlingen of the community Zimmern ob Rottweil.GPS-Track (W√ºrttembergische) Eschach In their last valley village Horgen at km 26,57 from the right the Fischbach finally flows. = Eschbach and Fischbach = The most productive source is that of the Eschbach and the Glasbach, which merge with other waters to form the Fischbach.GPS-TRack Eschbach-Fischbach The Eschbach is reached at km 1.85 by the 3.5 km long BirkenmoosgrabenGPS-Track Birkenmoosgraben, in the village Eschbronn-Mariazell. At km 4,7 it connects with the Reutenbach coming from the right to the Hinterbach, this at km 5,46 with the Mittelbach to the Eschbach. At km 7,46 it meets in the village Fischbach the Glasbach coming from the right. Herewith the river section begins as Fischbach. At km 11,76 after the source of the Eschbach this Fischbach flows together with the Badische Eschach. Since this is the weaker and with 13,9 km km also opposite the main stream, which has measured 16,8 km km until here, the name Fischbach is maintained until the confluence with the W√ºrttembergische Eschach in Horgen. In the valley slope north of the Fischbach are the ruins of a Roman estate and a Roman bath. After the confluence of Eschach and Fischbach, according to the older interpretation of W√ºrttemberg and Badischer Eschach, the river flows through a partly narrow valley with Muschelkalk rock faces on the impact slopes, a popular hiking area. At Rottweil-B√ºhlingen the Eschach merges with the Neckar. The confluence transforms the Neckar from a stream into a small river. At this point the course of the Eschach is almost twice as long as that of the Neckar, and its catchment area, as well as its water flow, is about three times as large. Nevertheless, the Neckar, which maintains its flow direction, is considered the main river.

All of the gang members are sons of gangsters, which makes it even harder for them to get paroled. They tell their superintendent this, and that they have no sponsor. To remedy this, Miss Crookshank asks the leader of the boys fathers' gang, Valentine (Barton MacLane), to come to her office. Valentine is barely released from prison. He is reluctant to help the boys, arguing that he is a reformed man and is now living on a farm with his wife Molly (Gladys George) and their daughter Pat (Evelyn Ankers). He has also decided to take a new name, \\"Ryan.\\" Miss Crookshank explains the boys‚Äô predicament, however, and Valentine agrees to take them in under his wings. One of the younger members of the gang, Pesky, is also taken in by the ex-gangster. The would-be mobsters in reformatory are quite disappointed when they are sent away to the horse- breeding farm in the country instead of out into the city streets. When the boys are transported out to the farm, a gangster named Spike the Butcher (Edward Pawley), who had killed Valentine's men ten years earlier, follows Valentine to his farm in hopes of finishing the job and kill Valentine too. Spike brings his two henchmen, Creeper (John Harmon) and Dingbat (Shemp Howard), to ambush Valentine/Ryan in his new home. District attorney Paul Revere Smith (Charles Lang), who is Pat's boyfriend, arrives at the farm at the same time. Later that day the delinquent boys try to steal Valentine's station wagon, but the car has a flat tire and an old hunting dog gets in the way of the car, spoiling the boys‚Äô plan to escape. Inspired by Paul's father, Colonel Smith (Walter Kingsford), Valentine raises $50,000 in an effort to build a trade school and give the boys something to do with themselves. Pretending to visit a dentist, Tom goes into the nearby town, where he hopes to plan the gang's escape. It doesn‚Äôt take long for him to run into Creeper and Dingbat, who take the young man to see Spike. Tom reveals to the gangster about the money raised for the trade school, and Spike suspects it is in fact a \\"charity racket.\\" When talking to the hardened gangster, Tom suddenly realizes that he is talking to his father's killer. Shaken, Tom goes back to his gang, and they plan to protect the charity money from Spike. Pesky finds them scheming and suspects that the gang will attempt to steal Pat's car. Pesky holds the teenagers at gunpoint until they explain what they are really doing. The boys are unable to stop Spike and his gang when they run Colonel Smith‚Äôs car off the road and steal the money. Both cars are wrecked and the gangsters take off on foot. The teenage gang follow them in close pursuit. In the meantime, the Colonel takes Pat's car into town to tell the police. The gangsters manage to get away, and Paul tells Valentine that he now is officially listed as a suspect in the robbery. The police arrive and return the teenagers to Valentine's home. There they are sent upstairs to their rooms, but as soon as they are out of sight from Valentine and the rest of the house members, they find Spike and his gang in Tom's room. Spike has prepared a trap for Valentine, which the family walks right into. The boys are locked in the cellar, along with Molly, Pat, and the house servants. Valentine manages to talk his old antagonist into hiding out at the farm until the heat blows over. Miss Crookshank arrives, and Spike gets the idea to use her for his plan to escape the farm. The kids manage to break out of the cellar and get into a fight with Spike and his gang. The gangsters are defeated by the boys and the money is recovered. The boys are congratulated by the Colonel for their bravery. The boys are very happy, until they realize that they have saved their own trade school.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/78133/Hit-the- Road/ Cast =The Dead End Kids= * Billy Halop as Tom * Huntz Hall as Pig Grogan * Gabriel Dell as String * Bernard Punsley as Ape =Additional cast= * Gladys George as Molly Ryan * Barton MacLane as James J. \\"Valentine\\" Ryan * Bobs Watson as \\"Slugger\\" Mickey Nolan, a. k. a \\"Pesky\\" * Evelyn Ankers as Patience \\"Pat\\" Ryan * Charles Lang as Paul Revere Smith * Shemp Howard as Dingbat * Walter Kingsford as Colonel Smith * Eily Malyon as Cathy Crookshank * Edward Pawley as Spike the Butcher * John Harmon as Creeper * Charles R.

The song is included on the 1986 compilation Menlove Ave., the 1990 boxset Lennon, the 1998 boxset John Lennon Anthology, the 2005 two-disc compilation Working Class Hero: The Definitive Lennon, and the 2010 boxset Gimme Some Truth. Lyrics and music Lennon wrote \\"Nobody Loves You (When You're Down and Out)\\" early in his time in Los Angeles during his separation from wife Yoko Ono, often called his \\"lost weekend.\\" The song reflects his feelings of depression and loneliness during that time. Lennon recorded an acoustic demo as early as October 1973. Besides his separation from Ono, the lyrics are also influenced by Lennon's disappointment at the negative reception his recent work had received from critics and the public, and his feelings of having been cheated by the music industry. The lyrics describe the emptiness he felt as well as his disillusionment with show business. Various lines could be taken as cynical responses to Ono, or to Lennon's audience and music critics. In response to the question of whether he loves someone, the singer responds \\"it's all showbiz.\\" The lyrics also seem to express resentment Lennon felt about being the one who had to awaken people to what was happening, and was still not appreciated, with lyrics about how he's \\"been across to the other side\\" and \\"shown you everything.\\" Lines about crossing the water to see \\"one eyed witchdoctors\\" may refer to Lennon's disillusionment with the Maharishi. The song ends cynically, with the line \\"Everybody loves you when you're six-foot in the ground.\\" Another line which adds to the cynicism is \\"I'll scratch your back and you knife mine.\\" Authors Ken Bielen and Ben Urish describe Lennon's voice for the song as \\"hoarse,\\" claiming that the production helps give \\"an alienated ambiance to his lethargic (but not dull) vocal performance.\\" They also claim that the horn section adds to the \\"thick musical overcast,\\" as does Jesse Ed Davis' guitar solo, which they compare to a \\"howling wolf.\\" The song changes tempo when the lyrics move from apathy to emotional outbursts. The title comes from the 1923 blues song \\"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out,\\" which had been covered by Eric Clapton with Derek and the Dominos in 1970. Lennon said that \\"Nobody Loves You (When You're Down and Out)\\" was an ideal song for Frank Sinatra to sing. This likely refers to the song's lethargic tone. Rock journalist Paul Du Noyer claims \\"Nobody Loves You (When You're Down and Out)\\" has a \\"low key, late night feel\\" reminiscent of such Sinatra songs as \\"One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)\\" and \\"In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning.\\" The judge hearing the lawsuit that Morris Levy initiated against Lennon over the similarities between the Beatles' \\"Come Together\\" (written by Lennon) and Chuck Berry's \\"You Can't Catch Me\\" quoted lyrics from \\"Nobody Loves You (When You're Down and Out),\\" claiming that the words \\"everybody's hustling for a buck and a dime\\" were an ideal introduction to the case. Reception Author John Blaney calls \\"Nobody Loves You (When You're Down and Out)\\" the \\"signature tune\\" of the lost weekend. Bielen and Urish claim that it \\"captures the essence of a three o'clock in the morning, bleary-eyed, self pitying, booze-drenched interior monologue,\\" and that it contains \\"a certain bravado and grandeur...that makes the weary emptiness of the verses and the impotent rage of the refrains eloquent and poignant...\\" Journalist Paul Du Noyer calls it a \\"colossal ballad\\" which \\"sounds nothing but sincere\\" despite being \\"a sprawling testament to John's cynicism and self- pity.\\" According to Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, Lennon had \\"rarely penned more honest words in his life.\\" Pop historian Robert Rodriguez praises Jesse Ed Davis' \\"incredibly fluid\\" guitar lead. Other versions The version of the song on Menlove Ave. has altered lyrics and minimal instrumentation. For example, the line on Walls and Bridges \\"I'll scratch your back, you knife mine\\" was rendered as \\"I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine.\\" Author John Blaney finds that version even more melancholy than the version on Walls and Bridges, claiming that Lennon's whistling at the beginning of the song gives the version a \\"sense of lonely isolation\\" and that Jesse Ed Davis' guitar \\"exacts palpable moans and cries of despair.\\" Rogan believes that the Menlove Ave. version \\"sounds slight\\" compared to the Walls and Bridges version, but still feels it makes an \\"interesting addendum to the Lennon catalogue.\\" John Lennon Anthology uses yet another version of the song, which incorporates additional musicians, including keyboards, percussion and an additional guitar. Personnel The musicians who performed on the original recording were as follows: *John Lennon ‚Äì vocals, acoustic guitar *Jesse Ed Davis ‚Äì electric guitar *Klaus Voormann ‚Äì bass *Nicky Hopkins ‚Äì piano *Ken Ascher ‚Äì organ *Jim Keltner ‚Äì drums *Bobby Keys, Steve Madaio, Howard Johnson, Ron Aprea, Frank Vicari ‚Äì horns References Category:Songs about loneliness Category:Songs about depression Category:John Lennon songs Category:Songs written by John Lennon Category:1974 songs Category:Song recordings produced by John Lennon ","title":"Nobody Loves You (When You're Down and Out)"},{"id":"33013518","text":"The Monastery of Santa Maria de Maceira D√£o () is a monastery in the civil parish of Fornos de Maceira D√£o, in the municipality of Mangualde in the Portuguese central subregion of D√£o-Laf√µes, classifies as National Monuments (). History Historic photo of monastery, c. 1960-1970 King Afonso Henriques and Queen Mafalda donated, in gratitude to the clergy of Rodrigo Esomenis, land to the medic Soeiro Teodoniz, representing parcels in Echega, Godesteo, Sendino, Alvito and Taoi, in Travanca de Tavares, that included houses, vegetable gardens, plantations, water and pastureland in July 1154. The medic abandoned his profession (in 1161) and founded a small monastery associated with the Church of Santa Maria, in Moimenta da Beira. Garcia Viegas and Godilha Moniz later sold their lands in Maceira to Soeiro. In 1162, D. Od√≥rio, bishop of Viseu, transferred the church in Moimenta de Azurara to the fledgling monastery, without imposing any tributes.Alexandre Alves (1992), p.22 On 1 September 1165, Afonso Pais donates to the monastery a farm, following Benedictine observances, which was complimented in 1170 by Gon√ßalo Pais and Guterres, with the latter in donating lands in Maceira D√£o, where they friars would move. The monastery was founded in 1173 in its actual location, by abbot D. Soeiro Teodoniz, following the Benedictine tradition, and on 31 October, Afonso Henriques established and fixed the limits of the new institution, falling into regal protection.Alexandre Alves (1992), p.23 A decade later, in 1188, the monastery joined the Cistercian Order, and began depending on the regional authority of Alcoba√ßa, until their extinction. Regal patronage continued in the 13th century, as both Afonso II and Afonso III supported the church with small endowments. In the meantime, between 1192 and 1208, the bishop, D. Martinho, bought several lands in the region of Trancoso. Inoc√™ncio XIII assumed the protection of the monastery, and conferred on it all the possessions that have been returned, after the monastery was converted to a Benedictine temple. Around this time (1230) the building was already well endowed financially, its sacristy included three silver chalices, and the monastery boasted 11 servants. Many of the monastery's possessions continued to flow from the patronage of the nobility: in 1294, the Chapel to Santa Catarina and guard houses were supported by D. Teresa Afonso Gata; and King Denis left 200 pounds in his will. Meanwhile, annual lands rents included 300 pounds (1320), and the monastery owned 1600 properties, that included farms, vineyards, cellars, mills, fruit orchards and olive fields (485 of these were located in Mangualde, but the remaining included land in Algodres, Aveiro, Besteiros, Folgosinho, Gouveia, Manteigas, Matan√ßa, Melo, M√µes, Penalva, S√°t√£o, Seia, Senhorim, Tavares, Trancoso, Viseu and Vouzela. Further, the Cistercian clergy also had five military redoubts including in the monastery, Outeiro, Granja (Fagilde), Moimenta and Figueiredo de Seia, in addition to many houses within their territory. By 1526, the monastery included 12 monks, in addition to the abbot and various servants, and its personal possessions were worth 80$000 r√©is. Yet, during the, 21‚Äì22 December 1532, visit of French abbot Bronseval, from Clairvaux, the cleric opined on the poverty of the monastery, referring to a \\"small and badly constructed [building] without refectory and regular kitchen\\".Cocheril (1978), p.122 These comments were received by the bishopric in Alcoba√ßa, who sent Father Ant√≥nio de Almoster the following year to Maceira D√£o, in order to evaluate the state of the congregation. There is no indication if the building received any improvements. By 1553, the rents received at the monastery were superior to 300$000 r√©is, and in 1560, the incorporation of female monastery of S√£o Jo√£o de Vale de Medeiros, resulted in an increase in the total income at the monastery. The number of friars reached a maximum of ten in 1564, reaching the limit for the community, at the time. In 1567 the abbots begin to be elected by triennium. In 1613, a project to reconstruct the cloister and many of the convent's dependencies began. These projects would persist off-and-on until 1668-1669, with the termination of the reconstruction of the main portico. Around 1632, the number of friars surpasses 15 clerics. In February 1666, the monastery contracts Sebasti√£o da Mota to execute a silver thurible, similar to those used in the Chapel of Senhor, in the Cathedral of Viseu. Some of the monastery's properties in Fornos de Algodres were sold, on 28 December 1720, to Manuel de Gouveia in order to pay the costs of public works. On 2 March 1744, the abbot contracts Jos√© Ribeiro Alves and Jo√£o Martins (Santiago de Encourado, Barcelos), Jo√£o da Costa Coelho (Eixo, Barcelos) and Jo√£o Fernandes Ribeiro (S√£o Jo√£o de Tarouca) to rebuild the church, dedicated to Nossa Senhora da Assun√ß√£o (Our Lady of the Assumption), for 6.100$000 r√©is, and included all the material costs. A similar project was undertaken in the second half of the 18th century, this time to the Chapel of Senhora da Cabe√ßa (Lady of the Head), at a time when the monastery had 17 cells for its clergy. The original project on the main church was completed by the stonemasons Jos√© Duarte (S√£o Miguel de Fontoura, Valen√ßa) and Ant√≥nio Barbosa da Cunha (Ferreira de Coura, Viana) in 1779. Once this project was completed, the monastery contracted (on 28 Setembro 1779) Jos√© da Fonseca Ribeiro to make the chancel. Pascoal Jos√© Parente moved to the monastery in 1786 in order to complete several paintings, including specifically the \\"Sagrada Fam√≠lia\\" (Sacred Family). By the time of the French invasion of Portugal in 1810, the Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Cabe√ßa was not yet completed. In 1834, under the anti-clerical reforms of the Liberal government, the convent was closed. A formal inventory of the possessions and properties owned by the monastery began on 14 June 1834, with the buildings and site sold to a businessman in Visue: Ant√≥nio da Silva. On 13 November 1835, in an ordinance, signed by Minister Silva Carvalho, the bell and clock were given to the Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia of Mangualde. Two years later, in 1837, the redoubt was incorporated into the municipality of Mangualde. The documents from the extinct convent, deposited in the seminary in Viseu were destroyed after a fire. On 31 July 1845, the Irmandade das Almas (Brotherhood of Souls) in Mangualde, purchase two lateral altarpieces and a painting of the \\"Fuga para o Egipto\\" (Flight into Egypt) for 48$000 r√©is. =Republic= After the mismanagement of various property-owners and the Rosada family from Tibaldinho, which almost left it in ruins, the monastery was bought by Ant√≥nio Jorge Ferreira, on 22 Abril 1965, for 728.720$00 r√©is. During a municipal council session, on 15 May 1978, a proposal to classify various properties in Mangualde, including the monastery, was debated. A petition was sent to the Director General of Cultural Patrimony () on 16 May, requesting that the monastery be classified as a property of public interest (). Throughout the 20th century several minor projects were completed to stabilize the previous damage: a new door was completed for the church; a cement staircase was added to the principal facade; a partial repair, in cement, of the right, lateral facade was completed; and the opening of new access-ways were undertaken. Yet, it would not be until the 10 August 1998, before the Ministry of Culture () re-classified the building as a National Monument (). In July 2006, a risk assessment of the structure was completed by the Direc√ß√£o Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (DGEMN). Architecture The monastery is located five kilometres from the centre of the municipal seat of Mangualde, accessed from the Estrada Nacional E.N.16 at the 105.6 kilometres marker, in the village of Vila Garcia, then by the municipal road 1441, along a dirt road towards the Moinhos do D√£o. Santa Maria is located in an isolated, rural landscape, situated on a fertile valley of the D√£o River. It is set between the Serra de Santo Ant√≥nio dos Caba√ßos and the Serra de Fagilde, relatively close to the settlement of Vila Garcia. The old monastery has been transformed into the largest wine-producing vineyard in the region, and utilizes many of the principal buildings, constructed in various epochs. The outside facade is distinguished by a supposedly medieval tower, but some authors opine that it is late-medieval, corroborated by the portico, beveled edges, and a frame formed by staves forming the arch. The monastery is accessible by a staircase on its left lateral fa√ßade. A wall intersects the valley, orientated east to west, crossed by the Ribeira dos Frades (with the same orientation), consisting of three hills: to the east, a steep incline, is the highest point; on the northern slope, a softer topography, with terraces; and in the south, an area of cultivation. Along the floodplain of the valley, is the main convent, with the Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Cabe√ßa along the eastern slope, with scattered agricultural and residential buildings, as well as the propertyowner's residence, that includes irrigation tanks around the religious building. The main fence is crossed by two dirt roads, north to south, in some areas sloping, as well as a partially paved road, that crosses the Ribeira dos Frades. In the steepest point on the property, occupying a third of the property, is a pine forest, leading to terraced vineyards (occupying the middle third of the land), punctuated by olive trees. Access to the monastery is made the western access, dotted by wayside shrines and terminated by a stone cross. =Monastery= Located at the end of the dirt road, the monastery is an irregular rectangular plan, composed of various articulated bodies, that includes the convent dependencies, a church to the left entrance and a tower, with tile-covered roofs. Church The main church has a longitudinal plan, composed of an elliptical nave, rectangular presbytery, with chamfered interior angles, forming polygons, divided in two parts: a rectangular tower and, opposite it, an addorsed sacristy. The facades in limestone, are partially constructed with granite masonry and decorated with cornices and awnings. The west wall has a convex profile, with straight gable, dominated by a main portal with a decorated facade cut with ornated curves and cornices that frames a Portuguese escudo (shield), surmounted by a closed crown. Over the portico is a large rectangular window, with salient frame, topped by arch in brick. The windows are flanked and topped by semi-circular niches, each with an arch over Tuscan pilasters with triangular gables. To the left of the entrance is a rectangular bell-tower, topped by conical spire, with facets marked by pillar wedges and topped by three-stage pinnacles defined by friezes and cornices. The four-bell belfrey is composed of Roman arches presented in salient limestone.

Son of a bookseller, Langewiesche founded his publishing company on 5 May 1902 with the goal to produce \\"distinguished mass-produced articles at the lowest prices\\" in order to make them available, \\"especially to the broad masses: those who are called uneducated, who may become so through my work.\\" The concept proved successful, largely through Langewiesche's advanced marketing methods. He is regarded as the inventor of the publisher-issued shop window poster and for the blurb (German: Klappentext). His first books were dedicated to lifestyle and world views. In 1907 he created a series of art and photo books creating a new genre of such high-class books produced inexpensively. From 1909 on he used the trademark, \\"The Blue Book\\" because his books had been printed with blue dust jackets since 1902. The use of advertising texts on the dust jacket was a first in the industry. He married Stefanie Rampelmann (1878-1956), a graphic design student in Stuttgart and D√ºsseldorf, in 1909. The couple had no children. In 1913 the publishing firm relocated to the spa town K√∂nigstein im Taunus. For the firm's 25th anniversary, he founded, under the motto \\"Good for All\\" an even cheaper label, \\"The Iron Hammer\\" (renamed in 1949 as the Langewiesche Library) with red covers.

According to the 2016 census there are 21,900 residents, making it the second-largest city in the province. It is believed that Darreh Shahr was once Madaktu, an important city in the Anshan Province of Elamite Kingdom with a population of about 74,000. The Elmite Kingdom had three important cities: Susa, Hidali and Madaktu. Madaktu served as an advance post toward Mesopotamia. The city was destroyed in 693 BC by Ashurbanipal during the Assyrian conquest of Elam. Madaktu saw many ups and down during centuries. After the Assyrian conquest, the city went into ruins and lost its significance. It did not regain its prosperity in the Achaemenid Empire. The Parthians era was a period of relative revival but it was during the Sasanian Empire that the city, then a settlement of about 5000 household and renamed to Seymareh, saw its utmost restoration and success. Nowadays, the ruins of Madaktu is abound with artifacts from that era, most of which are in display in Darreh Shahr Museum. The modern-day Darreh Shahr was part of Lorestan Province. In 1964, some areas of Lorestan and Khuzestan provinces were annexed to create Ilam Governorate-General and was declared a province ten years later in 1974. For the same reason, most of the people of Darreh Shahr speak Laki and Luri as opposed to Kurdish, the main spoken language of the province. Darreh Shahr has very hot and dry summers and mild and wet winters with long- term average of precipitation, almost all of which come in form of rain during winter. History In ancient times, Elamites governed the Lorestan mountains and constructed several strong buildings. Darreh Shahr was the first Elamite city attacked and destroyed by Assyrians in addition to the massacre of people. In Seymareh Valley the remains of the Sassanid monuments are still present; hence Darreh Shahr might have been a thriving city in the Sassanid and the Parthian periods. Furthermore, some foreign experts call the unearthed city as the second and lost capital of the Seleucids while some Iranian archaeologists believe that the monuments are part of the state of Sirvan. Referencing some resources and texts, Darreh Shahr may be the same as Mihrajanqadhaq, Saabzaan, Seymareh or the city of Khosrau II in the late Sassanid period completely leveled to earth from an earthquake in the years 248 and 344 A.H. Despite the fact that there is no strong and reliable evidence to show the first time human being settled in this are, most historians believe that Madakto Ancient City as a city in Sassanid era and because of its proximity to Ctesiphon was in fact a summer capital for kings in that era. Historians also believe the city was founded by Khosrau II. The great and impregnable fortress in east of Ctesiphon mountains that Khosrau II built to protect his family when threatened is believed to be in Darreh Shahr as well.

Life  Hynek was a member of the House of Podƒõbrady. His parents were Boƒçek II of Podƒõbrady and Anna Elisabeth of Lipa (), a daughter of Henry of Lipa (). He often used his middle name Boƒçek in addition to Hynek, as this name had a rich tradition with his ancestors. Hynek was first documented in 1417 in connection with the legacy of his late father, who died that year. Hynek was the youngest among his brothers and inherited the Podƒõbrady headquarters with the associated Lordship. Jan, the eldest brother died between 1407 and 1409, during the lifetime of their father. The third-born son Boƒçek III inherited together with the fourth-born Victor the Moravian estates, while Victor additionally received the Bohemian estates N√°chod, Hummel and Litice Castle. During the Hussite Wars, Hynek initially fought with the eastern Bohemian Orebites; he was their captain. During the collision with the moderate Hussites in Prague, he was taken prisoner by them. However, a year later, he entered in their service. In 1423 he participated with his brother Victor in a campaign in Moravia. In 1425 he arrested Jan Pu≈°ka of Kun≈°t√°t, the marshal of Nymburk at Mydlovar Castle and kept him prisoner at his own Podƒõbrady Castle. The reason for the arrest was probably a long-standing land dispute between the Podƒõbrady and the Lisice branches of the Kun≈°t√°t family. After Jan Pu≈°ka died in his prison, Hynek appropriate his Mydlovar Castle and the associated Lordship of Kostomlat, and added it to his Podƒõbrady possessions. In 1426, he participated in the Battle of Aussig. When the Taborites besieged Podƒõbrady, he fled to Nymburk, where he died on 16 October 1426 of a gunshot wound. He was not married and left no descendants.  References  * Ond≈ôej Felcman, Radek Fukala et al.: Podƒõbradov√©.

Specialising in the javelin throw, Situ is a two-time gold medalist at both the Paralympics and the IPC Athletics World Championships and is the first female South African black athlete to win a Paralympic gold medal. Personal history Situ was born in Kokstad, South Africa in 1971. At the age of twelve she experienced weakness in her legs which resulted in an inability to walk. Medical tests discovered a tuberculosis infection in her spine which resulted in Situ entering a two-year semi-coma, and was left with paralysis from the fourth vertebra down, leaving her wheelchair bound. After becoming disabled she was schooled at Mthatha. Athletics career Situ first came to the international stage in 1998 when she represented South Africa at her first IPC Athletics World Championships, held in Birmingham, England. There she entered both the javelin and discus events, winning gold in the javelin with a best throw of 14.45 metres, and bronze in the discus throw. This led her to the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney where she won a gold in the F52-54 javelin and a silver in the F51-54 discus. By taking gold in Sydney she became the first South African female black athlete to win a Paralympic title. Two years later she successfully defended her javelin world title in Lille, but despite adding almost two meters to her discus distance from Birmingham, it was only good enough for a fourth-place finish. 2003 saw Situ recognized for her achievements by her country when she was awarded the Order of Ikhamanga (silver) for her contributions to sport. Two years later in Athens, Situ successfully defended her javelin title at the 2004 Summer Paralympics. Although not finishing on the podium in either the shot put or the discus, she was recognized by the International Paralympic Committee as the female athlete who best embodied the spirit of the Games when she was awarded the Whang Youn Dai Achievement Award. After Athens, Situ entered a barren period competitively, failing to reach the podium at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing. She recovered some form in 2011, when she won bronze at Christchurch World Championships, but the emergence of world class competitors, such as Tunisia's Hania Aidi and China's Yang Liwan, made title challenges a difficult task. At the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London Situ threw a distance of 16.22 metres, but she fell short of the podium in fourth place. In between the 2012 and 2016 Summer Paralympics, Situ claimed two more world bronze medals, at Lyon (2013) and Doha (2015), both in the javelin. At Rio, in the 2016 Paralympics, Situ achieved a personal best in the javelin, throwing a 17.90 metre mark in her third round to take her first Paralympic medal in twelve years, a bronze. At the Rio Games she was also recognized by her country, being given the honour of flag bearer during the opening ceremony.

The monument is situated on the east edge of an artificial lake near the center of the park. In 1902, a national contest was held to design a monument for King Alfonso XII at the initiative of the Queen Mother Maria Christina of Austria. The winner was the architect Jos√© Grases Riera, whose design consisted of a grand colonnade alongside a pond in El Retiro, with several sculptures surrounding an equestrian statue of the king, with everything constructed in bronze and marble. Grases Riera died in 1919 with work still in progress. The architect Teodoro Anasagasti took control of the project without modifying the original design. More than twenty sculptors worked on the project. The monument, financed by a popular collection, was inaugurated on June 6, 1922.

History The work, together with other four attributed to Parmigianino, was listed in the \\"wardrobe\\" of Ranuccio Farnese in 1587, as a Portrait of a Priest. A more detailed description from 1670, of the works in the Palazzo del Giardino at Parma, also identifies the subject as religious man. The painting arrived in England in the early 19th century, in the collections of Lord Radstock, and was later auctioned at Christie's as Parmigianino's self-portrait. In 1857 it became part of the collections of Lord Strafford at Wrotham Park, being acquired by the National Gallery in 1977. It was published for the first time in an art history journal in 1940, on Emporium, which assigned it to the Roman sojourn of the painter. It was later considered earlier, to c. 1524, basing on stylistic similarities with works of that period. In particular, the bas-relief is similar to that in the fresco of Sts. Lucy and Apollonia at San Giovanni Evangelista, while the portrait scheme and technique recalls the Portrait of Galeazzo Sanvitale. There are at least two old copies of the painting, one in the Uffizi depot (inventory 3971) and one at the Walker Art Center of Minneapolis, United States. Description The first art historian to clarify that the subject was not a priest was Freedberg, in 1950, identifying him as Francesco Baiardi. Today he is considered an unknown collector, who holds the Offiziolo Durazzo, a miniated breviary today housed in the Biblioteca Civica Berio at Genoa. This work had been executed some twenty years before the painting by Francesco Marmitta, a painter from Parma who has been erroneously considered Parmigianino's master. The man is the same appearing in a portrait in London, attributed by some to Dosso Dossi. The subject, who is illuminated by a frontal source,wears a wide black coat lined in fur, and a hat of the same color. His left hands holds the Offiziolo, whose decorated cover is painted in the finest details; the right hands lies on the table, and has a golden ring with a precious stone at the little finger. Near it are a bronze statuette in ancient style, perhaps a female divinity (identified by some as Ceres), three bronze medals and an ancient silver coin: these objects were added as a show of the man's cultural interests. In the left background is a marble bas-relief of Mars, Cupid and Venus, a typical theme of the Platonic Academy, while on the right is a landscape.

His area of specialisation in philosophy is chiefly critical analysis.Mark Montebello, Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f‚ÄôMalta (A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, vol. II, pp. 246-247. Life =Beginnings= Vella was born to a Maltese family at Tripoli, Libya, and lived his boyhood within an Italian community there. He started his education at a Catholic school in Tripoli, then returned to Malta with his family and attended De La Salle College at Cottonera. =Higher studies= Vella studied philosophy at the University of Malta, social economy with a major in sociology at the University of London, and international economic politics at Berlin‚Äôs University of Humboldt, in former East Germany. =Career= In Malta, after teaching Italian and sociology in public elementary schools, Vella taught political economy and social development at the University of Malta. Vella is also a living lecturer in foreign direct investment and development at the University of Urbino, Italy. He was Chief Executive Officer of the Malta Development Corporation, and is Director of the foreign direct investment consulting services at Grant Thornton in Malta. Vella is further a member of the international faculty of the Postgraduate School of Economics and International Relations. He is politically active, serving, for some time, as President of the Labour Party in Malta. In 2013, Vella was appointed Chairman of Malta Enterprise.http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130522/local/mario- vella-made-malta-enterprise-chairman.470824 In June 2016 it was announced that Vella would be taking up the role of Governor of the Central Bank of Malta. Works Vella‚Äôs philosophical publications are few but significant. The following might be considered his most representative =Magnum opus= The following is Vella's major philosophical book to date. When published, the book was quite exceptional for it uncharacteristically dealt with the analysis and criticism of another Maltese philosopher, and a living one at that. Apart from Angelo Pirotta's investigation into the philosophy of Anastasio Cuschieri in the early 20th century, it seems that Maltese philosophers are reluctant to so take on, at least so directly, other living philosophers (or even dead ones, for that matter). Vella had certainly created an encouraging precedent. * Reflections in a Canvas Bag (1989)Ibid., pp. 134-135. ‚Äì First and foremost, this book is a critique of the philosophy of Peter Serracino Inglott in general, and of his book Beginning Philosophy (1987) in particular. However, it is also a sort of invitation (or instigation) to do philosophy by starting from history (as Vella does) rather than from theory (as Serracino Inglott does). History here is understood in the sense of Marx‚Äôs historical materialism. =Articles= Of course, the following are not the only articles published by Vella. Nevertheless, these might be the most philosophically engaging. On must bear in mind that Vella is a regular contributor to The Times of MaltaSee http://www.timesofmalta.com/ and also has his own blog.http://watersbroken.wordpress.com/about-this-blog * Wara r-Repubblika (Subsequent to the Republic; together with Lillian Sciberras; 1979) * That Favourite Dream of the Colonies (1994) * Minflok Dahla (Instead of an Introduction; 1995) =Poetry and short stories= Sometimes Vella ventures to publish some of his poetry or short stories in Maltese or in English. One example would be those in Wara r-Repubblika (1979).Particularly pp. 69-138. However, this does not seem to be very common. Here is one of his poems:Wara r-Repubblika, op. cit., p. 84. ::The Time has come ::for the fire eater ::to empty himself ::on the crowd. ::The time has come ::for the high wire artist ::and the flying acrobat ::to fall and fertilize the ground, ::the burnt ground, with their blood. ::The time has come ::to burn the circus top ::and crucify the clown ::and to release Barabbas, ::the lion, from his cage. =Editorial work= Though Vella sometimes contributes something of his thought to the following editorial works, of course his personality is seen more in the style and content chosen of these publications. * Pitazzi Homor (Red Copybooks; 1989‚Äì90) * Fl-Antiporta tal-Millennju (On the Threshold of the Millennium; 1995) Appreciation In part, Vella‚Äôs philosophy is deconstructivist, tenaciously exposing the internal conflicts that tend to undercut the asserted meaning of any text. But this is not all. It is also contextualist. To Vella‚Äôs mind, in order to be acceptable, philosophy must begin from, and build on, the socio-political and historical context. Neither philosophy nor the history of philosophy can rise above power and history. Doing philosophy means taking political positions for or against historically concrete structures of power, and the forces struggling for power within society.

Juries in these cases consist of 15 people, if jurors drop out e.g. because of illness the trial can continue with a minimum of 12 jurors. In criminal trials conviction is on the basis of a majority verdict, with eight jurors required to decide that the accused is guilty; should fewer than eight jurors declare a guilty verdict then the accused is acquitted, so a hung jury is an impossibility in Scottish criminal law. In the past some people were executed on majority verdicts in Scotland, such as Susan Newell, who had one juror dissenting. The jury has a choice of three verdicts: guilty (a conviction), not guilty (acquittal) and not proven (also acquittal). In civil trials there is a jury of 12 people, and a hung jury is possible. The pool of potential jurors is chosen purely at random, and Scottish courts have set themselves against any form of jury vetting.  History  During World War II the Administration of Justice (Emergency Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1939 provided that both civil and criminal juries would have seven members, of whom two would be special members, except for trials for treason or murder, or where a case in the High Court of Justiciary required the regular jury of fifteen on the \\"gravity of matters in issue\\".  Eligibility  The rules of eligibility for jury service are broadly similar to England, but people with legal experience (such as solicitors, advocates, or court clerks) are excluded, as are those who have been involved in the justice system, including, but not limited to, police officers (both serving and retired), medical forensic practitioners and coroners, and prison officers. Those who meet all of the following criteria are eligible for jury service: * British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens on the Electoral Register; * aged 18 or over; * ordinarily resident in the UK, Channel Islands or the Isle of Man for any period of at least 5 years since the age of 13; and * not disqualified for whatever reason.  Selection of jurors (criminal cases)  In criminal cases, there need to be at least 30 potential jurors present in the court for the balloting of a jury to begin. The names of the potential jurors are written on paper slips and drawn out of a glass bowl in open court by the clerk. The jurors then take the oath collectively and swear by \\"almighty God\\" without using any religious text. Those who prefer to affirm then do so collectively.

He is President of the nonprofit Pure Earth; co-chair of The Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health; he established the Global Alliance on Health and Pollution, and founded the leading sustainable waste management company Great Forest, inc. In June 2018, Fuller was awarded the Order of Australia Medal (OAM) in recognition of his service to conservation and the environment. In October 2019, Fuller received an Advance Award for Social Impact from the Australian government for his 20 years of pioneering work with Pure Earth and his leadership in tacking the issue as \\"a toxic pollution fighting hero\\" Fuller has focused on the problem of global pollution and its impact on health for nearly 20 years, having been driven by its neglect in the global agenda. In a 2010 profile, Time magazine's Power of One column described his motivation: ‚ÄúThe low priority that the world‚Äîincluding the media‚Äîtends to place on toxic pollution in developing countries is one of the reasons Fuller founded the nonprofit Blacksmith Institute‚Äù(renamed Pure Earth in 2015). Working with Pure Earth and the Global Alliance on Health and Pollution, Fuller was part of a global team that successfully worked to broaden the scope of toxic pollution addressed in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as described in a profile in the UN Dispatch. In 2017, Fuller ushered in the publication of the landmark report from The Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health, which concluded that pollution is the largest environmental cause of death in the world, killing over 9 million people worldwide, threatening the \\"continuing survival of human societies.\\" The report generated immense global interest, reaching over 2 billion people worldwide with news coverage including the Guardian, PBS NewsHour and Fareed Zakaria, who devoted his \\"What In The World\\" segment to the report. In an open letter to mark the release of the report from The Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health,http://gahp.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/GAHP_OPEN- LETTER.pdf Fuller writes: ‚ÄúFor too long, pollution has been sidelined, overshadowed, ignored by the world, in part because it is a complicated topic with many causes, and as many outcomes. Often it kills slowly, and indirectly, hiding its tracks. With this report, we bring pollution out of the shadows.‚Äù In a 2015 interview on The Takeaway on NPR, Fuller noted the differences in approaches to climate change and pollution: \\"... over the last couple of decades, climate change has taken over as the key environmental issue. So now we find that the agenda of these countries is biodiversity and climate change, and pollution has simply dropped off the map. This is an extraordinary result and one we really need to turn around.\\" Although toxic pollution is widespread, Fuller believes it is one global problem that can be solved. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a finite number of polluted sites out there, and you can fix them for relatively little.‚Äù \\"The good news is we have known technologies and proven strategies for eliminating a lot of this pollution.\\" Early career Richard Fuller graduated with a degree in Engineering from Melbourne University and began work for IBM. He left Australia in 1988 to work directly on global environmental issues in the Amazon rainforests of Brazil with the United Nations Environmental Programme. He then brought his experience to New York, establishing Great Forest Inc in 1989 to work on sustainability and commercial waste and recycling solutions for buildings and corporations in the pioneering days of corporate social responsibility. Realizing that enhancing sustainability practices to corporations alone would not have enough impact on global environmental issues, Fuller used profits from Great Forest to launch the nonprofit Pure Earth (formerly known as Blacksmith Institute) to tackle the problem on a larger scale. A portion of Great Forest's profits continues to support Pure Earth's work. Fuller serves as president of both Pure Earth and Great Forest.  Pure Earth/Blacksmith Institute: Building A Model For Global Pollution Cleanup  In 1999, Fuller established Blacksmith Institute (renamed Pure Earth in 2015) to focus on pollution remediation. Pure Earth is dedicated to solving pollution problems in low and middle-income countries, where human health is at risk. It is the only significant nonprofit organization working in global pollution cleanup. Over the years, Pure Earth has completed over 120 cleanup pilot projects in 24 countries, and assessed over 5000 toxic sites in 50 countries. Highlights include: * In 2011, Fuller received the UN-backed Green Star Award on behalf of Blacksmith Institute/Pure Earth. The award recognized Blacksmith/Pure Earth's work in environmental emergencies, particularly for its response efforts during the 2010 Nigeria lead poisoning crisis, which killed hundreds of children. * In 2014, Bloomberg Businessweek chronicled the growth of Pure Earth and Fuller's work on toxic pollution problems around the world, including a dangerous cleanup of a secret former Soviet arms site in the Ukraine. * In 2017, Pure Earth's cleanup work in \\"the world's most toxic town\\" in Kabwe, Zambia, made the front page of The Guardian newspaper. In a followup story in 2019, NPR's Goats and Soda program reported on Fuller's determination to raise support to complete the cleanup: \\"It has to get fixed. We have to keep pushing. We'll find a way.\\" In his first decade with Pure Earth, Fuller created a number of initiatives that established a model for global pollution cleanup. Fuller recognized the need to measure and quantify pollution in order to set priorities and push governments for action. The set of tools he developed are still being used today to rapidly identify, assess and rank polluted sites in order to prioritize cleanup. They include: * The Blacksmith Index, developed with Johns Hopkins University and used around the world to rate levels of health risk from pollution; * The creation of the Toxic Sites Identification Program (TSIP) to train local investigators to use these tools to identify and assess hotspots. To date, TSIP has trained over 400 investigators worldwide, who have mapped and documented more than 3,000 toxic sites in over 50 countries and screened more than 1,800 sites, representing a potential health risk to more than 80 million poor people. * The creation of the TSIP databasehttp://www.contaminatedsites.org/TSIP/ of polluted sites, one of the largest of its kind, containing data collected through the TSIP. This database is crucial to countries trying to address pollution. It makes available country-specific pollution data for the purpose of pollution planning, to help officials identify and prioritize the cleanup of sites that pose the most risk to residents in order to save lives. * The development of the Health and Pollution Action Plans (HPAP). The TSIP database now supports the HPAP, launched to help governments of low- and middle-income countries strategize and plan solutions to pollution-related health challenges. Madagascar was the first country to complete the Health and Pollution Action Plan process.  Forming Global Alliances To Solve Pollution  In 2012, while Pure Earth continued to clean up polluted communities, Fuller founded the Global Alliance on Health and Pollution to bring countries together to build public, political, technical and financial support to address pollution globally, and assist low- and middle-income countries to fight pollution. These efforts led Fuller to help convene and co-chair the Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health, an initiative of The Lancet, the Global Alliance on Health and Pollution, and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, with additional coordination and input from United Nations Environment, United Nations Industrial Development Organization, and the World Bank. Following the release of the groundbreaking Commission report, Fuller was invited to present the report's findings at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos in February 2018. He was also invited to provide briefings of the report at the World Bank, the UN, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, the OECD, and other key international development and professional meetings. In October 2018, Fuller joined former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy; Erik Solheim, UNEP; Dr. Philip Landrigan, Boston College; and Pushpam Kumar, UNEP at the launch of the Global Observatory on Pollution and Health. The new initiative will target issues raised by the Pollution Commission, and function as an international clearinghouse for all data available on pollution and health. Pure Earth will oversee the coordination and collection of input and data worldwide, and will make the crucial trove of information available on pollution.org. Advocacy: Children and the Poisoned Poor  Fuller's focus is not just on pollution in general, but specifically on disease-causing pollution that impacts the health of people, especially those living in low and middle-income countries. ‚ÄúToxic chemicals from industry and mining affect the health of hundreds of millions of people in low- and middle-income countries,‚Äù he wrote in The Poisoned Poor in 2012. \\"We've already solved most of the pollution problems in the West. There aren't people dying in droves in the U.S. or in England - they're all dying overseas, in low- and middle-income countries,\\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.http://www.trust.org/item/20150903130138-1unij/ on the publication of his 2015 book \\"The Brown Agenda.\\" Fuller believes that pollution is one of the most serious problems facing the earth. \\"The health of roughly 100 million people is at risk from pollution in developing countries.\\" \\"A particular concern...is the accumulating and long-lasting burden (of pollution) building up in the environment and in the bodies of the people most directly affected.\\" In 2014, Bloomberg Businessweek chronicled Blacksmith/Pure Earth's growth. The article offered a behind-the-scenes look at how Fuller came upon a secret abandoned chemical weapons factory site in the Ukraine that was sitting on top of a forgotten \\"bomb\\", and worked to make the site safe before the onset of hostilities in the area. The article also explained: \\"Fuller‚Äôs mission is to help kids play safely on the beach or bathe in a river, not save spotted owls and polar bears. He also knew he wanted to serve the poor, because ‚Äúthe U.S. has the resources to clean up its own Superfund sites.‚Äù Mostly, he didn't want to be another nongovernmental organization dedicated merely to raising awareness.\\" In 2017 The UNEP acknowledged Fuller‚Äôs message publishing ‚ÄúThe Impact of Pollution on Planetary Health: Emergence of an Underappreciated Risk Factor.‚Äù A paper he co-authored, Pollution and Children's Health, points out that ‚ÄúPollution was responsible in 2016 for 940,000 deaths in children, two- thirds under age 5,‚Äù and that ‚Äú92% of pollution-related deaths in children occur in low- and middle-income countries.‚Äù His conclusion was that ‚Äúpollution prevention presents a major, largely unexploited opportunity to improve children‚Äôs health especially in low and middle-income countries.\\"  Calling Attention to the Global Pollution Crisis  \\" ‚Ä¶ toxic pollution is the largest cause of death in the world. Yet it is one of the most underreported and underfunded global problems,\\" Fuller told the World Bank. Fuller's efforts to call attention to the crisis took many forms, including: * His 2015 book \\"The Brown Agenda: My Mission To Clean Up The World's Most Life-Threatening Pollution\\", Fuller recounts his research into global issues, and his first- hand accounts of seeing pollution's impact around the world, from the woman in Senegal who lost five children under two years of age because she was recycling used lead acid batteries in her yard, to the town in the Ukraine, where the life expectancy was under 50. He also recounted one of the most dangerous cleanups he'd ever faced‚Äîan abandoned Soviet weapons factory filled with highly toxic chemicals and TNT sat in the middle of the town, turning it into a ticking time bomb. A lightning strike or an accident ‚Äúwould wipe out every living thing in a radius of many miles.‚Äù * Fuller is also responsible for the creation and launch of the annual World's Worst Polluted Places Reports. He saw the same tale in every community he visited and he decided that he needed to start ringing the alarm bells, most notably with the World's Worst Pollution Problems reports, which he launched in 2006. The popular series of annual reports tracked the world's worst polluted problems and places and resulted in news coverage year after year for over a decade, raising global awareness of the issue. * In order to encourage more research focused on low and middle-income countries, Fuller launched the Journal of Health and Pollution, which promotes and brings together academic research on the health effects of life-threatening toxic pollution. * In 2015, working with Pure Earth and the Global Alliance on Health and Pollution, Fuller was part of a global team that successfully worked to broaden the scope of toxic pollution addressed in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\"Meet a 2015-er: Richard Fuller - UN Dispatch\\". 8 April 2015. Cite web requires website= (help) Including pollution in the SDGs was a major feat that aims to ensure some of the world's resources will be directed to fight pollution and save lives. * Following his success with the SDGs, Fuller turned to focus on his work as co-chair of the Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health. After years of work gathering data and making alliances across disciplines, Fuller was instrumental in bringing together over 50 researchers worldwide in an effort to quantify the health and economic costs of pollution.  The Brown Agenda  In 2015, Santa Monica Press published \\"The Brown Agenda: My Mission To Clean Up The World's Most Life-Threatening Pollution\\", written by Fuller and Damon DiMarco. The book documents his adventures at some of the world's most toxic locations, and introduces readers to the plight of the poisoned poor, suggesting specific ways in which anyone can help combat brown sites all over the world.

It was constructed in 1858, and is a well-preserved example of the Italianate style villas being constructed during the antebellum period in northern North Carolina and Southern Virginia by master builder Jacob W. Holt (1811‚Äì1880). Annefield is one of only two known plantation houses in Charlotte County attributed to Holt, a Virginia-born carpenter, builder, and contractor who moved to Warrenton, North Carolina, and established one of North Carolina's largest antebellum building firms.Bishir, Catherine W. ‚ÄúJacob W. Holt: An American Builder‚Äù. Winterthur Portfolio, Vol. 16, No. 1 (Spring, 1981): pp. 1‚Äì4. Architectural historian Catherine W. Bishir notes: ‚ÄúDrawing upon popular architectural books, Holt developed a distinctive style that encompassed Greek Revival and Italianate features adapted to local preferences and the capabilities of his workshop. In addition to the more than twenty buildings documented as his work, stylistic evidence and family traditions also attribute as many as seventy more to Holt and his shop.‚ÄùNorth Carolina Architects & Builders: A Biographical Dictionary Annefield is attributed to Holt's shop because it shares many stylistic features with several documented buildings. On 17 September 2009 the property was placed on the Virginia Landmarks Register, and on 12 November 2009 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because it is a locally significant example of a relatively rare form of high-style architecture that is the work of a master builder. In addition to the main house at Annefield, stylistic evidence suggests that Holt also designed and built the Kitchen/Quarter and the Smokehouse. Other secondary buildings and sites on the property contribute to Annefield's importance as a relatively intact antebellum farm complex in Charlotte County, Virginia. The property is located east of the village of Saxe in lower Charlotte County, and comprises approximately 190 acres between Horsepen Creek (to the north) and State Route 612 (Sunny Side Road) to the south. Open fields, woods, orchards and vineyards combine to form a bucolic landscape that has changed little in the past two hundred years. Other significant landscape features include two small ponds and an oak-lined drive approaching the main house from the south.  History  In 1760, Abraham Martin (1716‚Äì1771) patented 4,060 acres of land (including 989 acres already patented in 1746) on Horsepen Creek in what was then Lunenburg County.Virginia Land Office Patents Book 34, p. 664 (reel 33‚Äì34). Library of Virginia, Richmond, VA. In 1770, Martin conveyed 899 acres of this land to William Jameson (1745‚Äì1785), a native of Glasgow, Scotland.Deed Book 2, p. 365, Charlotte County Clerk of Court. Jameson settled the property with his wife Anne Read, the daughter of Clement Read and Mary Hill of Bushy Forest, the wealthiest and most powerful family in the region.Rouse, Alice Read. The Reads and Their Relatives (Cincinnati: Johnson & Hardin Press, 1930) pp. 15‚Äì76; 554‚Äì59. Jameson's alliance with a leading family in the county was an advantageous one, for he secured a number of important commissions in spite of his foreign birth, including County Justice (1772 and 1784), Vestryman of Cornwall Parish (1778), Escheator (1778), Militia Lieutenant (1778), and Militia Captain (1779).Ailsworth, Timothy S., ed. Charlotte County, Rich Indeed (Charlotte Court House, Virginia: Charlotte County Board of Supervisors. 1979), pp. 67, 106‚Äì8, 443, 450, 452, 464‚Äì6. It was Jameson who named the plantation Annefield, presumably in honor of his wife. The name first appears in the county records when the last will & testament of William Jameson dated 28 July 1784 was proved on 2 September 1785. In anticipation of a journey overseas, Jameson wrote: ‚ÄúWhereas I am about undertaking a voyage to Great Britain from which it may be the will of the Almighty I may never return... ...To my wife Anne ‚Äì my manor plantation and mansion house of Annefield, with all and sundry the appurtenances thereof during the term of her natural life... I leave to her disposal the Manor of Annefield, at her death, to which of our sons she thinks proper, still observing that the said plantation and original tract must be considered a part of such son‚Äôs heritage or proportion of land.‚Äù Will Book 1, p. 369, Charlotte County Clerk of Court. Anne (Read) Jameson married as her second husband Col. Richard Elliott in 1787, who was dead by 2 November 1796 when his will was recorded in Charlotte County.Will Book 2, p. 95. Charlotte County Clerk of Court. On 16 March 1801, Anne Elliott, joined by her sons Clement R. Jameson and Edmund Jameson conveyed this land (apparently surveyed and found to be 908 acres and called by them the ‚ÄúHorsepen Plantation‚Äù) to Philip Goode, Sr. of Charlotte County. On 2 December 1805, Philip Goode conveyed the property to his two sons Thomas and Delanson Goode, who in turn conveyed it to their neighbor Jeremiah Williams in 1810. Williams died the next year, and the property passed to his daughter, Sarah Williams Hutcherson. After the death of Sarah's husband, Collier, she married Hillary Moseley, Sr. The early nineteenth-century house that is located on the property was likely constructed during the Moseley's ownership. Evidence gleaned through deed research indicates that the site of the original (eighteenth century) house on Annefield is not located on the current property, so the house was likely not part of the original Annefield's domestic complex. In 1855, Richard E. Moseley (a son of Sarah and Hillary) conveyed 870 acres on big and little Horsepen Creeks to Hillery Mackiness Langston Goode, the youngest son of Hillery and Sarah (Bacon) Goode of Charlotte County.Deed Book 29, p. 294, Charlotte County Clerk of Court. Goode was a prosperous planter and merchant, who was named a County Justice in 1852 (but resigned in 1853), and served as Postmaster of Wylliesburg, Virginia, in 1855. He later represented the citizens of Charlotte County in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1878 to 1881. Physical evidence suggests that Goode commissioned prominent and fashionable builder Jacob W. Holt to construct a house on his land that befit his wealth and standing in the community. It is not known how Goode may have come to know Holt, but the builder was well known throughout the greater region. Beginning in 1859, the value of buildings on Goode's 870 acre tract jumped from under $1,000 to $4,370, reflecting the construction of Goode's new ‚ÄúItalian Villa.‚ÄùCharlotte County Land Tax Records, 1850‚Äì1880, Charlotte County Clerk of Court. In 1860, the U.S. Census indicated that Goode owned 42 slaves, 500 acres of improved land, 403 acres of unimproved land, and that the farm at Annefield was valued at $18,000. His livestock were worth $1,600, and included horses, cattle, oxen, mules, sheep, and pigs. The farm produced 528 bushels of wheat, 700 bushels of corn, 300 bushels of oats, and 18,000 pounds of tobacco. At least two of Goode's sons served in the Civil War just a few years later. Hillery Langston Goode (1846‚Äì1921 or 1925) attended the Virginia Military Institute (Class of 1867) and saw action at New Market, Virginia, along with other V.M.I. cadets in May 1864. Richard Bennett Goode (1845‚Äì1913) enlisted in the First Richmond Howitzers at age 17, and saw action at Second Manassas, Orange Court House, Gettysburg, and was paroled at Appomattox. A third son, William E. Goode, may have served in the 52nd Virginia Regiment, but this is unconfirmed at this time.1860 United States Census, Slave Schedule and Agriculture Schedule. Hillery Langston Goode‚Äôs service record is located on the Virginia Military Institute Web Site (http://www1.vmi.edu/archiverosters/Details.asp?ID=2888&rform;=search ) accessed 29 May 2009. Information on Richard Bennett Goode: Encyclopedia of Virginia Biography, Vol IV (Lyon G. Tyler, ed., NY: Lewis Historical Publishing Co., 1915) p. 441. Agriculture continued to be an integral part of life at Annefield during the 1880s, although at $5,000, the farm was not as valuable as it was before the American Civil War. One hundred and fifty acres of the property were tilled, 20 acres were in meadows, and 100 acres were wooded. Generally, Goode owned less livestock than in 1860, and his grain production had declined as well. Fifteen acres of oats produced 60 bushels, 30 acres of corn produced 800 bushels, 11 acres of wheat produced 180 bushels, and 6 acres of tobacco produced 3,000 pounds (1/5 of 1860s production). His orchard occupied at least 10 acres; 100 apple trees produced 500 bushels, and 100 peach trees produced 200 bushels.1880 United States Census, Agriculture Schedule. Hillery M.L. Goode and his wife Sarah executed a Deed of Trust on 21 April 1870 with Zachariah Bugg to secure certain debts. Apparently they failed to meet the terms of this Deed of Trust, for in September 1882, 470 acres of the land was sold at public auction to John Booker of Richmond. The Trustee's Sale advertisement that appeared in the Charlotte Gazette of Thursday, August 3, 1882, read, in part: The farm was indeed sold in two tracts, for the Land Tax Book for 1884 notes that Goode was taxed on acres of land on Horsepen Creek and his residence is given as Tennessee. In the Land Tax Book for 1885 he was taxed on acres, and his residence is still given as Tennessee, with the records noting that 470 acres had been sold to John Booker of Richmond by W.E. Holmes, Special Commissioner. The property was almost immediately transferred to Robert D. Adams (born 1834), a farmer, who held Annefield until 1908, when he and his wife Laura conveyed it to Henry C. Marshall (born 1870), superintendent of the nearby State Experimental Farm, in 1910. In October 1942, Marshall and his wife Emma Gray conveyed the property to James W. Scott (1901‚Äì1963) and Julia T. Scott.Deed Book 107, p. 143, Charlotte County Clerk of Court. The Scott family held the property until 1992, when approximately half of the land was conveyed to a lumber company, while the remaining 190 acres with the house and outbuildings was sold to investors from North Carolina. These investors maintained the property and in 2005 conveyed it to the present owners, who undertook a substantial rehabilitation of the house and in 2009 listed the property in the Virginia Landmarks Register and the National Register of Historic Places.  Significance  Annefield's significance is derived from the fact that it is a relatively rare example of the well-developed Italianate architectural style in Charlotte County, Virginia. Elements of Jacob W. Holt's interpretation of the Italianate style within Annefield include a stereotypical Holt front entryway featuring double doors with arched panels, surrounded by arched sidelights, and a round-ended transom flanked by a pair of round ‚Äúpinwheel‚Äù windows. Other features include a fenestration pattern displaying pairs of arched windows matching those found in the entryway, a deep, bracketed cornice, and a mantel design that seems to be unique to Holt: a progressively-styled Italianate mantel from William H. Ranlett's The Architect (Volume I, plate 52) with the insertion of a Greek Revival-style frieze roll just above the firebox opening.Parlor mantle c. 2005 during restoration Another factor contributing to the significance of Annefield is the house's attribution to Jacob W. Holt, a prominent master builder of Piedmont Virginia and North Carolina during the middle to late nineteenth century. Holt performed the overwhelming majority of his work in Mecklenburg County, Virginia, and Warren County, North Carolina. Outside of Mecklenburg County, Holt is only credited with constructing (or influencing the construction of) nine Virginia houses. According to noted Holt scholar Catherine W. Bishir, only two Charlotte County houses (including Annefield) are attributed to the builder.Bishir, Catherine W. ‚ÄúJacob W. Holt: An American Builder‚Äù. Winterthur Portfolio, Vol. 16, No. 1 (Spring,1981): p. 3. Generally, buildings that are attributed to Holt are placed in this category because they possess stylistic similarities with other buildings that are documented to have been built by J.W. Holt. A prime example of a Holt-documented house is Dr. Robert D. Baskerville's Eureka in Mecklenburg County, Virginia. An 1857 contract between Baskerville and Holt specified the design to be a modified version of a plate in Ranlett's Architect. The building was to be completed by 15 August 1858 at a cost of $4,885.00. While the floor plan of the villa described by Ranlett was used, the fa√ßade elevation was modified to suit the needs of the client. Mantels, windows, and other architectural details for Eureka did not follow Ranlett's specifications, but rather conformed in character to what Holt had included in previous buildings. According to Catherine Bishir, Eureka was ‚Äúperhaps Holt's grandest private project, bearing the stamp of his standardized detail but in its dramatic towered form and atypical plan reflecting the productive cooperation of builder and adventuresome client.‚ÄùBishir, Catherine W. Southern Built: American Architecture, Regional Practice (Charlottesville, Virginia: University of Virginia Press. 2006), p. 46. Franklin County, North Carolina's Vine Hill is also documented to have been built by Jacob W. Holt by a 5 September 1856 contract. The front entryway and Palladian windows of Eureka and Vine Hill, both documented Holt houses, are identical to that found at Annefield.  Plantation Complex  The Main House, c. 1858. Sited on the highest point of the property, the house was built in three stages. The oldest part of the house dates from 1858Land Tax Records, Charlotte County Clerk of Court. and consists of a large main block (measuring approximately 50 feet by 20 feet) with a center hall flanking a parlor and a bedroom; a hallway and two bedrooms are located upstairs. A two-story addition in the rear encompasses a single- story section that is original to the house. This section was subordinate to the main block, both in style and scale. Construction of interior doorways and chimneys suggests that this section was built at the same time as the main block. If not, it was certainly in place by 1882, when a foreclosure sale notice described the dwelling as containing six rooms (two rooms on each floor in the main block, with two additional rooms in the one-story rear section). This rear section was enlarged to two stories in the early 21st century. Two interior brick chimneys rise up from the dwelling's hipped roof, which is covered with tin shingles. The roof is accented by a deep, bracketed cornice that is typical of Italianate style buildings of the period. The entire house is covered by smooth weatherboard siding, and the corners of the main block of the building are highlighted by fluted Doric pilasters. A foundation of brick laid in the Flemish bond pattern supports the oldest sections of the house (this is relatively new brickwork. Evidence in the cellar indicates that the bond may have originally been five to six course common bond). A parged concrete masonry unit foundation supports a late nineteenth or early twentieth century addition to the rear. Typical Holt entryA full-length, one-story portico graces the front fa√ßade. The portico was completed in 2009, and its design is inspired by the one found on the front fa√ßade of Cherry Hill (Warren County, North Carolina), which was built by John A. Waddell, a Jacob W. Holt- school builder.Bishir, Catherine W. Southern Built: American Architecture, Regional Practice. Charlottesville, Virginia: University of Virginia Press. 2006. p. 28. The portico features a bracketed cornice, a balustrade which creates a balcony accessible from double doors in the central bay of the second floor, and is supported by six sets of square, fluted columns.Bishir, Catherine W. Southern Built: American Architecture, Regional Practice. Charlottesville, Virginia: University of Virginia Press. 2006. p. 28. The house's main entryway is located in the central bay of the front fa√ßade, and consists of a pair of paneled doors surrounded by unique sidelights and a transom punctuated by circular ‚Äúpinwheel‚Äù windows in each corner. This entryway is identical to that of Vine Hill (Franklin County, North Carolina), which was built by Jacob W. Holt in 1856. The main block of the villa is set apart by the use of double-arched windows set within a square casing, a motif consistent throughout the main block of house, taking the form of a simple Roman arch in the front door and the interior doors of the principal rooms. The form of the front windows is identical to that of Engleside (Warrenton, North Carolina) and Pool Rock (Vance County, North Carolina), both of which are attributed to Jacob W. Holt. Holt likely received his inspiration from Ranlett's ‚ÄúItalian Villa Design #31.‚ÄùBishir, Catherine W. Southern Built: American Architecture, Regional Practice. Charlottesville, Virginia: University of Virginia Press. 2006, pp. 27, 34, 45 A central hall with staircase on the first floor is flanked by two rooms on each side. Each room opens into the stair hall, and the rooms on each side of the hall connect via a doorway as well. To the rear of the house, a one-story porch that was added in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century has been enclosed, and now contains a kitchen, bathroom and pantry. The house as originally built had four main rooms on the first floor, and two rooms on the second floor. The house as currently configured has five main rooms on the first floor and three on the second floor. The principal rooms are heated by interior chimneys located between the front and rear rooms. Interior details continue the motifs of the exterior. The doors and windows on the first floor have massive casings with large bases. The mantels of the two front rooms combine Greek Revival proportions and a fluted frieze roll with Italianate brackets. These two mantels are identical to an example from Engleside (the John White House) in Warrenton, North Carolina. Mantels in the rear rooms and on the second floor are much simpler that those found in the two (front) primary chambers. Quarter/Kitchen House, c. 1858. The quarter/kitchen house lies to the rear (west) of the house and measures approximately 34 by 16 feet. The hipped roof is covered by pre-formed, ribbed tin panels which are not original to the building, and the exterior of the quarter is clad in wooden weatherboard siding. A simple box cornice highlights the transition between the roof and the vertical walls. The front fa√ßade of the building is divided into four bays. The central two bays are occupied by window openings (the sash themselves are missing), and the outer two bays are occupied by doorways. This fenestration pattern is repeated on the west (rear) fa√ßade, and a window opening is located on each end of the building as well. The structure of the building consists of mortise-and-tenon timber frame construction, with studs spaced roughly every twenty four inches. Floor joists are made of logs that have been worked flat on the top face. The wall finish on the interior consists of butt-joined horizontal boards that have been limewashed. Evidence in the wall and roof structure suggests that the interior space was once divided into two rooms, with a central chimney serving both spaces. In addition to the kitchen, this building probably contained living space for the cook and her family. The 1860 Census Slave Schedule indicates that Goode owned 10 slave houses or quarters, and this may have been one of them. The location of the others is unknown. Smokehouse c. 2005 prior to restorationSmokehouse, c. 1858. Measuring approximately 14 by 14 feet, the smokehouse is clad in weatherboard and covered by a pyramidical roof of standing seam, galvanized metal (a later replacement). The board-and-batten entry door is located on the east fa√ßade. The interior exhibits the building's timber frame construction, and a wooden floor is broken in the center by a sunken firepit. Office, Early 20th Century. To the west of the smokehouse lies a small, 12 foot by 10 foot building that may have served as an office for a farm manager or similar individual. The building may date to the period of the main house, but construction features such as wire nails, diagonal sheathing and a roof that is not consistent with the other Holt-designed buildings (i.e., gabled instead of hipped), suggests that the building was constructed in the beginning of the twentieth century. Like the other outbuildings in the cluster, the building's roof consists of pre-formed, galvanized metal. The exterior is clad in unpainted weatherboards. A board and batten door provides access on the north fa√ßade, and the remnants of a four-over-four sash window provided light on the south fa√ßade. A small, square, brick chimney is located in the interior of the southwestern corner of the building's sole room, and contains a stovepipe hole. Tobacco Barns, 19th Century. Located approximately 700 feet north of the main house is a pair of tobacco barns. These buildings each measure approximately 16 by 16 feet, are constructed of squared, lap-notched, rough- hewn logs, and are covered with galvanized metal roofs. The barns rest on dry- laid stone foundations, and remnants of vertical board-and-batten siding remain on both. The interiors of both barns exhibit evidence of the smoke- curing process, including numerous rounded poles running from end to end to facilitate hanging tobacco. Dairy Barn, 1954. West of the main house's complex of domestic outbuildings lies a large dairy barn that is constructed of concrete masonry units. The main block of the barn is one and a half stories in height, and is covered by a gambrel roof of pre-formed galvanized metal sheets. The upper story contains a storage loft, and is clad in weatherboards. Attached to the southern fa√ßade of the building is a one-story wing (also of concrete masonry units) that is fenestrated by six pane steel windows. Two large concrete silos rise from the western fa√ßade of the barn. House, c. 1830. Approximately 1,100 feet southwest of Annefield is a two cell, -story frame house that probably dates from the second quarter of the 19th century. The oldest section of the house measures approximately 21 feet by 18 feet, is covered by a galvanized metal gable roof, is clad with vertical boards (covered by asphalt siding), and rests on a dry-laid stone foundation. A massive stone chimney rises from the east gable end of the house. The front fa√ßade of the building presents three bays, with an entry door in the center. This door opens into the primary chamber of the first floor, which measures approximately 17 feet by 18 feet, and was heated by a fireplace that is surrounded by a simple, Greek Revival-inspired mantle. An enclosed, dog-leg staircase leads to the garret from this room. The smaller chamber measures approximately feet by 18 feet, and contains a door that leads to a shed-roofed addition, which was likely built in the early 20th century. The garret is divided into two rooms, and is lit by two casement windows on the east end (flanking the chimney) and one (off-center) casement window on the west end. The entire interior of the building is plastered or shows evidence of plastering, and riven lath can be seen in many sections of the house. Small, open porches are located on the front (west) fa√ßade and the rear (southeast) fa√ßade. Based on the presence of plastered walls (even in the garret), it is unlikely that this dwelling was constructed for use by slaves, and may have been occupied by a member of the Moseley family or a plantation manager. Slave Cemetery, 19th century. According to local tradition, a slave cemetery is located on the grounds of Annefield, approximately 1,700 feet northeast of the main house, near Horsepen Creek (UTM 17S 0711948 4089808). This area is covered by Periwinkle (Vinca minor), which is commonly used as a groundcover planting in Virginia cemeteries. A number of relatively young eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) trees now shade the site. Evidence of at least two graves can be found via the presence of standing fieldstones and slight depressions in the earth. However, a methodical survey of the site is likely to yield evidence of additional graves. Previous owners of the property are known to have owned slaves, Hillery Goode owned more than forty slaves in 1860, and at least four of Mr. Goode's slaves were over sixty years of age at that time.

BRILL, 1993. . p 224 In the 1860s, Pinet Laprade, then the French governor of Senegal, and Captain Vincent described the Serer-Noon men as \\"fierce and cruel to foreigners\\" (the French). They only traded with other Serers through barter and resented the authority of foreigners. Of all the Senegambian ethnic groups, the Noons were among the most independent during the colonial period. The Noons also refused to pay taxes to the French administration of Senegal in the 19th century and launched many wars and massacres against the French. To force the Serer-Noon to pay tax to the French administration in Senegal, sometimes violence was used against them. In Noon country, their heads of state were the Lamanes. The Lamanes managed the Noon towns and villages, and each village was an independent republic. The Lamanes in Noon country were the oldest men chosen from particular families. Although these Lamanes should not be confused with the ancient Serer Lamanes (the old powerful kings and landed gentry), the Lamanes in Noon country were very powerful during the colonial period. Culture The Serer-Noon are mostly farmers who grow millet, peanuts, cotton etc. They tend to follow monogamy. Like many of the Serer group, the Noons rarely marry out. They usually marry among themselves or other groups of the Serer race, but rarely outside the Serer group. Noon culture forbids mix-marriages. Where a young Serer-Noon has left his or her village for more than three months, on their return, they were subjected to prove their sexual purity. The head griot would offer them a beverage that they must drink. If vomit after drinking it, they were found guilty and sentence to celibacy. This test was just one of many tests carried out by the head griot. The head male griot would test the young man whilst the head female griot would test the young woman. =Language = They speak the Noon language, which is one of the Cangin languages rather than a dialect of the Serer-Sine language.

He was a saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) measured at , and weighed , making him one of the largest crocodiles ever measured from snout-to-tail. In November 2011, Australian crocodile expert Adam Britton of National Geographic sedated and measured Lolong in his enclosure and confirmed him as the world's largest crocodile ever caught and placed in captivity.\\"Lolong\\" holds world record as largest croc in the world . Pawb.gov.ph (17 November 2011). Lolong died on 10 February 2013 from pneumonia and cardiac arrest. Capture and habitat Lolong was caught in a Bunawan creek in the province of Agusan del Sur in the Philippines on 3 September 2011. He was captured with the joint cooperation of the local government unit, residents, and crocodile hunters of Palawan. Hunted over a period of three weeks, it took around 100 people to bring him onto land. He became aggressive at several points during the capture, and twice broke restraining ropes before eventually being properly secured. He was estimated to be at least 50 years old. Lolong was suspected of eating a fisherman who went missing in the town of Bunawan, and also of consuming a 12-year-old girl whose head was discovered two years earlier. He was also the primary suspect in the disappearance of water buffaloes in the known area. In the examination of the stomach contents after his capture, no remnants of water buffaloes reported missing before Lolong's capture were found, nor human remains. The nongovernmental organization activist Animal Kingdom Foundation Inc., with the cooperation of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, had urged the local government of Bunawan to return Lolong to the creek of barangay Nueva Era, where the giant reptile was captured. But, in an ongoing debate, Bunawan mayor Edwin \\"Cox\\" Elorde and residents of the barangay opposed the crocodile's release, arguing that he would threaten individuals living in the vicinity of the creek. Name The crocodile was named after Ernesto \\"Lolong\\" Goloran Ca√±ete as one of the veteran crocodile hunters from the Palawan Crocodile and Wildlife Reservation Center, who led the hunt. After weeks of stalking, the hunt for Lolong took its toll on Ca√±ete's health. He died of a heart attack several days before the crocodile was captured. Captivity and display Bunawan made Lolong the centerpiece of an ecotourism park for species found in the marshlands near the township. Mayor Elorde said, \\"We will take care of this crocodile because this will boost our tourism and we know it can help in terms of town's income and jobs to our village communities.\\" The giant crocodile was kept in an enclosure in the Bunawan Ecopark and Wildlife Reservation Center in Barangay Consuelo located 8 km from town. The exhibit was opened to the public on 17 September 2011, after permission was received from the Palawan Wildlife and Conservation Center. The Bunawan Municipal Council subsequently passed an ordinance regulating and imposing fees on gate entrance, parking, and other fees at the ecopark where the celebrity giant crocodile resided in captivity. The ecopark charged a P20 entrance fee for adults and P15 for children, which supported the park's maintenance and procurement of Lolong's food. The Bunawan Ecopark also incurred expenses for electricity, maintenance, and other incidental expenses, such as installation of CCTV cameras. According to Bunawan Mayor Elorde, up to 26 October 2011, the celebrity crocodile had already earned nearly half million pesos in donations, entrance fees, and parking fees, with a daily income of about P10,000 that month. Guinness World Record In June 2012, six months after Australian zoologist and crocodile expert Dr. Adam Britton gathered measurements, Lolong was officially certified by the Guinness Book of World Records as the \\"world's largest crocodile in captivity\\" at . Experts from the National Geographic Channel found out that Lolong breaks the record of the previous record-holder: a male saltwater crocodile named Cassius kept in the crocodile park of MarineLand Melanesia in Queensland, Australia. The certification was read in public during Bunawan's annual local festival, Araw Ng Bunawan (Bunawan Day). Bunawan Ecopark and Research Center plans Bunawan Media Affairs Coordinator Welinda Asis-Elorde said the local government unit, through a private-public partnership project, will be embarking on a P200-million site development project for the Bunawan Ecopark and Research Center. \\"You have more than 5,000 crocodiles, some of them are giants bigger even than Lolong at Agusan Marsh here in Bunawan, therefore we need a longer plan for more visitors to come and visit this homeland of the giants. We are embarking on this P200-million project now and for future generations\\", she said. Bunawan Municipal Planning & Development Officer Robert Floyd Salise, told PNA in an interview that the project will include the construction of cottages, lodging houses or inns, swimming pools, an amphitheatre, laboratory and research center, souvenir shops, pavilion, and other amenities. Death and storage of remains Taxidermied skin of Lolong at Philippine National Museum Lolong was found dead inside his compound at around 8:00p.m. on 10 February 2013. The necropsy revealed he had died of pneumonia and cardiac arrest, which was aggravated by a fungal infection and stress.\\"Pneumonia, stress contributed to Lolong's death, initial study shows\\".

Nature 446, 375 (22 March 2007)  Turner's current research focuses on the emergence of super-organismal structure and function in mound-building termites of southern Africa (Macrotermes). His extended organism idea was inspired by his work on termite mounds that clarified how the mound functions as an external lung for respiratory gas exchange for the colony as a whole.Turner, J. S. 2001. On the mound of Macrotermes michaelseni as an organ of respiratory gas exchange. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology 74(6): 798-822.Turner, J.

His prior work on the thermal capacity of incubated birds' eggs showed that an egg with an embryo and an incubating parent function not as two separate organisms but as a coupled physiological unit.Turner, J. S. 1997. On the thermal capacity of a bird‚Äôs egg warmed by a brood patch. Physiological Zoology 70: 470-480.Turner, J. S. 1994. Transient thermal properties of contact-incubated chicken eggs.

Building upon this empirical work, Turner has argued that the principle of homeostasis is a fundamental property of living systems that accounts for, among other things, the phenomenon of biological design. With this argument, Turner counters both Intelligent DesignHarvard University Press Author Forum and strong Darwinism, showing how natural selection is complemented by other factors. Turner proposes that modern evolutionary theory over-emphasizes genetic natural selection and a tendency to separate information from catalysis at the molecular level. By connecting information and catalysis, epigenesis coupled with homeostasis exemplifies the internal, directive capacities of the organism, linking information and behavior. Turner has also suggested that termite mounds exemplify collective intelligence via a form of swarm cognition that is a model for the emergence of cognitive systems in a variety of contexts, including, but not limited to, self-contained nervous systems. The extended organism principle also justifies the Gaia HypothesisTurner, J. S. 2008. Gaia, Extended Organisms, and Emergent Homeostasis. In: Scientists debate Gaia: the next century.

In 1915, the South African Railways placed five Class MH Mallet articulated compound steam locomotives with a 2-6-6-2 wheel arrangement in coal hauling service.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1945). The Locomotive in South Africa ‚Äì A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VII ‚Äì South African Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, May 1945. pp. 350, 356. Manufacturer During 1914, the requirement for locomotives with a high tractive effort to cope with the increasing volume of coal traffic between Witbank and Germiston led to the introduction of a heavy Mallet compound superheated engine with a 2-6-6-2 wheel arrangement. D.A. Hendrie The Class MH Mallet articulated locomotive was designed in detail in the locomotive drawing office in Pretoria under the personal direction of D.A. Hendrie, Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the South African Railways (SAR) from 1910 to 1922. The draughtsman, specially detached for the work, was J.R. Boyer who was later to become the Chief Locomotive Draughtsman of the SAR. Five of these very large locomotives were ordered from North British Locomotive Company and delivered in 1915, numbered in the range from 1661 to 1665. They were erected in the Salvokop shops in Pretoria and were placed in service in September 1915.North British Locomotive Company works list, compiled by Austrian locomotive historian Bernhard Schmeiser Characteristics The main bar frames, thick, were machined from a wide solid. The hind part of this frame was rigidly secured to the boiler through the high-pressure cylinder saddle castings and terminated just in front of the firebox outer throat plate. From this point rearwards, the frame was of the plate type and arranged to carry the spring gear and other fittings for the trailing Bissel truck. The locomotives were superheated and had Walschaerts valve gear, controlled by steam reversing gear. The cylinders and steam chests were formed in three separate castings. The high-pressure cylinders were arranged with piston valves, while the low-pressure cylinders were arranged with Richardson balanced type slide valves, arranged above the cylinders. The steam chest covers of the low-pressure cylinders were designed with inclined joint faces to facilitate the handling of the valve and refacing of the ports during servicing. As built, the boiler pressure was set to blow off at , which gave the engine a tractive effort of at 50% of boiler pressure. The setting was later reduced to , which reduced the tractive effort to at 50% of boiler pressure. At the time of their introduction, the Class MH was the largest and most powerful locomotive in the world on Cape gauge. It attracted the attention of locomotive engineers throughout the world as an outstanding achievement for locomotive power on gauge. Its adhesive weight and the SAR's ultra-conservative practice of reporting a Mallet's tractive effort at only 50% of boiler pressure resulted in a much lower than actual starting tractive effort of . The Class MH was almost certainly capable of exerting more than tractive effort at starting.Soul of A Railway, System 7, Western Transvaal, based in Johannesburg, Part 21: Witbank Line by Les Pivnic, Eugene Armer, Peter Stow and Peter Micenko. Captions 3‚Äì4. (Accessed on 4 May 2017) Service They were initially placed in service on the coal line between Witbank and Germiston as intended to supplement the other Mallets already working on that line. In the 1930s they were transferred to Natal to work on the line between Vryheid and Glencoe, also hauling coal. They were outstanding in their performance and remained in Natal for the rest of their service lives until they were all retired and scrapped by 1940.

The building is situated in the parish of St Saviour in Jersey. It is also used for ceremonial functions, receptions and meetings with visiting foreign dignitaries and heads of state. It is also the official residence of the Duke of Normandy (currently Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom) as head of state when staying in Jersey. History of Government House =Previous Government Houses= The current building is at least the fifth official residence of Governors and Lieutenant Governors of Jersey. Early Governors or their Lieutenants resided at Mont Orgueil and later at Elizabeth Castle, although the latter's status as a tidal island meant that for convenience accommodation in the town of Saint Helier was sought. Colonel Magnus Kempenfelt is known to have resided in a house belonging to a man named Le Geyt in 1727. At the time of the Battle of Jersey in 1781, Major Moise Corbet resided at Le Manoir de la Motte, where he was apprehended by the French invaders. Around 1800, under General Andrew Gordon, a house adjacent to the Royal Square was acquired, described in 1809 as a \\"large, substantial and commodious stone mansion with appropriate offices, pleasure and kitchen gardens\\".A Picture of Jersey, Stead, Jersey 1809 Under General Sir George Don, the house was enlarged by the addition of offices for the conduct of public business,An Account of the Island of Jersey, Plees, Jersey 1817 but Major- General Sir Colin Halkett was petitioning the British Government in 1821 to agree the exchange of this town centre property on the grounds that the house needed expensive repairs, was prone to flooding from Le Grand Douet, the adjacent brook, and that \\"the rooms are ill calculated for public entertainment\\". =The current Government House= Government House Jersey In 1803, the Rector of St Saviour's Church, The Rev. Philip Le Breton, bought the land on which the current Government House is situated and built a family home. This was bought by the ship owner Fran√ßois Janvrin in 1814 who demolished the house and built a small two-storey villa, naming the house Belmont. He brought mahogany from South America in his ships which enabled the use of this wood throughout the interior, including the main staircase, which remains a notable feature of the house. In 1822, Major-General Sir Colin Halkett, the then Lieutenant Governor, transacted the exchange of the old Government House in Saint Helier and Le Pr√© au Roi in Saint Clement for the Belmont property and additional land. It has been the official residence of all the Lieutenant Governors of Jersey ever since. Major-General (later promoted Lt.-General) Halkett had written that the Lieutenant Governor \\"would at Belmont possess the desirable opportunity of seeing together, without apparent partiality, such of the inhabitants, and strangers, as naturally expected to be invited to Government House\\". But his ADC John Le Couteur criticised the property and wrote that \\"the masonry... is shamefully done\\". The guardhouse was built at this time at a cost of ¬£215, but the house was regarded as unprepossessing. Projects to add a third storey were entertained, but not carried out until the second half of the 19th century. Further improvements were carried out, including the addition of a porte-coch√®re. The drive was formerly part of La Ruette du Sacrement, leading to Saint Saviour's Church. This lane was purchased in 1810, and replaced as a thoroughfare by the new military road (St Saviour's Hill ‚Äì J√®rriais: L√© Mont du Gouv√®rneux, the Governor's hill) From the formal lawns next to the house, the 12 acre grounds descend from the house in a valley setting, and include an ornamental lake and fountain created in 2009 that can be seen from the road. Commemorative trees and monuments are situated around the grounds. The Lieutenant-Governor's flag is flown from a flagpole in the grounds when he is in the Island. During the German occupation of the Channel Islands during World War II, the house was used as the residence of General Rudolf Graf von Schmettow, the German Commandant of the Channel Islands.

It commemorates the victims of the Pentagon, which was struck by al-Qaeda terrorists as part of the September 11 attacks. The memorial specifically honors the five individuals for whom no identifiable remains were found. However, a portion of the remains of 25 other victims are buried at the site. The names of the 115 Pentagon employees and 10 contractors in the building, as well as the 53 passengers and six crew members aboard American Airlines Flight 77 (which crashed into the building) are inscribed on the memorial. Creation Memorial to the 253 dead of the USS Serpens, which inspired the Pentagon victims' memorial. After the 2001 terrorist attack on the Pentagon, Arlington National Cemetery Superintendent John C. Metzler, Jr. realized that there was a strong likelihood that many of the victims might not have their remains identified, while other remains might be commingled. Many of the victims would be military personnel whose families could choose to have their loved ones buried at Arlington. This would necessitate a group burial at the cemetery, and an appropriate monument to mark the grave. Metzler designed the memorial himself. He drew inspiration from the memorial to the 253 dead of the United States Coast Guard ship USS Serpens, which is located in the northern corner of Section 34 at Arlington National Cemetery. The Serpens memorial is octagonal in shape and lists the names of the dead on its side panels. The Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon Memorial is a pentagonal granite marker high. On five sides of the memorial along the top are inscribed the words \\"Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon September 11, 2001\\". Aluminum plaques, painted black, are inscribed with the names of the 184 victims of the terrorist attack. There are five plaques, one for each side of the marker. The names of those aboard Flight 77 are marked with a diamond in front of their name. The names of those for whom no remains could be identified are marked with a star in front of their name. A pentagonal base extends approximately out and down from the main body of the memorial. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs commissioned the memorial. Granite Industries of Vermont, Inc., of Washington County, Vermont, provided the marker. (The company is also the sole provider of headstones for Arlington National Cemetery.) The stone was quarried near Danby, Vermont, at a site underground and inside a mountain. Michael E. Cappetta, a stoneworker with Granite Industries, sculpted the marker. It was shipped on or about August 20, 2002, to the cemetery. Identification of the dead Identifying remains at the Pentagon was a lengthy and technically complex task. The speed at which the aircraft struck the building, as well as the intensity of the subsequent fire, left few human remains to be found. Furthermore, the fire severely damaged the DNA in some remains that they were impossible to identify. The inscribed cover of the burial vault beneath the monument, on display during the funeral service. However, DNA analysis helped to identify many of the dead. Human remains were taken to a military mortuary at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology conducted the DNA analysis. Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the amount of usable DNA. The United States Department of Defense had previously collected \\"bloodstain cards\\" from all its civilian and military employees, and the DNA on these cards was used to identify many remains. Families of those aboard Flight 77 provided DNA samples (from commonplace household items like combs or toothbrushes) for use in identifying their loved ones. Not all the victims of the terrorist attack on the Pentagon qualified for burial at Arlington National Cemetery. Families of those who did often chose to bury the remains of their loved ones at a private cemetery. Sixty-four individuals who died at the Pentagon were buried at Arlington, and 57 of them were interred in Section 64, their headstones facing the Pentagon about away to the southeast (visible through a few trees). No remains could be identified for five victims: #Dana Falkenberg, age three, who was aboard American Airlines Flight 77 with her parents and older sister. #Ronald Golinski, age 60, a civilian worker at the Pentagon and a former colonel of the United States Army. #Electronics Technician 1st Class Ronald Hemenway of the United States Navy, age 37. #James T. Lynch, age 55, a civilian video technician for the United States Navy. #Rhonda Rasmussen, age 44, a civilian worker for the United States Army. In some cases, additional remains were discovered and identified after a person had already been buried by their families. Some families chose to add these remains to an existing grave. But 25 families chose to have these fragments interred during the group burial rather than disinter their loved ones or hold a second memorial service. The additional remains were cremated, mixed together, and placed in an urn which in turn was placed inside a single wooden coffin. Five sets of remains were found but could not be identified. Military officials say that, by a process of elimination, they believed these remains to be those of the hijackers. Army Military District of Washington officials said the remains which were inextricably commingled were excluded from the burial so that there was no possibility that any terrorist remains were included. These terrorist and commingled remains were turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in February 2002. The FBI said the remains were \\"disposed of in a dignified manner'\\", although a very small amount of suspected terrorist remains were retained to aid in later criminal prosecutions. Dedication Remains of the dead await burial on September 12, 2002. The monument with its pentagon-shaped wreath resides temporarily in the background. The Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon Memorial was dedicated on September 12, 2002. A funeral service for the 30 victims was held at the Arlington Memorial Amphitheater, the first time the amphitheater had held such a service since the interment of an unknown member of the armed forces representing Vietnam War dead in 1984. About 1,000 relatives attended the funeral service. The funeral was held the day after the one-year anniversary of the September 11 attacks. Many of these families felt the emotional strain was too much for two days of remembrances, and so chose not to attend the funeral. The September 12 funeral focused on the families of five victims whose remains could not be identified, although all victims were memorialized. United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and chaplains from each branch of the United States armed forces spoke, and United States Air Force General Richard Myers, chairman of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, attended. The United States Navy Band provided music. After the funeral, the casket was carried from the amphitheater by an Armed Forces casket team composed of two representatives from each of the four branches of the United States military. The casket team carried the coffin to a horse- drawn caisson provided by and guided by the 3rd US Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard). The United States Army Band, an Army-Air Force honor guard platoon, a color guard from all four services, and a Navy-Marine honor guard platoon led the caisson to the grave site. The group burial site is located at the southern end of Section 64, near Patton Circle. The site is on a slight rise, which gives it a view of the Pentagon. Several hundred people attended the graveside service. Wilbert Funeral Services of Laurel, Maryland, provided a burial vault. The grave was dug several days in advance, a concrete foundation for the memorial laid, and a specially-constructed burial vault placed on the foundation. The vault had a concrete core surrounded by three layers of bronze. It was lined with high-impact plastic, and the exterior encased in ABS plastic to simulate marble. The seal of the U.S. Department of Defense and the name of the memorial was inscribed on the cover of the burial vault using a special process. Near the grave was the memorial itself, next to which was displayed a funeral wreath in the shape of a pentagon and made from 184 red carnations. A rifle party gave a three-volley salute, and a bugler provided by the Navy played Taps. The casket team secured and folded the American flag while the Army Band played America the Beautiful. General Myers accepted the flag on behalf of the Pentagon. Grief counselors from Operation Solace (a group founded to assist the families of victims of the 9/11 attacks) were present to assist families after the service. The memorial was installed over the group burial site about a week later. The burial vault was locked, concrete was poured over the vault to fill the grave, and the memorial emplaced once the concrete set. Ponsford, Ltd., a company which provides conservation and curatorial services, maintains the monument and keeps it clean (as it does for all the monuments at Arlington National Cemetery). Critical reception The memorial days before the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The monument has not received much attention. A critic for The Washington Times, however, approvingly called it a \\"five-sided Rock of Ages\\". Paul Goldberger, architecture critic for The New Yorker magazine, was more cautious. By inscribing the name of each victim, he said, the memorial risks becoming a private monument rather than a monument belonging to the entire nation or a symbol of something larger than an individual person. Incidents On June 20, 2014, a man committed suicide by shooting himself near the Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon Memorial. Dozens of police vehicles from the Arlington County Police Department, cemetery security, Fort Myer security, and other federal agencies converged on the scene. Cemetery officials said there were no eyewitnesses to the suicide, but were unable to ascertain if he was a veteran.

Career  Gilmartin began his career in the golf industry in 1982 as president of Tournament Golf Specialists, a wholesale golf tournament supply company. In 1986, Tournament Golf Specialists became M&M; Management and broadened its scope to include golf course retail management and consulting. M&M; Management continued operating in this capacity until 1999.

The study examined the use of paroxetine by teenagers.Martin Keller, et al, \\"Efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of adolescent major depression: a randomized, controlled trial\\", Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 40(7), July 2001, pp. 762‚Äì772. The trial was sponsored by, and ghostwritten on behalf of, SmithKline Beecham (now GlaxoSmithKline), and is widely regarded as having downplayed the trial's negative results. JAACAP editors have declined to retract the article, arguing that the negative results are available in the article, and that therefore there are no grounds for retraction. This claim is disputed on the basis that primary and secondary outcomes for efficacy were manipulated and safety results were obscured or omitted. Critics therefore argue that the Journal's editors have failed to uphold the scientific standards of clinical research by failing to retract a fraudulent article.Isabel Heck, \\"Controversial Paxil paper still under fire 13 years later\\", The Brown Daily Herald, 2 April 2014.Melanie Newman, \\"The Rules of Retraction\\", BMJ, 341(7785), 11 December 2010, pp. 1246‚Äì1248.

She was taken captive following the attack and held for several years before her release. Susanna Hutchinson was born in Alford, Lincolnshire, England and was less than a year old when her family sailed from England to New England in 1634. She was less than five when her family settled on Aquidneck Island (later Rhode Island) in the Narragansett Bay following her mother's banishment from Massachusetts during the Antinomian Controversy. Her father died when she was about eight years old, and she, her mother, and six of her siblings left Rhode Island to live in New Netherland. They settled in an area that became the far northeastern section of The Bronx in New York City, near the Westchester County line. The family found themselves caught in the middle of Kieft's War between the local Siwanoy Indians and the colony of New Netherland, and they were all massacred in August 1643, except for Susanna. She was taken captive by the Indians, and was traded back to the English three years later. When Susanna was released from her Indian captivity, she was taken to Boston where her oldest brother and an older sister lived, was re-introduced into English society, and married John Cole at the age of 18, the son of Boston innkeeper Samuel Cole. They lived in Boston for a few years, but moved by 1663 to the Narragansett country of Rhode Island (later North Kingstown) to look after the lands of her oldest brother Edward Hutchinson. Here the couple remained and raised a large family. Susanna Cole was still alive in 1707 when given administration of her husband's estate, but was deceased by December 1713 when her son William took receipts concerning his parents' estate.  Early life  Susanna Hutchinson was baptized in Alford, Lincolnshire on 15 November 1633. She was the youngest child of William and Anne Hutchinson to accompany her parents on the voyage from England to New England in 1634. She was the couple's 14th child, of whom 11 survived to make the trip to the New World; a 15th child was born in New England. The family settled in Boston and lived across the street from magistrate John Winthrop, who was a judge during the civil trial in 1637 that led to her mother's banishment from the Massachusetts colony. While Hutchinson was still very young, her mother hosted popular religious discussions at their home. Her mother's religious views were at odds with the orthodoxy of the Puritan ministers; she helped to create a major division in the Boston church and an untenable situation for the colony's leaders. The family was forced to leave Massachusetts; they settled with many of her mother's supporters on Rhode Island in the Narragansett Bay, establishing the settlement of Portsmouth which soon became a part of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. Susanna was less than five years old when the family left Boston, and she was about eight when her father died in Portsmouth. Susanna's widowed mother was frightened at the prospect of Massachusetts gaining influence or control over Rhode Island. Consequently, she moved to the part of New Netherland that later became The Bronx in New York City, along with her six youngest children, an older son, a son-in-law, and some servants. The Dutch were engaged in Kieft's War against the Siwanoy Indians during the family's tenure there. In August 1643, Siwanoy attacked the emigrant household and killed all members of the family, except for nine-year- old Susanna. According to one story, Susanna's red hair spared her from the slaughter, while another account claimed that the girl was out picking blueberries some distance from the house and hid in the crevice of Split Rock. In any event, the attackers took her captive and held her for several years. Split Rock, where one legend says that Susanna Hutchinson hid during the Indian massacre which killed her mother and siblings Massachusetts governor John Winthrop provides an account of Susanna in his journal, under the date of July 1646: > A daughter of Mrs. Hutchinson was carried away by the Indians near the > Dutch, when her mother and others were killed by them; and upon the peace > concluded between the Dutch and the same Indians, she was returned to the > Dutch governor, who restored her to her friends here. She was about eight > years old, when she was taken, and continued with them about four years, and > she had forgot her own language, and all her friends, and was loath to have > come from the Indians. Sources indicate that during her time with the Siwanoys, Susanna bore a son to Siwanoy sachem Wampage I - Ninham-Wampage, who would later become Wampage II. Winthrop says that Hutchinson was captive for about four years, although his journal makes clear that her captivity lasted less than three years. When she returned to Boston, her living siblings were her oldest brother Edward, brother Samuel, and her two oldest living sisters Faith (the wife of Thomas Savage) and Bridget (the wife of John Sanford). Faith lived in Mount Wollaston, about ten miles south of Boston; Bridget lived in Portsmouth, Rhode Island; and Samuel's residence is unknown. Only her brother Edward is known to have lived in Boston proper, and it is likely that Susanna came to live with him and his family. On 30 December 1651, she married John Cole in Boston, the son of Boston innkeeper Samuel Cole, who had established Boston's first tavern in 1634.  Adult life  Susanna and John Cole began raising a family in Boston, but they went to look after her brother's land in the Narragansett country by 1663, which was then in disputed territory but later became North Kingstown, Rhode Island. Here the Coles lived for the remainder of their lives, rearing many children. The will of John Cole's father Samuel Cole, dated 21 December 1666, left a property at Bendall's Dock in Boston to Susanna and her children to satisfy an agreement with Susanna's brother Edward Hutchinson and uncle Samuel Hutchinson. This property was leased out in 1676, and sold in 1698 for ¬£160. In April 1667, John Cole deeded their house in Boston to Susanna's brother Edward and uncle Samuel, signifying that they intended to remain in Narragansett. They lived in the vicinity of Wickford, an area claimed by both Connecticut and Rhode Island. Many of the Wickford inhabitants preferred to be under the jurisdiction of Connecticut, and John Cole became a magistrate and commissioner for the area in the late 1660s under the auspices of the Connecticut government. Rhode Island was eventually given control over the Narragansett lands following many years of dispute and tension, and John Cole was made a conservator of the peace under the Rhode Island government in 1682. John died by 1707, and Susanna and her son William were given administration of his estate during that year. Susanna died by 14 December 1713, and her son William \\"took receipts from heirs for their full proportion of estate of deceased father and mother.\\"  Family and Legacy  Susanna and John Cole had 11 children: Susanna, Samuel, Mary, John, Ann, a second John, Hannah, William, Francis, Elizabeth, and Elisha; at least 9 of them grew to maturity. Their oldest daughter Susanna married Thomas Eldred, but the fate is not known of their oldest son Samuel. Mary lived into her 60s, never marrying, and John Jr. died as a youngster. Ann married Henry Bull, the son of Jireh Bull, and grandson of Rhode Island colonial governor Henry Bull. A second John grew to maturity; Hannah married Thomas Place; and William married Ann Pinder. Francis grew to maturity; Elizabeth (1673-1744) married Robert Potter (1667-1745), grandson of original Rhode Island settler Nathaniel Potter (1616-1644); and Elisha married Elizabeth Dexter and was a Deputy or Assistant in the Rhode Island colony for many years. Among her well-known descendants are two aspirants to the United States Presidency: Stephen Arnold Douglas, who lost to Abraham Lincoln in the 1860 election, and Willard Mitt Romney, who lost to Barack Obama in 2012. Her grandson John Cole, the son of Elisha Cole, was a chief justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court. There have been numerous books and articles written about Susanna Cole's famous mother Anne Hutchinson, most of which mention Susanna. The novel Trouble's Daughter by Katherine Kirkpatrick presents a fictionalized account about Susanna's life with the Indians who captured her, but it also presents some of the limited historical information that is available about her. A bronze statue in front of the Massachusetts State House in Boston displays an assumed likeness of Cole as a youngster and her mother Anne Hutchinson; it was dedicated in 1922.  Ancestry  Some of Susanna's ancestry on her father's side was published by John D. Champlin in 1913, and he published much of her ancestry on her mother's side the following year.

Gordon obtained a commission in the Royal Engineers in 1823 and served in the United Kingdom, North America and Bermuda before the outbreak of the Crimean War. Due to casualties during the Siege of Sevastopol, he was temporarily commanding the army's Royal Engineers contingent. He was brevetted three times during the war, from Captain to Colonel, became a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) and received the nickname \\"Old Fireworks\\" for coolness under fire. Later in the siege he was wounded, being shot in both arms, and returned to the United Kingdom. After the war he served with the Royal Horse Guards, commanded the defensive works at Plymouth and briefly commanded engineers in Canada when British involvement with the American Civil War became a possibility. During this period he was an appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB), promoted to Major General and became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. In 1869 he was appointed the Inspector-General of Engineers, the head of the Corps of Royal Engineers. However, in 1870 Gordon committed suicide, attributed to insanity brought on by his wounds from the Crimean War, in Westward Ho!, Devon while visiting family. He also was in India for East India Company. Early life Gordon was born in 1814, the eldest son of Colonel Thomas Gordon of Harperfield, Lanarkshire. The estate came to him while still young on his father's death, and through his mother, Jane Vigor Nisbet of Carfin, niece of Andrew, last Earl of Hyndford, he inherited Carfin and Maudslie Castle. From a private school at Bexley he passed into the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and obtained a commission in the Royal Engineers on 1 December 1823. He passed the first twenty years of his service at various stations at home and in North America. On his promotion to Captain in July 1845 he was appointed to command the 1st company, Royal Engineers, which he took shortly afterwards to Bermuda; he remained there six years. Crimean war On the outbreak of the Crimean War he was at once sent to the East, was present at the battles of Alma and Inkerman, and was director of the right attack during the early days of the siege. A month after the siege commenced, owing to several casualties, Gordon found himself Commanding Royal Engineer of the army, and held the position until the arrival of Sir Harry Jones. The loss of officers increased the strain upon the survivors, and Gordon's energy and physical training were severely tried. During one bombardment he never slept nor sat down to a meal for the greater part of three days. Gordon became achieved fame during the war and was called \\"Gordon of Gordon's battery\\" in English newspapers. He was very popular among the naval brigade, and was always welcome in their lines. Due to his coolness under enemy fire, which he may have attracted due to his height, and his disdain to hide from it, the sailors called him \\"Old Fireworks\\" throughout the siege. During the siege of Sevastopol, while directing siege operations during a sortie on 22 March 1855, Gordon was severely wounded when a ball passed through both arms. Although he soon returned to duty and commanded the Royal Engineers in the Kerch expedition, he had eventually to be invalided before the fall of Sevastopol. He obtained a brevet majority on 12 December 1854, a brevet lieutenant- colonelcy 24 April 1855, and a brevet colonelcy 29 June 1855. He was also made a C.B. and aide-de-camp to the queen. Later life In 1856 he was appointed deputy adjutant-general at the Royal Horse Guards, a position which he held for five years. While at the Horse Guards he was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Gordon's next appointment was Commanding Royal Engineer of the Southern District, where the works for the defence of Portsmouth had recently been commenced. His command at Portsmouth was broken temporarily by a call to Canada to command the engineers on occasion of the Trent affair at the end of 1861. While at Portsmouth he was made a K.C.B.. Soon after leaving that command, on 3 August 1866, he was promoted to Major- General. On 1 June 1869 he was selected for the appointment of Inspector- General of Engineers, the head of the Corps of Royal Engineers. The previous holder of the position, Edward Frome, had been titled \\"Inspector-General of Engineers and Director of Work\\" but the positions were split. There was, however, no Director of Work during Gordon's life. He did not long enjoy the honour of high office. Disease of the brain, caused by increasing irritation of his Crimean wound, set in, and the suffering which finally destroyed his judgment was borne patiently and in silence. Accompanied by his friend Colonel Charles George Gordon, he was on a visit to his brother-in-law, Colonel Hutchinson, at Westward Ho! in February 1870, when he slashed his throat with a razor. He died of blood loss the following day, on 8 February 1870, aged 55 years. An inquest issued a verdict of suicide while of unsound mind. A full- length portrait of him hangs in the headquarters mess of the Royal Engineers at Chatham. Character According to Robert Hamilton Vetch, writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, \\"[Gordon] was a man of great height and strength, and careless of danger; his earnest religious convictions governed his whole conduct, though his warmth of feeling was hidden under a cold exterior.\\" Regarding his earlier posting in Bermuda, Vetch also adds, \\"his name was remembered in the islands long after his departure, not only for his athletic feats, but for a liberality to the poor which continued for many years after he had left the place.\\" References Category:1814 births Category:1870 deaths Category:British Army personnel of the Crimean War Category:British military personnel who committed suicide Category:Knights Commander of the Order of the Bath Category:Suicides by sharp instrument in England ","title":"John William Gordon"},{"id":"33016091","text":"Hegg is an unincorporated community located in the town of Ettrick, Trempealeau County, Wisconsin, United States.

SSG Judkins distinguished himself by removing live explosive devices from the extremities of two Republic of Vietnam soldiers. SSG Judkins was honorably discharged from the military in 1978 with 17 years of honorable service.  Early life  Roy Judkins was born July 18, 1943. Roy's father was a Sergeant in the United States Army so he moved around a lot as a child, including living overseas for several years.  Military  Roy Judkins enlisted in the army a few weeks shy of turning eighteen years of age, so he needed his father's permission. Since he was a military man himself, Roy's father knew how much it would mean to his son. It was always Roy's dream to be in the military. Roy started his long military career as a ranger. Roy put himself in danger and went under enemy fire to rescue a patrol from a mine field. He got on his hands and knees and used only a bayonet to rescue his patrol. On his first trip out, he brought back 3 casualties, 2 wounded and 1 KIA, while disarming 4 mines. One of Roy's greatest achievements in his military career, is when he and several members of his patrol operated on enemy soldiers from behind sandbags. Roy put himself into danger by removing live explosive devices from the extremities from the wounded men so that the regular surgeons could operate on them without any risk to themselves.  After the Military  After the military, Roy Judkins would be 100% disabled, and 90% would come from issues that were service related. After Roy left the military, he would go around to different military complexes and speak with other soldiers to tell his story. One speech in particular, went to the men of the Explosive Ordnance Training Department. He would spend the rest of his days with his wife, Betty, in their small home in Martinez, Georgia.  Honors  On November 8, 2005, SSG Judkins was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross on February 2, 1998, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile.

During the Battle of Globe Tavern near Petersburg, Virginia, on August 21, 1864, he was captured in a thickly wooded area by a group of five Confederate soldiers, including a color bearer, from the 24th North Carolina Infantry. When it became clear that the Confederates were lost, Reed stated that they were in danger of stumbling into Union forces and being killed. He convinced the soldiers that the safest decision was to give him back his weapon and surrender themselves to him. The Confederates agreed, and Reed led them to the Union lines as his prisoners. Two weeks later, on September 6, 1864, he was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the battle, specifically for capturing the flag which the Southern color bearer had held.

Built in 1745‚Äì54 as World's End Inn, it was later greatly expanded as the home of the prominent inventor Samson Fox. It was the first house in Yorkshire to have lighting by water gas. It is Grade II* listed on the National Heritage List for England. World's End Inn: 1752‚Äì1850 The earliest reference to the World's End Inn was in 1728, but the inn may date back earlier, when Harrogate was expanding as a spa town. The present building was originally constructed in 1752‚Äì54 as a square shaped hostelry around an inner quadrangle. There is evidence to suggest that it served as coaching inn and staging post, for passengers and mail from London to York. In 1805, it was purchased by a Mrs. Holland for use as a boarding school. In 1809 it was purchased by Yorkshire-born author Barbara Hofland, who developed it as a ladies finishing school, a forerunner to what is now Harrogate College. But she kept it only until 1811, when she moved to London. Purchased by the Reverend T.T. Wildsmith in 1822, he converted it into a school for boys. After being unoccupied for some years, it was converted to a private house by new owner, Captain Heneby. Grove House: 1850‚Äì1926 In 1882, the house was bought by engineering inventor, Samson Fox. A self-made man, he had created the Leeds Forge Company, and through his invention of the corrugated flue, had made himself a multi-millionaire. His descendants include the actor Edward Fox, and his daughter the actress Emilia Fox. Samson Fox built himself a fully equipped workshop in the basement, and added the Royal Stables, which included a Turkish bath for his breeding stock. The stables clock tower, and much of the interior panelling, stained glass and plasterwork to create new rooms in the house, were all recovered from the recently demolished Dragon Hotel, formerly over a bridge on the opposite side of Skipton Road. Fox extended the estate footprint through purchases of land when they became available, eventually creating an estate just in excess of . This included the provision of grazing land for sheep by the gatehouse, so that they could rest on their way to Knaresborough market. Experimenting after a trip to the United States, he refined the process for producing water gas in his basement laboratory, and began constructing a trial plant in the grounds of the property. This made Grove House the first house lit with water gas in the world. He later built the first of three new town-scale plants across the UK in Harrogate, creating a light so bright that it was written that: \\"Samson Fox has captured the sunlight for Harrogate.\\" This success allowed him in 1870 to add the west wing, designed to provide a suite of rooms for his friend the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII), and his party when visiting Yorkshire, including: a library; billiard room; and small gallery. His commercial efforts to extend water gas production across the UK were blocked by the commercial and political efforts of the existing coal gas companies, plus an article written by consumer safety champion and fiction writer Jerome K. Jerome. This was released to the press and printed on the day that Fox formally presented the final cheque to the Prince of Wales, completing his full under writing of the ¬£45,000 construction cost of the new home for the Royal College of Music. Denied his knighthood, Fox funnelled his efforts into his new home town. He provided Harrogate with its first Fire Service, and built Grove Road School. After clearing his name from the water gas scare, he eventually he became Mayor of Harrogate for three successive years, a feat never equalled since. From 1898 to 1902, Fox built the east wing on the site of the former winter garden. It provided a music and ballroom, and an extensive art gallery on the first floor. During renovations in 1998/9, builders found a number of dragon-patterned ornate plaster panels above the music room, probably incorporated from the former Dragon Hotel, which were part of Fox's original renovations. Carefully removed, they now reside in Lesser Hall, the Grand Staircase and first floor landing. Those in the Lesser Hall alone have been valued in excess of ¬£40,000 by the Royal Pump Room Museum. After Fox's death on a visit to Walsall in 1903, his executors maintained the house and estate, retaining staff to keep the house clean and the gardens in order. During the First World War, like many great houses, Grove House became a convalescence hospital, used for troops from the Battle of the Somme and Battle of Flanders. RAOB Grove House: 1926‚Äì2017 In 1926, the RAOB needed a new orphanage. Led by Lord Alston to raise funds to build and furnish a new orphanage, \\"Buffs\\" were urged to \\"buy a brick\\" or a yard of turf at a cost of one shilling, with each donor presented with a certificate. RAOB agreed to purchase Grove House for ¬£10,000 in 1926, which also facilitated the move of the Grand Lodge's offices from Sheffield. The orphanage opened during Easter 1927, with an opening march by donor members taking three hours to travel from Harrogate railway station, accompanied by four brass bands. During the Second World War, the orphanage continued in operation, as well as accommodating some British and United States Army units. With the introduction of the national welfare state, the orphanage closed in 1947 and the RAOB returned the final resident children to members of their original families, together with supporting cash funds. In 1966, to mark the centenary of the RAOB Grand Lodge of England, Grove House was adapted to provide permanent residential care for aged members without family or dependants. In 1980 female dependents of members were admitted as convalescent patients. In 1988 joint husband and wife convalescent patients were admitted for rest and recuperation, together with fee-paying holiday guests to help offset the costs of maintaining the premises. The RAOB sold Grove House in December 2016.

Lashup site L-14 Site L-14 of the temporary Lashup Radar Network was the ground-controlled interception radar station established at Fort George G. Meade until the radar's surveillance area was covered by a Quantico AFS radar in 1955. The Fort Meade radar station also had the first experimental AN/GSG-2 Antiaircraft Defense System in 1955. ARAACOM site W-13DC In 1957 the Fort Meade station was designated an Army Air-Defense Command Post (AADCP) for the Washington-Baltimore Defense Area. The site had the first operational Martin AN/FSG-I Antiaircraft Defense System, a fire distribution center for Nike Missiles and which was operated by the 35th Antiaircraft Artillery Brigade. Designated W-13DC, the site had an AN/FPS-67 search radar and later a solid- state Hughes AN/TSQ-51 Air Defense Command and Coordination System.

The fourteenth named storm and fourth hurricane of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, Nate originated from a frontal trough in the Bay of Campeche on September 7\\\\. Within a weak steering environment, the storm meandered southwestward while gradually gaining strength. Though classified as a tropical storm operationally, data during a post-season review indicated that Nate briefly attained Category 1 hurricane status on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale on September 8\\\\. As a result of its slow motion, the storm caused significant upwelling, leading to a marked decrease in convection, and weakening accordingly. On September 11, Nate moved ashore Mexico as a tropical storm, producing several inches of rainfall and damaging several hundred structures. Ten oil rig workers went missing; seven were rescued, but one died of an unknown cause, and three other bodies were later recovered. In Veracruz, a boy was killed after being struck by lightning. Meteorological history On September 5, a frontal trough, the same responsible for the extratropical transition of Tropical Storm Lee, passed through the western Gulf of Mexico before stalling in the central Gulf of Mexico and Bay of Campeche. At the tail-end of the trough, increased shower and thunderstorm activity associated with a developing low-pressure area prompted the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to begin monitoring the disturbance for tropical cyclone formation the next day. The low separated from the front early on September 7, but convection was too disorganized for classification at the time. By 1800 UTC, however, a curved band developed in the western semicircle of the circulation. In accordance with satellite imagery, surface observations from land and oil rigs, and data from a reconnaissance aircraft, the disturbance was upgraded to Tropical Storm Nate, positioned roughly 160 mi (260 km) north of Villahermosa, Mexico. Within a weak steering environment between a mid-level ridge over northern Mexico and a mid-level ridge over the northern Caribbean Sea, Nate drifted slowly southwestward initially. Though an abundance of dry air was expected to limit a rapid rate of intensification, warm sea surface temperatures and light to moderate wind shear allowed for gradual strengthening. Operationally, the system attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 994 mb (29.35 inHg) on September 8\\\\. However, as part of its post-season routine, the NHC received data from an offshore oil rig in the southeastern quadrant of the system that yielded maximum sustained surface winds of ; as a result, Nate was re-designated as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale while centered approximately 80 mi (130 km) north-northwest of Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico. Following peak intensity, the storm's broad wind field and slow forward motion led to significant ocean upwelling. With cooler sea surface temperatures and low ocean heat content, the coverage of deep convection decreased and Nate weakened to a tropical storm at 0600 UTC on September 9. Tropical Storm Nate approaching Mexico with a nearly convection-free circulation on September 10 While accelerating west-northwest and eventually westward in response to an eastward shift in the ridge over Mexico, Nate moved away from cooler ocean temperatures, briefly allowing it to gain strength on September 10\\\\. By the next day, however, increasingly dry, low- to mid-level air wrapped into the circulation, causing associated convection to collapse. At 1600 UTC on September 11, the system made landfall near Barra de Tecolutla, Mexico, with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). The rugged terrain of Mexico caused Nate to rapidly weaken once inland, and the cyclone degenerated into a remnant low by 0000 UTC on September 12, about 20 mi (30 km) west of Poza Rica, Mexico. The circulation dissipated six hours later, at 1200 UTC on September 12. Preparations and impact Following Nate's declaration as a tropical cyclone, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning stretching from Chilitepec to Celest√∫n, noting that tropical storm conditions were likely within 12 hours. Early on September 8, a tropical storm watch was issued from Celest√∫n to Progreso. A day later, a tropical storm watches were issued from La Cruz to Tampico and Veracruz to Punta El Lagarto. A hurricane watch was issued from Tampico to Veracruz, and three hours later, all tropical storm warnings were discontinued. On September 10, the tropical storm watch stretching from Veracruz to Punta El Lagarto was discontinued, and a tropical storm warning was issued from Tampico to Punta El Lagarto. By 1500 UTC, all tropical storm watches were discontinued, and at 2100 UTC, the tropical storm warning area was modified to Tampico to Tuxpan. At this time, the hurricane watch area was modified to Tampico to Tuxpan, and a hurricane warning was issued from Tampico to Veracruz. The following day, this hurricane warning was changed to a tropical storm warning following Nate's weakening trend. All hurricane watches were discontinued, and during the afternoon hours, all tropical storm warnings were discontinued. On September 7, the Dos Bocas and Cayo Arcas ports, Mexico's two main crude oil export ports, closed in preparation for the storm. Ten contractors for Geokinetics were forced to abandon their lifeboat after evacuating the Trinity II rig. Seven of the ten men were rescued; however, one later died, and the bodies of the three other men were recovered. The body of the tenth man, who had remained listed as \\"missing\\" for several days, was recovered by the Mexican Navy on September 14. Throughout Veracruz, 839 homes were damaged by the storm. In the southern sections of the state, Nate produced several inches of rainfall. A child was killed in P√°nuco when a lightning-struck tree fell on his home.

(cited by Volume I, p. 132) After a mid-July direct telephone line was installed between CONAC headquarters and the 26th Air Division HQ (\\"the beginning of the Air Force air raid warning system\\"); in August \\"President Truman had a direct telephone line installed between the Air Force Pentagon post and the White House.\\" =Sites in the network= The 44 Lashup radar stations in April 1950 were 23 in the Northeast/Great Lakes areas, 10 in the Pacific Northwest, 5 in/near Southern California, 3 at Albuquerque, 2 at San Francisco, and 1 in Tennessee (Alaska radars were in a separate network.) (Figure 3 in History of Strategic Air and Ballistic Missile Defense, Volume I 1945-1955) Stations were geographically grouped by Air Divisions which each had a ground-controlled intercept (GCI) center (e.g., Roslyn Air Warning Station's Manual Control Center in New York). Palermo Air Force Station Portland Air National Guard Base Fort Meade radar station Highlands Air Force Station Selfridge AFB radar station Snelling Air Force Station Fort Williams Cape Charles Air Force Station =Lashup equipment= Lashup used improved systems that included the Western Electric AN/TPS-1B Radar, which was first used in 1948 (a -1B was at Portland L-33 in March 1948 for warning the nuclear Hanford Site.) L-17 began using a 1949 Bendix AN/CPS-5 radar, to which a height finder MIT AN/CPS-4 Radar was added by March 9, 1950. Also developed was the General Electric AN/CPS-6 Radar which was at L-12 in 1949. The Bendix AN/FPS-3 Radar used in the Lashup network was ready for installation in late 1950. Replacement planning The Interim Program and its First Augmentation were planned to replace Lashup with a larger radar network \\"until the Supremacy plan network could be approved and constructed\\", and an $85,500,000 March 1949 Congressional bill funded both the Interim Program \\"for 61 basic radars and 10 control centers to be deployed in 26 months, with an additional ten radars and one control station for Alaska\\" and the augmentation's additional 15 radars (\\"essentially Phase II of Supremacy\\"). The USAF reallocated $50 million to instead implement the program as a \\"permanent Modified Plan\\" (modified from Supremacy) to \\"start construction on the high Priority Permanent System of radars in February 1950 with the first 24 radar sites to be constructed by the end of 1950\\"‚Äîoperating in 1951 were P-1 in WA (opened June 1, 1950) and TM-187 in TX. Early June 1950 exercises \\"in the 58th Air Division [tbd Lashup sites] indicated insufficient low-altitude coverage,\\" and Maj Gen Morris R. Nelson identified on June 12 that ADC could employ \\"an American version of CDS\\", the British command and control system. (cited by Schaffel pdf p. 311) Congress subsequently passed a \\"supplemental appropriation\\" in September 1950 of nearly $40 million for new radar stations and search/height-finder equipment.\\" By November 1950, Ground Observation Corps filter centers (7 in the west, 19 in the east) were being installed, and by November 10 a separate Air Defense Command headquarters at Ent AFB was approved (the Federal Civil Defense Administration was created in December 1950.) On June 13, 1951, the government released $20 million for construction of permanent radar stations, and the \\"original construction program for the Permanent System\\" was completed in May 1952. Lashup phaseout Phaseout of Lashup radar stations began in January 1952 at Larson AFB (L-29) & Richland (L-30) in Washington that were replaced by Othello AFS (P-40). On December 1, 1953, a few Lashup stations became part of the subsequent \\"75-station, permanent net\\", e.g., the Montauk USAF facility was named an Air Force Station when designated LP-45\\"On 1 December 1953, the site designation was changed to LP-45 and the Air Force facilities were renamed Montauk Air Force Station. Montauk AFS was incorporated into the permanent ADC network of General Surveillance Radar Stations. (unsourced claim at Montauk Air Force Station wikipage) (the Palermo AFS L-14 reportedly became permanent site LP-54 in 1951.) One station of the Lashup Radar Network remained in 1957 at the end of which ADC operated 182 radar stations (cf. 135 SAGE CDTS sites in 1963, 66 \\"long-range radars\\" in 1981, and 41 JSS stations in 1985).Defensive Watch.

In natural science, hypothesis must be verified scientifically to be regarded as scientific theory. Validity, accuracy, and social mechanisms ensuring quality control, such as peer review and repeatability of findings, are amongst the criteria and methods used for this purpose. Natural science can be broken into 2 main branches: life science, and physical science. Each of these branches, and all of their sub-branches, are referred to as natural sciences.  What type of thing is natural science?  Natural science can be described as all of the following: * Branch of science - systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.\\"... modern science is a discovery as well as an invention. It was a discovery that nature generally acts regularly enough to be described by laws and even by mathematics; and required invention to devise the techniques, abstractions, apparatus, and organization for exhibiting the regularities and securing their law-like descriptions.\\" ‚Äîp.vii, J. L. Heilbron, (2003, editor- in-chief). The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science. New York: Oxford University Press. . * Major category of academic disciplines - an academic discipline is focused study in one academic field or profession. A discipline incorporates expertise, people, projects, communities, challenges, studies, inquiry, and research areas that are strongly associated with academic areas of study or areas of professional practice. For example, the branches of science are commonly referred to as the scientific disciplines. For instance, Gravitation is strongly associated with the discipline of physics, and is considered to be part of that disciplinary knowledge.  Branches of natural science  =Physical science= *Physical science ‚Äì branch of natural science that studies non-living systems, in contrast to the biological sciences. It in turn has many branches, each referred to as a \\"physical science\\", together called the \\"physical sciences\\".

He is ranked 9th Dan, and is a former Japan Karate Association (JKA) World Champion in kumite (sparring) and kata (patterns). He was also coach (European Championship in 1971, 1972 and 1975) of the German national team and Chief Instructor for JKA Europe. In 1997, he received the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.  Biography  Ochi began his Shotokan karate training at the age of 14 years. As a student of economics at Takushoku University, he was a member of its karate team and due to his success as a competitor he consequently applied as instructor for the JKA. He passed all the tests, and in 1964 the JKA made him instructor for the honbu dojo (headquarters training hall) in Tokyo. During the following years, he was champion of Japan several times. Because of his victories in kata and kumite from 1966 to 1969 he eventually achieved the title \\"Grand Champion\\". = Germany = 1970 he took over Hirokazu Kanazawa's position as National Karate trainer in Germany. Under his guidance, the German national team won the European Championships three times. After they had placed second in the world championship in Los Angeles 1977, the very next year he competed himself once again during his holidays in Japan, defeated 1976's World champion Osaka, and won the National championship of his home country Japan. In 1993, he founded the DJKB (Deutscher JKA-Karate Bund) as German branch of the JKA. In 2016, he was awarded 9th dan. Ochi is the successor of Keinosuke Enoeda as Chief Instructor for JKA Europe. He has been invited to participate in other karate organizations international events, such as the ISKF Master Camp, placed in Philadelphia, USA every year. In 2011 he gave his belt -which was almost white- to a boy blackbelt from Venezuela, when he asked Master Ochi for a picture for his birthday. Now, he is wearing a new black belt.

Harold Acton wrote that he was \\"our last great actor\\" in the tradition of Henry Irving and that he was known for his \\"emphatic stammer\\" and his dandyish ways. Of Spanish descent, Condamine was born in London and attended the Rugby School. He studied under actor F.H. Macklin and made his stage debut in two plays by Henrik Ibsen at the age of 21. In 1905, he played Herod in the English premiere of Oscar Wilde's Salom√©, directed by Florence Farr, impressing critics Max Beerbohm and Robbie Ross. On the basis of this success, he was cast by Farr as Foragel in William Butler Yeats' The Shadowy Waters. Yeats disliked his performance, complaining that Condamine was \\"over-emphatic and shoots his voice up and down the scale in a perfectly accidental way\\" and that \\"You cannot play Foragel without nobility or any of my verse without pride & he has neither.\\" Yeats wrote \\"I long to get him by myself and make him speak on a note day after day till he had got rid of accidental variety\\" but since Condamine and the other actors were performing without pay as a favor to Farr, Yeats could not have him removed from the play. Under the direction of Theodore Komisarjevsky, Condamine played the title characters in Anton Chekhov's Uncle Vanya and Ivanov and played Vladimir Lenin alongside John Gielgud's Leon Trotsky in Hubert Griffith's Red Sunday. Other roles include Duke Ferdinand in John Webster's The Duchess of Malfi (1919), Iachimo in Shakespeare's Cymbeline (1923) and Czar Paul I of Russia in Such Men Are Dangerous (1929) by Ashley Dukes. His best known role was in 1922 as the Count alongside Sybil Thorndike as the Count's daughter Beatrice in the first public performance of Percy Bysshe Shelley's controversial verse drama The Cenci, directed by Lewis Casson Later in life he performed in radio dramas, including the 1955-6 radio adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, in which he played Saruman and Denethor. He quipped to Donald Wolfit \\"I have been doing a recording for the Third programme but it has all come to an end now. The man who used to listen has bought a television set.\\" The Author Harold Acton, in his More Memoirs of an Aesthete, says: \\"He had published a single book, The Upper Garden. It begins: 'In those days which are consecutive, so as to give life or memory to each other, and to which men give one name of Life or another name of Death, beyond the garden bright with tulip-cups or poised with the gloom of rose-bowers, there is, in some moods, a new delight of dark trees and dark ponds, or tangled colours that were not set against each other in the war of the known gardens - a competition that often gives no greater suggestion to a garden than the war of life' and it rambles on in the same strain for 264 close-written pages.\\" References External links * Category:1877 births Category:1966 deaths Category:Male actors from London Category:English male radio actors Category:English male stage actors Category:English people of Spanish descent Category:People educated at Rugby School Category:Place of death missing ","title":"Robin de la Condamine"},{"id":"33017113","text":"The 2010-2011 Tiburones Rojos de Veracruz season is the club's 67th year of existence. squad (Captain)  Match results  = Apertura 2010 = = Clausura 2011 = See also Tiburones Rojos De Veracruz Category:C.D.

He lithographed the Hans Br√ºggemann's altarpiece between 1824-1832. Biography Conrad Christian B√∏hndel was born in the parish of Hostrup in T√∏nder, Denmark. He was the son of Christian August B√∏hndel and Frederikke Louise, n√©e Staack. He went to Copenhagen as a young man to be trained as an artist at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. He belonged to the circle of friends of Caspar David Friedrich when he first arrived in Copenhagen in 1799. After his studies at the Art Academy he visited the German painter Philipp Otto Runge in Dresden in 1802. In 1799 he won the Great Silver Medal and undertook an overseas trip with royal support, joining the Danish-German colony in Rome where he stayed from 1802 to 1810. He befriended Bertel Thorvaldsen, especially through his old classmate Johan Ludwig Lund. After his return to Copenhagen he showed a portion of his trip abroad in an art exhibition in 1811. Although his work at the academy lacked accuracy in drawing and harmony in color, his pictures were so very good that he was conferred an agr√© in 1812. A year later he painted the architect Christian Frederik Hansen and Count Heinrich Carl von Schimmelmann's portraits. He appears to have lived in the District of Schleswig, where between 1824-1832, he lithographed the panel compositions of the altarpiece (Der Bordesholmer Altar) at Schleswig Cathedral which was originally carved by Hans Br√ºggemann between 1514 to 1521. Considered a respectable piece of work at the time, his work comprised 34 plates with a translated text in German by Niels Laurits H√∏yen. Personal life He was married to a widow Anna Maria Struck (1777-1830). He died in the Duchy of Schleswig in 1847.

After attending Los Angeles City College from 1961 to 1963, he studied at the Otis Art Institute from 1963 to 1967. He received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Otis in 1964 and a Master of Fine Arts in 1967. Painting and exhibitions In 1975, Lees had a solo exhibition in Santa Barbara, California. Two years later, in 1977, Lees had a solo exhibition New York City. His second solo exhibition in New York followed in 1980. During this period, Lees also had solo exhibitions in Detroit (1979) and in San Francisco (1981). In 1981, Lees moved to New York City. He presented his third solo exhibition in New York in 1983. In its review of Lees' 1983 exhibition, The New York Times wrote: > John Lees's landscapes and heads are almost incidental to his technique. > This, in turn, is less a matter of applying oil paint than of allowing it to > accumulate until the canvas looks like a fragment of some ancient, lumpy > wall. ... The work is on the precious side and might pall if administered in > large doses, but there's scant danger of that, given the artist's glacial > rate of production. In the mid-1980s, Lees became associated with Hirschl & Adler Modern in New York. He presented his first solo exhibition at Hirschl & Adler in 1986 with additional solo exhibitions there in 1989, 1993, 1996, 1998, and 1999. During this period, Lees also had solo exhibitions in London, Chicago, Boston (1992, 1997, 2003, and 2005), and Italy. In describing Lees' 1996 show, art critic Holland Cotter described Lees' work as \\"intense\\" and \\"surprisingly graceful\\" and wrote that the artist's \\"clotted and encrusted brown pigments, look as if they were lifted straight from the earth,\\" but with each image seemingly \\"packed with references and energies beyond the naturalistic.\\" Following a 2007 exhibition, a reviewer for The New York Times wrote: > The artist John Lees is one of the most accomplished expressionist painters > of his generation. He is also one of the most under-recognized, at least > when it comes to inclusion within museum collections and the sort of group > exhibitions that help build a reputation. He has the distinction, however, > of having exhibited continuously in private galleries since 1969. In 1987, Money magazine reported that Lees' 69-inch-by-89-inch painting of an armchair, which sold in 1974 for $1,800, was valued at $30,000. In 1990, Lees moved to Leeds, New York. Lees and his wife, Ruth, who is also a painter, have maintained their studio and home there since that time. One of the unusual characteristics of Lees' paintings is his tendency to work on a single canvas for as long as 30 years. Following his 2003 show, Cate McQuaid wrote in the Boston Globe: > John Lees has paintings of his wife, Ruth, that he has been working on since > the '70s. Over 30 years, exploring the image of his wife with a paintbrush > and a palette knife, Lees delves deeper and deeper into their relationship. > ... Lees lives with his paintings.

He has had exhibitions there in 2008, 2009, and 2011. Following his 2008 exhibition, David Cohen titled his review in the New York Sun \\"Deliciously Distressed\\" and emphasized Lees' tendency to rework the same canvas for years: > What is primarily to love and at the same time distrust about Mr. Lees is > his self-professed obsessiveness. This takes the form, in the mottled > surfaces of his slowly worked landscapes, figure studies, and still life > paintings, of accretion, stress, and mutedness. ...

Originating from a tropical wave over the central Atlantic on September 6, Maria moved toward the west and slowly strengthened. While approaching the northern Leeward Islands, however, the system entered a region of higher vertical wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures, causing it to degenerate into a low-pressure area. It slowly curved toward the north and northeast around the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, and regained tropical storm status on September 10\\\\. Maria further strengthened to attain hurricane status while making its closest approach to Bermuda. The cyclone attained peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) on September 16, but weakened thereafter because of an increase in wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures. Maria made landfall on the southeastern coast of Newfoundland during the afternoon hours of September 16 before becoming absorbed by a frontal system later on that same day. Despite its poor organization, Maria brought heavy rainfall to portions of the east Caribbean, notably Puerto Rico. Numerous roadways and homes were flooded, and as the storm passed through the extreme northeastern Caribbean, over 15,000 people went without power. In addition, tropical storm-force winds were observed on many of the U.S. Virgin Islands. As the system passed west of Bermuda, brief tropical storm-force sustained winds were recorded, along with higher gusts; rainfall on the island, however, was minimal. In Newfoundland, strong winds were recorded, but rainfall totals were relatively minimal. There were no deaths reported in association with Maria, although the storm caused $1.3 million (2011 USD) in damage. Meteorological history The origins of Hurricane Maria can be traced back to a tropical wave‚Äîan elongated area of low pressure oriented north to south‚Äîthat moved westward from Nigeria to Senegal on September 1\\\\. The wave entered the eastern tropical Atlantic early the following day and slowly strengthened. By September 6, it had developed a sufficient amount of convection to be designated as Tropical Depression Fourteen, while it was about 700 mi (1100 km) west-southwest of the southern Cape Verde Islands. By this time, it had also developed well-established outflow within the western semicircle of the low-pressure center. The depression continued to increase in strength, and it was upgraded to a tropical storm six hours after formation, receiving the name Maria. Tropical Storm Maria near the Lesser Antilles on September 10 Early on September 7, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted that although Maria was in an area of favorable atmospheric conditions, most intensity guidance models did not anticipate any strengthening. The system changed little in organization over the next 24 hours as it moved rapidly toward the west-northwest around the southern periphery of the subtropical ridge. Though visible satellite imagery depicted a well-organized circulation center, it was displaced from the strongest convection due to increased vertical wind shear. The system reached an initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) on September 8 before the unfavorable environment began to impede the system's organization. Following a reconnaissance flight into the system early on September 9, it was noted that Maria had degenerated into a tropical disturbance, despite reports of tropical storm-force winds in the northern Leeward Islands. Operationally, however, the NHC kept the system classified as a tropical cyclone and never downgraded it to a disturbance. When the system approached the northern Leeward Islands on September 10, satellite imagery and surface observations revealed an increase in its organization; a subsequent reconnaissance aircraft into the disturbance revealed that the remnants of Maria had regenerated into a tropical cyclone about 40 mi (65 km) east- southeast of Antigua. After reaching the southwestern periphery of the subtropical ridge, Maria turned to the north as its forward motion slowed considerably. Strong vertical wind shear over the system began to relax by September 14, allowing Maria to slowly restrengthen as the convection redeveloped near its center. At 1800 UTC on September 15, Maria reached Category 1 hurricane status on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale while located roughly 135 mi (215 km) northwest of Bermuda. Embedded within increasing atmospheric flow, the hurricane's forward motion accelerated towards the northeast. At 0000 UTC on September 16, Maria attained its peak intensity with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 983 mbar (29.03 inHg). Continuing on a northeastward course, Maria began to move over an area with cooler sea surface temperatures and higher vertical wind shear. Around 1800 UTC, Maria weakened to a tropical storm and made landfall near Cape St. Mary's, Newfoundland at 1830 UTC with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). Shortly thereafter, the cyclone's circulation was absorbed by a frontal system over the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland, on September 18. Preparations and impact =Caribbean= Rainfall caused by Maria in Puerto Rico Before Maria's arrival, tropical storm watches were issued for most of the Lesser Antilles on September 8; the watches were upgraded to tropical storm warnings at 2230 UTC. On the following day, Puerto Rico and many of the U.S. Virgin Islands and British Virgin Islands were placed under a tropical storm watch. The watches and warnings for the islands were discontinued around 1500 UTC on September 10, after the strong thunderstorms diminished from Maria's center. The storm's effects on the island of Puerto Rico were primarily in the form of heavy rainfall. Flood waters near Patillas, Puerto Rico, destroyed several homes and bridges, causing $1.3 million (2011 USD) in damage. In the surrounding city of Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, heavy rainfall flooded and damaged around 150 homes. Many people were forced to relocate after rainfall and mud filled their homes. Near the city of Naguabo, Puerto Rico, the car of a 60-year-old woman was swept away by flood waters on a road. After becoming tangled in bushes, the woman was able to get out of her car and pulled to safety. Nearly a month after the storm, U.S. president Barack Obama announced that federal disaster aid would be available to the island due to Maria. =Bermuda= Following Maria's regeneration into a tropical cyclone, a tropical storm watch was issued for the island of Bermuda on September 13\\\\. The watch was upgraded to a warning later that day, and at 1200 UTC the following day, it was replaced by a hurricane watch. All watches and warnings for the island were discontinued by September 15. When Maria bypassed Bermuda on September 15, its outer bands briefly produced tropical storm-force winds across the island. At Commissioners Point, sustained winds reached 52 mph (83 km/h), with gusts as high as 69 mph (111 km/h), and winds of 36 mph (60 km/h) were reported at L.F. Wade International Airport at 1500 UTC on September 15. =Newfoundland= Satellite image of Hurricane Maria on September 16 as it made landfall in Newfoundland In anticipation of Maria, Environment Canada declared a tropical storm watch for the coast of Newfoundland on September 15, which stretched from Arnolds Cove to Brigus South. Three hours later, it was upgraded to a hurricane watch, while a tropical storm watch was put into effect from Arnolds Cove to Jones Harbor. At 0600 UTC the following day, the watches and warnings were replaced by a hurricane warning, and areas between Brigus South and Charlottestown, Newfoundland were placed under a tropical storm warning. All tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued at 2100 UTC on September 16\\\\. While becoming absorbed by a front on September 16, Maria made landfall on the southern tip of the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland, where winds of 64 mph (103 km/h) were recorded. Offshore, winds reached up to 77 mph (124 km/h). The capital city of St. John's experienced heavy rain, though not to the extent that had been forecast, as the storm moved through the peninsula faster than predicted.

It was found in 2009 and represents the most complete troodontid remains known from the Upper Cretaceous. Its four autapomorphies (unique traits) include a jugal with a lateral flange, a surangular crest that is anteroventrally oriented, the presence of medial expansion near the distal end of the femur, and a wide longitudinal groove present along the distal third of the dorsal surface of the third metatarsal. Description Pectoral girdle and forelimb Linhevenator is a troodontid, a group of small, bird-like, gracile maniraptorans. All troodontids have many unique features of the skull, such as closely spaced teeth in the lower jaw, and large numbers of teeth. Troodontids have sickle-claws and raptorial hands, and some of the highest non-avian encephalization quotients, meaning they were behaviourally advanced and had keen senses. Linhevenator is a rather large troodontid with an estimated body weight of . The arms are relatively short but the humerus is very robust. The describers suggest the arm might have been used for digging or climbing. The first toe was preserved in a lateral position, instead of pointing forwards. Linhevenator has a dromaeosaurid-like pedal digit II, carrying a sickle-claw larger than that of basal troodontids. Classification Linhevenator was assigned to the Troodontidae by the describers. It possesses a combination of \\"primitive\\" (basal) and derived characters, but was found to be a derived troodontid in a phylogenetic analysis, in a polytomy with Troodon and a clade formed by Zanabazar and Saurornithoides. This position was seen by the authors as an indication for an evolutionary trend in the Troodontidae of shortening the forelimbs and for a parallel evolution of large sickle-claws with both the troodontids and the dromaeosaurids.

Through the recollections of Albert Einstein, the play focuses on the life and career of German chemist Dr. Fritz Haber, who helped improve living conditions with his work on nitrogen fixation. His work was later used by the German army to produce chlorine gas used in Second Battle of Ypres in the First World War. As Dr. Haber becomes increasingly involved with the German army, the play depicts how his actions and newly forged military connections affect his relationship with his wife, Clara, and his assistant, Otto. As his passion in science intertwines with nationalistic pride, Haber manifested himself a scientist devoted to a country that never accepted his Jewish origin. Einstein's Gift was published in 2003 by Playwrights Canada Press. Topic Einstein's Gift is a memory play that loosely recounts the life of Dr. Fritz Haber from 1905 until his death in 1934. The play is presented as the memories of Albert Einstein as he looks back upon Haber's life. Through the interactions of Einstein, Haber, Haber's two wives, scientific colleagues and political and military minders, it addresses the connections between pure and applied science, faith and nationalism, and imagination and knowledge. Fritz Haber was a Nobel Laureate and German chemist. Haber converted from Judaism to Christianity to help further his scientific career as even at that time in Germany there existed discrimination against Jewish people. He was the co- inventor of the Haber-Bosch process. The process, used to make ammonia, revolutionized the production of agricultural fertilizer. This invention helped to prevent the starvation of millions of people. However, he was also involved in the use of chlorine gas by the German military. This gas was used in as a weapon in Ypres during World War I. Haber's lab also developed the cyanide-based pesticide Zyklon A, predecessor to the infamous Zyklon B. The first act works to develop the meaningful yet complicated relationship between the characters Einstein and Haber, drawing upon the dynamic differences between both their scientific and moral principles. Morals that are discussed between (Albert) Einstein and Haber during this act include nationality, religion/faith, and what it means to change these factors in one's life; for example, Haber does not fully embrace Christianity, but is baptized so that he can increase his chances of gaining professorship. Haber's decision to get a baptism is motivated by his career goals. This not only demonstrates his devotion to science, but also his ambition to acquire fame and recognition as a scientist. Very early on, it is established that Einstein and Haber are each other's foil, both with a very different outlook on life and the future of science. While Einstein does not care much for his nationality and cultural identity, Haber, who is strongly nationalistic, feels obliged to serve his country. In the opening scene, Haber praises the German education system as \\"the best in the world\\", while Einstein retorts that being a German born and raised was \\"no privilege for [him]\\", detesting the structure and interconnecting the differing stances the two brilliant scientists have on nationality and scientific belief (Thiessen 10). Their differing views arise later, as the two once again find themselves at odds with each other through their contrasting perspective on the sciences ‚Äì Haber scoffs at the impracticality of physics, while Einstein views chemistry as unimaginative. Their differing views regarding science's involvement in war create tension between the pacifist Albert Einstein and the war involved Haber. Haber argued that, if he were to assist the military in the production and utilization of lethal chlorine gas, the war would come to an end sooner due to the gas's effectiveness in trench warfare. Einstein, however, reasoned that science should, under no circumstances, be used for such purposes. In addition to the discrimination towards religion that is addressed in the play, there is the topic of prejudice towards women in the early twentieth century. Focussing on the scientific community as women began to advance into the many fields of science, it is represented in the play through the chemist and Fritz Haber's wife Clara Immerwahr, the first woman to receive a PhD from the University of Breslau. Clara was also Jewish and of German descent. Thiessen presents non- stereotypical scientists with varying points of view toward their disciplines: Haber is willing to compromise his faith, the people in his life, and morals to further his career ambitions through practical use of science; Haber's wife Clara practices science to serve the greater good through applications of her work; Einstein believes that science is composed of ideas and imagination; and Otto only wishes to make a difference. In this play, the clash of these scientists‚Äô ideologies is explored through their relationships. On one hand, Haber's views differ with his assistant, Otto, who, in act one, is portrayed as an idealistic young man who truly believes that science will yield a better future, and desires no power or recognition for his efforts; Haber, on the other hand, issues a command, by order of General Deimling of the German Army, to release chlorine gas, causing the death of several enemy soldiers, fearing he would be stripped of his precious titles and posting if he did not comply. Haber's drive to advance his career by developing chemical warfare also places a great deal of strain on his relationship with his wife, Clara Immerwahr. Clara and Haber both believe in the practical application of science. But, Clara is more interested in serving \\"greater humanity\\" while Haber is more concerned with helping his own country, furthering his career and, in Clara's eyes, gaining recognition. This causes Clara to constantly challenge Haber. Through her arguments and criticisms, Clara displays how Haber has become overly obsessed with being accepted by a country that, as she puts it, will never see him as a \\"real German.\\" In the ending scene of Act 1, Haber along with Colonel Peterson and General Deimling release chlorine gas in Ypres to \\"create havoc.\\" Haber is hoping that the release of chlorine gas will bring the war to an abrupt halt; however, Deimling disregards Haber's strategy and orders him to release it without \\"full reserves.\\" Haber listens to General Deimling due to his flaw of searching for fame and recognition. Otto, Haber's assistant, notices that Haber will do whatever it takes to further his career even if that involves murdering other men. This is supported by Deimling's comment: \\"Well done, Haber. I'm sure a promotion to captain will be in order...\\" After the chlorine gas is released, Haber sees firsthand the mass murder he has caused in order to be famous. His actions not only astonished him at the atrocity that took place but also lead to his wife committing suicide. She killed herself because she felt betrayed by her husband, and could not live with the knowledge that her husband had used the scientific processes in which they had created together for evil rather than for the original purpose of establishing a more productive society. In the second to last scene during Act 2, Einstein shares with Haber his opinion about the differences in their own respective approaches to life and science. Einstein explains how he is undeserving compared to Haber because he has \\"[kept] a safe distance from life\\" and lived inside himself, whereas Haber \\"struggled with the world\\" and is therefore more deserving of recognition, praise and respect. In his play, Einstein‚Äôs Gift, Theissen explores theme balance between career ambition and morals; faith and nationality; and practicality and imagination; by juxtaposing two brilliant scientists with opposing points of view toward their common discipline, Theissen demonstrates that both scientists‚Äô lack of balance leads to their downfall.

Born in Surabaya, Dutch East Indies (colonial Indonesia) from a Dutch father and Indo (Eurasian) mother. Ido was the Art Editor of P.A.Daum's Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad and later the Chief Editor of newspaper Batavia's Handelsblad as well as an accomplished musician (organist). As a literary author his work shows a keen eye for the discrimination and socio-economic realities of middle and lower class Indo-Europeans of the late 19th century. As an innovative and successful playwright he incorporated many indigenous i.e. Indonesian cultural elements into a western theatrical format.Nieuwenhuys, Rob Oost-Indische Spiegel (Publisher: Amsterdam, 1978) P.298-301 Early life His mothers Indo (Eurasian) family belonged to the lower social layer of European society, where constant lack of money, outright poverty and a continues struggle for existence characterized life in the late 19th century. An atmosphere and world he would display in his literary work. Due to an inheritance he and his brother had the opportunity to go to the Netherlands and study the arts (music). After his stay in the Netherlands he seemed detached from his old maternal world, as can be seen in his novel Don Juan (1897), which is partly set in the high society of Batavia. After a while though his writing re-focuses on his roots.Nieuwenhuys, Rob Oost-Indische Spiegel (Publisher: Amsterdam, 1978) P.298-301 Novelist In 1900 the Java Bode newspaper published his serialised novel \\"The pariah of Glodok\\", a tale about an impoverished Indo-European. The story ends somewhat melodramatic, but caters to the need within the Indo community to see an identification and recognition of their socio-economic problems. In his later novel \\"The paupers\\" (1915) he stuck with this theme. It tells the story of a so-called \\"kleine bung\\" (a Dutch-Malay mix term meaning little brother used to describe Indos from the lower layer of society) who is full of resentment and frustration, caused by discrimination, lack of social climbing and living in poverty. Ido vividly describes the characters resentment against the white European expatriates that treat him as a second class citizen.Nieuwenhuys, Rob Oost- Indische Spiegel (Publisher: Amsterdam, 1978) P.298-301 The latest edition was published in 1978. Play writer Another important achievement was the way Ido used indigenous culture, i.e. Javanese epics and lyrics as inspiration for the many plays he wrote. His popular plays had been performed on numerous occasions in colonial theatres.

The species is included in the genus Cuevavirus. LLOV is a distant relative of the commonly known Ebola virus and Marburg virus. Use of term The species Lloviu cuevavirus is a virological taxon (i.e. a man-made concept) included in the genus Cuevavirus, family Filoviridae, order Mononegavirales. The species has a single virus member, Lloviu virus. The name Lloviu cuevavirus is derived from Cueva del Lloviu (the name of a Spanish cave in which Lloviu cuevaviruses were first discovered) and the taxonomic suffix virus (which denotes a virus species). In 2010, the species and the genus cuevavirus were proposed as independent species and genus. In July 2013, the species and the genus cuevavirus were ratified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) to be included in its report, therefore the name is now to be italicized. Species inclusion criteria A virus that fulfills the criteria for being a member of the genus \\"Cuevavirus\\" is a member of the species \\"Lloviu cuevavirus\\" if it has the properties of \\"cuevaviruses\\" (because there is currently only \\"cuevavirus\\" species) and if its genome differs from that of Lloviu virus (variant Bat86) by <30% at the nucleotide level. Lloviu virus ( ; LLOV) is a virus distantly related to the well-known pathogens Ebola virus and Marburg virus. Lloviu virus is the sole member of the species Lloviu cuevavirus, which is included genus Cuevavirus, family Filoviridae, order Mononegavirales. The name Lloviu virus is derived from Cueva del Lloviu, the name of a Spanish cave in which it was first discovered. According to the rules for taxon naming established by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), the name Lloviu virus is always to be capitalized (because \\"Lloviu\\" is a proper noun), but is never italicized, and may be abbreviated (with LLOV being the official abbreviation). History LLOV was discovered in 2011 in Schreibers's long- fingered bats (species Miniopterus schreibersii) that were found dead in Cueva del Lloviu back in 2002, Asturias, Spain, as well as in caves in Spanish Cantabria and in caves in France and Portugal. It has not yet been proven that the virus is the etiological agent of a novel bat disease, but healthy Schreibers' long-fingered bats were not found to contain traces of the viruses, thereby at least suggesting that the virus may be pathogenic for certain bats. Necropsies of dead bats did not reveal macroscopic pathology, but microscopic examination suggested viral pneumonia. No information is available about whether or not LLOV infects humans. However, Cueva del Lloviu is frequented by tourists and no human infections or disease has yet been observed, suggesting that it is possible that LLOV might be the second filovirus that is not pathogenic for humans (the first one being Reston virus (RESTV)). Seroreactivity of additional Schreibers's long-fingered bats were reported from North Spain from 2015, suggesting the circulation of the virus among those bat colonies. However PCR positive animals were not found. Additional Schreibers's long-fingered bat die-off events were reported from Hungary in 2013, 2016 and 2017. The presence of LLOV was confirmed in bat carcasses from 2016, presenting hemorrhagic symptoms. Updated genome data was obtained from the Hungarian samples in 2020, using the Nanopore sequencing technique. Virology =Genome= LLOV has yet to be isolated in tissue culture or living animals, but its genome has been determined in its entirety with exception of the 3' and 5' UTRs. Like all mononegaviruses, LLOV virions contain a non-infectious, linear nonsegmented, single-stranded RNA genome of negative polarity that most likely possesses inverse-complementary 3' and 5' termini, does not possess a 5' cap, is not polyadenylated, and is not covalently linked to a protein. The LLOV genome is probably approximately 19 kb long and contains seven genes in the order 3'-UTR-NP-VP35-VP40-GP- VP30-VP24-L-5'-UTR. In contrast to ebolaviruses and marburgviruses, which synthesize seven mRNAs to express the seven structural proteins, LLOV seems to produce only six mRNAs, i.e. one mRNA (VP24/L) is thought to be bicistronic. LLOV genomic transcriptional termination sites are identical to those of ebolavirus genomes but different from those of marburgvirus genomes. LLOV transcriptional initiation sites are unique. =Structure= The structure of LLOV virions has not yet been described. Like all other filoviruses, LLOV virions are expected to be filamentous particles that may appear in the shape of a shepherd's crook or in the shape of a \\"U\\" or a \\"6\\", and they may be coiled, toroid, or branched. Their diameter is expected to be 80 nm in width, but vary in length. The LLOV genome suggests that LLOV particles consist of seven structural proteins. At the center would be the helical ribonucleocapsid, which would consist of the genomic RNA wrapped around a polymer of nucleoproteins (NP). Associated with the ribonucleoprotein would be the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) with the polymerase cofactor (VP35) and a transcription activator (VP30). The ribonucleoprotein would be embedded in a matrix, formed by the major (VP40) and minor (VP24) matrix proteins. These particles would be surrounded by a lipid membrane derived from the host cell membrane. The membrane would anchor a glycoprotein (GP1,2) that projects 7 to 10 nm spikes away from its surface. While nearly identical to ebolavirions and marburgvirions in structure, lloviuvirions may be antigenically distinct from both (just as they are from each other). =Replication= The LLOV life cycle is hypothesized to begin with virion attachment to specific cell-surface receptors, followed by internalization, fusion of the virion envelope with endosomal membranes and the concomitant release of the virus nucleocapsid into the cytosol. LLOV glycoprotein (GP) is cleaved by endosomal cysteine proteases (cathepsins) and the cleaved glycoprotein interacts with the intracellular entry receptor, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). The virus RdRp would partially uncoat the nucleocapsid and transcribe the genes into positive-stranded mRNAs, which would then be translated into structural and nonstructural proteins. LLOV L would bind to a single promoter located at the 3' end of the genome. Transcription would either terminate after a gene or continue to the next gene downstream. This means that genes close to the 3' end of the genome would be transcribed in the greatest abundance, whereas those toward the 5' end would be least likely to be transcribed. The gene order would therefore be a simple but effective form of transcriptional regulation. The most abundant protein produced would be the nucleoprotein, whose concentration in the cell would determine when L switches from gene transcription to genome replication. Replication would result in full-length, positive-stranded antigenomes that would in turn be transcribed into negative-stranded virus progeny genome copies. Newly synthesized structural proteins and genomes would self-assemble and accumulate near the inside of the cell membrane. Virions would bud off from the cell, gaining their envelopes from the cellular membrane they bud from. The mature progeny particles would then infect other cells to repeat the cycle.

Pleomorphism is a term used in histology and cytopathology to describe variability in the size, shape and staining of cells and/or their nuclei. Several key determinants of cell and nuclear size, like ploidy and the regulation of cellular metabolism, are commonly disrupted in tumors. Therefore, cellular and nuclear pleomorphism is one of the earliest hallmarks of cancer progression and a feature characteristic of malignant neoplasms and dysplasia. Certain benign cell types may also exhibit pleomorphism, e.g. neuroendocrine cells, Arias-Stella reaction. Despite the prevalence of pleomorphism in human pathology, its role in disease progression is unclear. In epithelial tissue, pleomorphism in cellular size can induce packing defects and disperse aberrant cells. But the consequence of atypical cell and nuclear morphology in other tissues is unknown.

Back at her apartment, Lester Trout (Ross Alexander), a saxophone player, convinces Patsy that he is ill and has lost his job. Patsy gives Lester the bracelet as a loan, against the advice of her friends, who are suspicious of him. Charlie's mother, Mrs. Henry Horace \\"Maggie\\" Breene (Pauline Frederick), fearful of her son's relationship with a plebeian, arranges a party hoping Patsy's lack of social graces will ruin Charlie's affection for her. Finding the party boring, Patsy goes to the bar, where after a few drinks, she begins to entertain the guests who are slowly wandering in to escape the dull affair. Maggie, relying on the family patriarch, Uncle Jefferson Breene (Charles Winninger), to end the romance, announces his arrival, but she is aghast when Patsy fondly hugs the old man whom she knows as \\"Jonesie,\\" the friend of one of her roommates. Maggie then asks family attorney Albert Wiggins (Garvie) to end the romance, no matter the cost. Wiggins pays Lester to tell Patsy that he is ill and in need of her help. Charlie is informed about what Patsy did with the bracelet and accuses her of being unfaithful. Lester convinces Patsy to marry him, but as soon as they wed, she finds Wiggins' check for $5000 and realizes the truth. Patsy tears the check up, just as Charlie arrives with Jonesie, who arranges their reconciliation. Having only been married to Lester for ten minutes, Charlie has Wiggins arrange Patsy's annulment.

The character she played in this film, while still working class (as they were in her other films for Neilan, like Dinty and Her Wild Oat) was more sophisticated and adult than the women she had played at the height of her fame in the late 1920s. Neilan was a heavy drinker and over the years his reputation as a director was eroded by his drinking and his disdain for authority. This was one of his last major films. Some scenes were filmed on location in New York City. A print of this film has long been held by the Library of Congress.Catalog of Holdings The American Film Institute Collection and The United Artists Collection at The Library of Congress (<-book title) p.169 c.1978 American Film Institute Notes * Synopsis, nytimes.com; accessed 24 March 2016. * Colleen Moore, Silent Star, Doubleday, 1968. *Jeff Codori (2012), Colleen Moore; A Biography of the Silent Film Star, McFarland Publishing,(Print , EBook ).

Teaching centers also routinely provide professional development for graduate students as they prepare for future careers as teaching faculty. Some centers also may provide learning support services for students, and other services, depending on the individual institution. Teaching and learning centers may have different kinds of names, such as faculty development centers, teaching and learning centers, centers for teaching and learning, centers for teaching excellence, academic support centers, and others; a common abbreviation is TLC.  History  The first teaching and learning center in North America was University of Michigan's Center for Research on Learning and Teaching, established in 1962. Purpose University professors, part-time instructors, or teaching assistants approach teaching as experts in their field and know their contents. However, that does not guarantee success in teaching, as teaching expertise is an altogether different matter. Many instructors have not been trained in teaching methods, and may have difficulties conveying contents and concepts to students, who are relative novices. Novice students approach the information and contents in a course in a much different way than expert teachers, and teachers may not understand the conceptual divide between them and their students. Novice students may perceive the contents of lectures and textbooks as large amounts of information, rather than as meaningful concepts, in contrast to experts, who can naturally see the materials as coherent and meaningful, due to years of mastery.Committee on Developments in the Science of Learning. 2000. How People Learn, 2nd ed. National Academy Press Those who rely on traditional teacher-centered methods such as pure lecture may inadvertently subject students to an information dump, or fail to connect with students at a conceptual level, leaving students unable to learn or retain information in a meaningful manner. Teaching and learning centers exist to help instructors to modernize their teaching style, to scaffold concepts and information in a way that students can meaningfully take in, and to help students learn more deeply and retain what they have learned. As such, these centers assume roles as educational change agents.Diamond, Robert M. 2005. The institutional change agency: The expanding role of academic support centers. In Chadwick-Blossey, Sandra (Ed.), To Improve the Academy, 23, pp. 24-37. Bolton, MA: Anker Publishing Company. Singer, Susan R. 2002. Learning and Teaching Centers: Hubs of Educational Reform. New Directions for Higher Education, 119, 59-64. Wiley Publications. Such centers also attempt to help instructors with other problems that they might have, such as managing graduate students, designing courses, technical writing, trying novel teaching methods, and designing better assignments and exams. Some centers may address learning difficulties at the students' end, by providing support services for better learning and study skills. Some centers may also be involved in e-learning and similar movements. Faculty support services Teaching and learning centers typically offer professional development services for faculty, particularly to help them improve their teaching and professional careers. Depending on the institution, these may be optional for professors, or required for new professors or those facing difficulties in teaching performance. Some universities in the American system may require graduate teaching assistants who teach university courses to participate in training or coaching programs. Such centers also work to promote more modern teaching methods, discussion, and institutional changes in teaching practices and in the academic environment. Instructional coaching is one service typically offered to faculty members. In a coaching session, an instructor meets with an instructional coach or consultant (an education specialist or researcher), who can provide guidance to the instructor in improving his or her teaching skills and pedagogical expertise.Knight, Jim. 2008. Coaching: Approaches and Perspectives. Corwin Press.Knight, Jim. 2007. Instructional Coaching. Corwin Press. Depending on the institution, this may be optional or required for new professors or other teaching staff. Others may be required to seek coaching if cited for poor teaching performance. Others may choose to visit an instructional coach for help with difficulties in teaching, or simply out of a self-motivated desire to improve one's teaching ability, or for advice or instruction on using new teaching techniques. Micro-teaching workshops are sessions where instructors present a short demo lecture or mini-lecture, either part of a real lecture, or a condensed version of a lecture, in front of other colleagues or an educational consultant. The presenter can receive feedback on his or her teaching and presentation skills from peers and from the instructional coach or consultant. Many TLCs in Canada and around the world, for example, have implemented the Instructional Skills Workshop since 1978 as a peer micro-teaching certificate program. Workshops or \\"brown bag\\" meetings may be offered by the center's staff or outside speakers on various aspects of professional development and teaching techniques. Workshops may provide instruction in newer teaching techniques, by introducing techniques to instructors and/or helping them to better implement these methods, as well as helping them to make more effective use of traditional methods such as lectures and lecture-discussion formats. Newer or more student-centered techniques might include group activities, active learning or cooperative learning, problem based learning (PBL), discovery based learning, experiential learning, or non-traditional forms of assessment such as portfolios and formative assessment techniques. Orientation workshops can also introduce teaching skills as well as other necessary information for newer faculty members. Teaching and learning centers may also sponsor and facilitate faculty learning communities (FLCs) for professional development in teaching. FLCs consist of instructors, often similar or related fields, to meet in small groups to troubleshoot difficulties and issues that they face in teaching, and to brainstorm or research solutions. Members meet regularly to discuss issues and findings, and may engage in journaling or other means of promoting reflective practice about their teaching. FLCs also promote a sense of community and sharing of teaching experience.Cox, M. D. (2004), Introduction to faculty learning communities. New Directions for Teaching and Learning, 2004: 5‚Äì23. Layne, J.; Froyd, J.; Morgan, J.; Kenimer, A. (2002). Faculty Learning Communities. In proceedings of the 32nd ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, pp. F1A-13-18. URL: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber;=1158114&isnumber;=24586 Other services may include workshops, brown bags meetings, or consultation services in other areas of professional development for teachers.Gullatt, Daved E.; Weaver, Sue Wells. 1997. Use of Faculty Development Activities To Improve the Effectiveness of U.S. Institutions of Higher Education. Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Professional and Organizational Development Network in Higher Education (22nd, Hines City, FL, October 16‚Äì19, 1997). http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED414796.pdf Topics in teaching skills can be addressed, such as improving one's lectures or course design for more student- centered and interesting lessons, teaching specific academic skills, using new instructional technologies, and help with presentation skills. Teacher-student issues might include understanding and addressing difficulties that students might have; guidance on how to mentor graduate students; and understanding issues of gender, race or other factors that can affect classroom dynamics and academic performance; e.g., linguistic and educational research has shown that female and male students interact differently in small group versus full-class discussions.Tannen, Deborah. 1996. Researching gender-related patterns in classroom discourse. TESOL Quarterly, 30, 341-344. Evaluation and assessment issues can include such as designing assignments, designing quizzes and exams, grading, and giving feedback. Career-related help is provided by some centers for matters like help with writing grants, academic job search skills, and creating teaching portfolios for those seeking academic jobs. For instructors who are not native speakers of English, such centers may provide some help or referrals for instructors in English for academic purposes (EAP). Other activities Other services might be offered by a teaching and learning center, though this varies among institutions. Some centers provide support services for students in study and learning skills, or even peer tutoring programs.http://ctl.korea.ac.kr At many institutions, however, student support services may fall under the domain of learning resource centers or student counseling centers. Some centers provide support for e-learning and research on e-learning programs and techniques. Some may participate in e-learning movements and consortia such as the OpenCourseWare (OCW) movement. TLCs may also offer longer workshops or formal courses on graduate supervision theory and practice. Some TLCs go beyond the individual teacher level to system support, for example facilitating department retreats on curriculum or program level mapping of concepts and skills through courses and year levels, for redesign or new design or accreditation purposes. Such centers may also conduct internal evaluations on the effectiveness of academic programs, or may manage student feedback on instructors' performance, and provide faculty help in understanding and making use of students' course feedback.http://cte.illinois.edu Educational researchers at some centers conduct educational research on teaching methods or e-learning programs, and research in the scholarship of teaching and learning (SOTL).

The chamber got its first permanent venue in 1869 when a part of The Madras Mail office was leased to them. In 1924, the chamber moved to the offices of the Mercantile Bank. Right from the initial stages, native Indians did not join in large numbers in the chamber as in the case of the Southern Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Indian merchants chose to start their own organisations such as the Madras Trades Association. The chamber got its first Indian President only in 1964.

Since the beginning of development on UnrealIRCd c. May 1999, many new features have been added and modified, including advanced security features and bug fixes, and it has become a popular server. Development UnrealIRCd was originally based on DALnet's DreamForge IRCd, \\"a now deprecated IRC server that was the predecessor to the actively maintained Bahamut server.\\" On July 13, 2007, Carsten V. Munk (stskeeps), the founder of the UnrealIRCd project, announced that a future v4.0 would be a fork of InspIRCd. Later on, this idea was dropped. With the release of version 3.2.10 in December 2012, Bram Matthys (Syzop), the current project leader of UnrealIRCd, announced that development has been started on a 3.4 version. The 3.2 series will be maintained until the new version has been declared stable, which was expected to happen somewhere in 2014. In October 2015 it was announced that due to the many changes the new series will be called UnrealIRCd 4 and the first Release Candidate was made available for download. An UnrealIRCd 4.0.0 stable release was made on December 24, 2015. Next UnrealIRCd 5 stable series was first released on December 13, 2019. Features Some of Unreal's features are referred to as \\"nonstandard\\", in that they are not listed in the IRC-related RFCs 1459 and 2811-2813,Piccard et. al., p. 402 but are beneficial \\"from a security point of view.\\" The software \\"possibly has the most security features of any IRC server\\", including \\"spam filters, different styles of user bans, various channel modes to prevent abuse and flooding, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) connection support, and compressed server connections.\\" For example, the shun command blocks a user from transmitting any text, the spamfilter uses regular expressions and can automatically ban, shun or disconnect users, and dccdeny can block files from being transmitted.Piccard et. al., p. 371 It includes the ability to password-protect server restart and stop commands, for operator use only. The Windows version includes error reporting on startup. Unreal supports linking to IRC Services, and allowing Services to change channel modes.Leadbeater, p. 366. Server-side filtering can be used by administrators to block transfers of files, or certain domains.Piccard et. al., p. 409, 392 Unreal 3.2's \\"new-style\\" configuration file format is described as \\"more verbose\\" than traditional IRCd servers, which makes it easier set up; it is divided into \\"blocks\\" of related options, and has explanatory comments for each option.Leadbeater, p. 361. Reception UnrealIRCd is \\"one of the most popular and full-featured IRC daemons\\"Leadbeater, p. 360. and is used on the largest number of IRC servers, according to SearchIRC.com.

He is best known for being the chief private-sector patron and financial angel of the Discovery Expedition to the Antarctic. Antarctic patron Llewellyn Longstaff was born in Wandsworth London, on 23 December 1841. In 1873, he married Marie Lydia Sawyer, with whom he had 10 children, including mountaineer Tom George Longstaff. He owned a significant equity share in Blundell Spence & Co., a ¬£400,000 firm based in Kingston upon Hull that crushed linseed oil to manufacture oil paint. He was also a member of several nongovernmental organizations, including the Freemasons, the Hull Chamber of Commerce and Shipping, and the Royal Geographical Society (RGS). Longstaff's Society membership coincided with the presidency of longtime RGS leader Sir Clements Markham, whose dream was to organize a British expedition to the then-unknown Antarctic continent. Markham's initial efforts to lobby for funds were met with indifference in London; but Longstaff's friendship with Markham made it possible for the impecunious expedition plans to move forward, as the industrialist pledged in 1899 to donate ¬£25,000 sterling. The British government then promised to appropriate ¬£40,000 as matching funds, thus creating a budget to support the construction in 1900-1901 of a ship for the expedition, RRS Discovery. The ship, partly paid for by Longstaff, would be commanded by Markham's prot√©g√© Robert Falcon Scott. The paint manufacturer's donation gave him the standing to recommend potential expedition members to Markham. After Sir Llewellen's son Cedric befriended a junior Union Castle merchant navy officer while their ship was heading for South Africa, young Cedric recommended his friend to Longstaff's attention. Longstaff got the sea officer, Ernest Shackleton, a crucial interview with Markham that led to his selection for the expedition. The Discovery Expedition sailed south, with Scott as commander and Shackleton as a key officer, in August 1901. The expedition members treated Longstaff in absentia as their principal patron, and in December 1902 Scott and Shackleton, in a probe southward over the Ross Ice Shelf, discovered and named the Longstaff Peaks, a mountain system in the Holland Range. Longstaff died on 20 November 1918 in Wimbledon, London. He was posthumously appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1919 New Year Honours. The Discovery, built with his donation, was preserved as a historic landmark. As of 2019 it is permanently moored in Dundee.

He was the oldest son of the penultimate emperor Emperor Zhaozong and Empress He and was Crown Prince from 897 to 900. In 900, Emperor Zhaozong was briefly forced by the eunuch Liu Jishu to abdicate in Li Yu's favor; after Emperor Zhaozong was restored, Li Yu was no longer Crown Prince but remained a favored son. After Emperor Zhaozong was assassinated by the powerful warlord Zhu Quanzhong in 904, Li Yu, whom Zhu was apprehensive of, was bypassed in favor of his younger brother Emperor Ai (Li Zuo/Li Zhu), and in 905, Zhu had Li Yu, along with eight of his younger brothers, killed. As Li Yu's brief reign was under duress from a eunuch, he is not typically considered a true emperor of Tang.  Background  It is not known when Li You was born ‚Äî including whether he was born before or after his father Emperor Zhaozong became emperor in 888 ‚Äî but it would be before his younger brother Li Zuo was born in 892,Old Book of Tang, vol. 20, part 2. particularly since both he and Li Zuo were born of Empress He. He was Emperor Zhaozong's oldest son.New Book of Tang, vol. 82. In 891, Emperor Zhaozong created him the Prince of De.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258.  As crown prince under Emperor Zhaozong  After Emperor Zhaozong and his court were forced to flee from the imperial capital Chang'an to Hua Prefecture (ËèØÂ∑û, headquartered in modern Weinan, Shaanxi) after an attack by the warlord Li Maozhen the military governor (Jiedushi) of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) in 896,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. Emperor Zhaozong came under effective control of Han Jian the military governor of Zhenguo Circuit (ÈéÆÂúã, headquartered at Hua Prefecture). Han soon became apprehensive of the fact that Emperor Zhaozong arrived at Hua Prefecture along with a number of new imperial soldiers that Emperor Zhaozong had recruited and put under the commands of a number of imperial princes (who were not his sons), and he pressured Emperor Zhaozong to force the imperial princes to give up the commands. Under Han's duress, Emperor Zhaozong was forced to have the imperial princes give up the commands and subject to house arrest by Han. Han, knowing that this displeased Emperor Zhaozong, wanted to placate the emperor, so he suggested to the emperor that he create Li You crown prince. In spring 897, Emperor Zhaozong did so, and also changed Li You's name to Li Yu. Shortly after, Li Yu's mother Consort He was created empress. (Subsequently, when Han ascertained that if he acted against the imperial princes that he arrested that he would not face retaliation from Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), whom Emperor Zhaozong was still awaiting rescue from, Han slaughtered those imperial princes.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261.  Briefly as emperor  Emperor Zhaozong subsequently made peace with Li Maozhen and returned to Chang'an in 899. It was said, however, that after the ordeal at Hua Prefecture, he became depressed, drank frequently, and had unpredictable moods. The powerful eunuchs (Liu Jishu and Wang Zhongxian (Áéã‰ª≤ÂÖà) the commanders of the Shence Armies and Wang Yanfan (ÁéãÂΩ•ÁØÑ) and Xue Qiwo (ËñõÈΩäÂÅì) the directors of palace communications) became considering deposing him. Late in 900, after an incident where Emperor Zhaozong personally killed a few eunuchs and ladies in waiting after being drunk, Liu acted. He took the Shence soldiers and entered the palace, forcing Emperor Zhaozong to turn over the imperial seal and putting the emperor under house arrest. He brought Li Yu to the palace and, issuing an edict in Emperor Zhaozong's name passing the throne to Li Yu, declared Li Yu emperor and changed his name to Li Zhen. Emperor Zhaozong was honored as Retired Emperor (Taishanghuang) while Empress He was honored as Retired Empress, but they were effectively kept under house arrest. Less than two months later, a group of Shence officers loyal to Emperor Zhaozong (led by Sun Dezhao (Â≠´Âæ∑Êò≠), Dong Yanbi (Ëë£ÂΩ•Âºº), and Zhou Chenghui (Âë®ÊâøË™®)) killed Liu and Wang Zhongxian. They restored Emperor Zhaozong to the throne. A group of eunuchs, in the disturbance, escorted Li Zhen to the Left Shence Army. They offered the imperial seal back to Emperor Zhaozong. Emperor Zhaozong accepted it and stated that Li Yu was not responsible, since he was young. He returned Li Yu to the Crown Prince's palace, but still removed the title of Crown Prince from him and made him the Prince of De again.  After Emperor Zhaozong's restoration  There was no reference to Li Yu's activities after becoming Prince of De again. Presumably, when Emperor Zhaozong was subsequently kidnapped by the eunuchs led by Han Quanhui to Fengxiang (as they were allied with Li Maozhen) in 901, Li Yu was taken to Fengxiang as well. At the instigation of the chancellor Cui Yin, Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) took an army to Fengxiang, put its capital Fengxiang Municipality under siege, and forced Li Maozhen to surrender the emperor to him. He took the emperor and the imperial household back to Chang'an.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263. By this point, Li Yu was growing up and was said to be handsome. Zhu, who wanted to eventually take over the throne himself, was apprehensive of him, and stated to Cui that he believed that Li Yu, having taken the throne improperly earlier, should not be allowed to live. When Cui relayed this to Emperor Zhaozong, Emperor Zhaozong was shocked and confronted Zhu; Zhu then disavowed having told that to Cui. Subsequently, when Zhu had Cui killed and forced the emperor to relocate to Luoyang, which was firmly in his control,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264. Emperor Zhaozong became fearful that Zhu wanted Li Yu killed, once stating to Zhu's assistant Jiang Xuanhui (Ëî£ÁéÑÊöâ), whom Zhu made the director of palace communications to keep the emperor under watch, \\"The Prince of De is a beloved son of ours. Why does Quanzhong firmly want him dead?\\" Zhu became more apprehensive, and, in 904, he had his adoptive son Zhu Yougong (Êú±ÂèãÊÅ≠) and officer Shi Shucong (Ê∞èÂèîÁêÆ) assassinate the emperor. Li Yu, even though he was the oldest son, was bypassed, and his younger brother Li Zuo, then the Prince of Hui, was made emperor (as Emperor Ai, with his name changed to Li Zhu). In spring 905, at the She Festival (Á§æÊó•, i.e., the festival dedicated to the Tudi), Zhu had Jiang invite Li Yu and eight of his younger brothers to a feast at Jiuqu Pond (‰πùÊõ≤Ê±†). At the feast, Zhu had the soldiers seize the imperial princes and strangle them to death. Their bodies were thrown into the pond.

It is bounded by Battery Place on the north, State Street on the east, New York Harbor to the south, and the Hudson River to the west. The park contains attractions such as an old fort named Castle Clinton; multiple monuments; and the SeaGlass Carousel. The surrounding area, known as South Ferry, contains multiple ferry terminals, including the Staten Island Ferry's Whitehall Terminal; a boat launch to the Statue of Liberty National Monument (which includes Ellis Island and Liberty Island); and a boat launch to Governors Island. The park and surrounding area is named for the artillery batteries that were built in the late 17th century to protect the settlement behind them. By the 1820s, the Battery had become an entertainment destination, with the conversion of Castle Clinton into a theater venue. During the mid-19th century, the modern-day Battery Park was constructed and Castle Clinton was converted into an immigration and customs center. The Battery was commonly known as the landing point for immigrants to New York City until 1890, when the Castle Clinton immigration center was replaced by one on Ellis Island. Castle Clinton then hosted the New York Aquarium from 1896 to 1941. In 1940, the entirety of Battery Park was closed for twelve years due to the construction of the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel and the Battery Park Underpass. The park reopened in 1952 after a renovation, but then subsequently went into decline. The Battery Conservancy, founded in 1994 by Warrie Price, underwrote and funded the restoration and improvement of the once-dilapidated park. In 2015, the Conservancy renamed the park to its historic name of \\"the Battery\\". History =Site= The area was originally occupied by the Lenape Native Americans. Dutch settlers populated the area as part of the settlement of New Amsterdam in the early 17th century. The Dutch referred to the southern tip of Manhattan as \\"Capske Hook\\" or \\"Capsie Hoek\\", the term coming from the Lenape word \\"Kapsee\\", meaning \\"rocky ledge\\". Capske Hook was originally a narrow, hilly ledge that extended northward to Broadway, which at the time was a Lenape trail. In 1625‚Äì1626, the Dutch built Fort Amsterdam atop of a hill at the site of the present Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House. However, the fort was largely ineffective, despite several attempts at reconstruction. The British took over the settlement in 1664 and renamed the defenses Fort James. An artillery battery was installed at the fort in 1683, from which the Battery got its present name. The fortification would later be renamed several times more, before the British settled on the name of \\"Fort George\\" by 1714. left The Battery did not fire any additional shots until 1776 during the American Revolutionary War, when American troops commandeered the fort. The Americans failed to prevent the British from sailing up the Hudson River, though. Following the British landing at Kip's Bay on September 15, 1776, the Americans had abandoned the fort, and the British took Lower Manhattan. At the end of the war in 1783, the Battery was the center of Evacuation Day celebrations commemorating the departure of the last British troops in the United States; the event was later commemorated with the erection of a flagstaff. By 1788, Fort George had been demolished, and debris from the fort was used to expand the Battery. The fort itself became the site of Government House, an executive mansion intended for U.S. president George Washington, though never actually used for that purpose. In 1808‚Äì1811, just prior to the War of 1812, the West Battery was erected on a small artificial offshore island nearby, to replace the earlier batteries in the area. At the time, the shore at the Battery was a relatively flat edge. The West Battery was never used, and following the war, the artillery battery was renamed Castle Clinton. When Battery Park's landmass was created, it encircled and incorporated the island.History of The Battery, The Battery Conservancy. Retrieved December 1, 2014. About were added to the park area in 1824. Meanwhile, Castle Clinton was turned over to the city government, which turned the structure into an entertainment venue. It subsequently served various purposes, including as an immigration and customs center as well as an aquarium. = Creation = The alt=By the 1840s, members of the city's elite were publicly calling for the construction of a new large park in Manhattan. Proponents said that the park would serve three purposes: abetting good health, improving the behavior of the \\"disorderly classes\\", and showcasing the refinement of the city's elite. At the time, Manhattan's seventeen squares comprised a combined of land, the largest of which was the park at the Battery. Two sites were considered for a large park: Jones's Wood, and the present site of Central Park. An alternate suggestion was to enlarge the existing Battery Park, a move endorsed by most of the public. However, the expansion of Battery Park was opposed by wealthy merchants who deemed the proposed enlargement to be dangerous to maritime traffic, and they obtained the opinion of a United States Navy lieutenant who agreed with them. As a compromise, New York City's aldermen also voted to expand Battery Park to . Ultimately, the plans for the large park would result in the construction of Central Park. The relatively modern Battery Park was mostly created by landfill starting from 1855, using earth from street- widening projects in Lower Manhattan which united Castle Garden's island with the \\"mainland\\" of Manhattan. The original shoreline is roughly the modern-day park's eastern boundary at State Street. On State Street, the former harbor front and the northern boundary of the park, a single Federal mansion, the James Watson House, survives as part of the Shrine of Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton. By 1870, there were plans to improve Battery Park and Bowling Green, which were seen as having degraded substantially due to overuse. Paths were to be laid through both parks, intersecting with a plaza to be built outside Castle Clinton. City Pier A, located immediately north of Castle Clinton, was commissioned in 1886 and completed two years after. The building originally housed the New York City Board of Dock Commissioners and subsequently was used as a fireboat station until 1992.  Elevated and subway lines  Several elevated railroad lines or \\"els\\" were being built to Battery Park by the late 19th century, but they were controversial for several reasons. Because the els were originally pulled by steam trains until 1902, this caused substantial pollution at Battery Park. The New York Elevated Railroad Company opened the Battery Place elevated station at Battery Place, on the park's northern end, in 1872. This was followed by the opening of the two-track South Ferry elevated station at the park's southern end in 1877. New York Elevated Railroad agreed to beautify Battery Park as a condition of being allowed to construct the station, but the elevated station's construction soon prompted opposition among people who wanted the elevated tracks removed. A larger four- track station was built nearby in 1879, serving the Second, Third, Sixth, and Ninth Avenue Lines. In 1883, the state legislature established a committee to examine the process through which permission had been granted to construct the elevated station. The following year, New York Elevated proposed to extend the platforms of the Battery Place station over Battery Park because the platforms were too short to accommodate four-car trains. Another plan, which would have created elevated track loops over Battery Park, was rejected in 1887 as being unlawful. Other unsuccessful plans to build elevated tracks over Battery Park were proposed in 1889 and 1891. By 1900, the els were considered a nuisance, and there were calls to destroy the segments of elevated tracks that ran directly over the park, though this did not come to pass for another fifty years. In 1903, a state assemblyman proposed a bill that would give the elevated railroad companies the exclusive rights to build a rail terminal at Battery Park, precluding the construction of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT)'s underground subway. The bill was not passed. By that time, the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, the Joralemon Street Tunnel to Brooklyn, and the South Ferry subway terminal were being built directly under the park. The South Ferry station opened in 1905, while the Joralemon Street Tunnel opened in 1908. Another early method of transportation was by streetcars, which stopped at Battery Place and traveled up both sides of Manhattan Island. These streetcar lines terminated at South Ferry and included what are now the bus routes. The streetcars were eliminated by 1936, though only some were replaced by buses. =20th century= The New York Aquarium used to be housed in Castle Clinton (image before 1923) By the 20th century, the quality of Battery Park had started to decline, and several new structures were being proposed within the park itself, though most plans faced opposition and were not built. For instance, in 1901, a large memorial arch to honor United States Navy soldiers was proposed within the park. Another monument, to steamboat operator Robert Fulton, was proposed in September 1905 by Gustav H. Schwab. There was also a bill to construct a playground in the park, which was vetoed in 1903. Opposition to structures in Battery Park was such that even the construction of the IRT subway under Battery Park was opposed by the Manhattan parks commissioner. Other proposals included a 1910 plan to expand the Aquarium into Battery Park, and a proposal for an athletic jogging field the following year. Furthermore, during World War I, there was a plan to construct a federal government building on the site, but this was withdrawn after the U.S. government found new premises following opposition to the project. Proposals to redesign Battery Park continued through the next decade. An expansion of the New York Aquarium within the park was announced in 1921, and a new memorial plaque was unveiled the same year. By 1926, a group called the Battery Park Association had formed a committee to study ways to improve the park. In 1928, it was proposed to remove the els from Battery Park. The following year, an immigrants' memorial was proposed within Battery Park, and the park itself was proposed for reconstruction into a formal vista. In 1940, Battery Park was partially closed for the construction of the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel, and the aquarium was shuttered. Subsequently, several plans to modify Battery Park were proposed. A design competition to rebuild Battery Park was hosted in 1941, and a plan to replace Castle Clinton with a Fort Clinton memorial was also brought up. During the park's closure, its northern end was used to store debris. A second tunnel, the Battery Park Underpass, started construction in 1949. The following year, the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel opened, and the South Ferry elevated station was removed after the closure of the last elevated line leading to the station. After the underpass was completed in 1951, the park was re-landscaped and expanded by , and it reopened in 1952. In Battery Park's new layout, it contained a landscaped esplanade, a raised waterfront terrace, and an oval lawn with a playground. Various statues, formerly scattered across the park, were rearranged in patterns. The reconstruction of Battery Park had cost roughly $2.38 million. A tree in Battery Park Several memorials opened through the mid-20th century. Peter Minuit Plaza and a Coast Guard memorial were both dedicated in 1955, and the East Coast Memorial was dedicated in 1963. Additionally, a \\"space needle\\" with office and commercial space, twice the height of the Empire State Building, was proposed for the Battery in the 1960s, while discussions were ongoing on where to put the additional earth created from the construction of the World Trade Center. The building would have been placed partially on landfill adjacent to the Battery. The \\"needle\\" was never built, and the earth was used as landfill for the creation of Battery Park City, just to the north of Battery Park. By 1971, Battery Park was so dilapidated that a U.S. representative from Missouri, Richard Howard Ichord Jr., called the litter- ridden park \\"a national disgrace\\" and proposed that two National Park Service employees be hired to clean up the park. Castle Clinton was restored several years later, and reopened in 1975. In 1982, Battery Park and multiple other \\"historic waterfront sites\\" were designated by the government of New York State as part of a zone called \\"Harbor Park\\". The other sites included South Street Seaport in Manhattan, Liberty and Ellis Islands in New York Harbor, Fulton Ferry in Brooklyn, and Sailors' Snug Harbor in Staten Island, which were to be linked by new ferry routes. The Harbor Park legislation was part of a city proposal to create a larger tourist destination out of these sites, focused chiefly around New York Harbor's history. The \\"park\\" was opened in July 1984. = Restoration and 21st century = Battery Park City was constructed as a luxury waterfront neighborhood through the 1970s and 1980s. The success of the development resulted in attention and new funding for Battery Park projects, such as $5 million for a garden near Castle Clinton. In 1988, governor Mario Cuomo and mayor Ed Koch announced a $100 million plan to construct two new parks in Battery Park City and rearrange the park at the Battery as part of a new Hudson River waterfront park system. Part of the waterfront park system had been completed previously, but the new proposal would complete the system of parks. Within Battery Park, the Battery Park City Authority would add new entrances and redesign the park to give clearer views of the Hudson River. However, by the 1990s, Battery Park was worn down, and many of the nearby residents and tourists shunned it altogether, except when taking boats to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. The New York Times said of the park, \\"Some benches are broken, all need repainting. Where grass should be, there is dirt and litter. A sign with a map and guide is so smeared with graffiti it is unreadable. There are potholes on the asphalt where people line up for boats to the Statue of Liberty.\\" The nonprofit Battery Conservancy was created in 1994, and one of its first actions was to create an architectural plan for the park, and renovating it for $30 million. In 1998, the administration of mayor Rudy Giuliani announced a $40 million initiative to renovate Battery Park. The restoration project, based on similar successful projects at Bryant and Central Parks, called for the relocation of the Battery's 23 statues, as well as an expansion of Castle Clinton. Much of the funding was to be raised privately, and at the time, this was thought to be a minor obstacle since Battery Park was neither as high-profile as Central Park, nor as worn-down as Bryant Park. One of the first renovation projects to commence was the reconstruction of the park's seawall and promenade at a cost of $5.5 million. Although Battery Park was used as an emergency staging site following the September 11 attacks in 2001, construction on the upper promenade continued largely uninterrupted, and it opened in December 2001. The Battery Bosque, a new landscaped garden, opened in 2005. SeaGlass Carousel, opened 2015 Some restoration projects were undertaken in Battery Park in the 2010s, including the addition of a community garden, the renovation of a promenade, and the construction of the SeaGlass Carousel. By June 2012, a third of the park was being cordoned off for these construction projects, though the park itself remained open, serving 10,000 to 15,000 daily visitors. In October of that year, Hurricane Sandy caused severe damage to the area, submerging the park under salt water for several hours. the Battery Conservancy restored the wooded areas within Battery Park, as well as added gardens and green patches to mitigate the effects of future storms. Though the SeaGlass Carousel was left largely intact during Hurricane Sandy, its opening was delayed. Following the storm, the attraction was supposed to open in late 2013, but did not actually open until August 2015. The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation restored the park's original, historical title of \\"The Battery\\" in 2015. By the following year, the Battery Conservancy had raised $46 million in private funding over its 22-year existence, as well as $92 million in city funding. The conservancy planned to use these funds to make additional improvements to the park. For instance, the Battery Oval was opened in 2016. A environmentally-friendly, flood-resistant playground called the Playscape was proposed in 2016; work began in March 2020, and it is expected to open in early 2021. Notable attractions Korean War memorial in the Battery The Battery contains multiple attractions and points of interest. Castle Clinton, a former fort, lies near the northwestern corner of the Battery and serves as the park's main attraction. To its north is the former fireboat station, Pier A, which since 2014 has been used as a restaurant. Another eatery, the Battery Gardens restaurant, is located next to the United States Coast Guard Battery Building. Located nearby is a garden called the Battery Bosque, which was designed by Dutch landscape architect Piet Oudolf and is centered around a grove of 140 plane trees. An additional grove of 15 trees was dedicated at the park in 1976 as a gift from the city of Jerusalem. This area, located northwest of Castle Clinton, is called Jerusalem Grove. The northeastern corner hosts a lawn called the Battery Oval. The lawn opened in 2016 as part of a major restoration of the park, and contains turf made of Kentucky bluegrass. Along the waterfront, Statue Cruises offers ferries to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. The southwestern corner of the Battery contains the SeaGlass Carousel, an attraction with bioluminescent design that pays homage not only to the carousel's waterfront site, but also to Castle Clinton's former status as an aquarium. The southeastern corner contains Peter Minuit Plaza, an intermodal passenger transport hub. The plaza hosts a bus terminal for the buses, an entrance to the Staten Island Ferry's Whitehall Terminal, entrances to the New York City Subway's South Ferry/Whitehall Street station, and taxi stands. The plaza also includes the New Amsterdam Plein and Pavilion, a pavilion gifted by the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which displays art, design, and horticulture. The park is also the site of numerous memorials and monuments placed there over the years. , the park saw over five million annual visitors. In 2016, the Battery Conservancy said that the park saw 600,000 visitors a month, which amounted to about 7.2 million visitors per year. = Castle Clinton = Castle Clinton National Monument Castle Clinton was originally called the West Battery, it was built as a fort just prior to the War of 1812. It was renamed Castle Clinton in 1815 after the war, in honor of mayor DeWitt Clinton, and became property of the city in 1823. When leased by the city, it became a popular promenade and beer garden called Castle Garden. Later roofed over, it became one of the premier theatrical venues in the United States and contributed greatly to the development of New York City as the theater capital of the nation. In the early 1850s alone, the venue hosted such acts as Swedish soprano Jenny Lind, European dancing star Lola Montez, French conductor Louis-Antoine Jullien, and the Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company. The migration of the city's elite uptown increased during the mid-19th century, and in 1855, Castle Garden was closed and made into the world's first immigration depot. The immigration center operated until 1890, just before the offshore immigration facility at Ellis Island opened. An estimated 7.7 million immigrants passed through the center during its operation. The structure then housed the New York Aquarium from 1896 to 1941, when it was closed as part of Triborough Bridge Authority commissioner Robert Moses's plans to build the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel. Moses wanted to create a Fort Clinton memorial on the site, but would only keep Castle Clinton if the federal government agreed to pay for its restoration. Ultimately, Castle Clinton was preserved as part of a National Monument in 1946. The structure was restored in 1975. Today, Castle Clinton retains its original name and is managed by the National Park Service. It contains a small history exhibit and ticket booths for the ferries to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island; in addition, it occasionally hosts concerts. As the site of the ferry ticket office, it recorded nearly 4.08 million visitors in 2009. According to data from the National Park Service, the Statue of Liberty National Monument, which includes Castle Clinton, was the most popular national monument in the United States that year. = Memorials = Battery Park contains over 20 monuments, many of which are clustered in an area called \\"Monument Walk\\".alt= The Sphere, Hope Garden, and flagpole Five months after being damaged in the September 11 attacks, Fritz Koenig's The Sphere, which once stood at the center of the plaza of the World Trade Center a few blocks away, was reinstalled in a temporary location in the northern section of the park. It was located near the Netherlands memorial flagpole in the northeast corner of the park before being moved to Liberty Park in the new World Trade Center in late 2017. The Sphere, standing high, was meant to symbolize world peace through world trade, and was, at its original location, in the center of a ring of fountains to mimic the Masjid al-Haram, Great Mosque of Mecca; The Sphere had stood at the place in the World Trade Center where the Kaaba was in the Masjid al-Haram. After 2001, it became a World Trade Center memorial as well; a plaque alongside The Sphere reads as follows: Within the park is Hope Garden, a memorial dedicated to AIDS victims, where The Sphere had been exhibited at times. The garden has also been used as a site for environmental demonstrations due to its fragility and the Battery's status as a tourist attraction. The Netherlands flagpole was dedicated on December 6, 1926, as a gift from the Dutch in honor of the establishment of New Amsterdam three centuries prior. It was originally located south of Castle Clinton, but during the 1940‚Äì1952 renovation, the flagpole was relocated to the northeast entrance of the Battery, where it still stands. It was renovated and rededicated in 2000. East Coast Memorial A World War II war memorial, the East Coast Memorial is one of three war memorials in the United States administered by the American Battle Monuments Commission; the others are the West Coast Memorial to the Missing of World War II in San Francisco and the Honolulu Memorial. The memorial commemorates U.S. servicemen who died in coastal waters of the western Atlantic Ocean during the Battle of the Atlantic. A total of 4,609 names are inscribed on both sides of eight 19-foot-tall granite pylons. The pylons are arranged in two rows of four each. Between the two rows stands a bronze statue of an eagle, erected on a black granite pedestal. The eagle faces the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor.\\"East Coast Memorial ,\\" American Battle Monuments Commission website The memorial was designed by the architectural firm of Gehron & Seltzer, while the eagle statue was created by Albino Manca, an Italian-born sculptor. The granite slabs were set up in October 1959; the sculpture was installed in February 1963, and the memorial was dedicated by President John F. Kennedy that May. American Merchant Mariners' Memorial American Merchant Mariners' Memorial The American Merchant Mariners' Memorial sculpture, located in the Hudson River west of the park, is sited on a stone breakwater just south of Pier A and connected to the pier by a dock. It was designed by the sculptor Marisol Escobar and dedicated in 1991. The bronze sculpture depicts four merchant seamen with their sinking vessel after it had been attacked by a U-boat during World War II. One of the seamen is in the water, and is covered by the sea with each high tide. The sculpture is loosely based on a real photograph of crewmen of the SS Muskogee that was taken by the commander of an attacking submarine, all of whom died at sea. The memorial was commissioned by the American Merchant Mariners' Memorial, Inc., chaired by AFL‚ÄìCIO president Lane Kirkland. Other memorials The park also contains several other memorials, including: * The Immigrants (1983, rededicated 2005) ‚Äì Located south of Castle Clinton, this statue by Luis Sanguino depicts multiple types of immigrants that would have passed through Castle Clinton in the late 19th century. * Korean War Memorial (1991) ‚Äì Located at Battery Place just northeast of Castle Clinton and designed by Mac Adams, it is a black granite obelisk dedicated to veterans of the Korean War. It was intended as one of the United States' first Korean War memorials. * John Ericsson statue (1903) ‚Äì Located near the center of the park, the statue was designed by Jonathan Scott Hartley. It commemorates Ericsson, a designer and innovator of ironclad warships, and depicts him holding a model of the . * Walloon Settlers Memorial (1924) ‚Äì Located at Battery Place, the memorial was designed by Henry Bacon. The monument is a stele dedicated to Jess√© de Forest for his contributions to the founding of New York City. * Giovanni da Verrazzano (1909) ‚Äì Located at Battery Place, the memorial was designed by Ettore Ximenes. It is a statue of Verrazzano, the first European to sail into New York Harbor, on a pedestal. * World War II Coast Guard Memorial (1955) ‚Äì Located at the extreme southeast end of Battery Park, this memorial was designed by Norman M. Thomas and depicts three figures on a pedestal. * Wireless Operators Memorial (1915, rededicated 1952) ‚Äì Located near the center of the park, the monument consists of a cenotaph commemorating wireless telegraph operators who went down with their ships. Temporary monuments have also been installed in the Battery, such as the Staten Island Ferry Disaster Memorial Museum, a 2016 piece memorializing a fake octopus attack on the Staten Island Ferry, as well as a \\"UFO Tugboat Abduction Memorial\\" from the same sculptor as the ferry \\"memorial\\". At least ten monuments, including the Verrazzano, Coast Guard and Wireless memorials, were stored in the park behind a temporary fence from the mid-2000s until 2016. Controversy over the statues' integrity arose in 2015 after renovations took longer than expected. Representatives of NYC Park Advocates and the Italian-American organization UNICO expressed concern about the statues' condition, although experts said there should be no long-term physical harm. The monuments have since been installed in or around the perimeter of the park, although not necessarily in their previous locations. Prior to the restoration, which cost $875,000, some of the monuments had not been restored for 60 years. Surroundings =Around the park= To the northwest of the park lies Battery Park City, a planned community built on landfill in the 1970s and 1980s, which includes Robert F. Wagner Park and the Battery Park City Promenade. Battery Park City, proposed in 1966, was named after the park. Battery Park contains the Battery Bikeway, a component piece of the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway, a system of parks, bikeways, and promenades around Manhattan Island. The bicycle path was completed in late 2015 and consists of terracotta pavings near the waterfront, adjacent to a pedestrian walkway. The bikeway contains three connections to other parts of the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway: * A bike path originates on the northern side of the Battery and runs parallel to the West Side Highway to its west. North of Battery Park City, the bikeway continues into Hudson River Park, which extends up the Hudson River shoreline. * Another bike path exits the Battery from the northwest and runs directly on the shore of the Hudson River through Battery Park City. * At the Battery's southeast end, the bikeway continues as the East River Greenway, which runs next to FDR Drive. Across State Street to the northeast is Bowling Green, as well as the old U.S. Customs House, now used as a branch of the National Museum of the American Indian and the district U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Peter Minuit Plaza abuts the southeast end of the park, directly in front of the Staten Island Ferry's Whitehall Terminal at South Ferry. =Under the park= Battery Park control house, a landmark subway entrance at the edge of the park, which provides an entrance to the Bowling Green subway station The Battery is surrounded by several pieces of transportation infrastructure: * The Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel, opened 1950, carries vehicular traffic to Brooklyn. * The Battery Park Underpass, opened 1951, carries vehicular traffic from the West Side Highway to the FDR Drive. * At the New York City Subway's old South Ferry station, opened 1905, the former Interborough Rapid Transit Company's Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue and Lexington Avenue Lines have a balloon loop to enable trains to turn around and switch between the two lines. It closed in 2009 following the opening of a replacement subway station, but was temporarily placed back into operation between April 2013 and June 2017. * The South Ferry subway station on the Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line (), opened 2009, created a new free connection with the BMT Broadway Line's Whitehall Street station (), which was formerly a separate station. The two stations comprise the South Ferry/Whitehall Street subway complex.New and Old Downtown: Wall Street and South Ferry. Forgotten NY. Retrieved June 11, 2014. The new Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line station was closed and sustained severe damage following Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. The new station did not reopen until 2017, during which time the old loop station was used. * The Bowling Green subway station, opened 1905 and serving the , is at the northeast corner of the park. Its original entrance, or \\"Control House\\", is an official city-designated landmark. Tracks leading south of the station go to both the old South Ferry station and to the Joralemon Street Tunnel, which skirts the park before traveling under the East River. Discovery of wall alt= In late 2005, New York City authorities announced that builders working on the new South Ferry station had found a remnant of a stone wall dating to at least the 18th century. After archeological analysis, the wall was widely reported to be the oldest man-made structure still in place in Manhattan. Four walls and over 250,000 individual artifacts were found, and a portion of one wall was placed on temporary display inside Castle Clinton. Another, long portion of the wall was embedded permanently into the entrance to the newly constructed station, at the same depth below street level as originally discovered. Robert Tierney, chairman of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, said that the wall was probably built to protect the park's original artillery batteries. The remains were described as \\"an important remnant of the history of New York City\\".

Hospitals of Hope‚Äôs goal is to use medicine as a vehicle into the hearts of people, to demonstrate Christ‚Äôs love by showing the value of each person they care for. Hospitals of Hope sends medical, dental, and general volunteers, as well as students at various levels in their training, to serve at the Hospitals of Hope hospital in Vinto, Bolivia and in other countries, such as Liberia and Haiti. Hospitals of Hope also manufactures Clinic In A Can, self-contained medical clinics built in shipping containers.  History  Hospitals of Hope began was founded by Michael Wawrzewski, after he took a number of mission trips overseas where he saw that many around the world lack basic medical care and died from preventable or treatable diseases. In 1998, Michael and others started Hospitals of Hope in Wichita, Kansas. Originally, the organization focused solely on Bolivia, beginning with a small, free clinic and expanding to a 32-bed hospital. Hospitals of Hope‚Äôs work expanded to Haiti in 2004 with the development of the Clinic In A Can ‚Äî a self-contained clinic built in a shipping container. Since January 2010's earthquake, Hospitals of Hope has sent six more Clinics in a Can to Haiti and three to Southern Sudan. In 2008, Hospitals of Hope began work in Liberia, West Africa, partnering with John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Monrovia. Since 2008, Hospitals of Home has sent over $1.1 million of medical equipment and supplies to Liberia and has developed a partnership with ELWA (Eternal Love Winning Africa) Hospital, where they send volunteers year-round. In March 2013, Hospitals of Hope sent a radiology Clinic in a Can to Sierra Leone.  Clinic In A Can  Clinic in a can. A Clinic In A Can is a self-contained medical clinic built in a shipping container. These clinics are built in the US and shipped around the world, providing an important resource for medical relief in the face of disaster or in areas with poor infrastructure. The typical Clinic In A Can consists of two exam rooms, a laboratory, and a mechanical room with a generator and water system. Clinics can be modified to contain a dental room, a radiology suite, or a surgical suite. The first Clinic in a Can was sent to Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Hospitals of Hope has constructed ten Clinic In A Cans total. Seven clinics for use in Haiti and three will be sent to Southern Sudan. The most recent projects were actually making two small hospitals, made of three shipping containers each, for use in Haiti and Southern Sudan.Medical Mission Centres made from Shipping Containers  Bolivia  Hospitals of Hope in Bolivia. After its founding in 1998, Hospitals of Hope began work in and around Cochabamba, Bolivia. In those early years, their efforts were directed at providing medical care in a small clinic in Vinto, Bolivia. Hospitals of Hope broke ground for its new hospital in Vinto, Bolivia in January 2003. The Bolivian hospital is currently the primary site where volunteers are sent, both medical and non-medical. Hospitals of Hope has sent over 1700 volunteers on short-term missions to Bolivia, who assist the staff in caring for patients, as well as doing construction and community outreach.  Haiti  Hospitals of Hope in Haiti. Les Cayes, Haiti is the home of the original Clinic In A Can‚Äîa self-contained medical/dental clinic built in the back of a 48‚Äô semi-trailer donated to Hospitals of Hope by the Love Box Company. Hospitals of Hope built more Clinics in a Can in response to Haiti's January 2010 earthquake. The idea for a Clinic In A Can was born after hearing a story from a Kenyan man whose sister had died on the way to the hospital during her first pregnancy. She had come home to have her first baby, as is customary in Kenya. While home, she began running a fever, and the family decided to take her to the nearest hospital, which was ten miles away. Taking their only method of transportation, the family took turns pushing and pulling their ailing relative in a wheelbarrow. Somewhere between her village and the hospital, she died. This story inspired Hospitals of Hope‚Äôs founder, Michael Wawrzewski, to find a solution, and the solution that he found was the Clinic In A Can ‚Äî a clinic that could be built in Wichita and then shipped anywhere in the world. Hospitals of Hope partnered with Jean Eustache, a Wichita nurse born and raised in Haiti, to send the Clinic In A Can to Les Cayes. Two of Hospitals of Hope‚Äôs long-time supporters, Kyle Stevens and Myron Smith, headed up this daunting task and, after two years of design and one year of construction, the first Clinic In A Can was completed. Since then, Hospitals of Hope has built several more Clinics in a Can, which contain exam rooms, a laboratory, a generator, and a water system, making them fully self-contained.  Liberia  Hospitals of Hope founder Mike Wawrzewski in Liberia. Hospitals of Hope is committed to helping bring change in Liberia, through sending essential equipment, training hospital staff, and providing patient care. In its first two years of working in Liberia, Hospitals of Hope primarily focused on JFK Medical Center in Monrovia, Liberia, the main government hospital in this country of 3.5 million people. When Hospitals of Hope began work there, JFK was in need of basic equipment, but Hospitals of Hope has donated $1.1 million of medical equipment to JFK, greatly increasing its capacity to effectively treat patients. Since then, Hospitals of Hope has shifted its focus to ELWA (Eternal Love Winning Africa), a well-respected and established ministry, which has been at work in Liberia since the 1950s and began as a ministry of SIM (then Sudan Interior Mission). Although ELWA offers quality care and has great plans for the future, the hospital is in dire need. With only 1 doctor for every 28,000 people in Liberia, ELWA is swamped with patients, and their limited resources are stretched thin. Hospitals of Hope is partnering with ELWA to help meet these needs. In the summers of 2010 and 2011, Hospitals of Hope sent volunteer teams to work at ELWA. In early 2011, Hospitals of Hope partnered with the Brother's Brother Foundation to send necessary equipment to the hospital. Hospitals of Hope is also helping ELWA make plans to expand the existing hospital. The current ELWA Hospital was built in 1965 and is too small and out-of-date to meet the needs of the community.

Subsequently, other stars began utilizing Simpson as well. Finally, after learning of his assistance, the show‚Äôs producers asked him to take the lead on writing the show. By the time the show was cancelled, Simpson had already compiled enough quotes to publish the first version of his quote compendiums in 1957 under the title Best Quotes of ‚Äô54, ‚Äô55, ‚Äô56.‚ÄúLifetime of Research Leads to New Edition of Father Simpson‚Äôs Favorite Quotes. The Georgetown Letter, Vol. 2, No. 2, March 1991  Priesthood and quote collection  Following the publication of Best Quotes, Simpson wrote a series of pieces on modern spiritual leaders for Look magazine. This project was followed by a biography he authored in 1962 on Michael Ramsey, the 100th Archbishop of Canterbury, which was listed among the 200 best books of that year.New York Times. \\"James B. Simpson Obituary.\\" Through writing the book, Simpson‚Äîwho had wanted to attend the seminary ever since college but ultimately resolved to move to New York‚Äîfelt a higher calling and finally left his career as a journalist at 38 to enroll in the Nashotah House seminary to become an Episcopal priest.The Georgetown Letter. Nashotah House offers a rigorous core curriculum, including Hebrew and Greek, combined with an emphasis on the life of prayer and a demanding community life. As the late librarian of Congress Daniel J. Boorstin put it, the experiences of his early life ‚Äúfinally inspired him to still another view of the immortal word, and he became an Episcopal priest.‚ÄùWalker. It was the second edition of his Contemporary Quotations anthology which provided him with the funds to enter the seminary in 1964. After graduating and becoming ordained in 1967, he served as curate for Christ's Church in Rye, New York and as rector for Christ Church in Middletown, New Jersey and became an editor for The Anglican Digest and the director of the Episcopal Book Club. Despite his duties and commitment to the priesthood, he retained a strong appreciation for journalism. A voracious reader, he turned his analytical eye to the words of others, always looking out for an interesting, meaningful, or unique phrase. In his search for quotes, he would read eight daily newspapers, seven weekly magazines, and a dozen monthlies.Sanoff, Alvin P. ‚ÄúQuotations, familiar and otherwise.‚Äù U.S. News & World Report, June 6, 1988 In any given day, he would usually find about eight or ten quotes of interest that he would choose to save.Wilson, Craig. ‚ÄúQuote collector gathers pearls of wisdom into book.‚Äù USA Today, July 22, 1997 On choosing the most notable quotations, he would highlight his favorite sayings and then let them sit for a week or two before taking another look. Upon a second examination, if he still felt they were worthy of posterity, he would then catalog the story from which the quote was taken by clipping the article from the publication and storing it in a binder as well as noting its source, date and context in his computer. In addition, he thoroughly scrutinized every quote even more before adding it to the published editions of his books. Specifically, Simpson wanted to avoid the inclusion of a quote that would lose its significance in the future, so he was fond of saying that he would let quotes ‚Äúmarinate in time‚Äù for six months to a year to judge their lasting quality, saying that, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a certain news judgment involved to know a good quote. You have to ask if it is said originally and whether it will still be valued in 10 to 15 years. I won‚Äôt put any quote in immediately. I have to wait to see if it holds up to the test of time.‚ÄùWilson. He took his quotes, according to a 1997 article in The Christian Science Monitor, from not only newspapers but weekly and monthly magazines and the transcripts of 60 Minutes, 20/20, Dateline NBC, Primetime, and Sunday morning talk show broadcasts. In fact, at home he would even place a tape recorder near his television so that he was always at the ready to capture notable words. Simpson later moved to Washington, D.C. in 1988 in order to facilitate his quotation collecting and research. Nevertheless, he still remained equally committed to his priestly duties by heading the congregation at the Church of Ascension and Saint Agnes as well as serving the parishes of All Souls Church and St. Paul‚Äôs Episcopal Church on K Street and providing ecumenical services as a chaplain for The Georgetown, a retirement residence. In fact, Simpson felt that his work as a priest and his penchant for collecting quotations were symbiotically intertwined in saying that, ‚ÄúIt helps make my sermons more interesting. It helps me be aware of trends in medicine and lifestyles. It helps me be involved in the world, so I‚Äôm not just a priest.‚ÄùWebber. Of the most notable quotes he had compiled in his career, Simpson‚Äôs personal favorites included one by the novelist, Graham Greene: ‚ÄúWhen a train pulls into a great city, I am reminded of the closing moments of an overture‚Äù one from the Bible, Ecclesiasticus 39: ‚ÄúHe that giveth his mind ‚Ä¶ will keep the sayings of the renowned, and where subtle parables are, he will be there also. He will seek the secrets of grave sentences and be conversant in dark parables‚ÄùShiffman. and one by Albert Camus: ‚ÄúIn the depth of winter I finally learned that within me lay an invincible summer.‚ÄùSanoff  Contemporary Quotations  For more than 40 years, the Rev. James B. Simpson saw as his mission the documentation of the words of leaders, thinkers, journalists, social activists, artists, and pundits. He fulfilled that mission with great success, becoming the author of Simpson‚Äôs Contemporary Quotations, a book series of multiple editions which contain a collection of the best quotations of the modern era, particularly of the past fifty years. Simpson wrote that Contemporary Quotations picks up after James Bartlett's Familiar Quotations (first published in 1855) in that seeks to capture the important quotes of our time as, or before, they become classics. He chose quotes for his book based on their uniqueness, for how they stood out within a context, and the likeliness that they would have lasting power. One of the most important elements of his quotes, he wrote, was that they were accessible to his readers. This, he felt, was something that made Simpson's Contemporary Quotations unique. He also found the historical and societal context of quotes important. While other authors in this genre wrote books to locate the precise form of the quotes of the ancients and the literary classics, Simpson, with his journalist‚Äôs sensibility, had another plan. His idea was to tell use quotations to tell what contemporaries were saying as they said it. He wanted to portray their words in the pure, stark readable language of the day so that readers could properly assess, not only the words, but perhaps the character behind them. At a time when words are often lost amid modern-day images and spin, Simpson sought to help make sense of the world by creating Contemporary Quotations as a means of holding them safely in time for closer examination. Simpson‚Äôs Contemporary Quotations is a series of books compiled and edited by Simpson beginning in 1957, followed up by subsequent publications in 1964 and 1988 and finally with the last edition being published by HarperCollins in 1997.HarperReference News Release, \\"Simpson‚Äôs Contemporary Quotations.\\" The following titles are among the various editions in the series, including: Best Quotes, Simpson‚Äôs Contemporary Quotations: The Most Notable Quotes, 1950-1988 and Simpson‚Äôs Contemporary Quotations: The Most Notable Quotes From 1950 to the Present. Simpson had many friends in the literary, journalistic, and religious worlds, and he got fan mail from around the world for his books of quotations. He was listed in \\"Who's Who in America\\" in the 1990s. Hobbies Aside from his collection of over 200 books on quotations, Simpson had a passion for other items. He was an avid collector of old-fashioned \\"mustache cups\\", miniature busts of famous individuals who he felt were the best speakers of the time and was a self-proclaimed ‚Äúamateur collector‚Äù of Biedermeier furniture‚Äîa form of German furniture for the ‚Äúcommon man.‚Äù While living in Washington, Fr. Simpson also became a member of the Cosmos Club.  Death and legacy  Near the end of Simpson‚Äôs life, he offered his will and estate, to his alma mater, Northwestern University, which turned it down. Subsequently, he made the same offer to American University located in Washington, D.C. in 1997. As a resident of Cathedral Heights, he noted that choosing American for the gift seemed natural since the university was located in his neighborhood and he had always felt welcome in its academic community through his interactions with faculty members, visits to the library, and guest lectures on the importance of quotes in journalism. The bequest included $350,000 to fund the continuation of his mission for quotation collection as well as the valuable copyright to Father Simpson‚Äôs personal collection of quotes-more than 22,000 from the second half of the 20th century-and a collection of busts of famous quote-makers. In accordance with Simpson‚Äôs will, at his death in March 2002, American University now hosts the Simpson Room on the fourth floor of the School of Communication. It also serves as the headquarters for the Simpson Fellowship, awarded each year by the School of Communication.

It was first broadcast in the United States on Starz on 9 September 2011. Torchwood: Miracle Day follows the aftermath of a day where humanity has stopped being able to die. In the episode, a team called Torchwood seek to stop the \\"Miracle\\" affecting humanity's ability to die, which is engineered by a group of human families seeking to control the world. In 2012, creator Russell T Davies announced that the show will be on indefinite hiatus, citing personal reasons, making \\"The Blood Line\\" the show's overall series finale. Plot summary Now aware that Jack's blood is drawn towards the Blessing, the Torchwood team uses small amounts of the blood to determine headings towards the two sites. Rex and Esther contact the CIA for assistance in infiltrating the Buenos Aires site of the Blessing, at the same time keeping Jack, Gwen, and Oswald's presence in Shanghai a secret. Director Shapiro agrees to the request and puts his team on the task, including Charlotte, who surreptitiously reports the mission to the Three Families. A detachment of the Argentinian Army under the command of Captain Federico Santos soon arrives to assist Rex and Esther, but while the group is loading up, a Three Families double agent detonates a suicide bomb, making the other soldiers Category 1 and destroying Rex and Esther's supply of Jack's blood. Rex, Esther, and Captain Santos survive unharmed, and Rex tells Santos to report that he and Esther were killed in the blast in order to better allow them to infiltrate the Blessing site. At the CIA, Director Shapiro realizes the Three Families mole must be inside his team, and has Noah run a newly developed trace program to track any recent phone calls made using the Three Families' method of avoiding traces. Realizing she is moments from being discovered, Charlotte calmly retrieves a hidden explosive device from a side office, leaves it inside her purse in the main meeting room, and leaves. The resulting explosion 'category 1s' Shapiro and the rest of his team and lightly injures Charlotte, shielding her from any suspicion. Jack, Gwen, and Oswald successfully infiltrate the Shanghai Blessing site and make their way to its exposed face, where they meet the Mother, Jilly Kitzinger, and several armed guards. The guards quickly stand down when Oswald reveals he is wearing an explosive vest (at Jack's suggestion). This advantage seems short-lived when a radio transmission from the Cousin at the Buenos Aires site reveals that Three Families operatives there have captured Esther and Rex, but when Oswald expresses that he didn't expect to leave Shanghai alive, the operatives temporarily stand down. After spending some time examining the face of the Blessing, deducing that it generates a morphic field linking the human race, Jack and Gwen question the Mother about the Miracle; she reveals that the Miracle was produced by introducing Jack's immortal blood to the Blessing- causing it to disperse immortality to the whole human race as a 'defence' to a perceived 'attack'-, and furthermore is simply the first part in a larger plan to assert control of the world. By stopping death and destabilizing the economy, the Families are now poised to take control of the banks, thereby influencing the world governments, eventually leading to a fascist oligarchy which can \\"decide who lives, how long, where, and why.\\" When Jack moves to open his veins and release his blood into the Blessing (reasoning that his now-mortal blood would 'prompt' the Blessing to restore humanity's ability to die), the Mother stops him, explaining that this will not undo the Miracle, because the original effect required Jack's blood to be introduced at both Blessing sites simultaneously. Since Rex and Esther's supply of Jack's blood was destroyed, there is no way to do this, and the Mother orders all of Torchwood killed. Before this can happen, Rex manages to interrupt and claims that he still has some of Jack's blood with him‚Äîor rather in him. Upon arrival in Buenos Aires, Esther helped Rex transfuse almost all of Jack's blood into his body, which he notes only did not kill him because of the Miracle. The Mother counters that reversing the Miracle would require almost all of the blood in both Rex and Jack's bodies, which would likely kill at least one of them once the Miracle reverted, but Rex and Jack do not back down. The Cousin then shoots Esther, telling Rex that by undoing the Miracle he will now be killing Esther forever. Rex falters, torn by his feelings for Esther, but after reassurances from Jack and Gwen he rises and opens the wound over his heart, releasing Jack's blood into the Blessing. Simultaneously Gwen shoots Jack through the heart, releasing his blood as well. The Miracle reverts almost immediately, accompanied by an effect which Gwen calls \\"a breath\\": all of the world's Category 1 patients regain consciousness for a few seconds, then pass away in the next breath. This includes Gwen's father, who awakes in time to hear his wife wishing him goodbye over the phone. At the same time both of the Blessing sites begin to shake, making the structure around them unstable. Oswald grabs the Mother and urges Gwen to leave; she does, but as the exit elevator rises, Jack comes back to life. A brief struggle ensues between Jilly and Gwen before Gwen incapacitates Jilly, returns in the elevator and rescues Jack. The Mother begs Oswald to let her go, but Oswald proclaims he is happy to die and go to hell; as that is where \\"all the bad little girls\\" go. Jack and Gwen escape from the facility just seconds before Oswald detonates his explosives, destroying the Shanghai facility. Jilly follows close behind but falls to the ground, Jack and Gwen are unable to go back for her and she is engulfed in the explosion. The Buenos Aires team moves to leave as well, but before the Cousin can make it out, Rex regains consciousness long enough to grab him and throw him over the edge of the chasm around the Blessing. Rex falls to the ground next to Esther, the two watching each other die, but are rescued by Captain Santos and members of the Argentinian Army. Paramedics immediately start working to revive both Rex and Esther. Several months later, Jilly Kitzinger, having survived the destruction of the Shanghai facility, meets the Blue-Eyed Man at a familiar park bench. When she pleads that she has no place to go and no life to live, he offers her a chance to participate in the Three Families' \\"Plan B\\", then departs; after some delay, Jilly follows. Elsewhere, Gwen, Rhys, Jack, Charlotte and Rex attend a funeral for Esther. Afterward, as Charlotte is leaving, Rex receives recovered data from Noah's computer, and discovers the phone trace indicating that Charlotte is the mole. When Rex tries to stop her from leaving, Charlotte shoots him and is almost immediately gunned down by other agents. Jack and Gwen rush to Rex's side only to find him without a pulse, dead, but seconds later Rex gasps and regains consciousness. As he opens his shirt a stunned Jack, Gwen, and Rhys watch in shock as Rex's wounds heal completely. Broadcast and reception When \\"The Blood Line\\" premiered in the U.S on 9 September 2011, it received an audience of 0.95 million. In the UK, it fared relatively well against the viewing figure drop after Torchwood: Children of Earth with a consolidated figure of 5.13 million. Very much like the rest of the 10-part series, \\"The Blood Line\\" garnered a mixed response from television critics and the Torchwood fan base. The Guardian's Dan Martin noted that Torchwood finally showed its best in the series finale \\"with explosions, bloodshed and forced philosophical standoffs at every turn.\\" Martin also comments that the story of Gwen's dad was closed with \\"class.\\" However, Den of Geek's Simon Brew was more hesitant, claiming it was 'an otherwise busy, but rarely brilliant finale. To be clear, I didn't hate it, nor do I have an urge to pour buckets of scorn on it. But I think it was one of the least interesting episodes in the series, for the most part. And as someone's who's enjoyed Miracle Day, that was a disappointment.' On a positive note, he did also say in regards to the open-ended cliffhanger, ' Torchwood has been very good at burning bridges at the end of its series, with finales that force the show to move to a new place for the following run.' In a negative review for Uproxx, Alan Sepinwall said 'the season was too far gone for the finale to do much in the way of redeeming it, but we at least could have gone out on an interesting note. Instead, there were lots of explosions, lots of yelling, and very little that held my attention or made me feel anything in the way that, say, some of the sacrifices in \\"Children of Earth\\" did.' He also criticised the effect of the cliffhanger, saying 'so it turns out that this huge world- changing event was just a \\"trial run\\" for an even bigger plan on the part of the bad guys? Does anyone (other than Davies) think that what the series needs is to get even bigger?'

It was built for the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company and is the oldest extant railway bridge over the Yarra River. Completed in 1861, Hawthorn Railway Bridge was designed by Francis Bell. The opening had been delayed due to delays in completion of the bridge with the original iron trusses having been lost at sea. With a span of about , it was one of the last major items of permanent way to be built on the fledgling railway. The contractors were George Cornwell and Co (not Goldsack & Co as recorded in Leo Harrigan's history of Victorian railways). Cornwell had previously been involved as contractor in many other major construction works including the Melbourne and Suburban Railway as a whole, as well as Melbourne Grammar School, the Model School, Coppin's Haymarket Theatre, and the Sunbury railway goods shed. Subsequently, he was a contractor on Parliament House, Albert Park Station, Jack's Magazine and the Wallaby Creek water supply. It is likely that Alexander Kennedy Smith, who had designed the Cremorne Railway Bridge for the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Co, was also involved in the design of the Hawthorn Bridge, but was perhaps out of his depth. He ordered trusses which were inadequate for the job, and had to shorten them, suggesting he did not understand the design. The opening of the bridge on 13 April 1861 allowed the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company to extend its line from Pic Nic railway station (east of Burnley) to Hawthorn.Allom Lovell & Assocs. Yarra Heritage Review The earliest views of the bridge show it to consist of a deck lattice girder with five intersects. The main span over the river was flanked by segmental stone arch spans on either side. The bridge was duplicated in 1882 by the Railways Construction Branch, and minor works to the bearings and girder ends were made in 1887‚Äì8 to lower the levels of its girders by . A new double-track bridge using large double Warren trusses was built on its north side in 1912. One of the previous wrought iron lattice trusses was left in place. The bridge was extended westwards in 1938‚Äì39 when a new span was added to cross the Yarra Boulevard, which was constructed by sustenance workers during the Depression as a scenic drive. In 1971, the original piers were strengthened and a metal girder span added to accommodate a third track.

The IdeaPad S10 was initially scheduled for launch in September, but its release was delayed in the United States until October. The S series began with the IdeaPad S10, the lowest cost model, powered by an Intel Atom processor in a 10.2-inch subnotebook. Later, more expensive laptops in the S-series also powered by Intel Atoms were released. Once the Atom CPU line was discontinued, the main line of lightweight S series laptops switched to alternatives, such as the low-power AMD A-series, Intel Celeron, Pentium, and low-cost versions of Y-series CPUs. 2008 The IdeaPad S10, the first laptop in the IdeaPad S Series of netbooks, was released in 2008. = S10 = The IdeaPad S10 was Lenovo's first netbook. While Engadget found the design unremarkable, the low starting price was well-received. The S10 featured a TFT active matrix 1024√ó576 or 1024√ó600 display with an 80 or 160 GB hard disk drive and 512 MB or 1 GB DDR2 Random Access Memory, both of which could be upgraded via a trap door on the bottom of the netbook. The initial S10 featured 512 MB of RAM soldered to system board with an expansion SO-DIMM slot for further upgrades to 2 or 2.5 GB (2.5 GB was only usable with an operating system with support for sparse memory regions). The processor was an Intel Atom that ran at 1.6 GHz. The S10 supported IEEE 802.11 b/g wireless networking and had two USB ports, an ExpressCard expansion slot, a 4-in-1 media reader, and a VGA output. These computers received positive consumer reviews and a 9/10 rating from Wired magazine. In May 2009 Lenovo introduced the S10-2. While the S10-2 shared many traits with the S10/S10e, it omitted the ExpressCard34 slot, featured a new physical design, added an additional USB port, and enlarged the keyboard, touchpad, and sizes of the hard drive and SSD. 2009 The IdeaPad S Series netbooks released by Lenovo in 2009 were the S10e, S10-2, and the S12. =S10e= The IdeaPad S10e was a re-launch of the IdeaPad S10, with features updated for the education market. The netbook included a quick start operating system and 5 hours of battery life at a low starting price. It weighed 2.8 lbs, with a form factor of 9.8 x 7.7 x 0.9‚Äì1.4-inches. The netbook offered a wide keyboard occupying almost the entire width of the chassis, and LAPTOP Magazine reported that it was easy for even adults to type on. =S10-2= The IdeaPad S10-2 was a 10-inch netbook with a 1.6 GHz Intel Atom processor, 1GB RAM, a 6-cell battery, and Intel GMA Integrated Graphics. Notebook Review reported that the netbook's design offered \\"a cleaner and smoother appearance all around\\".

It was criticized for its navigation experience, touchpad, low capacity hard drive, and the lack of options for customization. Michael Prospero from LAPTOP Magazine indicated in his review that Lenovo had addressed some of the issues raised about the S10-2 netbook and praised the keyboard and the design. He also indicated that the storage capacity was not on par with competitor offerings and that the touchpad could have been improved. =S10-3t= The IdeaPad S10-3t was a netbook that was also a convertible tablet. The S10-3t netbook was among the first computers to use the 1.83 GHz Intel Atom N470 processor.

J. Winkler Productions, and features Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Plot summary One day at the Swiss mountains, Oswald is milking a goat which runs away upon being called by another one passing by. As Oswald's goat jumps out of the scene, the bucket used is kicked off and ends up on the rabbit's head. Oswald struggles to remove the pail but is able to get it off on time when he stumbles. Just then, his faithful St. Bernard dog comes to him, carrying a message. The message is a distress note from the girl cat seeking Oswald's help. Oswald and the dog move forth and head upland. Obstacles on the way include large rocks and a canyon, both of which they get through with little trouble. After a few more paces, they find the girl cat up a cliff and hanging onto a branch. To reach her, they stick a ladder on top of a boulder. Oswald climbs up and collects the feline. It turns out momentarily that the boulder is in fact a wolverine which wakes up and isn't happy to see them. Frightened by this, the dog runs off, carrying the ladder with Oswald and the girl cat still on it. Keeping away from the fierce predator, the three friends run into a cave. When they reach the entrance, they find themselves on an edge thousands of feet above water. They then move further from the exit and around the mount to hide themselves. The wolverine also enters the cave but is unaware of what lies ahead, and therefore picks up speed. As a consequence, the wolverine overshoots off the edge and plunges into the sea. Oswald and the girl cat ride the dog on their way back.

It is found in coastal areas of northwest Europe at depths down to 50 metres. Description The base of S. elegans is wider than the column and may reach in diameter. The base is usually anchored to the substrate but can be used as a foot for locomotion. It often has a ragged outline due to fragmentation having occurred. The column is soft and fleshy and varies in shape, even in one individual, from squat to cylindrical or trumpet shaped, and can grow up to tall. The lower part of the column is somewhat corrugated and there are a number of pale coloured suckers on the upper part to which grit or shell fragments may adhere occasionally. The disc is saucer-shaped with an undulating margin and there are up to 200 tentacles arranged irregularly, often arching over the edge. These are mostly about the same length but occasionally there is a much longer one among them. This may be used, as it is in some other sea anemone species, to prevent competing organisms from settling and occupying space nearby.

If disturbed it will retract more completely, disappearing from view if it is lodged in a crevice.Sagartia elegans Marine Species Identification Portal. Retrieved 2011-09-06. There are a number of differently coloured varieties: * Var. miniata: Disc variously coloured and patterned with similar coloured tentacles, often banded. * Var. rosea: Disc variously coloured and patterned and tentacles rose red. * Var. aurantiaca: Disc grey and tentacles dull orange. * Var. nivea: Disc and tentacles translucent white. * Var. venusta: Disc orange or buff and tentacles white. Distribution S. elegans is found in coastal areas of the northeast Atlantic Ocean from Scandinavia, Iceland and the North Sea south to the Mediterranean Sea. It is common round the coasts of the British Isles where the form var. miniata is the most abundant. In the Netherlands the population fluctuates widely, with decreases occurring after severe winters with cold sea temperatures. Habitat S. elegans is found from the mid-shore down to a depth of about 50 metres. Its base is often in holes and cracks in the rock and it is also found under stones, beneath overhangs, in rock pools and caves. It also favours brightly lit rock walls with fast moving currents.Sagartia elegans British Marine Life. Retrieved 2011-09-06. Biology S. elegans is an omnivore, scavenger and predator. Most of its nourishment comes from the ingestion of small invertebrates which are caught by the tentacles and thrust into the mouth. The undigested fragments are later expelled through the mouth. S. elegans often reproduces asexually by fragmentation, also known as basal laceration. As it crawls across a rock surface, pieces of its base become detached and grow into new individuals. This gives rise to groups of sea anemones in close proximity to each other which have identical colourations. Ecology Other organisms found in the same habitat include the breadcrumb sponge, Halichondria panicea and the soft coral, Alcyonium digitatum. Venom Sponge gatherers in the Mediterranean Sea come in contact with these sea anemones as they collect sponges. This causes a burning and itching sensation followed by erythema and blisters, the symptoms of \\"sponge fishermen's disease\\". Individuals may also experience nausea, vomiting, fever, muscle spasms and collapse.

History  United Saurashtra (Kathiawar) State, 1948-56 = Formation as United State of Kathiawar = Saurashtra State was originally named the United State of Kathiawar. It was formed on 15 February 1948, from approximately 200 large and small Princely States of the colonial Baroda, Western India and Gujarat States Agency of the British raj territory under direct colonial rule. The name of State was given after the Kathiawar and Saurashtra region, both of which generally denote the same geographical region of lands on the main peninsula of Gujarat. The statesmanship of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and the influence of Mahatma Gandhi are credited for persuading most of the States of Kathiawar to join the Union of India and sign the Instrument of Accession. Patel devoted extraordinary time and effort to meet and convince the local princes and petty subas, totaling 222 in Saurashtra region alone. Among these in Kathiawar Agency were 14 Salute states, 17 minor and 191 petty Non-salute Princely States and 46 Estates (Jagir-level). Most of the native rulers of the Kathiawar States entered into a Covenant for the formation of the United States of Kathiawar on 24 January 1948.The Rulers of the Kathiawar States, including Wadhwan State, entered into a Covenant for the formation of the United States of Kathiawar on 24 January 1948.The covenant, entered into by the rulers of Kathiawar States for the formation of the United States of Kathiawar.Indian Philately The large Kathiawar peninsula included some prominent princely states of India, notably salute state : * the vast Baroda State, title Maharaja Gaekwar, Hereditary salute of 21-guns (highest native rank in colonial India) * Idar, title Maharaja, Hereditary salute of 15-guns * Bhavnagar State, title Maharaja, Hereditary salute of 13-guns (15-guns local) * Navanagar, title Maharaja Jam Sahib, Hereditary salute of 13-guns (15-guns local) * Dhrangadhra(-Halvad), title Maharaja Raj Sahib, Hereditary salute of 13-guns * Porbandar, title Maharaja Rana Sahib, Hereditary salute of 13-guns * Rajpipla State, title Rajpipla, Hereditary salute of 13-guns * Cambay, title Nawab, Hereditary salute of 11-guns * Gondal, title Maharaja, Hereditary salute of 11-guns * Morvi, title Maharan, Hereditary salute of 11-guns * Wankaner, title Maharana Raj Sahib, Hereditary salute of 11-guns * Baria, title Maharaol, Hereditary salute of 9-guns (11-guns personal) * Dharampur, title Raja, Hereditary salute of 9-guns (11-guns personal) * Dhrol, title Thakore Sahib, Hereditary salute of 9-guns * Limbdi, title Thakore Sahib, Hereditary salute of 9-guns * Palitana, title Thakore Sahib, Hereditary salute of 9-guns * Rajkot, title Thakore Sahib, Hereditary salute of 9-guns * Sachin, title Nawab, Hereditary salute of 9-guns * Wadhwan, title Maharana, Hereditary salute of 9-guns and many smaller non-salute-states, including petty (e)states, often not more than one or two villages, making the peninsula the most fragmented of feudal age India. Among the States of Kathiawar, Baroda State -which was the third largest Princely state of India, having its territories scattered over Dwarka in West of Kathiawar to Bombay in South- did not sign the covenant for the formation of the United States of Kathiawar. Instead the erstwhile Gaekwar Maharaja of Baroda, Pratap Singh Gaekwad declared a full responsible Government on 4 September 1948, under Jivraj Narayan Mehta, as Prime Minister of the State, as per scheme envisioned by Sardar Patel. The Baroda State later merged itself into Bombay State on 1 May 1949.Baroda State - responsible government[ Baroda' s merger into Bombay on 1-5-1949 was an event which Sardar built brick by brick...Sardar Patel, in tune with the millions, Volume 2Baroda State Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel inaugurated the United State of Kathiawar on 15 February 1948. On this occasion he paid tribute to Jam Sahib and the other rulers of erstwhile Princely States of Kathiawar, saying :- The Jam Sahib K. S. Digvijaysinhji of Nawanagar State one of the chief negotiator from the side of rulers of Kathiawar in his reply observed and said :- Jawaharlal Nehru described the event as a great step forward and one of the most notable in contemporary Indian history. He further commended the statesmanship of Sardar Patel and further wrote in his letter to provincial chief ministers on 20 February 1948 :- Upon formation of United State of Kathiawar, Lord Mountbatten also congratulated Sardar Patel, saying :- However, it was sad that Mahatma Gandhi was not alive by that time to see his dream of whole of Kathiawar getting united under one umbrella. Even after creation of United States of Kathiawar, there were some patches of lands in Kathiawar belonging to princely states of Junagadh, Mangrol, Manavadar and others, which did not join the convention and were lingering over joining Pakistan. It was later after integration of Junagadh into Union of India that a referendum was held and Junagadh, Mangrol, Manavadar, Babariawad and others became a legal part of India. However, due to some technicalities, these territories even after referendum remained under an Executive Council of popular representatives of Junagadh led by Samaldas Gandhi, for some time, who assisted the administrator appointed by Government of India in managing affairs of these states. = Renamed Saurashtra = In November 1948, the United State of Kathiawar was renamed the United State of Saurashtra or Saurashtra State, when a supplementary covenant was negotiated and executed by the native rulers of the princely states merged into United State of Kathiawar. Once the Saurashtra Union came into existence, a second supplementary covenant was executed in January 1949, providing the integration of Junagadh with Saurashtra. A few days later on 20 February 1949, the administration of Junagadh State (another major salute state) and also that of Mangrol, Manavadar, Babariawad, Bantva and Sardargarh were officially handed over to Saurashtra Government. = Dissolution = On 1 November 1956 Saurashtra State ceased to exist as a State and became a part of Bombay State, the territory of which was enlarged on that day to include Kutch State, Saurashtra State, Marathwada & Vidarbha, while a southern portion was excluded, which went to Karnataka. Following Mahagujarat Movement, the Bombay State was again dissolved to be carved into two separate states of Maharashtra and Gujarat created on linguistic basis on 1 May 1960 With this, the area of Saurashtra State again became a geographically defined region, Saurashtra, within the State of Gujarat.

The mountains were once at the centre of the Kingdom of Derge and many remnant Tibetan Buddhist monasteries can be found in the mountain range's valleys. Etymology The Chinese transliteration of the Chola Mountains is Que Er Shan (). The Chola Mountains are named after the primary pass crossing the range, Cho La or Tro La. Cho La in Tibetan means Lake Pass. However, others claim, Chola is just another name for snow mountain, given by local Tibetans. Due to the Chinese transliteration of the mountains into Qu√®'√©r and its common usage on official maps, the mountain range is sometimes mistakenly translated into \\"Sparrow Mountains\\" or \\"Bird Mountains\\". Geology Located in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, the Chola Mountains are a result of uplift caused during the Indian subcontinent's collision with the Eurasian Plate. The Chola Mountains lie on the northeastern edge of a semi-independent tectonic block as part of the greater Eurasian Plate. The mountains range's abrupt northeastern edge is formed by the Ganzi segment of the Xianshuihe Fault where two blocks of the tectonic plate are experiencing strike-slip movement under stress. Geography The Chola Mountains run in a northwest to southeast direction with the ridgeline nearest to the range's northeastern edge. The highest peak, Rongme Ngatra, is above sea level. Other significant peaks include Dophu Ngatra (6,119m) and Zhiltr√∂n (5,988m). All three peaks have glaciers on their northern faces and the entire range possesses almost twelve glaciers in total with some descending as low as . The Chola Mountains form part of the drainage divide between the Upper Yangtze (Jinsha) and Yalong River watersheds. Major tributaries to the southwest include the Zhil Chu (), Pal Chu (), and Me Chu (), while the northeastern flanks possess the Tro Chu (). Numerous glacial-fed lakes have formed along the northeastern edge of the Chola Mountains, with Yihun Lhatso in the Tro Chu valley being the most notable. On the southwestern slopes and at lower elevations, the Chola Mountains are covered by sections of the Hengduan Mountains subalpine conifer forests. To the north and east, the Tibetan Plateau consists of montane grasslands and shrublands including the Southeast Tibet shrub and meadows ecoregion. Human activity The Chola Mountain's southwestern hills and valleys were historically at the heartland of the Derge Kingdom in the Kham region of Tibet. The kingdom's capital was Derge, located in the Zhil Chu valley of the Chola foothills. Cho La (Cho Pass) was an important link across the mountains, connecting Derge and central Tibet with the Garze and Sichuan basin regions. The Chola foothills possessed hundreds of monasteries until Chinese annexation in the 20th century. Many of these monasteries were associated with fringe branches of Tibetan Buddhism including Nyingma, Sakya, Kagyu, and the Rim√© movement. Today, major monasteries in the Chola Mountains' foothills and valleys include the Palpung Monastery, Gongchen Monastery, Dzongsar Monastery, and Dzogchen Monastery. Administratively, today the Chola Mountains are primarily within Dege County, Garze Prefecture, in Sichuan. A small portion of the mountains in the south pass into neighbouring Baiyu County. Derge remains as the primary urban centre in the mountain range, although the Pal Chu and Me Chu valleys also contain concentrations of villages. National Highway G-317, also known as the Northern Sichuan-Tibet Highway, crosses the range at above sea level via Cho La between Manigango and Derge. In 2016, the Chinese government completed construction of a new long tunnel bypassing the mountain pass and is the highest vehicular tunnel in the world.

He was killed outside his Portadown home during a feud with the rival Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), the breakaway organisation founded by former Mid-Ulster UVF commander Billy Wright after he and the Portadown unit of the Mid-Ulster Brigade were officially stood down by the Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership) in August 1996. Following Jameson's death, the feud between the UVF and LVF escalated into a series of retaliatory killings. These went on intermittently until the LVF disbanded in 2005. Early life and paramilitary career Richard Jameson was born in Portadown, County Armagh, Northern Ireland to a Protestant Church of Ireland family in about 1953, one of five sons. He had a twin brother, Stuart. He was married to Moira by whom he had three children: Glen, Wayne and Kirsty. A former reservist in the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) (1973-1981), he worked as a manager in the Jameson Group, a building firm which was a family-owned business. The building firm was regularly awarded government contracts to carry out work for the security forces and it was for this reason that Jameson's brother David lost a leg in a 1991 Provisional IRA bombing attack.\\"UVF suspect linked to police contract\\".

Retrieved 8 September 2011 It is not known exactly when he became a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) nor the leader of its Mid-Ulster Brigade. The Portadown unit of the Mid-Ulster Brigade had been officially stood down by the Brigade Staff in Belfast in August 1996 when it carried out an unauthorised sectarian killing while the UVF were on ceasefire. The Mid-Ulster Brigade's commander at the time, Billy Wright, was expelled from the UVF. He brazenly defied a Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC) order to leave Northern Ireland or face execution by establishing the breakaway Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF). Wright took most of the Portadown Mid-Ulster UVF with him.Taylor, Peter (1999). Loyalists. London: Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. pp.240-241 The units of the Mid-Ulster Brigade that remained loyal to the Brigade Staff continued to operate and Jameson became commander. He was said by The Guardian to have been a \\"staunch supporter of the Good Friday Agreement\\". Shooting death In the weeks prior to his killing, he was in a violent street altercation with LVF member Muriel Gibson, whom he accused of involvement in drugs and slapped forcefully in the face. This was followed by a fracas at the Portadown F.C. Social Club on 27 December 1999 where LVF members were commemorating the second anniversary of Billy Wright's fatal shooting inside the Maze Prison by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA). When Jameson entered the club several LVF men began to push and jostle him and challenged him to a fight; telling Jameson to hit them instead of women. Deeply offended, Jameson left and soon returned with a UVF gang armed with pickaxe handles and baseball bats. In the violent brawl that ensued, 12 people, including three LVF prisoners out on Christmas parole, received severe injuries. The LVF leaders subsequently made the decision that Jameson would pay for the attack with his life. One of the LVF members, who lived near Dungannon, got in touch with a family of north Belfast loyalists who had been members of the UVF but who had left after Wright's expulsion. From these former UVF members the LVF obtained the gun with which to shoot Jameson.Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack, UDA - Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror, Penguin Ireland, 2004, p. 313 On the evening of 10 January 2000, Jameson returned from work and drove his Isuzu Trooper jeep into the driveway outside his home on the Derrylettiff Road near Portadown. Waiting in ambush, a single gunman suddenly approached from the passenger side of the parked jeep. Before Jameson could emerge from the vehicle and with the engine still running, the gunman opened fire through the window with a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol and shot Jameson five times in the head and chest.\\"UVF Prepares Night of the Long Knives; Terrorist Group Plans Executions After Funeral of UVF Brigadier But 'No Claim No Blame Policy Means PUP Will Be Able to Stay in Assembly\\".

The RUC immediately began a murder inquiry. Within hours of the killing, the UVF Brigade Staff convened an emergency meeting at \\"the Eagle\\", their headquarters on the Shankill Road, where they compiled a list of all those they believed had been involved in Jameson's death and planned their retaliation against the LVF.

A month after Jameson's killing, two Protestant teenagers, Andrew Robb (19) and David McIlwaine (18), were savagely beaten and repeatedly stabbed to death in a country lane outside Tandragee, County Armagh by a local UVF gang. The young men were targeted by their UVF killers after they left a nightclub together in search of a party; they were believed to have been LVF members.Note: The double killing of Andrew Robb and David McIlwaine was not sanctioned by the UVF leadership in Belfast. However neither teenager was part of any paramilitary organisation and only Robb had tenuous links to the LVF. It was reported in the Belfast Telegraph that according to court hearings Robb had made disparaging remarks about Jameson's death. Two of the UVF men, Stephen Leslie Brown and Noel Dillon, were infuriated by the comments and afterwards Brown drove the victims to Druminure Road where he, Dillon and another man carried out the double killing.\\"Families weep as court hears graphic account of Tandragee murders\\".

Jim Cusack & Henry McDonald, UVF: Endgame, Poolbeg, 2008, p. 388 The tit-for-tat killings went on intermittently until 2005 when the UVF made a final assault against the LVF, leaving four members dead and the LVF leadership with no alternative but to order its military units to permanently disband. Richard Jameson's family persistently denied that he was a UVF leader and maintained that he was shot on account of the firm stand he had taken against drug dealers in the Portadown area. The late PUP leader David Ervine had expressed the same opinion the day after the killing by stating that \\"Mr. Jameson had been murdered by drug dealers masquerading as loyalists because he had been a bulwark in his community against dealers\\". Ervine had also described him as having been a \\"fine and honourable man, widely respected in the community\\". Northern Ireland security sources, however, named him as the Mid-Ulster UVF commander.

He also took the Marvel staff and freelancer photos published in Fantastic Four Annual #7 (cover-dated Nov. 1969). Lee invited him to submit story ideas, but Hewetson's writing style, heavily influenced by Edgar Allan Poe and other 19th-century authors, proved \\"highly unsuitable for Marvel superheroes\\", Hewetson said. He remained at his post from February to September 1969, and was succeeded as Lee's assistant by Allyn Brodsky, no relation to Sol Brodsky.

Hewetson and Shores did collaborate on Hewetson's one horror story for Marvel, the seven-page \\"Master and Slave\\" in Creatures on the Loose #12 (July 1971); this came after he had already begun writing uncredited stories for rival DC Comics and for the satirical magazines Sick and Cracked, and penning his first credited story, the 10-page \\"4 ‚Äì 3 ‚Äì 2 ‚Äì 1 ‚Äì Blast Off! to a Nightmare!\\", illustrated by Jack Sparling, in Warren Publishing's black- and-white horror-comics magazine Vampirella #3 (Jan. 1970).Al Hewetson at the Grand Comics Database That had come about, he said in 2003, when he was writing an article for Cinema magazine about comic-book characters in film: =Skywald= Hewetson went on to write a number of stories through mid-1971 issues of Warren's Creepy and Eerie, while also breaking in at the start-up rival Skywald Publications, with \\"Vault of a Vampire\\" in Nightmare #3 (April 1971). Skywald was co-founded in 1970 by Sol Brodsky, whom Hewetson knew from Marvel Comics, and who brought freelancer Hewetson in as associate editor; Hewetson's first credit as such appears in Psycho #7 (July 1972). By the following month, Brodsky had returned to Marvel, and Hewetson became Skywald's editor,Hewetson, Comic Book Artist, p. 57 managing editorial from his home in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. As he described the process, \\"The Horror- Mood\\" Soon afterward, Hewetson, both out of personal preference and in an attempt to distinguish Skywald's magazines from those of industry leader Warren, instituted a stylistic theme he called \\"Horror-Mood\\", going so far as to receive approval from publisher Israel Waldman to change the company name to Horror-Mood Publishing Corp. ‚Äî a move nixed by the low-budget company's accountant, who noted there would be legal costs incurred in a name change, which would also potentially confuse distributors.Hewetson, Comic Book Artist, p. 55 As Hewetson described the genesis and specifics of the Horror-Mood in 2003, it Hewetson estimates he wrote over 500 published stories for Skywald,Hewetson, Comic Book Artist, p. 47 using such pseudonyms as Joe Dentyn, Stuart Williams, Henry Bergman, Hugh Laskey, Harvey Lazarus and Howie Anderson, as well as Peter Cappiello, Edward Farthing, and Victor Buckley.

He successfully expanded to city magazines in Buffalo, New York, and Windsor, Ontario, the latter called Greater Windsor. By 2003, he and artist Pablo Marcos, a Skywald compatriot, were working on two graphic novels: Labyrinth Street, a horror anthology series set in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Suko: Samurai Time Warrior.

The play takes place on a sunny New England beach populated by four male-female character pairs. The oldest married couple in the play is Henden and Gertrude, aged 70 and 60 respectively. Each has a child from a previous marriage, and those two children form another couple: Daniel and Cordelia. A third, slightly younger married couple is Benjamin and Abigail. Benjamin and Daniel used to be together in a homosexual relationship, and their wives and parents are aware of this. The fourth pair is 45-year-old Edmee and her sixteen-year-old son, Fergus; they have never met the other characters before. Over the course of the play, Edmee and Fergus meet the other characters and learn of Benjamin and Daniel's history. The young wives struggle with their husbands' latent feelings for each other. Benjamin and Abigail have a tiff, and Benjamin seeks comfort with Daniel. Meanwhile Abigail tries to drown herself in the ocean and Henden dies sitting in his chair. =Characters= Source: Script * Abigail -- age 23, not pretty, not plain * Benjamin -- 30, blonde and handsome * Cordelia -- age 28, attractive in a cold way * Daniel -- age 37, good-looking * Edmee -- age around 45, stylish * Fergus -- age 16, swimmer's body * Gertrude -- age 60, \\"elegant outdoors woman\\" * Henden -- age 70, big, \\"looks like a retired diplomat\\" Critical response David Richards, in his review of the 1994 production for The New York Times, wrote: \\"It consists of the juxtaposed conversations of eight people at the beach -- two young men who were once lovers, and their wives; an older married couple, and a mother and her precocious son. The talk ranges from the difficulty of relationships to friendships, face lifts and the compromises life exacts of people. There's some speculation about the meaning of things. Then death happens right there on the shore. The lines can seem mannered, the plotting utterly random.... Viewed in light of the two preceding plays, as a fusion of the absurdism in 'Sandbox' and the rarefied musings of 'Box,' it appears far more sure of itself. A fugue on loneliness and love lost (or never found), it is clearly part of a continuum that also includes 'Seascape.'\\"Richards, David. \\"Review/Theater; 3 Albee One-Acters About People Boxed In\\" New York Times, February 10, 1994 Phyllis T. Dircks (professor of English at Long Island University in Greenvale, New York) observed that \\"critics...have sometimes lamented the lack of sharp characterization and conventional dramatic action, and the omission of a protagonist... There are no sustained bursts of wit, as ...in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ...no bursts of absurdist comedy, as in The American Dream. Finding the Sun has quite a different purpose, and Albee has satisfied his purpose in executing a precise and haunting study of loss.\\"Dircks, Phyllis T. \\"Finding the Sun\\", Edward Albee: A Literary Companion, McFarland, 2010, , p. 54 Notes References * Category:Plays by Edward Albee Category:1983 plays ","title":"Finding the Sun"},{"id":"33019637","text":"Megan Diane Langenfeld (born January 17, 1988) is an American softball coach and former pitcher.

Within DC Comics internal continuity, Batwing is one of several superheroes patterned after the famous superhero Batman. Batwing, in particular, was conceived by Batman as his crime-fighting counterpart overseas, 'the Batman of Africa'. The first Batwing is David Zavimbe, a Congolese police officer, created by writer Grant Morrison within the pages of Batman Incorporated prior to receiving his own eponymous series. Following later events within Batman Incorporated and Batwing, Zavimbe is replaced in the role by Luke Fox, an American mixed martial artist who had been Batman's first choice in the role, who is also the son of Batman's close associate Lucius Fox. Batwing faces a roster of adversaries ranging from international super villains to the Democratic Republic of Congo's corrupt police force. Batwing expands the DC Universe by taking place in Africa, making David Zavimbe both the first (in continuity) black Batman and one of the few characters headlining a series outside the United States. Publication history The character proper appears first in \\"Batman of Africa\\", in Batman Incorporated #5 (May 2011), written by Grant Morrison. He was designed by Chris Burnham, but was first drawn by Yanick Paquette. Batwing has since gained his own monthly ongoing series as part of the 2011 DC Universe reboot, featuring art by Ben Oliver and written by Power Girl and Justice League: Generation Lost writer Judd Winick. According to fellow Batman Incorporated artists, Chris Burnham told iFanboy that he designed the character first, while Paquette was the first to draw him in interiors. In line with Morrison's use of obscure continuity throughout his Batman stories, the character seems to be based visually on a minor character which appeared in Batman #250 in a story called \\"The Batman Nobody Knows\\". In this story, a young African-American boy tells his friends how he imagines Batman to be, and gives him the name \\"Batwings\\". Writing duo Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti took over the book starting with Batwing #19 (June 2013), to introduce a new Batwing, Luke Fox, unrelated to the previous one. The new Batwing character would no longer be the \\"Batman of Africa\\", but be more international, along with having more ties to Gotham City. Fictional character biography =David Zavimbe= David Zavimbe operates as Batwing who is a representative of Batman Incorporated from the city of Tinasha, within the Democratic Republic of Congo. When David Zavimbe was a young boy in Tinasha, his parents died of HIV/AIDS very early in his life.Batwing #1 (November 2011) Following the death of their parents, David, and his brother, Isaac, were taken from their orphanage and drafted as boy soldier prodigies, like many children his age, into General Keita's army known as the Army of the Dawn, for a war that ravaged his country. While many young boys were picked to join, the Zavimbe brothers shined above the rest with their ability to take orders and kill and garnered the name the Dragonflies. Due to their speed, dexterity, and prodigious ability to kill, General Keita promoted the boys into the ranks of his elite men. On Keita's path to power and domination, he orders the brothers to kill Okuru, one of Keita's major enemies.Batwing #2 (December 2011) They agree to sneak in and slit Okuru's throat, but Keita demands they torch the entire village to prevent any possible escape. Refusing to kill innocent women and children, Isaac shoots his gun in the air, giving Okuru and his squadron time to fire shots back, forcing Keita to retreat. The General cannot stand for any insubordination and while he is arguing with David, Isaac hits him over the head with a rock. Keita reaches for his machete and slices Isaac multiple times; all the while, David is sprinting away.Batwing #4 (February 2012) Later that night, David sneaks into Keita's room and drugs him before he can make a move. Eventually, Keita comes to be tied up in the back of an SUV. David says he will not kill any longer and drops Keita outside of Okuru's new encampment, while firing shots in the air to notify them. After General Keita's death, David spends the next few days walking to the Children's Harbor, an orphanage for former child soldiers. David was able to escape the life of being a soldier at such a young age, and soon became a police officer in Tinasha, where despite corruption running rampant, he remained dedicated to the law and justice. Elsewhere in the United States, Bruce Wayne announces Batman Incorporated, an initiative to put Batman-like figures in countries all across the world. Soon after that, Batman pays a visit to Tinasha, where he inducts David as the newest member of his team in his quest to stop the global terrorists, Leviathan.Batman Incorporated #4 (April 2011)Batwing #8 (June 2012) Shortly after finding the false Dr. Dedalus and coming into confrontation with Leviathan yet again, Batman travels to an unknown destination within the continent of Africa to recruit a new member to his team of Batmen, Batman Incorporated. Batman leads David through his first mission for Batman Incorporated, providing a technologically advanced bat-suit. David comes into contact with a Leviathan brain-washing cell, narrowly avoiding capture once his presence is compromised. During his escape, he demonstrated a knowledge of martial arts, also showing off special capabilities of his bat-suit including jet propulsion.Batwing #10 (August 2012) Batwing faces off against a new villain calling himself Massacre. As Massacre gets the upper hand in battle against Batwing, we see a flashback of Batwing stopping Blood Tiger, a former captain of a warlord and now in control of a drug ring. With the help of Batman he manages to capture him. As his investigation continues, he comes upon a gruesome crime scene with beheaded bodies. Later, as he researches it with the police, he finds a room filled with murdered police officers and he gets stabbed in the back by Massacre as he looks shocked at the murdered officers. David attempts to fight back his attacker, but he quickly loses. Massacre attempts to finish David off, but is interrupted by Kia Okuru and other officers who fire shots at him. David passes out during the shootout and wakes up two weeks later in The Haven. He asks Matu to see about the shootout and the welfare of Kia Okuru. Matu informs him that Kia lives, but she had been badly beaten and the rest of the officers had been killed. David attempts to go after Massacre shortly after he awoke, but Matu urges him to remain in The Haven to heal up his injuries and regain his strength. They both argue about it for a bit before Matu forces David to get back to bed. David soon knocks out Matu with a tranquilizer dart and goes after Massacre. He is able to deduce Massacre's location from something Massacre had said to him back at the police station. He arrives just in time to aid Thunder Fall of The Kingdom, who is engaged in a brutal battle with Massacre. Despite his injuries, Batwing, along with the help of a severely injured Thunder Fall manage to fight and then escape from Massacre to a nearby hospital where Thunder Fall reveals that The Kingdom, a super hero team which operated in Africa, had done something terrible and that Massacre was their punishment.Batwing #14 (January 2013) The final truth is revealed after the heroes rescue The Kingdom's tech-powered member, Steelback. He tells them that years ago, The Kingdom was fighting the ruthless dictator of Congo alongside the People's Army, which left him only with the capital city to defend. Intending on this to be a victory of the people, they left the army to go alone, but soon received a message saying the dictator has allied himself with the African crime lords, making it impossible to win even with The Kingdom's intervention. The heroes are forced to give amnesty to him and promise no retaliations after that. The crime lords fought anyway but without the dictator to support them, their army of child soldiers was slaughtered, and 50,000 lives were lost in the battle. This tragedy led to The Kingdom's subsequent dissolution.Batwing #15 (February 2013) After the events of the bomb attack at the United Nations place outside, Booster Gold was saddened that the team had lost some of the JLI members who were hurt or killed. Massacre was later revealed to have been Batwing's older brother, who was brainwashed by X. After this, after Matu is injured in an attack on Batwing's home base, he decided that he would use lethal force in his protection of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Batwing was briefly a member in the JLI until the series came to an end with Justice League International Annual #1. Batwing joined with the team calling themselves the Dead Heroes Club, an offshoot of Batman Inc.. The other members are Looker, Freight Train, The Hood, Gaucho, Wingman, and Halo. =Luke Fox= After the events of Batwing #19, David resigned as Batwing. Lucius Fox would then make a new Batwing suit, which Batman then gives to Fox's son Luke Fox.Batwing #19 (June 2013) Luke plays a significant part in Batman Eternal when he helps Jim Corrigan investigate recent events in Arkham Asylum, where the Joker's Daughter is using the spirits of the inmates to resurrect what she believes to be the Joker in the body of Maxie Zeus (although it is revealed to be Deacon Blackfire). In Batgirl #45, Luke Fox began a romantic relationship with Barbara Gordon, also fighting crime together as their alter egos Batwing and Batgirl. Luke Fox was created by Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray, the writers of Batwing #19 in April, 2013. In the DC Rebirth reboot following Red Robin's apparent sacrifice, Luke is recruited to the team that Batman and Batwoman set up.Detective Comics (vol. 1) #944 Powers and abilities Batwing has shown a knowledge of martial arts and is supplied by Batman with a variety of gadgets, weapons and tech to help him fight crime and corruption. He is also very well trained without any weapon in his hands, which makes him one of the biggest threats in the Batman universe. His batsuit is armored and is capable of regeneration abilities, and adaptation skills with the help of wings allowing him to fly or glide. Because he works as a police officer it is implied that he received basic police training with the genius detective Bruce Wayne assisting him along the way. Other versions * David Zavimbe is featured in the Smallville Season 11 digital comic based on the TV series. In this continuity, David is an ally of Lana Lang, who supplies her with information for her vigilante activities in Africa.Smallville Season 11 Special #2 In other media =Television= Luke Fox appears in the TV series Batwoman, portrayed by Camrus Johnson. While Luke being the son of Lucius Fox is intact with the series, he keeps an eye on Wayne Tower when Batman has been missing for three years. He befriends Bruce Wayne's cousin Kate Kane and becomes her ally in light of the Wonderland gang's attacks. Like his father, Lucius with Bruce Wayne, Luke helped Kate out by providing some gadgets for her. He even helped redesign her Batsuit where it gained some red on it while the mask has a red wig added onto it. While he does know where Bruce is, Luke states that he isn't answering his calls. The episode \\"I'll Be Judge, I'll Be Jury\\" had Luke mentioning to Kate that his father was killed during a store robbery when Lucius was running some errands for his family. Luke also told Kate that he was called down by the police to ID the body. In the crossover event Crisis on Infinite Earths, a version of Luke Fox (also portrayed by Camrus Johnson) that lives on Earth-99 and works for an aged Bruce Wayne made a cameo. =Film= The Luke Fox version of Batwing appeared in Batman: Bad Blood, voiced by Gaius Charles. After almost losing his father Lucius Fox in an attack orchestrated by Talia al Ghul, he uses his technology to become Batwing. He later reappears with a non-speaking role in Justice League Dark: Apokolips War. He is seen fighting against Parademons, but is shot down by one of them. =Video games= The Luke Fox version of Batwing appeared in DC Universe Online. In Batman: The Telltale Series, a young Luke Fox appears in a picture in Lucius Fox's laboratory. =Books= The Luke Fox version of Batwing appeared in Catwoman: Soulstealer written by Sarah J.

Location  Nakkasalem is a medium-sized village with a population of 3521 in 2009, almost at the geographical centre of Tamil Nadu state. The village is situated on a plain at the foothills of the Pachamalai range of hills. Nakkasalem is well connected to the nearby towns of Thuraiyur (12 km) and Perambalur (21 km) by Tamil Nadu State Highway 142. The nearest major city is Trichy (Tiruchirapalli, 45 km), which also has the nearest train station and airport. The village is about 290 km southwest of Chennai (previously known as Madras). Frequent buses connect Nakkasalem with Thuraiyur, Perambalur, Trichy and beyond.  Occupation  Small onion, produce of Nakkasalem Farming is the predominant occupation of most people in the village. Annual rainfall is about 800mm, mostly from the northeast monsoon between October and December. Seasonal dryland farming dominates the agricultural activity, although irrigated farming using water drawn from wells by energised pumps is also pursued to some extent. Small onions (Allium cepa var. aggregatum) are the village's most important cash crop. Rice, sorghum, millet, groundnut, sesame, chilli and various legumes are also cultivated and either rain-fed or irrigated. There is an anecdote that Periyar E. V. Ramasamy visited Nakkasalem on a political campaign in the 1950s, and the villagers gave him his own weight in small onions. It is said that Periyar was so happy with the villagers' gesture that from then on he added vengayam (onion) as his trademark word in speeches, mostly in a humorous way. During the harvest season, the village transforms into a hive of activity. Scores of buyers, sellers, traders and brokers swarming around the village and the farmers' fields. Lorries constantly ferry thousands of sacks of the red onions to wholesale markets in Trichy.  Village life  Nakkasalem is not a major commercial centre or tourist spot. A high school, two primary schools, a post office, a bank branch, a cooperative society, a rice mill, a veterinary clinic, a couple of petrol stations, and a few brick kilns are the most notable government and private business establishments there. Two private residential schools and an industrial training institute have recently been established near the village. The Thuraiyur‚ÄìPerambalur highway that passes through the village is dotted with a few shops that also serve as recreational spots and hangouts for the villagers, who engage in lively conversations on politics, cinema and other hot topics of the day. The village is also the transport and educational hub for the nearby smaller villages of Pudu Ammapalayam, Eachampatti and Siruvayalur.  Temples  Like other villages in Tamil Nadu, Nakkasalem has its share of temples. The village has small and medium-size temples to Shiva, Vishnu, Vinayagar, Mariamman, Chelliamman and Ellaiamman, Karuppu the village's guardian deity at the eastern entrance of the village. The Ellaiamman temple houses a unique, imposing statue of the war god Virabhadra, with a large curved moustache, a sharp sword in one hand and burning embers in the other. According to village folklore, Virabhadra was not to be taken out on festive processions, but the villagers once ignored this tradition, incurring the wrath of the deity and causing large fires. Virabhadra was never again taken out of the temple. The village also has a small temple to Hanuman at the foot of the hills. Chettikulam, 5 km away, is a famous local pilgrim centre with a large temple to Shiva in the town centre and a large hilltop temple to Murugan, which draws a huge number of devotees during the festivals of Thai Pusam and Panguni Uthiram. Another nearby village, T Kalathur, 4 km away, has a large dargah, a place of worship popular with local Muslims and people of other faiths.  Festivals  Manju virattu is celebrated during Thai Pongal in the village. Chithirai Thiruvla \\"Rabbit Hunting\\" is a festival on the first Sunday of the Tamil month of Chithirai (mid-April to mid-May) every year throughout the Perambalur district. The \\"kammandi\\" alias \\"Kaman Pandikai\\" is also the famous festival on Tamil 'masi' month on every year.
