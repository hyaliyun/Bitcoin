According to the New York Times (in 2015), it is one of \\"50 essential summer festivals\\". In 2016, Germany's World Guide identified the festival as one of the \\"Top 10 theatre festivals not to miss this summer\\". A representative of the Theatre Communications Group in its publication American Theatre stated that \\"(CATF's) forward focus has helped ... change the American theatre conversation, bringing new voices and pressing topics to the stage ...\\" The Festival specializes in premieres and second or third productions of new plays, currently producing six plays each summer in rotating repertory.  History  The CATF Frank Center Stage The CATF Frank Center Stage interior The CATF Marinoff Theater exterior located in the Contemporary Arts Center II The CATF Contemporary Arts Center I entrance A 2010 NPR segment stated: \\"For 20 years, in the oldest town in West Virginia, new plays have had a home and a loyal audience. The Contemporary American Theater Festival at Shepherd University is a dream for the writers of those plays.\\" The festival was started in 1991 \\"on a wing and a prayer and a $90,000 budget\\" by producing director Ed Herendeen. It was modeled after the Williamstown Theatre Festival, located in Williamstown, Massachusetts. It has the goal of producing and developing new American theater, specifically plays that deal with contemporary issues and strive to challenge and entertain audiences. In addition to finding new scripts which could be either premieres or on a second/third production, the festival has also commissioned works since 1998. Through the summer of 2013, the festival has produced 100 plays, by 73 American playwrights, including 37 world premieres, 9 of which were commissioned. It had an operating budget for 2013 of $1 million. In 2017 the New York Times picked it as \\"one of the top festivals in theater ... that we think you should see this spring and summer around the country\\". The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused officials to scrap the festival & defer to 2021.  Facilities  Housed on the university's campus, the CATF uses three performance spaces. The first is the 416 seat Frank Center for the Arts Stage, a conventional proscenium performance space without a curtain. The second is The Stanley C. and Shirley A. Marinoff Theater, a 180-seat flexible seating space, located in the recently completed Center For Contemporary Arts II(CCA II). This space replaced the Studio Theater, an adapted space in Sara H Cree Hall. The third space is a smaller adapted black box space in Room 112 of Center For Contemporary Arts I. The CATF scene shop and costume shop are also located in the new CCA II.  Notable productions  *Uncanny Valley, 2014 Festival ::As part of the National New Play Network Rolling World Premieres, CATF transferred their production to 59E59 Theaters in New York City from October 2 ‚Äì 26. The production received favorable reviews. *H2O, 2013 Festival ::This production was one of six finalists for the 2014 Harold and Mimi Steinberg/ATCA New Play Award, recognizing playwrights for the best scripts that premiered professionally outside New York City during 2013 *Gidion's Knot, 2012 Festival ::This world premiere production received a Harold and Mimi Steinberg/American Theatre Critics Association New Play citation as one of the top three new plays of 2012. The play has been published by Dramatists Play Service and had 14 productions scheduled for 2014 around the USA. According to American Theatre magazine, it is the 11th most-produced play in the 2013-2014 theater season. *Farragut North, 2009 Festival ::This play was adapted for the screen as The Ides of March starring George Clooney and Ryan Gosling. *My Name is Rachel Corrie, 2007 Festival. ::This production was notable because of the controversy surrounding the play (see the play's article in Wikipedia for details of the controversy). The festival playbill contained a two-page ad, \\"My Name is Rachel Corrie Does Not Tell the Whole Story: Don't Be Misled\\", which included photos of six other women named Rachel who were killed by Palestinian suicide bombers. A member of the festival's board of trustees resigned in protest and several regular patrons decided not to attend the festival in response to the selection of this work. The Artistic Director \\"was flooded with letters urging the board members to remove the play\\". The actual production was without incident and no drop in attendance. *Compleat Female Stage Beauty, 1999 Festival ::This production was notable as it was one of the early works commissioned by the festival which then went on to be regularly produced and was adapted by the playwright (Jeffrey Hatcher) into a film version Stage Beauty starring Claire Danes, Billy Crudup, and Tom Wilkinson. *Carry the Tiger to the Mountain, 1998 Festival ::This play by Cherylene Lee - and the festival's first commissioned work - focused on the beating death of Vincent Chin in 1982 Detroit. The play's production became the impetus for a state-wide discussion on race and served as the backdrop to the governor's year-long efforts on this issue, which began with a town-hall discussion, in the theater, following a production of the play. The festival was recognized for its role as catalyst for this important dialogue with the 1999 \\"Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts.\\"  Complete production history  The following is a complete list of the festival's productions. :2019 Festival :My Lord, What a Night by Deborah Brevoort*^; Support Group for Men by Ellen Fairey; Wrecked by Greg Kalleres*; A Welcome Guest: A Psychotic Fairy Tale by Michael Weller**; Chester Bailey by Joseph Dougherty; Antonio' s Song / I was dreaming of a son by Dael Orlandersmith and Antonio Edwards Suarez* :2018 Festival :The Cake by Bekah Brunstetter; Berta, Berta by Angelica Cheri*; Memoirs of a Forgotten Man by D.W.

The event features morning balloon launches, evening balloon glows, wine tasting from more than 20 wineries, wine competition, food and wine pairing, concerts featuring country on Friday, Classic Rock and Rock on Saturday, and Jazz on Sunday. There is also a giant arts and craft faire, kids faire, and fine art paintings on exhibit within the wine gardens.  History  The Temecula Valley Balloon and Wine Festival, then known as the Rancho California Balloon and Wine Festival, was started in 1983 by Walt Darren, a commercial airline pilot and avid balloonist and by Evelyn Harker a veteran event organizer and fundraiser. The seed money was provided by Kaiser Development Company and sponsors came from the local community giving what they could with many contributions consisting of in-kind services and products. At this time, there were only six wineries in the region. (There are over 40 wineries in the region now.) The first Balloon and Wine Festival was launched in the Spring of 1984 and was a monumental success for a town of only 9,000 residents. More than 4,000 people were in attendance that year as 35 balloons were launched from the Rancho California Plaza area off Ynez Road (now Tower Plaza). As the Festival grew, music was added and the event was moved to the Sports Park. In 1986 as the event continued to grow, it was moved to Cherry Street and the first ever poster contest was held. During 1987-1988, the Festival was moved back to the Sports Park and in 1989, it was moved to its current location at Lake Skinner. In 1988, the Festival featured live entertainment with the Coasters and Little Anthony & The Imperials. In 1991, the Beach Boys entertained. Modern history Today's concerts are held on two stages. Recent years have included Third Eye Blind, 3 Doors Down, Lifehouse, Daughtry, Justin Moore, Chris Young, Blake Shelton, Kenny Loggins, Sugar Ray, Collective Soul, Gin Blossoms, James Otto, Peter Frampton and Five for Fighting. In 1991 the Temecula Valley Balloon and Wine Festival Association was formed when the Chamber of Commerce ceased producing the event. The mission statement of this new non-profit charitable organization was (and still is) to enhance the charitable, cultural, educational and economic development of the region. During the 1992-1993 Festival years, weather grounded the hot air balloon launch but a balloon glow was presented by Paradise Chevrolet in 1993. While the theme of hot air balloons and wine has always served to anchor the event, each year new attractions have been introduced. 2020 was first rescheduled for September, then was scrapped for the year caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The 37th was deferred to 2021.

In 2005, Sanderson received a lifetime achievement award for his contribution to Israeli music.Danny Sanderson in LA celebrating 40 years of Israeli pop music Biography Danny Sanderson was born in Kibbutz Kfar Blum Israel,The Kaveret kid turns 60 to Jewish American parents. During his childhood the family had eventually moved to Haifa. His father worked as the director of El Al's North America department located in New York City hence, in 1960 the family was relocated to New York City. While in New York, he attended the well known High School of Music and Art, in New York City. In 1965, at the age of 15, he started his first band. During that time, he had written his first song. In April 1978, he married Neomi Sanderson. Music career In 1971, after his release from the Israel Defense Forces, Sanderson played with the Schnitzelim Band. He recorded \\"The Left-handed Octopus\\" with the Egyptian-born musician Zouzou Moussa and the orchestra of Israel Radio Arabic.Moussa, the man and the music, Haaretz After a short bout in London, Sanderson returned to Israel and founded a new band, Kaveret, with Alon Oleartchik, Ephraim Shamir, Gidi Gov, Meir Fenigstein and, later on, Yoni Rechter and Yitzhak Klepter. The band broke up in 1976. Sanderson took a break from music to write a nonsense book (Nekhira Pumbit, ◊†◊ó◊ô◊®◊î ◊§◊ï◊û◊ë◊ô◊™, A Public Snore), and musically produced a stand-up/music show for Yehonatan Geffen. He went on to create another band called Gazoz, which produced two albums, and Doda (◊ì◊ï◊ì◊î, Aunt), which had a heavier rock sound. Sanderson rebounded with his first solo album and solo show, and went on to create two other albums and solo shows in 1984 and 1987. His next album, Kofetz Leshni'ya (◊ß◊ï◊§◊• ◊ú◊©◊†◊ô◊ô◊î, Just popped in for a second), released in 1991, was a more mature and musically sophisticated achievement, but less commercially successful than his previous solo albums. The Israeli audience, enamored with Sanderson's blend of humor, jokes and lighthearted music, was willing to accept Sanderson's brilliant music only when masqueraded as 'simple pop', but was much less enthusiastic about more earnest musical attempts. Sanderson produced two more albums in the 1990s, followed by an album of his songs sung by others (2001) and a melancholy album (2006) called Congo Blue (◊ß◊ï◊†◊í◊ï ◊ë◊ú◊ï), which coincided with the death of his wife, Neomi. Sanderson also released several compilation albums and participated in two albums commemorating reunion shows of Kaveret. In 2007, famed Israeli punk rock singer and bassist Yotam Ben-Horin (of Useless ID) started touring with Sanderson as a touring bassist. He has since also become a session bassist for Sanderson and an official member of his solo band. In 2009, Ben-Horin sang on one of the new tracks on Sanderson's upcoming album Lo Yafrid Davar (◊ú◊ê ◊ô◊§◊®◊ô◊ì ◊ì◊ë◊®, \\"Nothing Will Separate [Us]\\").

He developed the lunisolar flood hypothesis of earthquakes and volcanism, based on the concept of subterranean lava tides, which the academic community thoroughly refuted even during his lifetime; nevertheless he attained considerable popularity through apparently correct predictions of several seismic events. Falb's lasting legacy is that he popularized the concept of extraterrestrial influences of geophysical phenomena, even though his concepts regarding the origins of earthquakes were wrong.  Priest and teacher  Falb, a miller's son, attended school at St. Lambrecht's Abbey and then studied theology at the University of Graz. He was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1862 and briefly served as a chaplain in Kainach bei Voitsberg and then in pastoral care. However he soon became a teacher for religion and German language at the merchants' academy in Graz where Peter Rosegger was one of his pupils. Falb became estranged from Catholicism during this time, renouncing his priesthood in 1866. (He converted to Protestantism in 1872).  The lunisolar flood theory  Falb relocated to Prague where he obtained a tutor position in a noble family. This supplied him with sufficient funds to study mathematics, physics and astronomy at the Charles University, and later geology at the University of Vienna. There is no record of him having obtained an academic degree at either institution. In 1868 Falb started the popular astronomy magazine, Sirius and began to develop his \\"lunisolar flood theory\\", published in 1869.Grundz√ºge zu einer Theorie der Erdbeben und Vulkanausbr√ºche. Ed. J. Pock, Graz 1869 A central point of this hypothesis stated earthquakes to be caused by tidal forces acting on subterranean lakes of lava (causing earthquakes) and its upwelling through the earth's crust (causing volcanic eruptions). The strength of these forces being predictable from the positions of the sun and the moon relative to each other, Falb proceeded to postulate \\"Critical Days\\" during which geophysical disasters should be more likely to occur. Subsequently he extended this hypothesis, which initially had strong connections to ideas put forward by the French mathematician Alexis Perrey, to include long-term weather forecasting. Falb's hypothesis gained a high public profile when he made predictions that seemed to come true with the 1873 Belluno earthquake and an eruption at Mount Aetna in 1874.Gedanken und Studien √ºber den Vulcanismus mit besonderer Beziehung auf das Erdbeben von Belluno am 29. Juni 1873 und die Eruption des √Ñtna am 29. August 1874. Ed.: Leykam- Josefsthal, Graz 1875 However, the fundamental flaws of this hypothesis were the typical ones that disqualify it as a scientific theory‚Äînamely, insufficient specificity and precision of the predictions in relation to statistically expected levels, and inherent irrefutability, the combined effect being non-falsifiability. Falb considered days on which the moon was either full or new or in its nodal positions (i.e., four days per month) to be \\"Critical Days.\\" To this were added the days of the equinox (2 per year), and the days when Earth was in the apical positions of its orbit (2 per year). Because Falb proceeded to claim each of these days to be preceded and followed by 2‚Äì3 days which he also considered critical (though less so), about a third of all days of the year met some criteria of \\"criticality\\" according to the lunisolar hypothesis. Moreover, by stating the actual occurrence of the predicted events not to be mandatory, Falb immunized himself against failures while he could (and would) always claim successes as being in support of his hypothesisBr√ºckner E. Weather prophets. In: The Sources and Consequences of Climate Change and Climate Variability in Historical Times, p. 246‚Äì248. Ed.: Kluwer Academic Publishers‚Äîa characteristic hallmark of predictions in pseudoscience. Falb also met the most determined resistance from the scientific establishment on geophysical grounds. Among his most determined and outspoken academic opponents were one of the founders of seismotectonics, Rudolf HoernesDie Erdbebentheorie R. Falbs und ihre wissenschaftliche Grundlage (Wien 1881) in Graz, the director of the Austrian Meteorological Service, Josef M. PernterPernter, J.M. Falbs kritische Tage. Ed.: Hermann Paetel. Berlin 1892 in Innsbruck, and the British inventor of the modern seismograph, John Milne. This formidable and sustained scientific opposition notwithstanding, Falb influenced public opinion regarding seismic phenomena to such a degree that the two major German encyclopedias - the Brockhaus Enzyklop√§dieBrockhaus' Konversations-Lexikon. 14th ed., Leipzig, Berlin and Vienna 1894; Vol. 6, p. 535 and Meyers Konversations-LexikonMeyers Konversations-Lexikon, 1888. Vol. 5, p. 737 \\\\- both mentioned Falb and his theory in editions published during the late 19th century. He also gained a degree of notability in the English-speaking world. In London Murray's Magazine published an appraisal of his earthquake predictions which was reprinted by The New York Times.The Falb Earthquake theory. The New York Times, June 26, 1887  Linguistic hypotheses  In 1877 Falb traveled in South America to study volcanic phenomena and became so fascinated with the native ethnic culture that he stayed much longer than he had planned. While in Bolivia he became a favorite of president Hilari√≥n Daza but had to leave the country when Daza was removed from office in 1879. After interludes in California and New York, Falb returned to Austria but then moved on to Leipzig where he married Petrine von Labitschburg, a primary school teacher. There he opened up another front of controversy in 1883‚Äì1888 when he published books on the Inca civilization,Das Land der Inka in seiner Bedeutung f√ºr die Urgeschichte der Sprache und Schrift. Leipzig 1883Die Anden-Sprachen in ihrem Zusammenhang mit dem semitischen Sprachstamm. postulating languages such as Aimara and Quechua to be the \\"original languages of mankind\\" and linking them to the Semitic languages. These writings did not gain the broad publicity which the lunisolar flood theory continued to enjoy.  Final years  Although increasingly affected by a paralytic spinal disease, Falb continued to publish \\"Critical Day\\" calendars (from 1888 onward) and other writings which became increasingly eccentric, including deluge myths and ice ages. With his wife and their five children he spent the following 15 years under increasingly dire economic conditions relocating between Berlin, his native town Obdach, Leipzig, and finally Berlin again where Rudolf Falb died in 1903, at an age of 65 years.

In the 2015 U.S. Women's Open, O'Keefe qualified as the #1 seed but had to settle for her second runner-up finish in this tournament, as she was defeated by Liz Johnson in the September 6 final by a single pin, 190‚Äì189. O'Keefe won her first PWBA singles title, and second PWBA title overall, in the Nationwide PWBA Sonoma County Open on May 26, 2016. Qualifying as the #2 seed, she defeated Singapore's New Hui Fen in the semifinal match before besting Kelly Kulick in the finals. Later in the 2016 season, O'Keefe led the Pepsi PWBA Lincoln Open wire-to-wire (from opening round of qualifying through to the finals) and captured her third PWBA title on June 26. On July 31, 2016, O'Keefe and Bill O'Neill repeated as champions at the Striking Against Breast Cancer Mixed Doubles championship, giving O'Keefe her fourth PWBA title, and third of the 2016 season. On August 6, 2017, O'Keefe won her fifth PWBA title in the St. Petersburg-Clearwater Open, defeating Colombia's Clara Guerrero in the final match. The win qualified O'Keefe for the season-ending Smithfield PWBA Tour Championship, which she subsequently won on September 6 by defeating Kelly Kulick in the final match. This was O'Keefe's sixth PWBA title and first career major. O'Keefe finished the 2017 season ranked third in points (behind Liz Johnson and Kelly Kulick), and second in match play appearances with 10 (one behind Liz Johnson). O'Keefe won her seventh PWBA title on May 5, 2018 at the PWBA Sonoma County Open, winning a high-scoring final match over England's Verity Crawley, 268‚Äì266.

She had a .411 batting average as a freshman, with 15 outfield assists. As a 15-year-old, she was among the final 160 women competing for a spot on the 1996 Team USA Softball Team. O'Keefe was recognized at the Oregon Hayward Awards in 2007 as a finalist for \\"Professional Woman Athlete of the Year\\". Personal life O'Keefe did not start bowling until age 16 when, as she said in a 2007 interview, \\"My little brother bowled in a league...I went to pick him up, got there early, and saw some really cute boys.\\" She soon joined her brother's league and fell in love with the sport. She met Bryan O'Keefe at age 20 when the two were bowling at the 1999 Super Hoinke tournament in Cincinnati. He became her coach, mentor and eventual husband. Bryan is a former men's bowling coach at McKendree University (now a member of the athletic department staff), where Shannon coaches the women's team. O'Keefe says she loves playing golf and \\"watching football for the first eight weeks of the season, (until) I realize the Buffalo Bills are still terrible and I lose interest.\\" While she and her husband lived in Greece, New York, they were Bills season ticket holders.

For example, a small image on a website, which may contain metadata including a thumbnail image, can easily contain as much metadata as image data, thus removal of that metadata can halve the file size. Metadata can be found in many types of files such as documents, spreadsheets, presentations, images, and audio files. They can include information such as details on the file authors, file creation and modification dates, location (GPS), document revision history, thumbnail images and comments.A Guardian Guide to Your Metadata, Interactive Graphic Since metadata is sometimes not clearly visible in authoring applications (depending on the application and its settings), there is a risk that the user will be unaware of its existence or will forget about it and, if the file is shared, private or confidential information will inadvertently be exposed.

Tiedjens (1895‚Äì1975) Victor Alphons Tiedjens (1895‚Äì1975) was an American horticulturist, agronomist, biochemist and soil chemist. He was credited as \\"one of the pioneers in growing plants in chemical solutions.\\" Massachusetts Horticultural Society Annual Report, 1952. In the late 1920s and the 1930s, Tiedjens was an early researcher of aqua ammonia as a source of nitrogen for plants. He is credited with publishing research that has changed the views and theories of nitrogen use by plants, \\"prior to about 1925, nearly all agronomists considered that nitrate was almost the only form of nitrogen assimilated by plants,...The bulletin by Tiedjens and Robbins (1931) did much to correct the early erroneous ideas.\\"Soil Organic Matter and its role in Crop Production, F.E. Allison, 1973, pg. 246. During his many years working as a student, graduate student, and basic researcher within the United States collegiate system, Tiedjens concluded that calcium was the key element for healthy, productive soils.Available Calcium a Factor in Salt Balance for Vegetable Crops (with L.G. Schermerhorn) Soil Science, December 1936, Vol 42, Issue 6, pages. 415‚Äì434 Using various technical publications and his years of field research, he devised a test to determine appropriate calcium levels necessary for various types of soils and growing media to encourage optimum economical plant growth, health, and reproduction. This test is still in use today. Tiedjens also experimented with different methods of fertilizing crops. He discovered plants can absorb fertilizer nutrients only when they are in a liquid form.Growing Vegetables with Fertilizer in Water (with L.G. Schermerhorn), New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 694, June 1942, pages. 1‚Äì20.Recent Studies on Fertilizer Applications for Gold Skin Sweet Potatoes (with L.G. Schermerhorn, American Society for Horticultural Science, Vol 37, 1939, pages. 857‚Äì859. He rationalized that if he dissolved dry materials in water they would be better utilized by the plant. This led to the inception of liquid fertilizers. Tiedjens then felt another step could lead to even greater efficiency; he completely bypassed the soil and applied the liquid fertilizers directly on the plants, which became the origin of foliar nutrition of plants. Tiedjens developed a program utilizing the combination of the ideal growing environment and nutrient stimulation of the plant to bring about the best economical and nutritional system for the farmer. The program has been successfully used on a wide scale, from a potato farm in Aroostook county Maine, grain and dairy operations in the Midwestern United States and Canada to a produce farm on Mexico's Yucat√°n peninsula, showing that it can be adapted to any agricultural operation. Early life, education and family Tiedjens was born near Brillion, Wisconsin on June 13, 1895 to John Alfred and Anna M. (Nelesen) Tiedjens. He received his B.S. from the University of Wisconsin in 1921 and his M.S. in 1922. He married Dorothy Janet Dopp on June 2, 1923. They had two children, Dorothy Loraine and Penelope Emily. Tiedjens was an assistant research professor at Massachusetts State College (1923‚Äì1928) and did postgraduate work at Harvard (1928). He was a research specialist in horticulture at Rutgers University (1928‚Äì1932) and received his Ph.D. from Rutgers University in 1932. Career, experimental work and inventions Tiedjens was Director of Research at Yoder Brothers Barberton, Ohio (1932‚Äì1934).

She died in 1664, and on 8 February 1684, Bulkeley married secondly Dorothy Whitfield, daughter of Henry Whitfield MP, and his wife Hester Temple, at the Church of St Nicholas Without, Dublin. He died only a year later, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son Richard. His widow two years after his death remarried as his third wife William Worth, Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland); she died in 1705. Rather strangely, at least by modern standards, Worth after Dorothy's death remarried her stepson's widow, Lucy Downing, who was a daughter of the eminent politician and financier Sir George Downing, 1st Baronet and his wife Frances Howard.

Richard Thompson included it on his album 1000 Years of Popular Music. It has also been covered many times, including by Julie Andrews and Miss Piggy. The song became famed in British politics when the second half of its refrain was sung by the then Prime Minister James Callaghan at the Annual Congress of the TUC in September 1978, to indicate that there would not be a general election that year. Callaghan misattributed the song to the better-known Marie Lloyd, an error which has in consequence become common.

SchneiderThe Local 29 May 2009 10:22 CET: Germany's most-wanted fugitive arrested in Hamburg  Escape  Having been repeatedly convicted (among other crimes, of bank robbery) and thus, oscillating between freedom and imprisonment, Wolf neglected to return to prison at the scheduled time after the 1999 Christmas release. On 20 April 2000, he was seen robbing a Commerzbank office in Altona, a district of Hamburg, netting about half a million EUR. Wolf's whereabouts were not known by the police for the next nine years except for numerous crimes associated with him, most of them committed in Germany but some also in Belgium and Netherlands.  Kidnapping  According to police, on 27 March 2009 Wolf kidnapped the wife of a banker in Wiesbaden. He asked for a ransom of 1.8 million EUR, which the banker paid. Despite police surveillance, Wolf managed to leave with the money. He was, however, identified by testimony of the kidnapped wife, which led to reinvigoration of the hunt on him.  New hunt and capture  After the kidnapping, police set a bounty of 40 000 EUR (and later, 100 000 EUR) for information leading to arrest of Wolf. Despite the bounty, Wolf's capture took three months. Wolf was found when he announced for a date on 16 May 2009 in Hamburger Abendblatt. Reportedly, he made strange demands to the woman who answered -- in particular, he requested that she rent a room for him in her name and open a bank account for him in her name -- which made her suspicious and led her to report the encounter to police. Subsequently, police located Wolf's cellphone, whose number he had given to his date, and arrested him on the Reeperbahn, after his departure from Lehmitz, a well-known pub.

The district encompasses a portion of the city's central business district, whose historical significance extends from about 1885 to the end of the Second World War. The original 1988 boundary of the district included buildings on two blocks of Walnut Street, between Second and Arkansas Streets, and encompasses a cluster of predominantly commercial buildings built between 1885 and 1912. These buildings were predominantly Italianate commercial masonry buildings. In 1993 the district was enlarged to include two blocks of First and Second Streets, between Walnut and Poplar Streets, which also included historically significant commercial buildings constructed up to 1943. This enlargement included the previously-listed former Rogers Post Office Building, Lane Hotel, Applegate Drugstore, and Bank of Rogers Building. This enlargement included a wider variety of architectural styles, notably the Colonial Revival styling of the old post office, and Spanish Colonial Revival of the Lane Hotel.

Produced and released eight years into the war, at a time when Congress was considering sending tens of thousands of new troops to Afghanistan, the film asks the American public to reconsider basic questions about the conflict, such as how much will it cost, in lives and money? How long will Americans troops be there? How do we know if we‚Äôve won? What is our exit strategy? The film was initially made available for free, online, in six consecutive chapters. This staggered release allowed the filmmakers to stay atop an ever-changing news cycle. Greenwald characterized it as \\"the first real-time documentary.\\" Synopsis Part 1: More Troops + Afghanistan = Catastrophe, questions the value of increasing the number of US troops in Afghanistan. Part 2: The Most Dangerous Country in the World argues that the ongoing conflict may further destabilized Pakistan, an unpredictable and volatile nuclear power. Part 3: The Cost of War explores the financial impact of the war, calculating that it could easily cost American taxpayers in excess of a trillion dollars. Part 4: Civilian Casualties looks at the death and damage that children and other innocent non-combatants suffer as the war continues. Part 5: Women of Afghanistan debunks the claim that American troops support a feminist revolution. In this chapter, Afghan women report that they are suffering more than they did under the Taliban. Part 6: Security features a variety of CIA and other experts predict that this military action will ultimately make the US less safe, increase anti-American sentiment abroad, and create more terrorists. Objectives The documentary campaign was designed to change the media narrative about the war, ultimately aimed at ending US involvement in Afghanistan. The key message, that military solutions won't change ingrained political, social and economic problems in Afghanistan, lead to the conclusion that US policy needed to be rethought to reflect that reality. Greenwald stated that the film was intended as an organizing tool and \\"our mission is to reach as many people as possible and motivate them to take action.\\" Production and distribution At the time of production, Greenwald determined that the topic of the Afghanistan war was extremely time sensitive, as policy was being decided in Washington concurrently, including decisions regarding a 2009 troop \\"surge.\\" This informed his decision to release the film in sequential segments, on a shoestring, fundraising as he went along. Brave New Films released the short chapters on the internet, an innovative distribution method at the time. As well as being streamed for free online, the completed film ran in a limited theatrical release, and was available on DVD. Rethink Afghanistan was also shown at thousands of Brave New Films‚Äô signature \\"house parties.\\" Impact One of the first successes of the campaign occurred early in production. In July 2009, Greenwald and Brave New Films successfully helped retired Corporal Rick Reyes and other veterans testify before Sen. John Kerry and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Reyes, who served in both Iraq and Afghanistan, told the committee, \\"Sending more troops will not make the US safer; it will only build more opposition against us. I urge you on behalf of truth and patriotism to consider carefully and Rethink Afghanistan.\\" At the time, support for the war and for the \\"surge\\" of 33,000 troops was about 52%. As the Rethink Afghanistan campaign progressed, that support dropped precipitously to 17%, lower than either Iraq or Vietnam. By July 18, 2010, the Rethink Afghanistan campaign had become part of the major media narrative, to the point that Newsweek borrowed the title and idea for their cover story. Capitol Hill got the message by June 2011, when President Obama announced an accelerated timetable for the withdrawal of American troops. As of February 2014, the US was on track for full troop withdrawal by the end of 2014.

The Imperial Navy had experimented previously with seaplane carriers, though these earlier conversions were too slow to operate with the High Seas Fleet and carried an insufficient number of aircraft. I was intended to carry between 23 and 30 aircraft, including fighters, bombers, and torpedo-bombers. The ship was based on the incomplete hull of the Italian passenger ship Ausonia, which was being built in Hamburg. The conversion was proposed by the Air Department of the Reichs Navy Office, but it was abandoned after negotiations within the German Navy over a proposed moratorium on new ships at the end of the war. After World War I ended, high inflation in Germany added to the cost of the ship, and as a result, the Italian shipping company for whom the ship was originally built, declined to purchase her. The vessel was therefore sold to shipbreakers and dismantled in 1922. Design Ausonia began her existence as a turbine- powered passenger steamer, ordered by Italian Sitmar in 1914. The ship was built in the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, under construction number 236.Gr√∂ner, p. 70 At the time, the only German seaplane carrier was the armored cruiser , which carried two planes.Greger, p. 87 The leadership of the German Navy believed that zeppelins were much more effective than seaplanes, both for reconnaissance and attack.Herwig, pp. 214-215 Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the architect of the German Navy, was particularly unimpressed by the performance of fixed-wing aircraft.Herwig, p. 213 Nevertheless, the Navy developed several naval aircraft before and during the war, including a pair of seaplane fighters, the W.12 and the W.29, both built by Hansa-Brandenburg. Twin-engined torpedo-floatplanes were also designed.Herwig, pp. 212-213 Regardless of the preference toward airships, several small merchant vessels were converted into seaplane carriers during World War I. They carried only two to four aircraft each, however, and were too slow to operate with the High Seas Fleet. The light cruiser , which was fast enough to steam with the Fleet, was converted into a seaplane carrier in 1918. She too, though, only carried two seaplanes. It was decided to convert the liner Ausonia into a flight-deck carrier for wheeled aircraft as well as floatplanes.Greger, p. 88 The plan for the conversion was drawn up by Leutnant zur See J√ºrgen Reimpell in 1918, an officer of the 1st Aviation Detachment.Schenk, p. 129 =General characteristics= Once converted, it would have been 158 meters long overall and 149.6 m long between perpendiculars. The ship had a beam of 18.8 m and a draft of 7.43 m, and displaced 12,585 metric tons. The ship was powered by two sets of Blohm & Voss geared turbines that drove a pair of screws, the diameter of which is not known. The details of the boiler system and electrical power plant are unknown. The ship was to have been equipped with two 82 m-long hangar decks for wheeled aircraft and a third 128 m-long hangar deck for seaplanes; all of the hangars were 18.5 m wide. The flight deck would have been 128.5 m long and 18.7 m wide. All three of the hangars and flight deck were intended to have been mounted above the main structural deck. The ship's designers intended to mount a take off deck on the bow, which would have been 30 m long and 10.5 m wide. According to naval historian Erich Gr√∂ner, the ship was designed to carry either 13 fixed-wing or 19 folding-wing seaplanes, along with around 10 wheeled aircraft. Rene Greger estimated the ship to carry eight to ten fighter aircraft and a combination of fifteen to twenty bombers and torpedo-floatplanes. Conversion She was launched as the passenger ship Ausonia on 15 April 1915. While the ship was still being fitted out, the German navy decided to convert her into an aircraft carrier. The proposed design was completed by 1918, but by then, the majority of naval construction efforts were diverted to building new U-boats. The demands on labor and resources the war imposed on the German economy reduced the shipbuilding industry to barely being able to cover the maintenance and repair needs of the High Seas Fleet. What resources were left over were by 1918 funneled into U-boat production.Weir, pp. 178‚Äì179 As a result of the growing importance of U-boat construction and a moratorium on new surface ships imposed by the Reichsmarineamt (RMA‚Äîthe Imperial Navy Office), the conversion project was abandoned. The design influenced the planned conversion of the armored cruiser into a seaplane carrier. This plan too, however, was scrapped. In 1920, the Italian shipping company canceled its order for Ausonia because the post-war inflation in Germany substantially increased the price of the ship. As a result, she was sold to ship breakers in 1922 and broken up for scrap.

It consisted of a regulation racing track and associated stables for horses, and facilities for trainers, exercise workers, and jockeys. It was opened in 1950 primarily as a venue for racing thoroughbreds. The track owners also leased the complex to Wolverine Raceway for Standardbred harness racing events.Wolverine Raceway The large complex had stables with a capacity for 1200 horses. Until the late 1980s, the Detroit Race Course (DRC) and others, with its racetrack betting, were the only sites in Michigan for legalized gambling. In this period, efforts to introduce other types of gambling at the DRC were unsuccessful. Interest in horse racing declined in the late 20th century. In 1985 the business was sold to Ladbroke, a UK-based hotel and gambling company.http://longshotsblues.wordpress.com/2009/11/19/reminiscing-detroit- race-course/ It discontinued harness racing that year. The DRC and gaming environment was adversely affected by the opening in 1994 of Casino Windsor across the river in Ontario, Canada. The casino was owned by the province and was a rousing success, attracting millions of visitors annually, many from the Midwest. The complex is owned by Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation of the provincial government. Following a major expansion in 2008, it is now known as Caesars Windsor. In response, in 1996 the Michigan state legislature and governor passed a law to establish gaming in the state, beginning with casinos to be constructed in Detroit, the largest city and across from Windsor. Two casinos opened in 1999 and the third in 2000. They were intended in part to help generate revenues for the city of Detroit, which had struggled financially. The last horse races on the flat at DRC were run in 1998. In May 1998 Ladbroke announced the sale of Detroit Race Course. Based on the new 1996 law, which authorized betting at tracks for simulcast events, Millennium, the new owners, used the complex as a venue for viewing simulcast video racing, with associated betting, into 1999. Attempts failed to gain voter approval for expanded forms of gaming at racetracks, such as slot machines. That summer Millennium demolished the facilities to redevelop the property for commercial uses. As noted, the legislature in 1996 approved casinos in the state. Three have opened in Detroit: the MGM Grand Detroit and MotorCity Casino in 1999, and Greektown Casino-Hotel in 2000. In addition, by 2019 there were two dozen casinos elsewhere in the state owned and operated by federally recognized Native American tribes. Thoroughbred racing was reintroduced at Hazel Park Raceway in 2014 after 30 years. Harness racing continued at other sites in the state, and now, one last harness racing facility operates, Northville Downs at Northville, Michigan. Sports Creek Raceway, a harness racing track near Swartz Creek, Michigan, operated from 1986 to 2015. Several car racing tracks continue to operate in the state.

It originally aired March 3, 1981 on CBS. Plot Jesse Hallam is a coal miner in Muhlenberg, Kentucky, whose wife has recently died and who has also recently lost his job. His daughter Jenny is in need of an operation on her back, and the nearest hospital that can successfully perform the procedure is in Cincinnati, Ohio. He sells the family farm to his brother-in-law Charlie, receives $15,000 in cash, packs up Jenny and his son Ted, and piles their belongings high on a pickup truck as they head to Cincinnati to start a new life. Upon arrival in Cincinnati, Jesse checks Jenny into the hospital, paying the $14,000 for her operation in cash from the money he received from Charlie. After getting Ted registered at Harding High School, Jesse sets out to find work. However, his behavior is peculiar...as he is presented with a job application to fill out, he backs off and leaves. His efforts seem futile until he witnesses a vendor trying to cheat an elderly fruit grocer by selling him inferior apples. Jesse intervenes and stops it. The grocer, an Italian immigrant named Sal Galucci (Eli Wallach), is impressed enough to offer Jesse a job immediately. Soon afterwards, Jesse learns his driver's license has expired after he runs a stop sign and is stopped by a police officer. One day, as Jesse is helping Sal set up a stand at a farmer's market, Sal rebukes him for setting their wares on a spot marked with another name. In his anger, Sal says, \\"What's'a matter, don't you read good?\\" When Jesse turns away to hide his shame, Sal comes to realize the truth‚Äîthat Jesse is illiterate. He manages to convince Jesse to allow Sal to have his daughter Marian, who is also Ted's principal, teach him. Marian is reluctant at first, but gives in when Sal tells her how much he wants Jesse to continue working for him. Throughout all this is a subplot that involves Jesse's son, Theodore \\"Ted\\" Hallam. Though his athletic abilities land him a spot on the track team, Ted is struggling academically, especially with reading‚Äîa parallel similar to his father. Because of this, he also struggles socially, leading him to hang out with a group of wild friends from school. This culminates in a police officer bringing Ted home to Jesse after Ted is found to be consuming alcohol. Jesse continues to progress well with his reading, to the point where Marian offers him a copy of Ernest Hemingway's \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\", which further inspires Jesse. She suggests a summer reading program at the high school that would bring him to a higher grade level. However, after Jesse fails the written portion of his driver's test, he becomes discouraged and decides to return to Kentucky, which pleases Ted. After the school year ends, Ted brings home his report card, and when probed by Jesse, Ted says he received an A in gym and a D in math, but says nothing about his other grades, expressing excitement at going back to Kentucky, where he would be enrolled as a junior at his old high school. Jesse learns that Ted actually flunked out of school...failing all of his other subjects, which require him to know how to read. The final scene shows Jesse and Ted showing up at the high school for the remedial reading class that Marian had suggested to Jesse earlier. She watches them with delight as they pull up in front of the school. However, the class is out of control before it even starts, with all the students (with the exception of Jesse and Ted) talking and playing loud music. Jesse gets up from his desk and sits down each of the rowdy students, and grabs the radio and shuts it off. The class quickly quiets as he addresses them: \\"You want to do what I've been doin' my whole life? Running away from words?\\" He then goes on to call it 'a poverty trade' and that they're in danger of digging deeper into their disabilities by not taking advantage of the opportunity they have in front of them. He says the choice is theirs, but no one is going to stop him and Ted from learning to read. The teacher, Mr. Parker, then calls roll, with Jesse and Ted proudly stating 'here' when their names are called.

The patterns which link Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and the ways in which they have changed their concepts over time are explored as one of the central themes. One of the conclusions of the book that Wright tries to make is a reconciliation between science and religion. He also speculates on the future of the concept of God. Evolutionary biology Among other things, Wright discusses the role of evolutionary biology in the development of religion. Geneticist Dean Hamer hypothesized that some people have a specific gene that makes them prone to religious belief, which he calls the God gene, and that over time natural selection has favored these people because their spirituality leads to optimism. Wright, however, thinks the tendency towards religious belief is not an adaptive trait influenced by natural selection, but rather a spandrel ‚Äî a trait that happens to be supported by adaptations originally selected for other purposes. Wright states that the human brain approaches religious belief based on how it adapted to survive and reproduce in early hunter-gatherer societies. He points out four key traits of religion that align with the human brain's survival adaptations: *Its claims can be surprising, strange, and even counterintuitive. *It claims to show what causes good and bad things to happen. *It tells people that they can control these causes and increase the ratio of good to bad results. *It is hard to falsify or disprove. Humans have adapted to pay attention to surprising and confusing information because it could make the difference between life and death (for instance, if a person left the campsite and mysteriously never returned, it would be wise for the others to be on guard for a predator or some other danger). Understanding and controlling cause and effect also takes top priority in the human brain, since humans live in complex social groups where predicting and influencing the actions and thoughts of others gains them allies, status, and access to resources. As human cognitive abilities and curiosity expanded over the centuries, their investigation of cause and effect expanded from the strictly social context out into the world at large, opening the doors for religions to explain things like weather and disease. Though some of these explanations were strange and perhaps dubious, the fact that they could not be completely disproven lent them credibility; it was better to be cautious than dead. Wright uses an example from the Haida people, indigenous to the northwest coast of North America, who would try to appease killer whale deities to calm storms out at sea; they would pour fresh water into the ocean or tie tobacco or deer tallow to the end of a paddle. While some people certainly died despite these offerings, those who survived were a testament to the ritual's possible efficacy. Mysterious and unproven beliefs can also persist in a culture because human brains have adapted to agree with the group consensus even if it goes against one's better judgment or personal beliefs, since a person alienated from the group loses protection, food, and mates. Wright cites the Asch conformity experiments and even posits that Stockholm syndrome is not so much a syndrome as a natural product of evolution, the brain's way of ensuring that a person accepts and is accepted by his or her new social group. In addition, beliefs can persist because once a person publicly announces a belief, social psychologists have found that he or she is inclined to focus on evidence supporting that belief while conveniently ignoring evidence contradicting it, a logical fallacy known as cherry picking. Reviews Journalist and political commentator Andrew Sullivan gave the book a positive review in The Atlantic, saying that the book \\"...gave me hope that we can avoid both the barrenness of a world without God and the horrible fusion of fundamentalism and weapons of mass destruction.\\" Andrew Sullivan's blog post linking to his review, from The AtlanticSullivan's full review of the book from The Times Newsweek religion editor, Lisa Miller, described The Evolution of God as a reframing of the faith vs. reason debate. Drawing a contrast to such authors as Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens, Miller gives an overall positive review of the book's approach to the examination of the concept of God.Let‚Äôs Talk About God from Newsweek In a review for The New York Times, Yale professor of psychology Paul Bloom said, \\"In his brilliant new book, ‚ÄúThe Evolution of God,‚Äù Robert Wright tells the story of how God grew up.\\"Review of The Evolution of God from The New York Times Bloom sums up Wright's controversial stance as, \\"Wright‚Äôs tone is reasoned and careful, even hesitant, throughout, and it is nice to read about issues like the morality of Christ and the meaning of jihad without getting the feeling that you are being shouted at. His views, though, are provocative and controversial. There is something here to annoy almost everyone.\\" However, in a New York Times review that included a reply from Wright, Nicholas Wade, a writer for the \\"Science Times\\" section, notes the book is \\"a disappointment from the Darwinian perspective\\", because evolution \\"provides a simpler explanation for moral progression than the deity Wright half invokes.\\"The Non-Evolution of God, a July 2009 blog post from the New York Times website Wright replied to Wade's comments, saying Wade had misunderstood Wright's argument and that \\"The deity (if there is one‚Äìand I‚Äôm agnostic on that point) would be realizing moral progress through evolution‚Äôs creation of the human moral sense (and through the subsequent development of that moral sense via cultural evolution, particularly technological evolution).\\"Non-Evolution of God, Part 2, a July 2009 blog post from the New York Times website Wade replied that \\"evolution seems to me a sufficient explanation for the moral progress that Mr. Wright correctly discerns in the human condition, so there seemed no compelling need to invoke a deity.\\" Promotional appearances To promote the book, Wright did a variety of interviews, including with the New York Times, Publishers Weekly, and Bill Moyers Journal. He also did a series of videos on Bloggingheads.tv, a website he co-founded with Mickey Kaus.

Paine lost the 1927 mayoral election to Watkins Overton, who represented the Crump machine, and this marked the resurgence of Crump's dominance in the politics of western Tennessee. In 1930, Gwinn ran in the Democratic gubernatorial primaries against the sitting Governor Henry Horton, who had the support of Caldwell-Lea political machine in Nashville. Gwinn was supported by two ex-governors, Benton McMillin and Albert H. Roberts, and by Hill McAlister.Lee, David D. 1979. Tennessee in Turmoil: Politics in the Volunteer State, 1920-1932. Memphis, TN: Memphis State University Press. 204 p. Crump, who had opposed Horton's election in 1928, threw his support behind Horton in the Democratic primaries of 1930. Horton won the primary election by 123,642 votes to Gwinn's 88,416. Shelby County made the difference, giving Horton 27,634 votes compared to Gwinn's 2,267. Virtually all statewide political contests in Tennessee during this era were resolved in the Democratic primaries rather than in the general elections. Crump had made a governor, but most remarkable was that over 20 thousand voters who had been against Horton in 1928 changed their minds at Crump's suggestion and voted for Horton in 1930.Miller, William D. 1964.

History  The castle of Pierola, of which nothing remains, was cited in documents in 963. It belonged to the vicecounty of Barcelona from the tenth to the thirteenth century. In 1286 it was given by Alfonso II of Aragon to Asbert of Mediona. In 1698 Pau Ignasi of Dalmases bought the barony of Pierola. Afterwards it remained in the hands of the Fontcuberta family who kept it until the end of the manorialism The municipality became internationally famous because of the 2002 discovery of a Miocene primate, the Pierolapithecus catalaunicus, a fossil of great interest for human evolution. The genus was named after the municipality.  Main sights The church of the municipality is dedicated to Saint Peter (Sant Pere) and was constructed in 1852 in the place in which an ancient Roman temple was found. The church of Pierola, also dedicated to Saint Peter, is of Roman origin and appears in documents from 1060. Near the border with the municipality of Collbat√≥ (Baix Llobregat comarca), a hermitage, also Roman, dedicated to Saint Christopher of Canyelles was described as early as 1033. Events Els Hostalets de Pierola celebrates its major festival in July. In September a festival of wine takes place.

The Army Safety Team provides safety and risk management expertise to the Army, DoD, and other agencies; develops, maintains and evaluates Army Safety policy and programs; and communicates relevant risk management information to Army Leaders for the preservation of our Soldiers, Civilians, Families and vital resources.https://safety.army.mil It is located at Fort Rucker, Alabama, alongside the Army's major flight training unit. The center has developed a myriad of tools and resources that reinforce the sound principles of risk management. These resources are a means to assist Leaders, Soldiers, Army Civilians and Managers, and Family members in successfully and safely completing their missions, jobs and off-duty activities while mitigating the harmful effects of risk. The USACRC website hosts many tools to identify hazards, reduce risk and prevent both accidental and tactical loss. The USACRC's objective is to keep all Army personnel and their Family members safe and strong. It is commanded by Brigadier General Jeffrey Farnsworth. History The U. S. Army Combat Readiness Safety Center traces its origin to the Army Accident Review Board, a section of the Army Aviation Training Department of the Artillery School at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The Review Board consisted of two officers and one enlisted. As Army aviation expanded, so did the work of the Review Board, which was moved to Fort Rucker in Alabama, with the U.S. Army Aviation School in 1954. The Review Board was renamed the U.S. Army Board for Aviation Accident Research in 1957. USABAAR's mission included not only the review of aircraft accident reports but also crash-site investigations and research into aviation safety matters involving aircraft design, operations, and training as well as supervision, maintenance, inspection, and human factors. In 1972, USABAAR became the U.S. Army Agency for Aviation Safety under the supervision of the director of Army Aviation, Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Force Development. Responsibilities of USAAAVS were expanded to include accident prevention education, safety assistance visits Armywide, establishment of Army aviation safety policy, collection of all Army aviation accident data, promotion of system safety, and support of selected aspects of the Army‚Äôs ground safety program. USAAAVS was under the supervision of the Inspector General from 1974 to 1978. In 1978, it became a field operating agency of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, and its mission was further expanded. USAAAVS assumed responsibility for both aviation and ground safety and was renamed the U.S. Army Safety Center. The Commander of the Army Safety Center became the deputy director of Army Safety in October 1983. The Safety Center was given Army staff responsibility for implementation of the Army Safety Program and served as the primary advisor on accident prevention to the Department of the Army. In July 1987, the Safety Center became a field operating agency of the Chief of Staff of the Army. The commander of the Safety Center was designated as the director of Army Safety. The director of Army Safety was made a general officer position, reporting through the Director of the Army Staff to the Chief of Staff, Army. Following the September 11 attacks and the resulting U.S. military action, United States Department of Defense leadership recognized the enormous impact that accidental loss had, and continues to have, on the readiness and capability of the Army. As a result, January 31, 2005, the U.S. Army Safety Center was redesignated as the U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center with an expanded mission to become the center of gravity for all loss-related areas. As the Army‚Äôs knowledge center for loss data collection, analysis and information dissemination, the USACRC assists the Army with the preservation of combat power through the application of Risk Management in order to stop Soldiers getting hurt.  Scope  Most Army accidental deaths occur while Soldiers are off duty, and statistics from fiscal 2011 reveal there were 136 off-duty accidental fatalities compared to only 40 on-duty. For soldiers who are at home or play, privately owned vehicle accidents are the most prevalent cause of death. Sedans and motorcycles were involved in most of these incidents. Risk management is the Army‚Äôs primary decision-making process to identify hazards, reduce risk and prevent accidents and can be used by Soldiers at any time even if they aren‚Äôt at work. Besides urging Soldiers to use risk management both on and off duty, Leaders, battle buddies and Family members can help reduce off-duty deaths by getting involved in their Soldiers‚Äô lives and helping them make better decisions. The U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center has many tools and programs to help leaders, battle buddies and Family members identify risky behaviors, provide solutions and help prevent needless accidents both on and off duty. The U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center has developed a myriad of tools that reinforce the sound principles of Risk Management , which assist leaders in successfully and safely completing their mission, while mitigating the harmful effects of risk. These tools were developed to keep the Army Family safe and strong, reflecting the organizational catchphrase, \\"Army Safe is Army Strong.\\" Some tools can only be accessed by those with Army Knowledge Online accounts.

The word Kattunayakar means the king of the jungle in Tamil and Malayalam. The Kattunayakar are one of the earliest known inhabitants of the Western Ghats, who are engaged in the collection and gathering of forest produce, mainly wild honey and wax. The men wear short dhotis and half sleeved shirts. The women attach a long single piece of cloth round their body just below the neck, leaving the shoulders and arms bare. Child marriages were common before the 1990s, but now the girls marry after attaining puberty. Monogamy is the general rule among the Kattunayakar community. Kattunayakar believe in Hinduism and have a language, which is a mixture of all Dravidian languages. The main deity of the tribe is Lord Shiva and( jakkamma[Nayakkar])under the name of Bhairava. They also worship animals, birds, trees, rock hillocks, and snakes, along with the other Hindu deities. Kattunayakar are fond of music, songs, and dancing. They are also called Cholanaickar and Pathinaickars. Kattunayakar in Kerala Kattunayakar are one of the five ancient tribal groups in Kerala. They live very much in tune with Nature. Hunting and collecting forest produce are the two main means of living for the Kattunayakar tribe. However, the restrictions to protect native forest and wildlife have forced them to find work outside the forests. Although willing to work for very low wages, unemployment and poverty is very severe among the Kattunayakan. Another important factor for the tribe is the medicinal system and its close association with the culture. They use traditional medicines for common ailments, but they use modern medicines in an emergency. Even then they only use modern medicine after seeking consent from \\"God\\" by the chieftain or priest (generally both roles are taken by the same person), through a well-defined set of traditional rituals or poojas.

The poem describes Coleridge's feelings on politics and religion, and it emphasises an idyllic lifestyle as an optimal way of living. Background While Coleridge lived in Bristol during the end of 1796, he worked on trying to get his poetry published and submitted many of his pieces to various magazines. The Ode to the Departing Year was submitted to the Cambridge IntelligencerHolmes 1989 p. 129 and published 31 December.Ashton 1997 p. 97 In a letter to Thomas Poole, on 26 December 1796, Coleridge explains, > Soon after the commencement of this month, the Editor of the Cambridge > Intelligencer [...] requested me, by Letter, to furnish him with some Lines > for the last day of this Year. I promised him that I would make the attempt; > but, almost immediately after, a rheumatic complaint seized on my head, and > continued to prevent the possibility of poetic composition till within the > last three days. So in the course of the last three days the following Ode > was produced. In general, when an Author informs the Public that his > production was struck off in a great hurry, he offers an insult, not an > excuse. But I trust that the present case is an exception, and that the > peculiar circumstances, which obliged me to write with such unusual > rapidity, give a propriety to my professions of it [...] For me to discuss > the literary merits of this hasty composition, were idle and presumptuous > [...] I am more anxious, lest the moral spirit of the Ode should be > mistaken. You, I am sure, will not fail to recollect, that among the > Ancients, the Bard and the Prophet were one and the same character; and you > know, that although I prophesy curses, I pray fervently for blessings.Letter > to Thomas Poole 11 December 1796 At the beginning of 1797 after the poem was published, Coleridge was attempting to complete his long poem titled The Destiny of Nations. A Vision for a 1797 edition of his poems. When Coleridge was no longer able to complete the poem, he replaced it with Ode to the Departing Year in the collection.Holmes 1989 p. 140 Poem The poem begins with a prayer to Divine Providence:Radley 1966 p. 41 The poem then predicts the fall of Britain if the British government was to ally with tyrant forces against the French: The poem ends with a description of living a meek, agrarian life:Holmes 1989 p. 133 Themes In terms of the political themes, Coleridge added a note to a later edition of the work which says, \\"Let it not be forgotten during the perusal of this Ode that it was written many years before the abolition of the Slave Trade by the British Legislature, likewise before the invasion of Switzerland by the French Republic, which occasioned the Ode that follows, a kind of Palinodia.\\"Mays 2001 qtd. p. 302 The actual topic of the poem is the death of Catherine of Russia and a prophecy that Britain will fall if they fight against France. Within the poem she is described as a Hag, and the poem opposes Catherine because she opposed France. The use of prophesy is connected to what Coleridge does in his poem Religious Musings and the political themes are connected to The Destiny of Nations.Radley 1966 p. 39 In particular, there is an emphasis on the suffering of mankind and how people need to think about the problems of society as a whole to fix the social ills. Along with the political message, Ode on the Departing Year and The Destiny of Nations relies on the image of a harp as a way to promote his message. Connections to the themes in Coleridge's poetry continued until the late poem, \\"Ne Plus Ultra\\", incorporates parallels to the ideas within the Ode.Jasper 1985 p. 105 Coleridge believed during 1796 that the best life is one of hard work farming with a modest lifestyle, which comes out in the end of Ode on the Departing Year. In a Letter to Poole in December, Coleridge wrote: \\"I mean to work very hard ‚Äî as Cook, Butler, Scullion, Shoe-cleaner, occasional Nurse, Gardener, Hind, Pig-protector, Chaplain, Secretary, Poet, Reviewer, and omni-botherum shilling-scavenger ‚Äî in other words, I shall keep no Servant, and will cultivate my Land-acre and my wise-acres, as well as I can.\\" After the poem was published on 31 December 1796, Coleridge set out from Bristol to be with his wife Sara and their child; his plans was to move to Stowey to become a farmer.Doughty 1981 p. 120 Critical response In 1959, John Colmer wrote, \\"Two of these poems, the Ode on the departing Year and France: An Ode, form landmarks in the development of Coleridge's political thought. The dominant note of the first is a deep disgust with his native land for associating herself with the armed ambition of the continental powers, particularly with Russia.\\"Colmer 1959 pp. 51‚Äì52 Notes References * Ashton, Rosemary.

The unit was designed to support a single combat group.Coleman, p. 208 Its 942d Air Engineering Squadron provided maintenance that was beyond the capability of the combat group, its 766th Air Materiel Squadron handled all supply matters, and its Headquarters & Base Services Squadron provided other support.

It was a coal mining town founded to exploit the national resources of Disko Island. The mines operated for 48 years until 1972, when the economic base of the settlement collapsed, leading to its abandonment.  History  Old waterworks Qullissat was not a traditional Inuit settlement, but was founded in 1924 as a coal mining town. By 1966 the mine was producing 40,000 tonnes of coal a year and the town had a population of 1,400, making it the sixth- largest population centre in Greenland.\\"Qullissat\\" Ilulissat Museum The coal mine attracted a multinational population, with Danes, Swedes, and British people working in the mines. In 1960 Nanok Idraetslag were crowned champions of the 1959‚Äì60 Greenlandic Football Championship. The Greenland Provincial Council voted to close the mine in 1966 due to falling profits and demand, poor quality coal and a lack of labour force in the cod fishing industry. Residents were to be moved after a relocation plan was completed. The mine was eventually closed on 4 October 1972, despite the fact that the cod industry had collapsed in the interim. By then 700 residents had already moved, and the remaining 500 were compulsorily relocated. Kuupik Kleist, later Prime Minister of Greenland, was born in Qullissat, and was the last person to be confirmed, before the settlement was abandoned in 1972. The town was sold on 20 October 1972 to an entrepreneur, who demolished the site. The town's church was spared and relocated to nearby Ilulissat. In November 2000 Qullissat was hit by a tsunami caused by a large landslide in Paatuut at the Nuussuaq peninsula. The tsunami reached more than 100 meters inland and would have cost many lives had the town still been inhabited.

The film concerns a recently married gay couple who face opposition from one partner's brother, who plots to murder them after being ostracized by his church. The film was a box office bomb, having earned only $40,000 .The Official Site of the Movie Ben and Arthur It is considered by some to be one of the worst movies ever made. Plot Ben (Jamie Brett Gabel) and Arthur (Sam Mraovich) are a gay couple eagerly awaiting the legalization of gay marriage in Hawaii so that they may travel there for their dream wedding. After a news bulletin that a judge has made a ruling that will allow gay marriages to take place, the men purchase plane tickets and prepare to depart; however, before they leave, they discover that a challenge to the judge's ruling has resulted in a suspension of gay marriage in Hawaii, pending further judicial review. Ben takes advantage of the delay to inform Arthur that he is actually already married to a woman named Tammy (Julie Belknap), whom he wed out of societal pressure before he came to terms with his homosexuality and from whom he has been separated since before he and Arthur met. Arthur becomes angry, but decides to stay with Ben anyway. Shortly thereafter, Ben contacts Tammy, finally comes out to her, and asks her for a divorce. After the disappointment of their near-wedding, Ben and Arthur resume their daily life, working in a small diner in Los Angeles, where Ben is a dishwasher and Arthur is a waiter. Although Ben‚Äîa former nurse who quit to pursue a music career‚Äîenjoys the manual labor and hours, Arthur has grown impatient with servitude and putting up with needy customers. One night, Arthur decides to quit and go back to college, so that he can earn an MBA and open up his own sex shop. Although the loss of income to the household means that Ben will have to quit and return to being a nurse, he agrees to do so in order to help Arthur pursue his dream. To finance his education, Arthur tracks down his estranged brother, Victor (Michael Haboush), whom he hasn't spoken to for seven years. Victor is a religious fanatic who believes that Arthur's homosexuality is a sign of demonic possession, although Victor himself appears to be flamboyantly gay‚Äîeven greeting Arthur in a pink feathered bathrobe. Although Victor lashes out at Arthur for his failure to turn straight, he nonetheless offers to give Arthur money for college if he will bring Ben by the apartment and allow him to evangelize. While Arthur considers Victor's offer, he and Ben hire an attorney (Gina Aguilar) to consult for advice on getting married. Despite Ben's still being legally married to Tammy, the attorney counsels them to travel to Vermont, be wed in a civil union, and then return to California and attempt to be recognized as members of a domestic partnership. The two take her advice, and are wed in a private ceremony in Vermont. Suspicious of Arthur's lack of response to his monetary offer, Victor hires a private investigator to tail Ben and Arthur. The PI tells Victor about the men's marriage and their attempts to get their union recognized in California. In response, Victor follows the attorney home one evening and shoots her to death in her apartment's parking garage. At the same time, Tammy arrives at Arthur's apartment and tries to force Ben to take her back at gunpoint, but Ben successfully disarms her and throws her out. Following their attorney's death, Ben and Arthur agree to come to Victor's apartment. Rather than evangelize, Victor and another congregant from his church, Stan (Richard Hitchcock), lash out at the couple with homophobic insults and slurs. When Ben and Arthur leave, Victor and Stan start making plans to exorcise the couple by feeding them Holy Water that Stan has cooked in his kitchen. The plot fails, and Ben and Arthur leave town to enjoy a honeymoon in Hawaii and allow the tension with Victor to blow over. In Ben and Arthur's absence, Victor is summoned to church by his priest, Father Rabin (Bill Hindley). Rabin informs him that he is being excommunicated because the congregation does not want the relative of a gay person attending church services, fearful that he will bring them bad karma and negative energy. A dejected Victor reaches out to Stan for help, who helps Victor come to an agreement with Father Rabin that Victor will be permitted to rejoin the church if he successfully murders Ben and Arthur. To this end, they hire a hitman named Scott (Nick Bennet), whom Father Rabin has apparently used to kill gay people in the past. When Ben and Arthur return from Hawaii, Ben is gay bashed by Victor and Scott; the attack fails to kill him, and Ben is hospitalized. Suspecting his brother's involvement, Arthur breaks into Victor's apartment and taps his phone. After intercepting a call implicating Victor and Father Rabin, Arthur goes to Victor's church, chloroforms Father Rabin, and then murders him by burning the church down with him still inside. After Ben has sufficiently recovered, Arthur takes him back home to their apartment. Deciding that the next attempt on the men's lives must be more drastic, Victor and Scott go to Ben and Arthur's apartment with guns; at the last minute, Victor tells Scott that he wants to kill them himself and sends him away. Victor rings the apartment's doorbell, and when Ben answers, he fatally shoots him. He then forces Arthur to strip naked at gunpoint and performs an impromptu baptism in the bathtub. While Victor contemplates what he's done, Arthur slips away and gets the gun that Ben had earlier confiscated from Tammy. Dressed in a bathrobe and briefs, a hysterical Arthur‚Äîreenacting one of the final scenes of Scarface‚Äîpropositions Victor while holding him at gunpoint, accusing him of lashing out to try to combat his own repressed homosexuality. When Arthur fires a warning shot, Victor pulls out his own gun and shoots Arthur in the chest and back several times. In turn, Arthur manages to fire off a single shot which hits Victor in the forehead and instantly kills him, before Arthur dies of his own wounds.

Some of Victor's lines are still listed as belonging to \\"Victoria\\" in the film's final shooting script, although any references as to her relationship with Arthur have been excised.Ben and Arthur Movie Script Following the film's release, Sam Mraovich received numerous complaints that, although ostensibly a homophobe, the character of Victor is not only played by a gay actor but is portrayed as flamboyantly gay in the film (Michael Haboush, who plays Victor, is in fact openly gay and a veteran of gay pornography).IMDB entry for Michael Haboush Mraovich responded saying that the casting and direction were intentional, and meant to convey that Victor is a self-loathing gay man in the vein of James McGreevy: The film premiered at the Sunset 5 theater in West Hollywood. It was released on Region 1 DVD in the United States in early 2003 and was rereleased on January 24, 2018 through Amazon Prime as the former is out of print and expensive to buy. , the film has only earned $40,000, making it a box office bomb.The Official Site of the Movie Ben and Arthur Reception Rotten Tomatoes' editorial staff ranked it #15 on their list of \\"Films So Bad They're Unmissable\\", stating \\"If Tommy Wiseau's The Room is the over-wrought, melodramatic and self-pitying heterosexual camp classic of choice, then Sam Mraovich's Ben & Arthur is its gay equivalent.\\" Rotten Tomatoes went on to cite the poor production values and Arthur's \\"hissy fits\\", concluding that the quality of the film was so poor that \\"Mraovich might as well have shot his story of gay persecution and fightback on a cell phone\\".Movies So Bad They're Unmissable Pop culture review site insert-disc likewise compared it to The Room, stating \\"The Room was better than this.

Of the 4,440 ordered, about 950 were eventually completed. They remained in service throughout the 1920s but did not take part in any combat, and were phased out during the 1930s.  History  The United States entered World War I on the side of the Entente Powers in April, 1917, without any tanks of its own. The following month, in the light of a report into British and French tank theories and operations, the American Expeditionary Forces' commander-in-chief, Gen. John Pershing, decided that both light and heavy tanks were essential for the conduct of the war and should be acquired as soon as possible.Treat 'Em Rough! A joint Anglo- American programme was set up to develop a new type of heavy tank similar to those then in use by the British. It was, though, expected that sizeable quantities would not be available until April of the following year. Because of the wartime demands on French industry, the Inter-Allied Tank Commission decided that the quickest way to supply the American forces with sufficient armour was to manufacture the Renault FT light tank in the US. A requirement of 1,200 was decided, later increased to 4,400, and some sample Renault tanks, plans, and various parts were sent to the US for study. The design was to be carried out by the Ordnance Department, under the job title \\"Six-ton Special Tractor,\\" and orders for the vehicles placed with private manufacturers. However, the project was beset by problems: the French specifications were metric and incompatible with American (imperial) machinery; coordination between military departments, suppliers, and manufacturers was poor; bureaucratic inertia, lack of cooperation from military departments, and possible vested interests delayed progress. The Army in France was expecting the first 100 M1917s by April 1918, and 600 per month thereafter.Wilson, p80. In the event, production did not begin until the autumn, and the first completed vehicles emerged only in October. Two tanks arrived in France on November 20, nine days after the end of hostilities, and a further eight in December. In the summer of 1918, with no sign of the M1917s and US troops desperately needed at the Front, France supplied 144 Renault FTs, which were used to equip the US Light Tank Brigade. After the war, the Van Dorn Iron Works, the Maxwell Motor Co., and the C.L. Best Co. built 950 M1917s. 374 had cannons, 526 had machine guns, and 50 were signal (wireless) tanks. These were delivered to the Tank Corps, to complement about 200 Renault FTs brought back from France.  Visible differences from the Renault FT  The M1917 can be distinguished from the Renault FT by means of several external features. *The exhaust is on the left hand side instead of on the right *The FT mantlet for the machine-gun or 37mm cannon is replaced with a new design. *Solid steel idler wheels replaced the steel-rimmed wooden or seven-spoked steel ones on the FT *Additional vision slits are added to aid the driver . *All M1917s have a polygonal turret; none used the circular turret type fitted to approximately 50% of Renault FTs. *The frontal armour below the turret was also slightly modified.  Operational use  M1917 tank at the Canadian War Museum The M1917 did not take part in any combat, but was used domestically in various riots to quell mobs such as the Washington race riot of 1919 and the 1920 Lexington riot. In June 1920 the Tank Corps was abolished as a separate branch, and control of tanks handed to the infantry. The number of tank units was progressively reduced, and the vehicles mothballed or scrapped. Five accompanied the U.S. Marine Expeditionary Force (the China Marines) to Tientsin in April 1927 under General Smedley Butler, but there is no record of shots being fired. They returned to the US in late 1928.Zaloga, S.J. US Marine Corps Tanks of World War II (New Vanguard, 2012) p5. In July 1932 six M1917s were deployed in Washington D.C. during the dispersal of the Bonus Army. George S. Patton Jr. states in his diaries that these vehicles were carried in trucks as a deterrent, but contemporary film shows them moving on their tracks along Pennsylvania Avenue. It is not believed that any shots were fired. In 1940 the Canadian Army bought 250 surplus examples at scrap value (about $240 each) and the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps gained valuable experience and training on them before embarking to Europe and using more modern equipment. The Canadian Army took delivery of 236 surplus M1917s. Fifteen of them apparently went to Camp Borden for training use, while others went to train individual units such as the Fort Garry Horse and possibly another three.  Variant  M1917 A1: In 1929 an M1917 was fitted with a Franklin six-cylinder, 67 hp, air-cooled engine. This involved lengthening the engine compartment by approx. 1 foot. In 1930-31 seven M1917s were fitted with the 100 hp version of the Franklin. This raised the top speed to 9 mph.  Surviving examples  Approximately 20 M1917s survive.  Depiction in films  M1917s were used by U.S. film-makers on numerous occasions as a substitute for Renault FTs, to depict either American tank actions during World War I or Renaults in use by European armies during and after the War.

He also works as a visual artist, journalist and occasional actor. He divides his time between Toronto and Zurich. Curt Truninger is a Member of the European Film Academy. Biography =Personal Life= Truninger was raised in Lucerne, at the time an international centre for the visual arts. His father Ernst worked as a banker and in the travel business. His grandfather Ernst was a popular local politician, and restaurateur. Truninger developed an interest in film at an early age, especially the French cinema of Eric Rohmer, Francois Truffaut, and Andre Cayatte. As a teenager he met the renowned American photographer and editor of Camera magazine, Allan Porter, who kindled within him a love of photography and the associated arts. Through his mentorship with Porter, Truninger was introduced to many celebrated media and arts figures such as: Oliviero Toscani, Jann Wenner, and Timothy Leary. Truninger was also a UNICEF Ambassador and is an accomplished amateur athlete. =Work Life= After studying Social Sciences and Art History at Munich University, he graduated with a PhD from the University of Aberdeen, where he also taught. During this time Truninger was a member of \\"Chatham House\\" the think tank officially known as the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London. After leaving academia, Truninger returned briefly to Switzerland, where he worked for the Swiss public broadcaster SRF. During the 1980s he was host of the film programme Neu im Kino, and honed his writing skills working for Swiss and German print media as a film, cultural critic, and photographer. He then went to Munich, where he worked for the Bavarian Public Broadcaster BR, contributing to their Foreign Affairs programmes such as Weltspiegel. Soon thereafter, legendary German television journalist Reinhard Hoffmeister, lured Truninger to join the team of the Arts programme Aspekte. At the German Broadcaster ZDF he also wrote and directed documentaries and docu-dramas. Concurrently he hosted the talk show \\"Begegnungen\\", which was broadcast in all of Europe's German speaking regions. As a respected television journalist Truninger was granted unique access to the TV series Wagner where he conducted one of the last on-camera interviews with ailing star Richard Burton. His freelance work includes a documentary portrait of Richard Avedon, produced in collaboration with the iconic photographer himself. After a brief excursion directing music videos, Truninger made the leap to feature films in 1996 with Waiting for Michelangelo, a critically acclaimed romantic comedy about four friends lucky in life but unlucky in love. It featured popular Canadian star Roy Dupuis, and was shot in Toronto and Lucerne. The film, distributed by Channel 4 in London, went on to become one of the most widely distributed Swiss films. Truninger also co-wrote the original screenplay with his producer Margrit Ritzmann. In 2001 he made his second feature film Dead By Monday, a black romantic comedy about love and suicide, starring Helen Baxendale (Friends, Cold Feet) and Tim Dutton (Ally McBeal, Bourne Identity). The film had its theatrical premiere in Italy and went on to win first prize at both the Portland Festival of World Cinema and the Monaco Film Festival. It was co- produced with Wim Wenders' production company Road Movies Berlin. In 2008 Truninger and Ritzmann adapted the play What Happened Was by New York actor/playwright Tom Noonan, into the feature film The Rendezvous, starring Eva Birthistle (Ae Fond Kiss, Nightwatching) and Tim Dutton. The Rendezvous is a dark comic drama about two single legal co-workers whose attempt at a romantic evening result in an amusingly awkward revelation. The World Premiere took place at the Zurich Film Festival in October 2010. The film had its Canadian Premiere in Toronto in June 2011. The US premiere took place at the Myrtle Beach International Film Festival in South Carolina in spring 2012, where it won the Best Drama and Best Actress awards. As a result it received US theatrical release in October 2012. Also in 2012, Truninger contributed one of his paintings to the group show (Songbird ART) in Davos, Switzerland during the WEF. For his film The Rendezvous, Truninger also worked as the Production Designer under the alias of Sepp de Engelberg.

According to the book Ghost Towns of the Montana Prairie, the town was incorporated as Aldridge in 1906 but was earlier named Horr, and later Electric. Aldridge is a mining town that supplied coke and coal to the smelters for the Anaconda Copper Mining Company. Aldridge is located two miles north of the northern entrance to Yellowstone National Park.  History  According to an insert in the Park County News, the story of Aldridge begins when Major Horr discovered five coal veins on a side hill near Cinnabar in 1872. In 1882 Major Horr and his two sons formed the Horr Coal Company. After the company was passed down to his sons it was sold to H.F. Blake and the Horr Coal Company became the Park Coal Company. During Blake's control of the company iron ore ovens were erected to expand the company. In 1889 J.H. Conrad became the manager of the company. By this time 50 tons of coal and iron ore were produced daily to be sent to the Anaconda Copper Mining Company smelters in Butte, East Helena, Great Falls, and Anaconda. In 1894 the Park Coal Company was sold to entrepreneurs from New Jersey who turned it into the Montana CoalCompany. Under the management of Ware B. Gay, the Montana Coal Company was employing 400 men, and it became the largest producing iron ore company in the western United States. Prospectors from the Montana CoalCompany explored the nearby area of Horr and in 1892 discovered a rich coal vein near the Lake (later renamed Aldridge Lake). By June 1895 much of the mining activity near Horr started moving toward the lake where the \\"Camp at the Lake\\" was formed. In November, 200 men marched from the mines at Lake to the Montana Coal Company office in Horr to demand higher wages. The Montana Coal Company sent W.H. Aldridge from Helena to break the strike. After the strike was over (with the help of Mr. Aldridge) the mining camp was renamed Aldridge. With the completion of a conveyor from the mines at Aldridge to the iron ore ovens at Horr the Aldridge mines produced 300 to 500 tons of iron ore daily. With this, in 1897 the mines at Horr were abandoned and all mining operations were focused at Aldridge. The Aldridge mines were safe compared to other mines in the area. In the mine's operation history there was only one recorded accident on the site. According to the Anaconda Standard, on August 2, 1901 Thomas W. Thomas lost his life in the mine. Thomas was killed by an explosion. The cause of the explosion was never determined but could have been caused by explosive gas or an unexploded blast. In 1901 the Montana Coal and Coke Company was operating at maximum capacity in Aldridge. They employed over 500 men and shipped out over 650 train cars of coke per day. All the coal was mined on the 3,000 acres of land surrounding Aldridge, but in August 1904 the miners went on strike. This strike lasted a year and crippled the local economy. The company recovered but never returned to its past glory. Prior to 1904, an electric plant was built in Horr to supply the Montana Coal Company's mines and businesses with electricity. In 1904, Horr was renamed Electric because of the power plant built on the town site. With no mines operating in Electric, its economy survived by transporting iron ore to the smelters from its railhead. In 1906, with popular community support, Aldridge absorbed Electric and incorporated. Local newspapers predicted that Aldridge would become one of the most important coal and iron ore mining camps in the country. Although Aldridge had a bright future, the Montana Coal Company defaulted in payments of bonds in 1910. The default led to a suit with the company and the bondholders. The bondholders won the suit and the Montana Coal and Coke Company was sentenced to pay over 100,000 dollars. This debt led to the closure of all the mining operations in Aldridge. With the closure of the mines, Aldridge became a ghost town.  Today  Today there is no active mining, but there is still an abundance of coal deposits in the area. Some of the buildings of Aldridge have been torn down or relocated, but the other buildings are in ruins.

He writes on Persian and Arabic literature and contemporary history of Iran, Turkey, the Balkans and Afghanistan. He served on the UC Berkeley faculty for 45 years (from 1965 to 2010). Algar remains an active scholar and his research has concentrated on the Islamic history of the Perso-Turkish world, with particular emphasis on Iranian Shi'ism during the past two centuries and the Naqshbandi Sufi order. Algar is a Shia Muslim. Algar, who was born in England, later converted to Sunni Islam and later chose to follow Shia Islam. He has also translated books written by contemporary political Shiite theologians, like Ruhollah Khomeini's book Velayat-e Faqih and books written by Ali Shariati, Murteza Mutahhari and Sayyid Mahmoud Taleqani. Life and career After earning his B.A. with first-class honors in Oriental Languages (Arabic and Persian) at Trinity College, Cambridge, he was offered a scholarship to Tehran University in Iran, where he planned to work for his Ph.D. He then moved to Cambridge and defended his thesis in 1965. Algar wrote his Ph.D. on the political role of Shi'a religious scholars in the 19th century. Algar met with Khomeini in exile in Paris and on brief occasions in Iran after the revolution there in 1979. He translated selected writings and speeches of Khomeini for Islam and Revolution, and also gave his own account, The Roots of the Islamic Revolution in Iran. He considers the Iranian revolution \\"the most significant, hopeful, and profound event in the entirety of contemporary Islamic history.\\" He received his formal training in Islamic studies at Cambridge University. In Berkeley he taught courses including tafsir, Sufism, Shi'ism, the history of Islam in Iran, Arabic, Persian and Turkish literature. Algar is the author of more than 100 articles in the Encyclopedia Iranica. In regards to his conversion to Islam, Algar has said, \\"I don't look like the average person's idea of a Muslim.\\" Views and scholarly critiques Algar is described as \\"a seasoned scholar who knows his Islamic theology and modern Middle Eastern history\\". According to Algar, Wahhabis lie outside the wide orbit of Sunni Muslim orthodoxy. Algar criticizes the Saudi regime for supporting them as he believes the Wahhabism fed into movements such as the Taliban. He similarly charges United States for backing the Arabian Peninsula climate over the years. While his work on the political role of Shi'i clerics has been said to be 'an outstanding study of one of the most interesting periods of Iranian history', some sources find Hamid Algar's explanations of complex events on the theoretical plane as simplistic. Ervand Abrahamian refers to Algar's biography of Mirza Malkum Khan as \\"highly readable, well documented, and definitive\\" pointing out Algar's \\"meticulous scholarship\\". He does, however mention some of Algar's \\"minor\\" flaws in that work.Mirza Malkum Khan: A Study in the History of Iranian Modernism by Hamid Algar, Reviewed by Ervand Abrahamian Journal of the American Oriental Society Vol. 96, No. 2 (Apr. - Jun., 1976), pp. 308-309 Algar's translation of Arabic poetry has been described as a sensitive one which \\"often achieves a beauty and conviction equal to the original poem\\".An Anthology of Modern Arabic Poetry by Mounah A.

Work  = Science in the Private Interest = In his 2003 book Science in the Private Interest, Krimsky argues that conflicts of interests are perceived and regulated very differently in public affairs and in science: > The prophylactic measures that are taken to prevent conflict of interest in > public affairs are considered irrelevant in science precisely because > scientists view themselves as participating in a higher calling than that of > public officials‚Äînamely, the pursuit of objective knowledge. While senior > public officials (elected or appointed) are prohibited from managing their > portfolios during their tenure in office, scientists with patents and equity > in companies that fund their research are at most simply asked to disclose > their interests. Krimsky raises the concern that conflicts of interest may compromise the scientific norm of \\"disinterestedness\\", which \\"requires that scientists apply the methods, perform the analysis, and execute the interpretation of results without considerations of personal gain, ideology, or fidelity to any cause other than the pursuit of truth.\\" He claims that blurred boundaries between public interest science and pursuit of private gain have severely compromised the integrity of university science: > The evolving academic universe is no longer as nurturing an environment for > public-interest science as it once was. To a large degree, universities have > been taken over by money managers and academic entrepreneurs who are looking > for financially lucrative research. Krimsky argues that the profit motive has corrupted many scientists in biomedical research. He also proposes that the relationships between corporations, universities, and government agencies have resulted in biased science that puts human health and environment at risk. He has written and commented on genetically modified foods, water fluoridation, environmental health, global warming, and other controversial topics.A Conversation With: Sheldon Krimsky; Uncoupling Campus and Company, by Melody Petersen.

It signals the arrival of the Jewish Sabbath, welcoming the angels who accompany a person home on the eve of the Sabbath. Sources This liturgical poem was written by the kabbalists of Safed in the late 16th or early 17th century.It is first found in the Tikkune Shabbat, published in Prague in 1641, according to B.S.

If the house has been prepared for the Shabbat (\\"the lamp has been lit, the table set, and his couch spread\\"), the good angel utters a blessing that the next Shabbat will be the same, and the evil angel is forced to respond \\"Amen\\". but if the home is not prepared for Shabbat, the evil angel expresses the wish that the next Shabbat will be the same, and the good angel is forced to respond \\"Amen\\".Shabbat 119b. The custom of singing Shalom Aleichem on Friday night before Kiddush is now nearly universal, even though certain rabbinical authorities have expressed misgivings. The 18th century Rabbi Jacob Emden in his Sidur Beth Ya'aqov prayer book pointed out many problems regarding this song (addressing requests to angels, expressions that do not make sense, etc.). A similar attitude to the singing of Shalom Aleichem is attributed to Rabbi Elijah, the Vilna Gaon. Words The lyrics, in Hebrew, are as follows: The song in Hebrew is transliterated as follows: The words to the song translate as follows: Mizrahi (not Sefard) tradition includes a penultimate verse, beginning , \\"{In} [May] your rest [be] for peace ...\\" and the final verse has a {◊ë÷∞÷º} inserted in front of the ◊¶ which Koren claims does not change the meaning of the last verse.Koren Siddur Tefila, Mizrahi ed., 1988 Jerusalem, page 156; Orot Sephardic Shabbat Siddur, 1995 NJ, page 140; M. Nulman, Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer, 1993 NJ, page 291; but not found in the \\"Sefard\\" prayerbooks by Koren, ArtScroll, or de Sola Pool. This {◊ë÷∞÷º} is also present in Tikunei Shabbos, the earliest known printing of the poem; as is one before the {◊ë} of the second verse. Yaakov Chaim Sofer, in his work Kaf Hachayim, (262:16) notes: Rabbi Jacob Emden, in his prayerbook, Bet El (1745), criticized both the use of the hymn (on the grounds that supplications on the Sabbath and supplications to angels were inappropriate) and its grammar‚Äîarguing that the inclusion of the prefix ◊û÷¥ at the beginning of every second line (i.e., _mee-_ melech) was bad form, as it rendered the passage, \\"angels of the Most High, away from the King who rules over kings\\". He therefore deleted that ◊û÷¥, thereby reducing mi-melech to melech, and that deletion has been emulated in some other prayerbooks (apparently a small minority) such as Seligman Baer's Siddur Avodat Yisroel (1868), the Orot Sephardic, and Koren's Mizrahi (but not Koren's Ashkenaz or Sefard) prayerbook, although it makes the musical meter a bit awkward.B.S. Jacobson, The Sabbath Service (Sinai Publ'g, Tel-Aviv, English ed. 1981) pages 124‚Äì125; Siddur Avodat Yisroel page 196. Melodies Many different melodies have been written for Shalom Aleichem. The slow, well-known melody for the song was composed by the American composer and conductor Rabbi Israel Goldfarb on May 10, 1918 while sitting near the Alma Mater statue in front of Low Memorial Library at Columbia University, and first published later that year as \\"Sholom Alechem‚Äî◊©÷∏◊Å◊ú◊ï÷π◊ù ◊¢÷≤◊ú÷µ◊ô◊õ÷∂◊ù\\" in Friday Evening Melodies by Israel and his brother Samuel.Friday Evening Melodies‚Äî◊©◊ô◊® ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú ◊ú◊ú◊ô◊ú ◊©◊ë◊™, composed by Rabbi Israel Goldfarb and Samuel Eliezer Goldfarb, published by Bureau of Jewish Education, New York, 1981, pages 83‚Äì86. The famous Goldfarb song is often presumed to be a traditional Hasidic melody. I. Goldfarb wrote in 1963, \\"The popularity of the melody traveled not only throughout this country but throughout the world, so that many people came to believe that the song was handed down from Mt. Sinai by Moses.\\"http://www.kanestreet.org/wp- content/uploads/2008/09/hjbinder06sacred_music.pdf#page=6 In the Preface to \\"Friday Evening Melodies\\" the composers articulated the goal of avoiding the extremes of both the free-form emotive Eastern European musical liturgical style and the classical Western European musical structure of \\"Israel Emancipated.\\" A modern, exuberantly joyful version of this melody has been popularized by Idan Yaniv and Kinderlach; it was released in September 2009.https://soundcloud.com/mimyusof/kinderlach-idan-yaniv-shalom As one of her last acts, Debbie Friedman shared her version of \\"Shalom Aleichem\\" with Rabbi Joy Levitt. Friedman believed it was this song that would become her legacy. Another common melody, with a faster, more upbeat tempo was composed by Rabbi Shmuel Brazil.

She was married twice. By her first husband William Bonville, 6th Baron Harington of Aldingham, she was the mother of Cecily Bonville, who became the wealthiest heiress in England following the deaths in the Battle of Wakefield of Katherine's husband, her father-in-law; and less than two months later, of William Bonville's grandfather, William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville who was executed following the Yorkist defeat at the Second Battle of St Albans.

He was the most important and influential peer in the realm, and one of the principal protagonists in the Wars of the Roses. Her aunt, Cecily Neville, Duchess of York, mother of future kings and Katherine's first cousins, Edward IV and Richard III, was another key figure in the dynastic civil wars that dominated most of the latter half of 15th century England.

Both her father and first cousin, Edmund, Earl of Rutland were also executed after the battle, which had been commanded by Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset. Queen Margaret had not been present at Wakefield as she was in Scotland at the time raising support for the Lancastrian cause. Less than two months later, William's grandfather, William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville was decapitated on 18 February 1461 in an act of vengeance by Queen Margaret who was present and personally ordered his execution after the Yorkists suffered another defeat at the Second Battle of St Albans on the previous day.Thomas B.

The proclamation was followed by the decisive Yorkist victory on 29 March at the Battle of Towton in which Edward had served as commander of the Yorkist army and crushingly defeated the Lancastrians.

King Richard III of England, Katherine's first cousin who ordered the execution of her second husband, William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings  Execution of William Hastings  King Edward died on 9 April 1483; his son Edward V and kingdom were placed under the guardianship of his youngest brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester who was made Lord Protector of England. It was Katherine's husband William Hastings who advised Richard to take the young King Edward V into protective custody immediately following the death of Edward IV.Paul Murray Kendall, Richard The Third, pp. 162‚Äì63 It was about this time that Katherine's husband became the lover of Jane Shore, a former mistress of both King Edward IV and her son-in-law, Thomas Grey, Marquess of Dorset.Costain, pp. 378‚Äì79, Kendall, p. 204 The latter had married her eldest daughter, Cecily in 1474. Hastings had confided to his mistress his concern that his considerable power and influence was on the wane under the protectorate of Richard. She encouraged him to enter into a conspiracy with the Woodville family against the Lord Protector. Richard, upon discovering Hastings' treachery ordered his immediate execution, which took place on 13 June 1483 at the Tower of London. Several weeks later, Richard sealed an indenture, swearing to take Katherine directly under his protection and to > \\"secure for her the enjoyment of her husband's lands, goods, privileges, and > the custody not only of their heir until the boy came of age but also the > wardship of the young Earl of Shrewsbury who was married to their daughter, > Anne\\". Richard assured Katherine that Hastings would never be attainted, and that she would be defended against any attempt by intimidation or fraud to deprive her of her rights.Kendall, pp.209‚Äì210 Shortly after Hastings' death, on 26 June, Richard proclaimed himself King of England which was supported by an Act of Parliament known as Titulus Regius that declared his nephew King Edward V and his siblings illegitimate. He was crowned king on 6 July. In spite of Richard's promise to uphold her interests, his close friend and ally, Francis Lovell, 1st Viscount Lovell claimed that the Hastings manors of Ashby and Bagsworth, and the Beaumont estates belonged to him, although these had been left to Katherine following her husband's execution. In order for Katherine to retain these properties, she was compelled to pay Lovell the sum of 200 marks in cash and give him lands totalling the same amount per annum. Richard made no move to curtail the avarice of his friend, who had assumed a powerful role in the government during the King's brief reign.David Baldwin. The Kingmaker's Sisters: Six Powerful Women in the Wars of the Roses King Richard was killed at the Battle of Bosworth on 22 August 1485 and the Lancastrian victor, Henry Tudor subsequently ascended the throne as Henry VII. Katherine's eldest surviving son, Edward fought on the side of King Henry against Lovell at the Battle of Stoke in June 1487. This battle saw the final defeat of the House of York and Lovell, as one of the Yorkists' chief leaders, afterwards fled to Scotland; however, his eventual fate remains unknown.Baldwin Death Katherine never remarried. She herself died on an unknown date in early 1504 having left a will dated 22 November 1503, arranging her burial within the Lady Chapel at the parish church of Ashby de la Zouche, Leicestershire.

It was built by the Sons of Don in the north of Prydain, among the Eagle Mountains, intended to protect Prydain from further conquests by Arawn of Annuvin. A tall fortress on a hill dominated the cottages, shops and other buildings in the valleys below it; the stones used to make the fortress had a color similar to gold. The fortress of Caer Dathyl was not only a place of defense and a seat of royal power, but also served as a repository of literature and art of every variety from throughout Prydain. A grove of hemlocks was planted in one of its courtyards above the burial mounds of past kings and heroes, and storehouses preserved the treasures of craftsmen collected from every corner of the land. The Chief Bard also resides at Caer Dathyl, where he maintains the Hall of Lore and the Hall of Bards, both of which store many of the historical documents, songs, poems, and other items of literature. Access to the Hall of Bards was limited to official bards, though other people were permitted within the Hall of Lore. In The Book of Three, Prince Gwydion surmises that Arawn's war leader, the Horned King, intends to destroy Caer Dathyl with the army he rallied in the southern realms of Prydain. The story's protagonist, Taran, sets out with his companions to warn the people of Caer Dathyl of the attack, though he failed to reach the fortress before the vigilant Sons of Don met the Horned King's army in battle in the valley beyond Caer Dathyl. The battle ended decisively in the Sons of Don's favor when the Horned King himself was slain, sparing Caer Dathyl itself from any damage. After the battle, Taran and his companions were welcomed as heroes by the High King Math, and saw much of Caer Dathyl before returning home to Caer Dallben. Caer Dathyl saw battle again in the final book of the series, The High King. Gwydion designated it as the rallying point for all the armies in Prydain who were loyal to the Sons of Don, though only the armies of the northern realms and the Free Commots made it there before a fierce battle ensued. Pryderi, king of those western domains that were loyal to the Sons of Don, came to Gwydion and Math, demanding they either surrender to him and Arawn or fight them. His ultimatum was rejected, and the next morning his armies faced the defenders of Caer Dathyl in the snow-covered valley before the fortress, led by Gwydion, the Chief Bard Taliesin, and Taran. As evening approached, Pryderi's forces broke ranks and retreated, but were then joined by an army of Huntsmen of Annuvin and deathless Cauldron-Born sent from Annuvin. The Cauldron-Born slew the High King Math inside the gates of the fortress, and throughout the night they leveled Caer Dathyl in its entirety, killing all who stood in their way. After the conclusion of the war, Taran determined to rebuild Caer Dathyl, including the Hall of Lore and Hall of Bards, hoping to recover the knowledge preserved there as well as providing a place for future learning to be stored. This goal was eventually fulfilled during his reign as High King of Prydain.

Women and society Some Haitian scholars argue that Haitian peasant women are often less restricted socially than women in Western societies or even in comparison to more westernized elite Haitian women. They attribute this fact to the influence of African matriarcal systems and of the Haitian Vodou religion which places women at the center of society contrary to purely Judeo-Christian systems. Women priests (named mambos) play equal roles to male priests or Houngan in Haitian vodou. The sexual equality inherent to Haitian vodou translates into the inclusion of women in all aspects of society. Peasant women specifically, because of their proximity to vodou, have traditionally played a crucial role in Haitian life. Compared to their Latin- American counterparts, the participation of Haitian women in agriculture, commerce and industry has been high. During the US occupation of Haiti (1915-1934) peasant women actively participated in guerilla warfare and anti- US intelligence gathering to free the country. Because of their involvement in commerce, Haitian peasant women have accumulated resources independent of their mates in contrast to more westernized elite Haitian women. Political representation Michele Pierre-Louis, former Prime Minister has proven a fervent promoter of women's rights in Haiti The Haitian government contains a Ministry of Women's Affairs, but it also lacks the resources to address issues such as violence against women and harassment in the workplace. A number of political figures such as Michele Pierre-Louis, Haiti's second female Prime Minister, have adopted a determined agenda in order to fight inequalities and persecutions against women. Her position in office as Prime Minister has had positive effect on female political leadership in a country where the percentage of women in government at ministerial level was 25% in 2005.UNDP 2007/2008 Human Development Report, Haiti Factsheet  History of the Haitian women's movement  Women have been involved in social movements in Haiti since the battle for independence even if History does not recall their names. A women's movement emerged in Haiti in the 1930s during an economic crisis which is thought to have forced some middle-class Haitian women to work outside the home for the first time unlike peasant women who had always done so. This was also a time at which more elite women began to pursue post- secondary education and when L'Universit√© D'Etat d'Haiti opened its doors to women. The first Haitian woman to receive a secondary education graduated during this period in 1933. One of the first established feminist organizations in Haiti was called the Ligue F√©minine d'Action Sociale (Feminine League for Social Action) and was created in 1934. Its mostly elite initial members included: Madeleine Sylvain, Alice Garoute, Fernande Bellegarde, Th√©r√®se Hudicourt, Alice Mathon, Marie-Th√©r√®se Colimon, Marie- Th√©r√®se Poitevien. The Ligue was banned by the government two months after its founding. The league was reestablished when it agreed to study its goals instead of immediately implementing them. The league is credited for the granting of voting rights for women in 1957. In 1950, writer and feminist Paulette Poujol-Oriol joined the league. She later served as President of the League from 1997 until her death on March 11, 2011. She was also a founding member of L'Alliance des Femmes Haitiennes, an umbrella organization for more than 50 women's groups. Some women were appointed to government leadership positions under Fran√ßois Duvalier: Rosalie Adolphe (aka Madame Max Adolphe) was appointed head of the secret police Volontaires de La S√©curit√© Nationale, also known as the Tonton Macoute, while Lydia O. Jeanty was named Under- Secretary of Labor in 1957 and Lucienne Heurtelou, the widow of former President Dumarsais Estim√©, was Haiti's first female ambassador. Marie-Denise Duvalier nearly succeeded her father in 1971.  Sexual violence  Women in Haiti may suffer threats to their security and well-being because of rape, kidnapping and human trafficking. Women suffer the most from Haiti's chronic political instability. Documented cases of politically motivated rape, massacres, forced disappearance, and violent assaults on entire neighborhoods increased greatly at the end of 1993 under the military dictatorship of Raoul C√©dras. Reports from women's rights groups in Haiti revealed that women were targeted for abuse in ways and for reasons that men were not. Uniformed military personnel and their civilian allies threatened and attacked women's organizations for their work in defense of women's rights and subjected women to sex-specific abuse ranging from bludgeoning women's breasts to rape.Rape in Haiti: A Weapon of Terror, Human Rights Watch (HRW), 1 July 1994 The troubles before the 2004 coup were seen by most of the nationwide women's group as a reminder of the 1991‚Äì94 coup d'etat tactics with the use of rape, kidnapping and murders as forms of intimidation. If most of the feminist activists in Haiti campaigned for the election of Jean-Bertrand Aristide before his first term (1991‚Äì1995), many of them, especially intellectuals like Myriam Merlet or Magalie Marcelin, condemned how the first democratically elected president of Haiti ruled the country during his second term (2000‚Äì2004). Other observers, more favorable of the Fanmi Lavalas party, were more incline to criticised the period after the coup as a \\"rewind\\" back to the same dictatorship tactics, \\"a terror campaign employing rape, murder and disappearance as tactics, and rapidly increasing insecurity undermining all economic activity of the informal sector.\\"\\"Rewinding History: The Rights of Haitian Women\\" 2005 Report of the Let Haiti Live Women's Rights Delegation sponsored by the Ecumenical Program on Central America and the Caribbean (EPICA), January 2005. Obtained June 3rd 2009 To this day, Haiti is \\"gripped by shocking levels of sexual violence against girls\\"; of particular concern is the number of cases of sexual violence reported in the run-up to or during Carnival.Amnesty International, Press Release, Embargoed Until Noon, Thursday, Nov. 27, 2008. Obtained June 3, 2009 Amnesty InternationalAmnesty International launched a grass-roots campaign to send postcards to the Prime Minister of Haiti to remind her of her duty to protect Haitian women. The text of the letter was such: \\"Dear Prime Minister: I am writing to you to express my deep concern at the levels of sexual violence perpetrated against girls in Haiti, particularly during the carnival period. While the true extent of sexual violence against girls is not known, every year, in Port-au-Prince alone, dozens of girls report being raped at gunpoint by groups of young men. I therefore urge you and your government to implement all necessary measures to prevent rape and protect girls' right to live free from violence, to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice and that the victims receive adequate support and reparation. Yours respectfully,\\" and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights have laid particular pressure on the duty of the state to act in due diligence necessary to prevent and eradicate violence and discrimination against women. Though the MINUSTAH has come with a peace- keeping mandate, a number of cases have arisen where the UN soldiers were found to have abused women. Education Women‚Äôs Education History Women in Haiti do not benefit from an equal access to education, this has been an issue for a long time. When researching the history of women‚Äôs education in Haiti, there are no accounts that start before 1844 since a male dominated society with colonial origins didn‚Äôt allow girls and women to go to school. This changed with The Constitution in 1843 but the first account of a primary school establishment for girls in Port-au-Prince was in the following year, 1844. Although the political leadership tried to do something about the unequal education at that time, the economic and social barriers made it very difficult to reach that goal because it wasn‚Äôt as late as 1860 that there was a difference in the number of girls going to school. However, secondary school for women developed faster than the girls. Organized after the law of 1893, by 1895 the government had established six secondary institutions for women.Clement, Job B. ‚ÄúHistory of Education in Haiti: 1804-1915.‚Äù Revista De Historia De Am√©rica, no. 88, 1979, pp. 33‚Äì74. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/20139335. In comparison to other countries, Though most Latin American countries have achieved universal or near universal primary education for all children, for Haiti primary education, the enrollment rate of boys was still somewhat higher than that of girls by 1987. The Overall System The education system in Haiti is one that is underdeveloped. Although there are primary, secondary, and tertiary schools, attendance and graduation from these schools, and upper levels is low, being that the majority of the population are combating poverty and are focused on labour income in order to live. How the system is structured is that formal education begins at preschool followed by 9 years of fundamental education. Starting from the second year of secondary education, students are allowed to seek vocational training programs. Higher education after the completion of second year studies is not common but highly appraised being that most children don‚Äôt have the chance to begin in the first place. Tuition rates have dramatically increased in the past starting from the preschool level. What once cost 1628 gourdes ($41) in 2004, increased to 4675 gourdes ($117) in 2007. This increase was 187% in the 3 years that most families simply cannot afford,Suzata, Eriko. 2011. Education in Haiti: An Overview of Trends, Issues, and Plans. World Innovative Summit for Education. Retrieved 24 November 2012. [20]Archived 14 September 2012 at the Wayback Machine especially for families in rural Haiti. The rural-urban difference is also considerable as nearly 25% of the women in urban areas have finished secondary school, compared with less than 2 percent in rural areas. Overall, according to a study by the Haitian Institute of Statistics and IT, 39% of Haitians has never attended school. There‚Äôs a high percentage especially in the 6-12 age range that‚Äôs at 37.7%. Situations only worsened after the 2010 earthquake. Post 2010 Earthquake More than 4,000 schools (preschool fundamental, secondary, higher education, and vocational institutions) were damaged and over 1,200 destroyed. The deaths of teachers and students were plenty more. The entire education system had to be shut down, not least because the Ministry of Education itself collapsed.UNICEF (2011) Children in Haiti: One year adter- The long road from relief to recovery, New York: UNICEF ‚Äú With a lack of stable infrastructure. supplies, and a high demand for educated school officials, children, especially women, had to help their family in informal ways. A pre-earthquake study by the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights concluded that almost all Haitian girls work in the informal market, primarily between the ages of 5 and 9. Although sources would like to announce that educational inequality is narrowing as the average growth enrollment has been significantly greater for girls than for boys, it is simply not the case. As of 2015, only 60.7% of the population is literate.The Central America :: Haiti ‚Äî The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agencyhttps://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world- factbook/geos/ha.html Males are more educated, about 64.3% of them know how to learn and write while women, constricted by gender roles and violence are only at 57.3%. d‚ÄôAdesky, Anne-Christine. ‚ÄúThe Haiti Gender Shadow Report‚Äù 2010 Haiti Equality Summit.

The banshees in old Irish folklore were often presented as grieving women who were keening (weeping/mourning) for the dead. This appears in the Darby O'Gill and the Little People DVD extra I Captured the King of the Leprechauns (originally a Walt Disney Presents or Wonderful World of Disney episode, telling viewers about the making of, and some of the folklore which inspired parts of, the movie Darby O'Gill and the Little People), in which the banshee is \\"keening for the young O'Brien\\" and is in no way a pernicious or threatening character, but merely seen as a dark or sad omen because she appears before people die. She does not cause deaths, she mourns for the dead (or, eerily, the soon-to-be-dead). The banshee in American popular culture (possibly starting with Darby O'Gill and the Little People, in which some characteristics of later American pop culture banshee behaviour can be seen) is typically a threatening and/or menacing figure who causes death and/or destruction (thereby taking on characteristics belonging traditionally more to the Morrigan than to the banshees). Animation *The 1959 Disney movie Darby O'Gill and the Little People contains a scene where the title character encounters a pernicious banshee. *The Real Ghostbusters episode \\"Banshee Bake a Cherry Pie?\\" depicts a banshee masquerading as an Irish pop singer and aiming to use its voice to take over the world. *The 1990s animated television series Gargoyles episode \\"The Hound of Ulster\\" is about Irish folklore and features a banshee as the main antagonist. The Irish-ethnicity characters for that particular episode, set in modern Ireland turn out to be characters from old Irish folklore, reborn in the present time. The episode's main character, Rory Dugan, who turns out to be C√∫ Chulainn, has a childhood friend Molly who turns out to be the Banshee. In a later episode, the Banshee is dragged back to Avalon by the Weird Sisters, where Oberon removes her voice as punishment for ignoring his summons. *The 1999 animated television series Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens, Myths and Legends premise was that aliens had been living among humans for ages, and were the origins of many of the creatures humans know from myth, folklore and legends, including a clan of banshees as the main antagonist. *A banshee is mentioned two times in episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants. **In the episode \\"Grandpappy The Pirate\\", Grandpa Redbeard mistakess Pearl for a Banshee. **In the episode \\"Not Normal\\", SpongeBob disturbs Squidward from his mid-morning nap by running up and down and laughing around his house.

Samhain is raised from hell by two powerful witches, and once risen, summons ghosts, zombies and ghouls to kill everyone around. He is later exorcised psychically by Sam Winchester and sent back to Hell after all efforts to kill him failed. He was shown to be an incredibly powerful demon. * Samhain, Glenn Danzig's gothic metal/punk rock band, was named after the festival. * In the film Halloween II, the killer Michael Myers writes Samhain on a school chalk board in blood. * In Bernard Cornwell's The Warlord Trilogy, a modern and realistic interpretation of Arthurian Britain, the Samhain is commemorated as the most important celebration by the Celtic pagan characters, and is mentioned by the protagonist, Derfel Cadarn, as the day when the spirits of the dead roam among the living and when the Druidic magic, represented by Merlin and Nimue weakens. * In the film Halloween III: Season of the Witch a business tycoon wishes to return Halloween to its sacrificial roots of Samhain. * Samhain is a \\"day\\" in the MMO game, Mabinogi. * In the beginning of an episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Dr. Weird proclaims 'Samhain forever!' before the opening theme. * In the video game Folklore, the night of Samhain is major plot point that sets off the events of the title and the entrance to the Netherworld. * Swedish black metal band Marduk have a song called A Samhain Fire as a bonus track on their 2001 release, La Grande Danse Macabre * The animated TV series Ugly Americans has a holiday called Samhain. * In the comic book series Hack/Slash the Samhain is an agent of the Black Lamp Society, a cult worshiping slashers. *In the Fever Series by \\"Karen Marie Moning\\", Samhain is the night when rituals are performed to keep the Fae Walls from breaching, unleashing evil fae into the world. *True Bloods final episode of season 4 references Samhain multiple times ‚Äì though even Wiccan characters mispronounce it as \\"samma-hane\\". *Samhain is a holiday event in The Secret World MMO game. *Samhain is mentioned in the BBC TV show Merlin. In season 4, episode 1 they are celebrating the festival of Samhain. ‚ÄúIt was on the stroke of midnight of Samhain's eve. The moment when the Veil between the worlds is at its thinnest...‚Äù ‚Äî Gaius (Played by Richard Wilson) * In the adventure game King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow, Samhain is one of the names of the Lord of the Dead, whom Alexander can encounter (while still alive). This meeting is one of the things required to get the good ending in that game, as part of getting said ending is to bring Princess Cassima's parents back to life. Miscellaneous =Geas/Geis= * In the Discworld novel Sourcery, the great hero \\"Nijel the Destroyer\\" claims to have a geis, which Rincewind mistakes for a type of bird. In A Hat Full of Sky, Rob Anybody is put under a geis by his wife Jeannie, the kelda, to protect Tiffany Aching from the Hiver. * In the novel Operation Chaos by Poul Anderson, every military recruit is put under a geis which prevents panic and assures loyalty. It can be broken only if the individual gives free consent, and is removed when the person returns to civilian life. *In The Jennifer Morgue by Charles Stross, members of an occult branch of British intelligence can cast geasa. * In Geis of the Gargoyle by Piers Anthony, Gary Gargoyle, being a gargoyle, has a geis on him since Xanth began, and it is a magical compulsion to protect the purity of the Swan Knee River. However, the pollution from Mundania (the 'real world') has gotten out of hand, and it is up to Gary to place his geis on the philter to keep all of Xanth's water clean. * Some role-playing games mention geasa as \\"spells\\" or \\"powers\\", though these \\"geasa\\" are often only loosely inspired by the historical concept. For instance, in Dungeons and Dragons there are two such \\"spells\\": \\"lesser geas\\", which forces the victim to obey a command issued by the caster, and \\"geas/quest\\", which is much the same but with more severe penalties.Dungeons&Dragons; 3.5: Geas / Quest, d20srd.org In the game Runequest, initiates of certain cults take on geases that are closer to the historical concept. ** In the video game Wild ARMs 2 the character Brad is forced to wear a collar called a \\"Geas\\" (or \\"Geass\\") that will explode, causing his death, if he does not follow the orders of those who placed the collar on him. In this sense, the character Lynn in the film Saw III can be considered to be under the effect of a Geis/Geas, as the collar she wears will explode, ending her life, if she does not fulfill the condition of saving John's life. ** In the science fantasy role-playing game Shadowrun, a geas is a self-adopted restriction on magical abilities that allows them to retain full potency some of the time (for example, when intoxicated or at night) by making them completely unavailable whenever conditions are not met. * In the anime series Code Geass the main character, Lelouch, obtains an ability called Geass that allows him to make anyone who gazes into his left eye obey any single order unquestioningly, though it cannot work on the same person twice. ** Several other characters receive different powers by the same source of Lelouch (immortal beings named Code, once Geass-holder themselves). True to the original source, the Geass is a gift from the Code, specific to the individual and bound by rules. * In a 1964 short fantasy story \\"A Case of Identity\\" by Randall Garrett, one of the characters, a homicidal psychopath by nature, is mentally restrained by a spell called geas, \\"which forces him to limit his activities to those which are not dangerous to his fellow man\\". * In the Halo franchise, the Forerunner Lifeworkers have the ability to impose genetic commands on the target species, which can lay dormant or stay active for thousands of years. Using this, the Forerunner known as the Librarian imposed a broad geas on mankind (which resulted in the Spartan program, the creation of AI's, and the ability to operate Forerunner technology). * In Clark Ashton Smith's story \\"The Seven Geases\\", a man hunting in the mountains encounters a mage whom he offends, and he is then placed under a series of geases, or curses of demanded obedience, that take him sequentially into the caves and through a series of ever-nastier groups of beings who pass him in turn onto others - seven in all. He does not survive. * In Henry H. Neff's The Tapestry, Max McDaniels is under the effects of two geasa; He cannot deny a dying wish, and he cannot knowingly kill his kin.

He served as a Lieutenant Governor in Nigeria, Governor and Commander-in-Chief of The Gambia and Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Cyprus.Sir Richmond Palmer, Obituaries, The Times 26 May 1958 Early life Palmer was born in 1877 in Lancaster to Robert Palmer of The Bank House, Kirkby Lonsdale and Mary Chippendall, who were married on 11 May 1867 at Lancaster Priory. Mary was the great-granddaughter of John Higgin who was Governor of Lancaster Castle from 1783 to 1833. Palmer was educated at Oundle School in Northamptonshire, being recorded in 1895 as an exceptional batsman. He went up to Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1896 as a scholar reading Classics. He was awarded his BA in 1899, and his Bachelor of Laws a year later. While at Cambridge, he played club rugby for Cambridge University and was awarded a Blue, playing wing three-quarter, in 1899 in the rugby Varsity match against Oxford. In 1899 he became a member of Percy Carpmael's invitational touring team, The Barbarians.Starmer-Smith, Nigel The Barbarians Macdonald & Jane's Publishers (1977) pg. 228 He worked his passage to San Francisco as a stoker in 1903 to explore opportunities in mining. He was called to The Bar on 15 June 1904 and was admitted to the Middle Temple. He was awarded Master of Arts in 1910. Colonial Service =Nigeria= Palmer spent the greater part of his long official service in Nigeria. His first posting was under Lugard, High Commissioner of the Northern Nigeria Protectorate, a position held by Lugard until 1906. Palmer was appointed an assistant Resident in the Provinces of Nigeria in 1904. One of his early acts was to work towards the abolition of slavery that was still to be found in the Northern Provinces. The appointment of Palmer as Resident in 1905 was a turning point in the history of British rule in Katsina. When he assumed office, the first task which Palmer accomplished was the re-organization of districts, in which nineteen new districts were created. Each of these was placed under the jurisdiction of a district head responsible to the Emir. The newly created districts were further divided into sub-districts, to allow for proper administration of the Emirate from the grassroots. Palmer installed Muhammadu Dikko as Emir of Katsina in 1906 largely due to his co-operation with the British administration. This was an early example of Palmer adopting the Lugard doctrine of Indirect Rule. He was one of the most prominent of the band of political officers who guarded and guided the destinies of the Northern Nigerian Emirates and other political units, in the formative years round about 1910. By 1911, Palmer was Commissioner of Native Revenue in the north of the country. Their planning was accepted and confirmed by Lugard on his return.Lethem, Sir Gordon, The Times, 3 June 1958 In 1912, Lugard returned from Hong Kong to Nigeria as Governor of the northern and southern protectorates. Lugard's main mission was to complete the amalgamation into one colony. Although controversial in Lagos, where it was opposed by a large section of the political class and the media, the amalgamation did not arouse passion in the rest of the country. From 1914 to 1919, Lugard was Governor General of the now combined Colony of Nigeria. Palmer acted as Resident of Kano Province between 1915 and 1916 and, in 1917, was promoted to Resident of Bornu Province. He maintained the relationships which Lugard has established with the Sokoto Caliphate and the Sultan of Sokoto and, as Lugard, worked through Nigerian traditional rulers. Palmer was a staunch advocate of the principles of Indirect Rule or devolved colonial administration which had been devised by Lugard and his successors in the government of Northern Nigeria. It greatly enhanced the prestige and influence of the traditional Muslim emirs and contributed to the rapid spread of Islam during the colonial era. The position of the Emirs was supported by Palmer and he strongly opposed the work of Christian missionaries, for example in Borno, contrary to the views of the Governor, Sir Hugh Clifford. Owing to the Great War, the duties of senior administrative officers in Northern Nigeria were especially arduous at that time. By the end of 1917 some 6,600 troops had been dispatched to East Africa to take part in the operations against Von Lettow's forces, and a further 1,800 were awaiting transport ‚Äì a serious depletion of the garrison of the country. Palmer carefully considered the effects of the War on the Muslim provinces and was highly critical of the French Administration in their colony nearby Palmer studied the culture, languages and literature of Africa becoming an outstanding Hausa and Arabic scholar and an acknowledged authority on civilisation and literature of Hausa and Fulani. Throughout the Northern Nigeria Protectorate there were then thousands of Muslim schools in which practically the entire time of the pupils was occupied in learning by heart and in writing portions of the Koran. Palmer, who was deeply interested in education, was anxious to improve on this system, and it was natural that he should turn his eyes towards the Gordon College at Khartoum, where important steps had been taken to improve Muslim education in the Sudan. He therefore made an arduous and adventurous journey in 1918 across Central Africa from Borno by way of Wadai and Darfur to the Sudan. This visit bore fruit when a training college for Muslim teachers was opened in 1922 at Katsina and attracted a promising number of candidates. Palmer acted as Lieutenant Governor of Northern Nigeria from 1921, and was promoted to the substantive appointment in 1925 based in Kaduna. Sir Richmond Palmer Government House, Kaduna 1926 He was a first class administrator described as \\"capax imperii\\", capable of (ruling the) Empire, with his understanding and study of languagesWest Africa, 22 June 1929 and was referred to locally as \\"Judgey\\", being the highest judicial authority. In 1919 steps had already been taken to develop the important cotton and ground-nut industries, and experimental work in tobacco cultivation had been started. Later, in 1926, work was begun on a scheme for utilising the waters of the Kaduna River for the supply of the town. Progress was also made in the construction of new European hospitals at Enugu, Jos and Kano in the province. Another important event was the journey undertaken by Palmer from Lagos to Lake Chad in March and April, this being the first occasion on which the entire distance had been traversed by motor transport. During the 26 years spent by Palmer in various part of Northern Nigeria much of his leisure was occupied in attempts to find data for the completion of a true history of the more important units of ruling races, such as the Fulbe and Kanuri of Borno.Hiribarren, Vincent, ‚ÄòA European and African Joint-Venture: Writing a Seamless History of Borno (1902-1960)‚Äô, History in Africa, 40 (2013), 77‚Äì98. In his journey across Africa in 1918, he was able to obtain first-hand information on matters connected with this subject. The results of these studies were embodied in a work entitled Sudanese Memoirs, the last volume of which was published in 1928. This work was supplemented by a book entitled The Bornu Sahara and Sudan and published in 1936. In December 1929, Palmer argued strongly for decentralisation of funding to leave discretion of expenditure to be determined within the Northern Provinces. He was not able to persuade the Governor Sir Graeme Thomson nor the Secretary of State of the merits of allowing an overall budget to be allocated to the Lieutenant Governor. This issue remains a matter of debate to this day. It may be that this dispute prompted his move to The Gambia. His departure from Nigeria was announced in February 1930. =The Gambia= In September 1930, Palmer was promoted to Governor and Commander-in-Chief of The Gambia. In this colony he was naturally faced with problems on a smaller scale than in the vast territories of Northern Nigeria, but in 1931 he was called upon to deal with a serious outbreak of rinderpest and pleuropneumonia among the native cattle. In 1932 he effected more continuity in the administration of the Protectorate by the establishment of a definite administrative headquarters in each of the four provinces with provincial offices which were to remain open for business throughout the Year. A small collection of artefacts from megalithic circles in The Gambia can be found in the British Museum's study collection that was donated by Palmer.British Museum Collection On 12 April 1933, he left Africa. =Cyprus= On 8 November 1933, Palmer became Governor and Commander-in Chief of Cyprus. Cyprus had been annexed by Britain when the Ottoman Empire joined with Germany and Austro-Hungary in World War I and, in 1925, had become a British Crown Colony. In 1931, there had been serious riots of Greek Cypriots demanding Enosis, the union with Greece. Government House in Nicosia had been burned down. He also arrived in the middle of a two years' drought which brought the Cypriots to the brink of famine, destroyed a great proportion of their crops and livestock, and added to their heavy burden of debt.The Times, 3 May 1939 Palmer therefore found himself having to govern at a difficult time of high tensions in the island with Cypriots seeking self- determination. One of the causes was failure of Colonial officials in too many cases to learn Greek or Turkish, the languages of the island, and of their consequent lack of touch with the inhabitants. Palmer insisted upon a knowledge of these languages. His rule in Cyprus was a strict one and his style of leadership was known to the people of Cyprus as \\"Palmerist dictatorship\\"Holland, Robert, Britain and the Revolt in Cyprus, 1954-1959 (Oxford; New York: Clarendon Press ; Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 12. or \\"Palmerocracy\\" (). There he completed the scheme for the improvement of the port of Famagusta. A scheme for the reconstruction and development of the port was started in May 1931, and all work under contract was completed in March 1933. Subsidiary work on the scheme was completed in 1935, and the new harbour, which could not previously take ships of more than 2,000 tons, was enlarged to accommodate ships of from 8,000 to 9,000 tons. He retired on 4 July 1939. =Honours= He was awarded several honours throughout his career, being appointed C.M.G in 1922, C.B.E in 1924 and K.C.M.G in 1933. He was also appointed a Knight of Grace of the Order of St. John on 22 May 1936. Later life Palmer returned to Langham House, Oakham in Rutland. In July 1940, after his family were evacuated to the United States of America, he went to live in Keswick to practice law providing legal aid. He wrote extensively about his African experiences in retirement. Publications He wrote a number of translations of Arabic texts associated with the countries in which he worked: * History of the First Twelve Years of the Reign of Mai Idris Alooma of Bornu, Lagos (1926) reprinted London (1970) * Sudanese Memoirs: Being Mainly Translations of a Number of Arabic Manuscripts Relating to the Central and Western Sudan, 3 volumes, Lagos (1928), reprinted London (1967) * The Bornu, Sahara and Sudan, London (1936) He wrote the Foreword and arranged the publication of The Occupation of the Hausaland: Being a Translation of Arabic letters found in the House of the Wazir of Sokoto, in 1903, collected by Major G Merrick and translated and edited by Mr H F Backwell, Lagos (1927). He also contributed to anthropological journals: * Notes on some Asben records, Journal of the African Society vol 9 ‚Äì 1909‚Äì10, ‚Äì pp. 388‚Äì400 * An early Fulani conception of Islam, Journal of African Society XIV, ‚Äì 1914‚Äì15, ‚Äì pp. 53‚Äì59 * Western Sudan history : the Raudth√¢t'ul Alf√¢ri, Journal of the African Society15 -, 1915‚Äì16, ‚Äì pp. 261‚Äì73 * History of Katsina, Journal of the African Society, 26, 103, ‚Äì April 1927, ‚Äì pp. 216‚Äì236 * The Kano Chronicle, Journal of the Anthropological Institute, 38 ‚Äì 1909 ‚Äì pp. 58‚Äì98 Family Margaret Isabel Smith He married Margaret Isabel Smith on 7 June 1924 at St Michael and All Angels in Waterford, the Archbishop of York Cosmo Gordon Lang officiating. Margaret Isabel was the daughter of Reginald Abel Smith J.P.,of Goldings near Waterford and Hon. Margaret Alice Holland, the daughter of Henry Holland, 1st Viscount Knutsford and Margaret Trevelyan (niece of Lord Macaulay). They had two daughters. Their elder daughter, Jenifer, married Edward Anthony Watson Bullock, younger son of Sir Christopher Bullock. Their younger daughter, Virginia, married Sir Paul Studholme Bt.

It is a frame house built in 1746, one of the rare pre-Revolutionary frame houses in the Rhinebeck area. Its current appearance reflects renovations made circa 1800, and the interior was altered in the 1830s. It is currently owned by the town and used for storage. In 2000 it was damaged in a fire, leading to some additional renovations and repairs. In 2003 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Building The house is on a wooded lot on the east side of Route 9, the remainder of the much larger original farm. It is a one-and-a-half-story, five-bay clapboard-sided frame house on a stone foundation. The main block is long by wide. A 12-foot-square (4 m) one-story flat-roofed wing projects from the south. Its gabled saltbox- profile roof is surfaced in seamed metal with a shallow cornice at the front. Siding on the front is modern plywood, installed after the original facade was destroyed in a fire. The main entrance is located in the center. It leads to a central interior hall with large rooms on either side and a matching exit in the rear. A staircase to the second story is also in the rear. The interior rooms are currently vacant, used for storage. An original mantelpiece and fireplace were located in the north end, but these have been removed and boarded up due to the damage caused by the fire. The second story has also been severely damaged. The basement retains the most original character of any room in the house. There is one outbuilding on the property, a three-bay gabled barn to the east. It is considered to be a contributing resource to the Register listing since it is built around the remnant of an original Dutch barn. Among those remnants is the center pole, which an inscription dates to 1770. There are also the remnants of another barn and well to the rear. History The first owner associated with the house was Franz Neher, one of the original Palatine German settlers of the area. He had come to New York from Birkenfeld with his father, Karel, as a boy in the 1710s. Karel's name appears on tax records in the area until his death in 1733. Franz is listed as the resident of the house on a contemporary map published by a local church. He served as a captain during the French and Indian War and later appears to have taken up shoemaking as a trade. In 1762 the records of local landowner Robert Livingston show that a Ludowick Elseffer became the lessee of the property, then in size. His descendants would own the property until its last resident, Karen Losee. They modified the exterior around 1800, and renovated the interior in the 1830s, moving the staircase further back and plastering the ceilings, which previously exposed rafters. In 1872 the south wing was added, the last significant change to the house. After it became vacant, it was damaged by a fire in 2000. The front facade had to be resided, and the north chimney and its fireplace and mantel were removed and boarded up. These actions further compromised the heavily damaged second story. The property was later donated to the local Quitman Resource Center, which plans to restore the house and use it as a museum. In 2002 it received a grant from the Preservation League of New York State to do a historic structure report on the house. Two years later, in 2004, it received a $25,000 matching grant from the state to restore the rear wall and do archaeological research.

History Sioux County was organized on January 20, 1860, on land occupied by the indigenous Sioux until they were forced to abandon it under the terms of the fourth Treaty of Prairie du Chien in 1830. The original courthouse was a log structure on the Big Sioux River in the hamlet of Calliope, Iowa (now part of Hawarden).

The courthouse was sold off soon after the Whites returned, when after a referendum in 1872 the county seat was moved to Orange City. Sioux County had no central county offices until the present courthouse was finished over 30 years later. With the approval of a bond issue, Sioux County selected W.W. Beach (1872‚Äì1937) as its architect. Beach had been born in 1872, the same year that the county seat was moved to Orange City. His birthplace was Alton, in Sioux County, just three miles east of the new county seat. Beach had established his architectural practice in Sioux City only in 1899, with his first major commission being the Main Hall (later Lewis Hall) for Morningside College in that city. By the time the Sioux County Courthouse was completed, Beach had hired promising young William L. Steele (1875‚Äì1949) as his draftsman, and the two would later form a brief partnership. Construction on the courthouse began in June 1902, but the construction company went bankrupt, delaying completion until October 1904. Just five years later, lightning destroyed the top of the tower in 1907, and it was replaced with a hip roof and a 10-foot-tall cast bronze statue personifying Justice (Vrouwe Justitia). The clock mechanism was built by E. Howard & Co. and was originally weight-driven, requiring staff to \\"wind\\" the clock frequently. As electricity became prevalent, the clock was converted to use an electric motor, making it easier to maintain and more accurate. Most of the original clock was preserved during this upgrade. The building was extensively renovated in 1976‚Äì1982, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Architecture Beach's design is classic, muscular Richardsonian Romanesque, an architectural style developed by Henry Hobson Richardson. Although of high quality, its timing is unusual, since that style was associated with the late 1880s rather than the early 20th century. More typically in Iowa or nearby South Dakota at this time, public buildings were done in a classical revival style, influenced by the World's Columbian Exposition, held in Chicago in 1893. However, two nearby South Dakota counties had built Richardsonian Romanesque courthouses just prior to this time: Union County (Elk Point, 1898) and Lincoln County (Canton, 1899). A deep rusticated arch forms the principal entrance at the base of the courthouse central tower, which is six stories tall. Doors and windows appear to be cut deeply into the dark red sandstone, and the effect is heightened by the light buff sandstone trim.

The operation was initiated by Office Antyk of the Home Army‚Äôs Bureau of Information and Propaganda. Begun in November 1943, it was directed by Tadeusz ≈ªenczykowski. ≈ªenczykowski Tadeusz, Encyklopedia WIEM Operation Antyk was a twin to the Home Army‚Äôs earlier and more famous counter-propaganda activity, Operation N.  Beginnings  After creation of the pro-Soviet Polish Workers Party (January 5, 1942), communist activists began propaganda attacks aimed at the agency of the Government in Exile, the Government Delegation for Poland, and its armed wing, the Home Army. Headquarters of the Home Army, together with the Delegation, decided to found special departments called ‚ÄúK‚Äù, whose tasks was to collect counter- propaganda materials, influence the propaganda in underground press, also inspire activities of anticommunist political parties. However, these were not enough, and on October 26, 1943, the Home Political Representation created Social Anticommunist Committee (SKA), which was supposed to neutralize activities of the Polish Workers Party.  Objectives  The Social Anticommunist Committee was directly linked with Office Antyk of the Home Army‚Äôs Bureau of Information and Propaganda, created in November 1943. Also, some propaganda activities were carried out by the Department I of the Government Delegation, as well as the underground press. In late 1943 and early 1944, several Local Social Anticommunist Committees were created. The main task of the Operation Antyk was to show the nation lies of the Communist propaganda, and to raise awareness of the real purpose of the Soviets, which was to deprive Poland of its independence. Therefore, in underground papers, brochures, and leaflets, plans of the Soviet Union were frequently described.  Activities  Operation Antyk brought out, among others, a weekly called Glos Ludu (People's Voice), which was targeted at the inhabitants of the countryside. The magazine‚Äôs publisher, the Bureau of Information and Propaganda, was not mentioned in the headline, because the operation was top secret, even in the structures of the Home Army. People's Voice was a radical anticommunist magazine, with such articles, as: * Soviet Fifth Column, * Brown Hitlerism-Red Stalinism, * PPR - Soviet Agenture, * Russia - Always the Same, * PPR is creating the Soviets in Poland, * Bataliony Chlopskie condemn the PPR. Also, Soviet Union was attacked by using the analogies to the Nazi Germany, with such expressions, as NKVD - Gestapo, or Hitlerism - Bolshevism. At the same time, some of the Communist proposals for postwar Poland, such as land reform, were left untouched, as these were also supported by the publishers of the magazine. Another publication was a biweekly Wolnosc Robotnicza (Laborer's Freedom), published since November 1943, with circulation of some 7 000. It contained articles similar to those published in the People's Voice, but also current information from the frontlines, as well as anti-Nazi propaganda. Also, several brochures and leaflets were printed, in which history of Polish - Soviet relations was summarized. One of these brochures was titled Polish - Soviet Conflict in documents and official utterances. February 1943 - February 1944, another one was titled Red Targowica. Leaflets, with titles such as We will not end up in a kolkhoz, presented totalitarian face of the Soviet regime. In February 1944, after creation of the parliament-like, Communist political body State National Council, a leaflet was published, signed by 23 parties and political organizations. It was entitled A response to the KRN's manifesto. Also, on the walls of several buildings in occupied Poland, slogans were painted, such as: PPR - traitors, PPR - the enemy, PPR - paid servants of Russia. Antyk should not be confused with the Social Anti-Communist Committee (Spo≈Çeczny Komitet Antykomunistyczny, SKA), an organization set up by the Home Political Representation on 26 October 1943, headed by Franciszek Bia≈Ças. Social Anti- Communist Committee coordinated anti-communist propaganda activity among the main political groups and organizations of the Polish Underground State; it also cooperated closely with AK's Operation Antyk. Spo≈Çeczny Komitet Antykomunistyczny, Encyklopedia WIEM =Anti-Semitic propaganda= Antyk was led by operatives who held strong anti-communist and anti-Jewish views, including the zydokomuna stereotype. The perceived association between Jews and communists was actively reinforced by its publications, including its initial reports that \\"tended to conflate communists with Jews, dangerously disseminating the notion that Jewish loyalties were to Soviet Russia and communism rather than to Poland,\\" and which repeated the notion that anti- Semitism was a \\"useful tool in the struggle against Soviet Russia.\\"  Results  The results of Operation Antyk were negligible, since most propaganda efforts of the Home Army's Bureau of Information and Propaganda were concentrated on anti-Nazi activities. Among around 150 workers of the Bureau, only some 20 were involved in Antyk, and the expenses were around 4% of total budget of the Bureau. Operation Antyk was terminated in the end of July 1944, just after nine months of existence.

OCAS uses a low power ground-based radar to provide detection and tracking of an aircraft's proximity to an obstacle such as a power line crossing, telecom tower or wind turbines. This capability allows the visual warning lights to remain passive until an aircraft is detected and known to be tracking on an unsafe heading. This leaves the nighttime sky free of unnecessary light pollution thus decreasing public annoyance issues while improving the environmental habitat. OCAS is currently the only FAA approved Audio Visual Warning System (AVWS) approved in the National Airspace. OCAS is also the only AVWS approved by the International Dark Sky Association. OCAS is operational in the US, Canada, Norway and Germany.  Background  A terrain awareness and warning system is crucial in air transportation. The costliest plane collisionthe 1977 collision of two Boeing 747sdid not happen in the air but on the runway at Los Rodeos Airport on Tenerife in the Canary Islands. Since then, accidents often occur on or near the ground involving planes and obstacles. OCAS has the capability to address the problem through its radar technology that detects obstacles so that an aircraft could be sent away to avoid collision. The system is related to other collision avoidance systems that work through a probability collision calculation, which involves \\"the relative trajectory between objects and the combined relative position-error probability density.\\" The current OCAS technology still relies on the pilot for overall safety. OCAS does not cover other critical factors such as weather, traffic not online, and air traffic control instructions.Garrett, 2014. Overview The OCAS system is designed to protect obstacles that are vulnerable to low flying aircraft. OCAS detects the ground speed, heading and altitude of approaching aircraft and determines whether it will adequately clear the obstacle. A configurable set of rules is applied to define and determine when to warn the aircraft, by which warning devise and signal depending on the calculated time to impact with the obstacle. Initial WarningMedium Intensity Lighting: Once the initial threshold is met, the visual warning is activated. This capability allows the lighting system to remain passive (in the off position) the vast majority of the time thus preserving the dark sky environment while adhering to strict safety standards set out by the FAA. Secondary WarningAudio Broadcast: If the initial warning does not result in the pilot altering the flight path, a programmable VHF radio broadcasts an additional obstruction warning directly to the cockpit. The VHF warning frequencies are adjusted based on local requirements.

In particular, it is often said to hide a secret city beneath its peaks. In some stories, the city is no longer inhabited, while in others, it is inhabited by a technologically advanced society of human beings or mythical creatures. Native American legends According to local indigenous tribes, namely the Klamath people, Mount Shasta is inhabited by the spirit chief Skell, who descended from heaven to the mountain's summit. Skell fought with Spirit of the Below-World, Llao, who resided at Mount Mazama, by throwing hot rocks and lava, probably representing the volcanic eruptions at both mountains. Writer Joaquin Miller recorded various related legends in the 1870s. Lemuria Mount Shasta has also been a focus for non-Native American legends, centered on a hidden city (called Telos) of advanced beings from the lost continent of Lemuria. The legend grew from an offhand mention of Lemuria in the 1880s[by whom?] . In 1899, Frederick Spencer Oliver published A Dweller on Two Planets, which claimed that survivors from a sunken continent called Lemuria were living in or on Mount Shasta. Oliver's Lemurians lived in a complex of tunnels beneath the mountain and occasionally were seen walking the surface dressed in white robes. In 1931, Harvey Spencer Lewis, using the pseudonym Wisar Spenle Cerve, wrote a book (published by the Rosicrucians) about the hidden Lemurians of Mount Shasta that a bibliography on Mount Shasta described as \\"responsible for the legend's widespread popularity.\\" This belief has been incorporated into numerous occult religions, including \\"I AM\\" Activity, The Summit Lighthouse, Church Universal and Triumphant, and Kryon. Count of St. Germain According to Guy Ballard, while hiking on Mount Shasta, he encountered a man who introduced himself as Count of St. Germain, who is said to have started Ballard on the path to discovering the teachings that would become the \\"I AM\\" Activity religious movement. J. C. Brown According to a legend, J. C. Brown was a British prospector who discovered a lost underground city beneath Mt. Shasta in 1904. Brown had been hired by the Lord Cowdray Mining Company of England to prospect for gold, and discovered a cave which sloped downward for 11 miles. In the cave, he found an underground village filled with gold, shields, and mummies, some being up to 10 feet tall. Thirty years later, he told his story to John C. Root, who proceeded to gather an exploration team in Stockton, California. About 80 people joined the team, but on the day the team was to set out, Brown did not show up. Brown was not heard from again.

They are known from the Lower Cambrian to the late Silurian; they are mainly found as disarticulated sclerites, but are also preserved in many of the Cambrian lagerst√§tten. They take their name from the typifying genus Palaeoscolex.  Morphology  Palaeoscolecids bear an annulated trunk ornamented with circular patterns of phosphatic tesselating plates; a layered cuticle; and an armoured proboscis. They are long and narrow, and can reach tens of centimetres in length. Their cuticle is annulated, typically in complete rings, but sometimes the rings split or only encircle part of the trunk. Each annulus is essentially identical to its neighbours; the only trunk differentiation is at the anterior and posterior. The anterior is radially symmetrical, typically comprising an introvert, whereas the trunk is bilaterally symmetrical. The posterior hosts the terminal anus and sometimes one or two hooks. There is no one character that unites the palaeoscolecids as a clade (indeed they are likely paraphyletic), and few individual specimens contain all characteristic palaeosolecid traits.  Taxonomic position  Palaeoscolecids are somewhat challenging to define, and probably represent a paraphyletic grouping. Their most current systematic diagnosis references their annulated worm-like body form, the presence of rows (usually) of phosphatic plates, and a straight gut, with the anus at the end of the animal. The group contains a wide and continuous spectrum of morphological variety, making further division of the group difficult; moreover, non-palaeoscolecid taxa likely evolved from palaeoscolecid-like ancestors, and it is thus difficult to demarcate a single clade that corresponds to the palaeoscolecid concept. They are considered to belong to the cycloneuralia, although their position within this group is unresolved; they may lie with the priapulids or nematomorpha.conference, http://gf.tmsoc.org/Documents/Mikro2009/GFSP15.pdf#page=82 They have also been described as a sister-group to the ecdysozoa, although as more characters are described a position closer to the priapulids becomes most probable. This said, their pharynx has the sixfold symmetry that likely characterised the ancestral ecdysozoan, rather than the fivefold symmetry of priapulans. A nematomorph affinity appears to be an artefact that results from under- sampling of the priapulid stem group. Their relationship with Archaeopriapulida is unclear, and either group may be paraphyletic to the other. Other genera include Cricocosmia from the Lower Cambrian Chengjiang biota. Their relationship with the archaeopriapulida is also unclear; it could be that both groups are a paraphyletic assemblage containing the priapulids.  Taxonomy  As palaeoscolecids may represent a grade rather than a clade, drawing up a formal taxonomy proves problematic. What is more, two parallel taxonomies exist: a form taxonomy for sclerites, and a true taxonomy for articulated fossils. The most recent holistic study of priapulids by Harvey et al. (2010) defines a core of palaeoscolecids characterized by a cuticle that is made up of interlocking plates of multiple sizes, and a looser assemblage (palaeoscolecids sensu lato) including other unconfirmed and palaeoscolecid- like forms: = Palaeoscolecids sensu stricto =  Articulated macrofossils  * Palaeoscolex piscatorum (early Ordovician) * Palaeoscolex (=Mafangscolex) sinensis (early Cambrian, China) * Sanxiascolex papillogyrus (early Cambrian, China) * Scathascolex minor (Burgess Shale, mid-Cambrian) * Sahascolex (early Cambrian of Siberia) * Gamascolex (early Ordovician, Czech Rep.) * Plasmuscolex (early Ordovician, Czech Rep.) * ?Guanduscolex minor (early Cambrian, China) * ?

As such, P. ratcliffei and P. huainanensis should not be included in Palaeoscolex.  Wronascolex  Originally described from Siberia, Wronascolex should now be considered to include all taxa with Hadimopanella sclerites that have 3‚Äì10 nodes in a single circle, perhaps including Yunnanoscolex.

Early life  She was the third daughter of Sir William Gervase Beckett, Bt. (1866‚Äì1937), a banker, Conservative MP, and chairman of the Yorkshire Post, and his wife, Mabel Theresa Duncombe (1877‚Äì1913). She was a relation of Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick.  Marriage  In 1923, Beckett married Anthony Eden, a Conservative politician, during a lull in his first election campaign. Their honeymoon was cut short after two days so her husband could campaign in Warwick.Christopher Hawtree, 'Games - Teaser, Cherie', The Independent On Sunday (16 February 2003), p. 61. Soon afterwards, her husband entered Parliament representing Warwick and Leamington. The couple had three sons: * Simon Gascoigne Eden (1924‚Äì1945); a navigator in the RAF. * Robert Eden (b. 1928; died same date); lived for fifteen minutes. * Nicholas Eden, 2nd Earl of Avon (1930‚Äì1985); served after the war as aide-de-camp to the Governor General of Canada. Although her family press connections provided a useful boost to her husband's political career, by the early 1930s their marriage was in trouble due to Beatrice's dislike of politics and Eden's long hours and frequent absences at work.\\"Clarissa Brings Happiness At Last\\", Sunday Times (August 31, 1986). Eden eventually realised that his wife was having affairs with other men, but the two agreed to lead largely separate lives in private, \\"maintaining the fabric of their marriage until the strain became intolerable.\\" Her separation from Eden increased in 1941, when the family moved to Binderton House, near Chichester, Sussex, while Eden, to meet his wartime responsibilities, lived in a flat in the Foreign Office. The marriage was dealt its \\"final blow\\" when the couple's eldest son, Pilot Officer Simon Eden, predeceased his parents after being reported missing in action in Burma in June 1945.http://www.cwgc.org/find-war- dead/casualty/2085328 Beatrice spent the rest of the war in Paris, and in 1946 left Eden to live in the United States.  Divorce  The marriage was dissolved in 1950 \\"on the grounds of his wife's desertion\\" after 27 years.\\"Anthony & Clarissa\\", Time 60/8 (25 August 1952), p. 24. The parting was amicable and the former couple remained friends. Two years later, Beatrice's former husband (the first divorc√© to become prime minister) married Clarissa Spencer-Churchill. The Church Times despaired that public approval for the second marriage \\"shows how far the climate of public opinion has changed for the worse, even since 1936.\\" Her lover, an \\"eminent American\\", reneged on his promise to marry her. She died in 1957 and is buried in the Beckett family plot at St Gregory's Minster, Kirkdale, North Yorkshire.

Dragon turtle  *In the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game dragon turtles are gigantic sea creatures, feared by sailors for their ability to capsize the largest ships. They are massively armoured and breathe a cloud of scalding steam. *Dragon turtles are monsters in some DragonQuest/Dragon Warrior games, often called Tortragon. *There are dragon turtles in the game Might and Magic VIII. *In season 5 of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003), the turtles turned into creatures that resemble dragon turtles. *In World of Warcraft, the Pandaren race can ride dragon turtles. *In Call of Duty: Black Ops III, the map \\"Exodus\\" features a dragon turtle statue in the courtyard. *The Pok√©mon Turtonator is based on the dragon turtle. *Bowser is based on the dragon turtle.

Akito Sohma, one of the main characters of the anime and manga Fruits Basket, is based on the Jade Emperor. In the manga Fushigi Y≈´gi, the identity of Tai Yi- Jun (aka Tai Itsuken), the oracle who created the Universe of the Four Gods, is eventually revealed to be the Jade Emperor. In the 2008 film The Forbidden Kingdom, the Jade Emperor is one of the minor characters. In the Dragon Ball anime and manga series, the character Kami-sama is based on the Jade Emperor, hence his green, or jade-colored, skin. In the Korean Manhwa The God of High School, the Jade Emperor is one of the major antagonists.  Mogwai  *Mogwai are featured in the film Gremlins. *There is a Scottish post-rock band named Mogwai. *In World of Warcraft, the main antagonist in Pandaria are the Mogu, evil ancient spirits that inhabit frightening stone statues.  Nezha  The story of Nezha has been made into several animated films. One of the most well-known is the 1979 production of Nezha Nao Hai (Âì™ÂêíÈ¨ßÊµ∑) (63 minutes), translated into English on the recent DVD release as Nezha Conquers the Dragon King, which won international award and recognition in the former USSR. In the Chinese VCD, Nezha is shown with fire wheels, a red ribbon, and a golden ring. Also, Nezha appears in the popular Japanese manga/anime series Saiyuki as Nataku, a half-mortal war god who won the then-divine Son Goku (Sun Wukong)'s friendship. Unfortunately, Nataku falls into a catatonic state (the reasons for this are not disclosed in the anime) and sits in the divine garden of heaven with only the Goddess of Mercy to keep him company staring blankly ahead for all time. In the series, Nataku is decidedly more somber than Goku and is resigned to being a puppet (he was 'given the honor' of being the prince of war, a role which is later passed onto Homura) to the Gods. Furthermore, Nataku goes by a different title, but his background is still very much the same‚Äîright down to a Commander father and spear weapon. (However, it is glaringly obvious as the series goes on that the Commander is exploiting his son for fame and recognition from the Gods, reversing the roles that Nataku is to blame for misfortune.) Nataku's father, however, is then lectured by the past reincarnation of Zhu Bajie (Marshal Canopy) and further mis-treatment of his son is yet to be seen in the series. In the anime series Gundam Wing, Meilan Long, Chang Wufei's wife, insists on calling herself Nataku (the Japanese pronunciation of the kanji for \\"Nezha\\"). After her death, Wufei would give his mobile suits the Shenglong and Altron Gundams the nickname Nataku in her honor. In the manga/anime series X/1999, one of the Dragons of Earth is named Nataku after the god. A genderless clone with the body of an adult and a childlike mentality, Nataku is presumed by its creators to be soulless and without emotions, though its actions prove otherwise. Again in an anime series Soul Hunter Nataku is the son of a minor governor who is born through mysterious means with great powers and weapons called . He ages quickly, kills a dragon and is killed by the Dragon's higher powered father to save his parents. Nataku also is restored by a god to be an incarnation of a lotus flower. Nataku's powpei include fire/stone wheels that allow him to fly. Nezha, renamed Nata, appeared in the animated version of Monkey Magic as the main character's first major opponent. In this version Nezha was defeated more by trickery than power or skill. Nezha, also appeared in the TV series and cartoon version Lotus Lantern. Nezha is a motif in the live action film Rebels of the Neon God by the Taiwan director Tsai Ming-liang. Nezha makes an appearance in Musou Orochi 2 (Warriors Orochi 3) under the name Ne Zha. Nezha is a playable character in the multiplayer online battle arena game Smite as a melee assassin. Nezha is a playable frame in MMO Warframe.  Nian  The Nian are a part of the Canthan New Year Celebration as part of the game Guild Wars, specifically appearing in Guild Wars Factions. Omen, a boss in World of Warcraft that appears only once a year during the Lunar Festival, was inspired by the Nian. The Nian make an appearance in an episode of Three Delivery. The Nian is available as a mount in the game World of Kung Fu. The Nian (known as the Neinbeast in-game) is available as a mount in the game Perfect World International. There is also an in-game event in which players try to kill Neinbeasts and their minions. The Nian are in the TV show Spirit Warriors (however, they are humanoid and ninja-like in this show). The Nian temporarily makes an appearance as a boss in Dota 2 as part of the New Bloom Festival Update.  N√ºwa  Nu Wa appears in the Koei video game Dynasty Warriors 3 and the later game Warriors Orochi 2. She wields a rapier and a shield. In Dynasty Warriors 3, she wore green pants, a green top with a gold chestplate, a golden hairpiece, and she looked human. In the Warriors Orochi Series, her appearance was greatly changed. In Warriors Orochi 2, she believes that Cao Cao is the chosen one, but she has mixed feelings about both Cao Cao and Oda Nobunaga on whether they will slip into darkness or not. Although she assists Wei, she is constantly testing Cao Cao. After Orochi's second demise, Nu Wa believes that Orochi mixed the different worlds because he wanted it that way. \\"Nuwa\\" appears in her more snaky incarnation as a Han Commander unit in the game Arcane Legions. She is able to resurrect fallen Terra-Cotta warriors. Nu Wa appears in the multiplayer online battle arena game Smite as a magical mage.  Ox-Head and Horse-Face  *In Lone Wolf and Cub, the protagonist, Ogami Itto, has visions about Ox-Head and Horse-face. He refers to them as \\"Gozu Mezu\\" and uses drawings of them to advertise his services as an assassin. *In the animated version of Rumiko Takahashi's InuYasha, the cast fights with Ox- Head and Horse-Face in order to enter the underworld ‚Äì but only Sesshomaru, with the healing sword Tenseiga, is allowed to pass without fighting Ox-Head and Horse-Face. * Ox-Head appears as the titular character in Takashi Miike's movie Gozu. * In Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne, Ox-Head is Gozu-Tenno, one of the main antagonists in the story. * Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG features a card named \\"Mezuki\\" based on Horse-Head. * Mezura, the second phantom god from the anime Kotetsushin Jeeg, is based on Horse-Face. Kyo even refers to its fight with Jeeg as Ox-Head and Horse-Face. * In the Dragon Ball Z anime, Goku falls off of Snake Way after his first death on his way to King Kai's and meets Gaz and Mez, who are clearly based on these characters. * In the anime Danganronpa 3, the Ultimate Wrestler goes by the name \\"The Great Gozu\\" and wears an ox-shaped mask to fit his character (that still doesn't save him from death, as he's the third victim on the Future Foundation). *In the Japanese Yokai anime Nurarihyon no Mago, there are two young Yokai called Gozumaru and Mezumaru, who their lord Gyuki trusts more than anyone else in his clan. Although Gozumaru looks normal, the giant claws he uses to fight can relate to the horns of an ox. Mezumaru also looks normal, with long dark blue hair but on his head is a horse skull which he uses as a helmet. the two split up to carry out tasks given to them by their lord but they are often seen together. *In the Namco X Capcom and Project X Zone series of strategy RPG computer games, the dimwitted comedy henchmen of series antagonist Saya are named Dokugozu and Dokumezu (sometimes nicknamed \\"Gozzie\\" and \\"Mezzie\\"), and closely resemble Ox- Head and Horse-Face.  Ranka  The legend was referenced by the Japanese playwright Chikamatsu in his play The Battles of Coxinga in 1715.  Sha Wujing  In Japan, Sha Wujing was popularly seen and depicted as a kappa, another fearsome kind of water demon. In the manga/anime Saiy≈´ki, Sha Gojy≈ç is loosely based on Sha Wujing, with a modified version of the same weapon (albeit incorrectly called a shakuj≈ç, the Japanese name for the Chinese xƒ´zh√†ng). However, Gojy≈ç is described as being half human, half y≈çkai with the ability to breathe underwater, instead of a man-eating river monster. Mega Man: The Wily Wars had a character based on Sha Wujing named Mega Water.S in the unlockable \\"Wily Tower\\" game. Mega Water.S later made an appearance in the CD Database for Mega Man & Bass. In the manga/anime Dragon Ball, the character Yamcha, the Desert Bandit, was originally based on Sha Wujing. There is a Digimon called Shawujingmon.  Shen  In the Chinese novel Water Margin, the character Tong Meng is nicknamed Fanzhiang Shen ÁøªÊ±üËúÉ \\"River-churning Shen\\". In Japanese manga, Shin ËúÉ is an illusion-creating weapon of Tomo (Seiryu Seishi) and an illusion-manifesting technique of Demon Eyes Kyo. The title Hon≈ç no MirƒÅju ÁÇé„ÅÆËúÉÊ∞óÊ•º \\"Mirage of Blaze\\" transcribes shinkir≈ç ËúÉÊ∞óÊ•º with the English gairaigo loanword mirƒÅju.

The most recent edition (2015) is published in the English Standard Version and the New King James Version. Dr. R. C. Sproul is the general editor and author of the theological notes. The Reformation Study Bible was first begun in 1988 as an attempt to create a modern Geneva Bible with study notes done in the Reformed tradition. The New International Version was to be used. However, when the publishing was taken over by Thomas Nelson (now HarperCollins), the translation was switched to the New King James Version that they owned. In 1995 the New Geneva Study Bible was released; the name was changed in 1998 to The Reformation Study Bible. In 2005, the Bible version used was changed to the English Standard Version after Nelson was sold. As of early 2015 a fully revised and edited version of the Reformation Study Bible was released by Reformation Trust publishing which is owned and operated by Ligonier Ministries. The notes were expanded into a three column format and the theological and doctrinal content was updated. An additional resource was added to the back of this Bible that contains the Creeds, Catechisms and Doctrinal documents that are common to Protestant Reformed fellowships. On February 25, 2016, Reformation Trust Publishing released the RSB with the New King James Version due to popular demand. This version is published by HarperCollins, which owns the NKJV.

The funds were controlled by representatives by Swedish trade unions. The idea was launched in the 1970s, with Rudolf Meidner playing a leading role in developing the idea, and they were in place 1982-1991\\\\. Throughout their existence, they caused much political controversy. Proponents described them as an attempt to increase the power of labour over Swedish companies, and opponents described it as large step towards socialism. They were introduced following the Social Democrat victory in the 1982 Swedish general election and accumulated funds until the 1991 Swedish general election where the Social Democrat lost for the first time since 1982, when the effort was abolished. While the accumulated wealth was transferred to two holding vehicles named Atle and Bure. Both vehicles were subsequently listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. On October 4, 1983, an anti-employee funds demonstration in Stockholm gathered between 80,000 and 100,000 participants. It was the largest political protest ever to take place in Sweden. Subsequent Social Democrat victories, such as the one in 1994, did not lead to their reintroduction, as leading members of the party found the whole debate surrounding these funds a problem for the party. Famously, Minister of Finance Kjell-Olof Feldt was captured on camera while scribbling negative words about the funds in his bench in Parliament already when they were introduced.

Biography  Cabrera was born in Zacatl√°n, the son of the baker Ces√°reo Cabrera Rica√±o and Gertrudis Lobato; an uncle, Daniel Cabrera Rivera (1858-1914), was a journalist and head of the anti-Porfirio D√≠az publication El Hijo de AhuizoteLaFrance, \\"Luis Cabrera Lobato,\\" p. 176.

Cabrera was assistant teacher at the Tecomaluca school in Tlaxcala for a while, before he continued his studies and worked for the El Hijo del Ahuizote. In May 1901 he achieved his licenciado degree. Afterwards he was a partner in a law firm with Rodolfo Reyes, son of General Bernardo Reyes, and Andr√©s Molina Enr√≠quez.Stanley F. Shadle, Andr√©s Molina Enr√≠quez: Mexican Land Reformer in the Revolutionary Era. Tucson: University of Arizona Press 1994, p. 36. Additionally he wrote for several journals. In July 1909 he started a critical campaign against the cient√≠fico group of Positivist advisers of Porfirio D√≠az. In his articles he also supported the campaign against Porfirio D√≠az, who had initially said he would not run in the 1910 elections and then reneged. Both he and Molina Enr√≠quez were supporters of Bernardo Reyes to succeed D√≠az in 1910, but Reyes declined to run and was sent on a military mission to Europe. Cabrera then joined in support of Francisco I. Madero and the Anti-Reelectionist Party. During the interim presidency of Francisco Le√≥n de la Barra, who assumed the presidency after the ouster and exile of D√≠az and before the election of Madero to the presidency, Cabrera was offered a government post, which he declined in favor of running for the post of federal deputy.LaFrance, \\"Luis Cabrera Lobato,\\" p. 176 Following Madero's election to the presidency, Cabrera was rejected by the president's advisers for the position of secretary of development, and he then served as a deputy for the Distrito Federal. In 1912 he became director of the Escuela Nacional de Jurisprudencia (today Faculty of Law of the UNAM) and deputy to the Congress. Following Madero's assassination in February 1913 during General Victoriano Huerta's coup and then restoration of Porfirian policies, Cabrera joined the Constitutionalist faction headed by Venustiano Carranza. Cabrera was \\"one of the 'First Chief's' principal aides, often credited for being the intellectual behind and theorist of Carrancismo.\\" Under Venustiano Carranza he was responsible for the Finance and Public Credit branch from 1914 to 1917, and was Secretary of Finance and Public Credit from 1919 to 1920. As political opponent of Pascual Ortiz Rubio, he was deported to Guatemala in 1931, but he returned after a short time. Under the presidency of Venustiano Carranza, Luis Cabrera served also as Constitutionalist delegate to the Niagara Falls negotiations, where the recognition of Carranza as Mexico's President by the U.S. government and the drawback of the U.S. troops from Veracruz were discussed. In 1933, Luis Cabrera declined the candidacy for president, which was offered him by the Partido Anti-rreeleccionista. A second time the candidacy was offered him by the Partido Acci√≥n Nacional in 1946, but he declined it again. After 1950 he had his own lawyer's office and became adviser of president Adolfo Ruiz Cortines. He died in Mexico City.

She is the youngest daughter of Traian BƒÉsescu, the former President of Romania. She was formerly a model, and entered politics in 2007. She has a degree in economics.  Political career  Before standing for elections on her own, she was an intern of the MEP Monica Iacob Ridzi.Romanian President's daughter Elena Basescu becomes intern at the European Parliament. English.hotnews.ro. 5 September 2008. Elena BƒÉsescu stood as a candidate for the European Parliament in the 2009 election. She had sought to stand as a candidate for her father's Democratic Liberal Party, but was rejected by the party, in particular by intellectuals like Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, so she ran as an independent. Nonetheless, she \\"wasted no time in gathering 200,000 signatures for her candidacy\\". L'Express noted that her candidacy still caused some concern in the party, due to fears that she might draw votes away from it. Her initial popularity in opinion polls was high (16%), but subsequently dropped to 5 or 6% shortly before the election. However 75% of the electorate did not vote in sign of protest, this being the lowest turnout in Romanian history for an election, and the percentage that voted for her was from a minority composed of the members of the party that was once ruled by her father Traian BƒÉsescu, the President of Romania at the time. During the campaign she caused some controversy after declaring herself in favor of legalizing marijuana use.Reuters FACTBOX: Some candidates in European Parliament election. Reuters. 7 June 2009.

Gene patents From 1982 to 2013,https://www.cas.org/news/insights/science-connections/gene-patent the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) accepted patents on isolated DNA sequences as a composition of matter. Simoncelli has stated that this became a \\"significant barrier to biomedical discovery and innovation.\\" From 2005 to 2009, Simoncelli, as the American Civil Liberties Union's science advisor, worked with ACLU lawyer Chris Hansen to file a case against Salt Lake City- based Myriad Genetics. Myriad Genetics held a complete monopoly on BRCA testing in the United States as Myriad had held the patents on the gene associated with increased risk for breast cancer, the (BRCA1) gene, since 1995 and on the BRCA2 gene since 1998. The company charged $3000 a test and, in Simoncelli's words, \\"refused to update its test to include additional mutations that had been identified by a team of researchers in France.\\" The lead plaintiff of 20 plaintiffs represented by Hansen in the ACLU-sponsored lawsuit was the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP). In March 2010, the Southern District Court of New York Judge Robert Sweet ruled in favor of the AMP that all the challenged claims were not patent eligible. Myriad appealed this decision, and the case went before the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which, although affirming part of the district court's ruling, also partly overturned it, ruling instead that isolated DNA sequences are patent eligible. Ultimately, the case went before the Supreme Court, which, in a unanimous decision on June 13, 2013, invalidated Myriad's claims to isolated genes in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, ruling that merely isolating genes that are found in nature does not make them patentable.

Puck is also a generalized personification of land spirits. In more recent times, the figure of Robin Goodfellow is identified as a puck. The Old English \\"puca\\" is a kind of half-tamed woodland sprite, leading folk astray with echoes and lights in nighttime woodlands (like the German and Dutch \\"Weisse Frauen\\" and \\"Witte Wieven\\" and the French \\"Dames Blanches,\\" all \\"White Ladies\\"), or coming into the farmstead and souring milk in the churn. Puck has appeared many times in popular culture. Examples Puck's most famous appearance is in William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. As Robin Goodfellow, Puck appears in a roughly contemporaneous Elizabethan play, Grim the Collier of Croydon (1600). It is unknown how Shakespeare's Puck appeared on the stage; but the figure in Grim was costumed \\"in a suit of leather close to his body; his face and hands coloured russet-coloured, with a flail.\\" Puck is the story-framer in Puck of Pook's Hill (1906) and Rewards and Fairies (1910) short story cycles by Rudyard Kipling. In Susanna Clarke's short story \\"The Ladies of Grace Adieu,\\" Robin Goodfellow appears as a mischievous yet caring servant to Auberon. In Orson Scott Card's novel Magic Street, and in his short film, Remind me Again, we meet Puck, Queen Titania, and Oberon in a modern, urban setting. In Raymond E. Feist's novel Faerie Tale, Puck is a fey being in the faerie court and is portrayed as a jester of sorts, and stays true to the mythology of him as a trickster. At times throughout the novel he is referred to as Puck, Putz, and Aerial, and assists the main characters to prevent evil King Oberon from seizing global power over humanity. In Pamela Dean's Tam Lin (a modern retelling of the Scottish faerie ballad), the character of Robin Armin is implied to be Puck; he used a similar name while performing as a singer and actor for The King's Men, and had been the inspiration for the Shakespearean Puck and several other comic characters, but he and the others of his troupe were unsuccessful in luring the Bard off to the Fair Lands. In Mercedes Lackey's novel The Wizard of London Robin Goodfellow/Puck steps in to play himself in a boarding school's production of A Midsummer Night's Dream when no one suitable can be found for the part. He reappears throughout the novel mainly in his friendlier aspect, but becomes extremely dangerous when crossed. The Puck who appears in Neil Gaiman's The Sandman is a trickster and maker of mischief. Puck was an American and then British humour magazine, somewhat similar to Punch. In the animated series Gargoyles, Puck is a traditional trickster and an important supporting character. During the long exile from Avalon, Puck comes across Queen Titania in the human guise of Anastasia Renard, the wife of David Xanatos' aged and ailing business rival Halcyon Renard. He also meets a nearly emotionless businessman named Preston Vogel, working in Halcyon's employ. Amused with the \\"wooden behavior\\" of the mortal, Puck decides to play the straight man for a while, and reinvents himself as Owen Burnett, who becomes Xanatos' business manager. In the 1989 movie Dead Poets Society, one of the main characters, Neil Perry, plays the part of Puck in a secondary school rendition of A Midsummer Night's Dream. In Michael Buckley's The Sisters Grimm series, Puck is an Everafter who takes on the form of an 11-year-old boy. He is described as rude, selfish, and immature, and occasionally plays pranks on the Grimm Family. He helps them solve most of their cases, and lives with them in their house. Puck plays a central role in Mark Chadbourn's fantasy trilogy, Kingdom of the Serpent, comprising the novels Jack of Ravens, The Burning Man, and Destroyer of Worlds. Puck manipulates the heroes in an epic battle between good and evil over two thousand years of human history. The children's theater play Robin Goodfellow by Aurand Harris is a retelling of A Midsummer Night's Dream from Puck's point of view. In Kentaro Miura's dark fantasy manga Berserk, Puck is one of the main character's earliest companions. He is a fairy-like elf of the Pixie race, and serves as comedic relief. Puck, the faerie dragon, is the name of a hero in the game mod Defense of the Ancients and its sequel Dota 2. Puck is a small rat-boy in Final Fantasy 9 who messes around with other people. Puck is also one of the lead characters of Julie Kagawa's Iron Fey series. When the series begins, he hovers around as the lead character's bodyguard but as it progresses, he reveals himself to be one of the love interests of the heroine. In the Nightside series by Simon R. Green Puck is the only imperfect elf. Born as son of queen Mab and a Camelot knight, Puck is the only hunchback fairy. He is mischievous and usually deceives the main character for a long time. Later in the series he ends the elf civil war between Oberon and Mab by deceiving and killing his own mother, when she wouldn't give up her revenge. The Cal Leandros series by Rob Thurman predominantly features the character Robin Goodfellow, also known as Rob Fellows. The character has crossed over into the author's Trickster series. Puck also appears in several books of author Mercedes Lackey's Elemental Masters series. He appears in The Wizard of London, Unnatural Issue, and Home From the Sea.

Hercules the Archer, plaster, Mus√©e Ingres, Montauban Hercules the Archer is a sculpture by Antoine Bourdelle, originally made in 1909, which now exists in many versions. It was a commission of the financier and philanthropist Gabriel Thomas, as a single copy in gilt-bronze in April 1909; Bourdelle worked on the sculpture in the summer of 1909. It was cast by Eug√®ne Rudier, and it was exhibited at the National Society of Fine Arts in 1910, and much appreciated. The dimensions were 2.50 m √ó 2.40 m. The second version was developed around 1923. It differed from the first version with additions of reliefs on the rock right, representing the Lernaean Hydra and the Nemean Lion. Finally a banner along the base of the sculpture and the monogram completed the work. Background Detail, Mus√©e Antoine Bourdelle, Paris Copy at Trammell Crow Center sculpture garden, Dallas, Texas Bourdelle was inspired by the myth of Hercules, he chose the sixth of them : the extermination of the Stymphalian birds. In the Greek mythology, the birds of this lake were monstrous, feeding on human flesh, which infesting the woods surrounding the lake Stymphale, in Arcadia, using their sharp-pointed feathers bronze (according to one of several versions) as arrows, to kill men and beasts, and devour. For the creation of this work, Antoine Bourdelle asked his friend the captain Doyen- Parigot (1854‚Äì1916), whom he had met at the \\"Saturday Rodin\\" to pose for him. This military man was an accomplished sportsman. The deployment of the body and muscle tension required by archery highlight the muscles of the model. Bourdelle modified the head of the model at the request of his friend who had requested for anonymity.H√©rakl√®s archer Naissance d'une ≈ìuvre, Antoinette Le Normand-Romain, Paris Edition 666/1986 Bourdelle did several studies to produce a small sculpture, which he considered as completed in 1909. During the visit to his workshop, the patron Gabriel Thomas was fascinated by this sculpture and commissioned a monumental sculpture for the garden of his home in Bellevue. International success In 1914, Antoine Bourdelle became aware of the injury suffered because of the exclusivity granted to Gabriel Thomas. Indeed, after the Venice Biennale where Bourdelle had presented a cast of Hercules the Archer, he was forced to refuse to sell a bronze statue. Seeing Bourdelle's disappointment, Thomas agreed to end his exclusivity and allow Bourdelle to make further copies. The first new sculpture went to Sweden in 1920. Thereafter, Thomas made a new bronze which remained in his family until it was sold in 1991 to Drouot-Montaigne, this work is now in Tokyo. After Thomas' agreement to concede his rights, a copy was given in 1916 to the Gallery of Modern Art in Rome. In 1920, the museum Waldemarsudde of Stockholm bought the first copy of Thomas. In 1923, copies were sold to museums in Brussels, Prague and New York. In 1925, the city of Toulouse provided a Hercules statue for its sports museum. In 1926, the Mus√©e du Luxembourg in Paris bought a Hercules (it is now at the Mus√©e d'Orsay). In 1927, the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon had a copy in turn.

Although now associated with his home in Memphis, he has lived and worked in North Carolina, St. Louis, New York, Los Angeles, and Norfolk, Virginia, where he was stationed in the United States Navy. He became acquainted with the blues in St Louis in his teens and started his career playing country blues on acoustic guitar, finding that singing eased a stutter and helped him to manage it. Although predominantly associated with acoustic guitar, his skills were developed as a blues bass player, and honed by his subsequent journeys into jazz and electric blues. Influences MacLeod's formative blues instruction is attributed to a man he knew as Ernest Banks who also gave him the guiding principles of his music and performances: ‚ÄúNever play a note you don't believe‚Äù ‚ÄúNever write or sing about what you don't know about‚Äù He also formed a strong friendship with George \\"Harmonica\\" Smith who not only became his mentor, but also the source or experience for many of his songs and stories in his live performances. Unable or unwilling to use his correct name, George always called him \\"Dubb\\", a name also adopted by his loyal followers, the DubbHeads. Writing MacLeod plays only his own compositions (of which he is credited with over 300), but his music has also been recorded by many other artists, including Dave Alvin, James Armstrong, Eva Cassidy, Albert Collins, Pee Wee Crayton, Papa John Creach, Albert King, Chris Thomas King, Coco Montoya, Billy Lee Riley, Son Seals, Tabby Thomas, and Joe Louis Walker. He has also been a long-time contributor to Blues Revue magazine with his column \\"Doug's Back Porch\\". Performance MacLeod's live performances preserve the tradition of the blues as a story-telling medium, expressed by his soulful voice and powerfully rhythmic acoustic guitar style. He usually plays a National Delphi guitar (accompanied by his left foot), with stories or introductions between pieces. The tales come from his early performances when he felt that he did not have enough music to fill a show. He has appeared in blues and jazz festivals and his own shows around the world, but particularly in the US and Europe. Other activities As well as writing and performing, he also teaches guitar and has released his own instructional DVD, and has hosted blues radio shows Blues Highway and Nothin' but the Blues (1999 to 2004), and was the voice for the Blues Showcase of Continental Airlines. Recognition He has won six Blues Music Awards: *Acoustic Artist of the Year 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2020. *Acoustic Album of the Year 2014 and 2018.

In 1826 Vientiane King Anouvong invaded Siam seeking complete independence. Anuvong's forces seized the city of Nakhon Ratchasima by a ruse when the governor was away. The invaders evacuated the inhabitants, intending to resettle them in Laos. Lady Mo is credited with saving her people by harassing the enemy. Varying stories describe her either getting the invading soldiers drunk, or leading a rebellion of the prisoners on the way back to Vientiane. The generally accepted version is that, when the Lao invaders ordered the women to cook for them, Lady Mo requested knives so that food might be prepared. That night, when the invaders were asleep, she gave the knives to the imprisoned men. They surprised the Lao troops, who fled, and the prisoners escaped. Thai King Rama III soon sent an army in pursuit, led by General Sing Singhaseni (‡∏™‡∏¥‡∏á‡∏´‡πå ‡∏™‡∏¥‡∏á‡∏´‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏ô‡∏µ). He defeated Anuvoung's forces in three days of fighting and completely destroyed Anuvoung's capital city of Vientiane. King Rama III awarded her the title Thao Suranari, (or Lady Suranari - \\"the brave lady\\") in recognition of her courageous acts. Statue A statue of Thao Suranari stands in the centre of Nakhon Ratchasima, and is a popular object of devotion. A festival in her honour is held each year at the end of March and the beginning of April. The statue was designed by Phra Thewaphinimmit () (1888‚Äì1942) and sculpted by Silpa Bhirasri. Thao Suranari's statue was placed next to the Chumphon Gate of the city wall on January 15, 1934. It has since been suggested that the story of Thao Suranari was somewhat embellished during the Thai nationalist movement under Field Marshal Phibul Songkham in the 1930s. As part of a 77 million baht city center renovation project, dirt and trees were uprooted for construction of a new tree-lined watercourse, a central stage, and to upgrade the Lady Mo monument and redo Chumphon Gate.

He was of Chinese descent. Sang Hue umpired 31 Test matches in the West Indies between 1962 and 1981, mostly in the 1970s. His first Test as umpire, the fifth Test against India at Sabina Park, Kingston, Jamaica, in March 1962, was also the first time he had officiated in a first-class match. He stood in four further Test matches in the 1960s. Wisden called him \\"Quite the most professional of the umpires\\" standing in the series against the touring MCC team in 1967/68.Wisden report of 1967/68 England tour of West Indies Sang Hue and Cortez Jordan were the umpires in the drawn Test against the touring England team in February 1968 at Kingston, Jamaica, the second Test of the series. West Indies were bowled out for 143 in their first innings, 233 runs behind England, and were asked to follow on. Crowd trouble started on the fourth day when Basil Butcher was correctly given out by Sang Hue, the fifth wicket to fall in the second innings with West Indies still 28 runs behind. The police used tear gas to subdue the crowd. Unfortunately strong winds blew the gas back towards the police, into the commentators' stand and then into the main pavilion, where the Governor-General, Clifford Campbell, and other dignitaries were watching the match. The match was extended by 70 minutes into a sixth day to make up for the lost time. A century by Gary Sobers set England a target of 159 to win, but the match ended with England on 68-8, still 90 runs behind.Riot ... what riot?, Wisden, 1968Wisden report of 2nd Test West Indies v England in 1967-8Scorecard He was the first umpire to stand in all five Tests of a series in the West Indies, against Australia in 1972/3. He repeated the feat in the five Tests against England in 1973/4. In 1973, Ian Chappell called him the \\"best umpire in the world\\".Ian Chappell tribute At the February 1974 Test against England at Port of Spain, Trinidad, West Indian batter Bernard Julien defended the last ball of the second day. His partner Alvin Kallicharran walked off the pitch towards the pavilion assuming the days play was over. Tony Greig, fielding at silly point, picked the ball up and threw down the stumps. Sang Hue had not called \\"time\\", so adjudged Kallicharran run out. Following the decision police had to be called in to control the volatile spectators. After a 2¬Ω hour meeting between the captains, the umpires, and West Indies Cricket Board representatives, the official decision was to reinstate Kallicharran, with Greig's appeal \\"withdrawn\\". Greig and Kallicharran shook hands in the middle of the pitch before play resumed on the third day.Cricinfo article on the Greig/Kallicharran incidentWisden report on the 1st Test West Indies v England in 1973-4 He spent a summer in England in 1977, umpiring matches in the County Championship, John Player League and Benson & Hedges Cup. He became the only non-Australian umpire in Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket later in 1977. After standing in one more Test in the West Indies, the first Test against Australia at Queen's Park Oval in March 1978, he was then dropped by the West Indies Cricket Board. He stood in four of the six WSC \\"Supertests\\" in Australia in 1977-8, and two of the five in 1978-9, including the Final, together with the five \\"Supertests\\" and three out of 12 ODIs in the WSC tour of the Caribbean in 1979. He returned to stand in three Tests of the 1980/81 series against England. He umpired only one ODI match, the first ODI between West Indies and Pakistan at Sabina Park in March 1988.

The Warrior Image-Soldiers in American Culture 2008 UNC Press Most of the same cast and crew made God's Little Acre the following year. Plot On 6 September 1950, an isolated and exhausted platoon of the 24th Infantry Division is cut off. In addition to losing radio contact, the platoon is harassed by unseen North Korean infiltrators who silently kill the Americans and take their weapons. Platoon leader Lieutenant Benson (Robert Ryan) has only vague instructions to reach a certain hill to link up with American forces. The patrol stops a jeep driven by Staff Sergeant \\"Montana\\" (Aldo Ray) and shell shocked passenger \\"the Colonel\\" (Robert Keith) from the First Cavalry Division. The Colonel is unable to speak and is tied to his seat. After the Battle of the Nakdong River, where \\"our men fell like rain\\", the tough experienced Montana decided he and his Colonel, whom he treats like his father, have had enough of the war. Benson commandeers their jeep for his platoon's equipment and the battle-fatigued Corporal Zwickley (Vic Morrow). The platoon makes its way towards the hill. Montana disobeys Benson by instinctively shooting a surrendering North Korean sniper, who turns out to have a concealed weapon inside his hat. Sergeant Killian (James Edwards) is killed while covering the rear after absentmindedly filling his helmet net with flowers. Montana takes his place and feigns fatigue, luring the infiltrators into the open, where he kills them. The cynical Montana transforms the platoon back into a military formation while also curing Zwickley's neurosis by slapping him around. The platoon successfully carries on through sniper attack, artillery barrage, and land mines during which Platoon Sergeant Lewis panics and is killed. When they reach the hill, they find it held by the North Koreans. Montana shoots three enemy soldiers disguised as Americans after a North Korean prisoner is used as bait and killed by his own men. Benson and his men launch an attack, but Montana and the Colonel sit it out. The Colonel comes to his senses, joins the assault, and is killed. Shamed, Montana joins Benson. They use grenades and a flamethrower to destroy a pillbox and machine gun nest. Only Benson, Montana, and Sergeant Riordan (Phillip Pine) survive. When American reinforcements arrive, Montana produces a container of medals that the Colonel meant to award his men. Benson calls the roll of the men in his platoon in alphabetic order (including those killed in the attack) as Montana throws the medals to the dead on the slope of the hill, while Elmer Bernstein's title song plays in the background.

You're mistreating the greatest pianist in the world.\\" According to this account, Powell was struck in the head by a police officer with a nightstick, suffering an injury that led to a pattern of institutionalizations and destructive behavior that plagued the rest of his career. Other sources have explained Powell's injury differently; Miles Davis said Powell was beaten by a Savoy Ballroom bouncer after walking in the club without any money, while Dexter Gordon claimed he was beaten while in police custody after his arrest for drunk and disorderly conduct in a Philadelphia train station.  Recordings  Monk recorded \\"In Walked Bud\\" several times during his career, starting with the 1947 sessions later compiled for Genius of Modern Music (1951). According to music critic Robert Christgau, Monk's rendition of the song for his 1958 live album Misterioso featured \\"a long, laconically hilarious (and laconically, hilariously virtuosic) Johnny Griffin solo that's a landmark of saxophony\\". The last recording by Monk was for his 1968 record Underground, featuring lyrics and vocals by Jon Hendricks. The song has since been covered by numerous artists.[ \\"In Walked Bud\\"] at Allmusic ‚Äì retrieved on 3 July 2009 References  External links  * \\"In Walked Bud\\" at jazzstandards.com Category:1947 songs Category:Songs with music by Thelonious Monk Category:Bebop jazz standards Category:1940s jazz standards Category:Songs with lyrics by Jon Hendricks Category:Carmen McRae songs ","title":"In Walked Bud"},{"id":"23086220","text":"Although Internet censorship in Germany has traditionally been rated as low, it is practised directly and indirectly through various laws and court decisions.\\"ONI Country Profiles\\", Research section at the OpenNet Initiative web site, a collaborative partnership of the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto; the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University; and the SecDev Group, Ottawa German law provides for freedom of speech and press with several exceptions, including what The Guardian has called \\"some of the world's toughest laws around hate speech\\". An example of content censored by law is the removal of web sites from Google search results that deny the holocaust, which is a felony under German law. According to the Google Transparency Report, the German government is frequently one of the most active in requesting user data after the United States. Most cases of Internet censorship in Germany occur after state court rulings. One example is a 2009 court order, forbidding German Wikipedia to disclose the identity of Wolfgang Werl√© and Manfred Lauber, two criminals convicted of the murder of the Bavarian actor Walter Sedlmayr. In another case, Wikipedia.de (an Internet domain run by Wikimedia Deutschland) was prohibited from pointing to the actual Wikipedia content. The court order was as a temporary injunction in a case filed by politician Lutz Heilmann over claims in a German Wikipedia article regarding his past involvement with the former German Democratic Republic's intelligence service Stasi. The first known case of Internet censorship in Germany occurred in 1996, when the Verein zur F√∂rderung eines Deutschen Forschungsnetzes banned some IP addresses from Internet access. Relevant laws =Access Impediment Act= In June 2009, the Bundestag passed the Access Impediment Act or ZugangserschwerungsgesetzGesetz zur Erschwerung des Zugangs zu kinderpornographischen Inhalten in Kommunikationsnetzen (Act for impeding access to child pornography content in communications networks). that introduced Internet blocking of sites found to distribute child pornography.\\"Kabinett beschlie√üt Netzsperren gegen Kinderpornos\\" (Cabinet approves blocking against child pornography), Pressestelle Bundesministerium f√ºr Wirtschaft und Technologie (Press Office Federal Ministry for Economics and Technology), 22 April 2009. Retrieved 19 June 2009.\\"Namentliche Abstimmung: Bek√§mpfung von Kinderpornografie\\" (Roll-call vote: combating child pornography), 18 June 2009. Retrieved 19 June 2009. Against the backdrop of an intense political debate, the law did not come into force until federal elections in September 2009 changed the setup of the governing coalition. In talks between the new governing parties CDU and FDP, it was agreed that no blocking would be implemented for one year, focusing on take-down efforts instead. After one year the success of the deletion policy would be reviewed.\\"New German government reaches key internet security agreements\\", Neil King, Deutsche Welle, 15 October 2009. The governing parties ultimately decided in April 2011 to repeal the law altogether.German Internet blocking law to be withdrawn, EDRi-gram newsletter, European Digital Rights, 6 April 2011. =Ancillary copyright for press publishers= After lobbying efforts by news publishers which began in 2009, the Bundesrat considered a law preventing search results from returning excerpts from news sites unless the search engine has paid a license for them. It passed in 2013 and was widely interpreted as an attempt to have Google subsidize German news. In response, Google modified search to only display headlines for certain sites. The publishing collective VG Media claimed in an unsuccessful lawsuit that removing the snippets rather than licensing them was an antitrust violation. Other supporters of the bill, including Axel Springer, saw an overall decrease in their readership following its passage. =Network Enforcement Act= The Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz or NetzDG was passed in June 2017 as a measure to require social media companies in Germany to censor extremism online, with significant hate speech provisions as well. The law, which applies to for- profit websites with over 2 million users, demands the removal of offensive illegal content within 24 hours and allows for one week to review \\"more legally ambiguous content\\". It was authored by Heiko Maas and went into full effect in January 2018. Critics have questioned the feasibility of fining companies ‚Ç¨50 million for failing to comply, and pointed to hundreds of new German content moderators hired by Facebook. A report testing the amount of illegal content that could be removed within 24 hours found figures of 90% for YouTube, 39% for Facebook and 1% for Twitter. Purveyors of satire also criticized the law after the magazine Titanic and the comedian Sophie Passmann were both suspended from Twitter after attempting to mock anti-Muslim rhetoric. The United Nations special rapporteur on freedom of expression David Kaye expressed a fear that NetzDG would lead to overly restrictive blocking and Cathleen Berger of Mozilla found evidence that it was inspiring other countries to do the same. Some victims of harassment campaigns have supported increased restrictions and stated \\"I don't mind if other comments get deleted along with the bad ones.\\" Opposition politicians including Nicola Beer of the FDP, Simone Peter of the Green Party and Sahra Wagenknecht of The Left, have criticized the idea of putting decisions about online discourse in the hands of American companies, with the latter calling it \\"a slap in the face of all democratic principles\\". In what has been called the \\"first test case\\" of NetzDG, a German Internet user sued Facebook for deleting a post that was critical of Germany. In April 2018, the court obtained an injunction ordering that the comment be restored.

Named after the playwright Galiaskar Kamal, it was founded on December 22, 1906. The first known Tatar theatrical efforts were during the 19th century when Tatar amateur theater groups emerged in some cities and towns of Russia with sizable Tatar populations. The first published Tatar-language play was \\"Unhappy Girl\\" (1886) by Gabdrakhman Ilyasi (1856‚Äì1895), written perhaps under the influence of the first Turkish playwright ƒ∞brahim ≈ûinasi and his play \\"≈ûair Evlenmesi\\" (A Poet's Marriage) which was published in 1860. Both plays deal with the problem of arranged marriages which were very common at that time. In the middle of the 19th century, Tatar amateur theater groups staged free performances in private houses and were attended by very few people. Their repertoire usually included the plays of Russian and foreign playwrights. The first public performance of a Tatar play in modern times took place in 1906 and was organized by the group \\"Sayar\\" (The Traveler). \\"Sayar\\" eventually became the leading Tatar professional theater company. In 1939 it was renamed after the playwright Galiaskar Kamal. In 1987, the company moved to its current building on the shore of the lakes Qaban. The theater's current repertoire consists mostly of plays written by Tatar playwrights but includes many plays of Russian and foreign playwrights as well. The theater provides special translation devices to audience members who do not understand Tatar. One of the peculiar features of Tatar culture during Soviet times was that Tatarstan, being an \\"autonomous republic\\" rather than a \\"union republic\\" within the USSR, was not allowed by Moscow to have its own film studio (whereas each \\"union republic\\" was entitled to one). As a result, most Tatar actors, producers and directors could develop their talents only within the realm of theater. All artistic talent in those fields of self-expression was concentrated exclusively in theater rather than both theater and film. This fact might explain the extraordinary commercial success of the Tatar theater and the remarkably high quality of its productions, as well as the enormous popularity of theater as a genre among Tatars.

He was the first umpire to stand in 100 ODIs. Steve Dunne was born in Dunedin, Otago. He is married with two sons. Before becoming an umpire, he played in one first-class match for New Zealand Under-23s in March 1966 and five first- class matches for Otago in the Plunket Shield in 1968/9, mainly as a left-arm medium-paced bowler. He took 10 wickets at a bowling average of 41.10. He averaged a paltry 4.28 with the bat. He umpired 39 Test matches and 100 ODIs between 1989 and 2002. His first 12 Tests were in New Zealand. In 1994, he and Brian Aldridge were the two New Zealand representatives on the first international panel of umpires, set up by the ICC to ensure that one neutral umpire would stand in every Test match (later supplemented by the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires). In the 2nd ODI between New Zealand and Pakistan in December 1992, at McLean Park in Napier, he made the first run out decisions in New Zealand by a television third umpire. He stood with Darrell Hair in the Boxing Day Test between Australia and Sri Lanka at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1995, in which Hair no-balled Muttiah Muralitharan for throwing. Dunne was criticised for failing to back Hair by similarly calling no-ball later in the match when Muralitharan bowled from Dunne's end, but he later defended himself, saying that the decision was too difficult to make on the field, and that he backed a previous decision to refer a bowler with a suspect action to the International Cricket Council for further investigation. In 2001, he and Doug Cowie reported Shoaib Akhtar after an ODI in at Carisbrook in Dunedin. He stood in four matches in the 1996 Cricket World Cup, including the semi-final between India and Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens in Calcutta, which was abandoned due to the rioting crowd after India lost their eighth wicket chasing the Sri Lankan score. The match was awarded to Sri Lanka. He also umpired in five matches in the 1999 Cricket World Cup. In 1999/2000, he stood in Pakistan's first Test match in India for 12 years, and the first Test between the sides for 9 years, at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. His 100th ODI was the match between New Zealand and England at his home ground in Dunedin on 26 February 2002. He had also stood in his first ODI at Carisbrook, just over 13 years earlier. He retired after he was not chosen as one of the eight umpires on the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires as he was considered not good enough for the modern game. He published an autobiographical account of his experiences, Alone in the Middle, in 2003.

In 1913 he returned to Odessa, where headed the group of modernists \\"The Independent\\", founded the private school \\"Free Studio\\" (1918), and participated in exhibitions of Odessa artists. After the Russian Revolution (1917) he was appointed to the People's Commissar of Arts of Odessa and to the head of the Committee for Protecting the Artistic and Historic Heritage. Since 1920 he lived in Moscow, where was the first art columnist of the newspaper Pravda, worked in the ROSTA Windows together with Vladimir Mayakovsky, and was professor of history of the Western art at the VKhUTEMAS. In 1927‚Äì29 he was missioned to Paris by the People's Commissar for Education A. Lunacharsky to read lectures on new Soviet arts. In 1932 he has contributed to the organization of the Moscow Regional Union of Soviet Artists (–ú–û–°–°–•) which later has been extended to the USSR Union of Artists. During World War II Nurenberg was in the evacuation in Tashkent (Uzbekistan). He continued to work as a painter and finished a series of anti-war paintings. After the war he has continued to work as an artist in Moscow, in particular for the Museum of Revolution. During his life, Nurenberg has worked in different styles‚Äîfrom avant-garde to realism, having always remained faithful to traditions of the School of Paris.

Pimagedine functions as an inhibitor of diamine oxidase and nitric oxide synthase. It acts to reduce levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) through interacting with 3-deoxyglucosone, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and related dicarbonyls. These reactive species are converted to less reactive heterocycles by this condensation reaction. History Pimagedine was under development as a drug for kidney diseases by the pharmaceutical company Alteon (now known Synvista Therapeutics Inc.) that was founded in 1986.Synvista Therapeutics Inc. Biocentury. Retrieved August 17, 2017. In 1987, Alteon acquired a license to intellectual property relating to AGE inhibition from Rockefeller University. In 1989, Alteon and Marion Merrell Dow Inc (MMD) entered into a joint development program for pimagedine. In 1992, Alteon licensed a patent from Rockefeller University relating to the use of pimagedine to inhibit AGE formation. In 1995, Hoechst AG (now Sanofi-Aventis) acquired MMD and subsequently terminated its agreement with Alteon, which led Alteon to stop clinical trials, which caused some controversy. In 1997, Alteon and Genentech announced a collaboration under which Genentech would fund development of pimagedine and would have the rights to sell the drug if it would be approved. In March 1998, Alteon announced that it had been advised that it should discontinue its Phase III trial of pimagedine in non-insulin- dependent (type II) diabetes patients with overt nephropathy, after the trial's external safety monitoring committee found an increased risk of side effects in the treatment group. In November 1998, Alteon announced that its Phase III trial for pimagedine as a treatment for end stage renal disease had failed to prove efficacy, which led Carl Gordon, a leading biotech analyst, to say: \\"It looks like pimagedine is probably finished.\\" In February, 1999, Genentech ended its collaboration with Alteon to develop pimagedine.http://business.globe24h.com/sec/001/06/060000/0000060271.shtml In April 1999 Alteon announced that it would cease development of pimagedine as a treatment for end stage renal disease but might consider continuing development in type 1 diabetic patients with overt nephropathy or progressive kidney disease. Alteon's 2000, 2001, 2002 annual reports indicated that it was not running any clinical trials on pimagedine but was seeking co-development partners.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/878903/0000893220-00-000381.txthttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/878903/000089322001000240/0000893220-01-000240.txthttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/878903/000089322002000222/0000893220-02-000222.txt Alteon's 2003 and subsequent annual reports did not mention that Alteon was seeking partners for pimagenine,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/878903/000089322003000272/0000893220-03-000272.txt which indicated that efforts to interest other companies and investors had failed and which signaled that commercial efforts to develop pimagedine as a drug were indeed finished.  Chemistry  = Synthesis = The industrial synthesis uses the reaction between cyanamide and hydrazine in aqueous solution. :File:Aminoguanidine_synthesis01.svg The compound can also be obtained from the reduction of nitroguanidine with zinc in acetic acid. = Properties = Aminoguanidine forms a colorless crystal that is soluble in water and ethanol. It is basic, producing salts when reacted with organic acids. With formic acid, a cyclization takes place to give 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. :600px The compound reacts with nitrous acid in acidic medium to give 5-aminotetrazole via the intermediate guanylazide.

The plaza features a monumental arch in its centre dedicated to Luis Dao√≠z and Pedro Velarde, two soldiers fallen to the French army on 2 May 1808 who became heroes in the national imaginary. The area was the place where the Montele√≥n Artillery barracks lied in 1808 and where the heroic defense of the aforementioned \\"martyrs\\" took place. In 1868 there was already an open semicircular space, but it left much to be desired. The municipal authorities, aware of the potential symbolic value, decided to refurbish and put the area in value. Following the demolishing of the Convent of Las Maravillas, the remains of the palace of the Dukes of Montele√≥n and further housing in order to create a gardened space with the monumental arch in its centre, the area was inaugurated on 1 May 1869.

Kalmƒ´te spent the last 46 years of his life in Minnesota, but was never fully integrated either artistically or socially into American society.LaSha, J.P.S., \\"JƒÅnis Kalmƒ´te\\", Tower Talks, Minneapolis, MN, October 1978, p. 14. His name is virtually unknown in American artistic circles, but within the global Latvian diaspora community his fame grew during his lifetime. After his death a substantial collection of his work was bequeathed to the Valmiera museum,Bl≈´ma, Iveta, \\"Valmieras muzejs\\" in Valmiera domƒÅ un rada (Valmiera Thinks and Creates) (2005). Valmiera, Latvia: Valmieras novadpƒìtniecƒ´bas muzejs, p. 75. and the Latvian National Museum of Art also possesses a collection of his paintings, including several early pre-war works. His paintings may be found in hundreds of private collections throughout the world, and Gallery Antonija in Rƒ´gahttp://www.antonia.lv. represents his work today. Although his work is strongly nationalistic, Kalmƒ´te was intensely interested in the development of Modernism and he described himself as an expressionist. The work of Vincent van Gogh was a major early influence, and he greatly admired many European modernist artists, such as Rouault, Vlaminck and, in particular, Braque. After immigrating to the United States, he was also influenced by American Abstract Expressionism, and stylistically his late works grew increasingly abstract.Sildegs, Arnolds, \\"JƒÅnis Kalmƒ´te\\", Latvju mƒÅksla (Latvian Art) volume 22, 1996. Today his work is becoming better known in his homeland, as the history of Latvian diaspora art. begins to be absorbed into the overall history of Latvian 20th-century art.

These fellowships permit professors, researchers and other senior academics to find temporary refuge at host universities and colleges anywhere in the world, enabling them to pursue their academic work and to continue to share their knowledge with students, colleagues, and the community at large. During the fellowship, conditions in a scholar's home country may improve, permitting safe return to help rebuild universities and societies ravaged by fear, conflict and repression. If safe return is not possible, the scholar may use the fellowship period to identify a longer-term opportunity. N.B. This is a program of the Institute of International Education. In 2007, as a response to an urgent appeal from Iraq's Ministry of Higher Education, IIE-SRF launched the Iraq Scholar Rescue Project. The Project's goal is to rescue Iraq's most senior academics ‚Äì in any academic discipline ‚Äì by placing them at institutions of higher learning in countries within the Middle East and North Africa region. History The Institute of International Education has helped rescue threatened scholars since its inception in 1919, demonstrating a commitment to protecting academic freedom. In the 1930s, IIE was instrumental in founding the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars, led by Edward R. Murrow. The program assisted scholars who were barred from teaching, persecuted and threatened with imprisonment by the Nazis. Over 300 scholars were rescued, some of whom became Nobel Laureates and many whose work and ideas helped shape the post-war world. Other major activities undertaken throughout the Institute's history, before the formal establishment of IIE-SRF in 2002, include: The Russian Student Fund (1920-1949), Rescue of Scholars from Fascist Italy (1922-1924), Rescue of Scholars from the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), Committee on Awards for Chinese Students (1942-1945), Emergency Program to Aid Hungarian University Students (in cooperation with World University Service) (1956-1958), The South African Education Program (1979-2001), Rescue of Burmese Refugees (1990-1992), Asia-Help (1998-2000), and Balkan-Help (1999-2000). IIE-SRF was founded in 2002, when IIE's trustees committed to making scholar rescue a permanent part of its work. Dr. Henry Jarecki, Dr. Henry Kaufman, and Thomas Russo, founded the Scholar Rescue Fund to aid threatened scholars find safe haven and continue their academic work. Since then, IIE-SRF has provided over 1,290 awards with the collaboration of over 400 institutions from over 45 different countries. In 2006, when security concerns in Iraq reached unprecedented levels, the IIE Scholar Rescue Fund began receiving hundreds of requests for assistance from threatened Iraqi scholars at major higher education institutions across the country and it became clear that the scope and scale of the Iraqi crisis required special attention. With generous funding from the private and public sectors, most notably, the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Richard Lounsbery Foundation, the IIE Scholar Rescue Fund responded by launching the Iraq Project. From 2007 to 2014, the Iraq Project provided support to Iraqi university professors and scientists to resume their teaching and research in safety. The Project's goal was to rescue more than 200 of Iraq's most senior academics ‚Äì in any academic discipline ‚Äì by placing them temporarily at institutions of higher learning in countries within the Middle East and North Africa region. (Some exceptions were made for university positions in other world regions.) By the Project's completion in September 2014, over 280 Iraqi scholars had received fellowships to help them resume their teaching and research activities in safety. The Iraq Project continues today through the Iraq Distance Learning Initiative, which \\"[fills] curricular gaps within Iraqi university courses with lectures in subjects ranging from nanotechnology to renewable energy mitigate the potential for brain drain.\\" This include the Iraq Scholar Lecture Series and the IIE-SRF University Joint Courses Project. IIE-SRF Mission To rescue scholars and, by protecting their lives and work, increase their countries' and the world's level of knowledge. The IIE Scholar Rescue Fund formalizes an unwavering commitment to academic freedom that the Institute of International Education has demonstrated for over 90 years. At the heart of IIE-SRF is the idea that each scholar helped who continues his or her work in safety is a beacon of hope in our world. Scholars IIE-SRF grantees are professors, established researchers and other senior academics from any country, field or discipline. Candidates are reviewed for academic qualifications, the quality/potential of the candidate's work, and the urgency of threats faced. As stated by Scholar Rescue Fund, preference is given to scholars: > \\"- Who are facing immediate, severe and targeted threats to their lives > and/or careers in their home country or country of residence; > \\\\- With a Ph.D. or other highest degree in their field who have extensive > teaching or research experience at a university, college or other > institution of higher learning; > \\\\- Who demonstrate superior academic accomplishment or promise; > \\\\- Whose selection is likely to benefit the academic community in the home > and/or host country or region.\\" IIE-SRF also states that: > \\"- Applications from female scholars and scholars who are members of ethnic, > racial, cultural or religious minority groups, or those otherwise > underrepresented in their field, are encouraged. > \\\\- Fellowships are approved by the IIE-SRF Selection Committee which > convenes at least three (3) times per year. > \\\\- The final fellowship award is dependent upon the location of the host > institution, the cost of living, and the value of any additional > contributions from the host institution or other source. > \\\\- Host academic institutions agree to accept the fellowship funds and > disburse the funds to the scholar. In most cases, host institutions are > required to match the IIE-SRF fellowship award through partial > salary/stipend support, research materials, and other in-kind assistance.\\" Reports Scholar Rescue in the Modern World is the Scholar Rescue Fund's world report, funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York, to share with a larger community the breadth and nature of the persecution of scholars around the globe. It is based on the data from the first five years of activity of the Scholar Rescue Fund (IIE-SRF), from its founding in April 2002 until May 2007.Scholar Rescue in the Modern World During this time, IIE-SRF received more than 1,000 inquiries from persecuted academics around the world. The report is based primarily on data collected from that time period from 847 applicants, 140 of whom were awarded grants. According to \\"Scholar Rescue in the Modern World,\\" life- and career-ending threats to scholars are widespread and egregious. Individuals in 101 countries, from a wide range of academic disciplines and fields, requested assistance; IIE-SRF provided direct support to scholars from 38 of these countries. While countries of origin spanned almost all regions of the world, seventy-five percent of IIE-SRF grantees came from two regions: the Middle East/North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. The report also identified five factors that cause scholar oppression: Low Gross Domestic Product (GDP); high level of conflict; low academic population; low academic population per million of country population; and Failed state status. The report also states that governments outnumber non-state actors, such as militias and rebel groups, in oppressing scholars by a factor of 3:1. The report also recommends several new programs or activities to mitigate scholar oppression worldwide. Recommendations include: a United Nations convention against the persecution of academics; special visas to enable persecuted scholars to cross borders to safety; and an index of academic oppression that might predict violence against scholars and in particular when and where the next big academic emergency might occur, much like Iraq. Scholars' countries of origin The IIE-SRF Fellowships have no geographic limits on awards, on the disciplines, or fields supported. Fellowships may be awarded to scholars from any country and/or institutions. As of 2017, IIE-SRF has hosted more than 750 scholars from the Middle East and North Africa (70.6%), Sub-Saharan Africa (11.1%), Europe and Eurasia (9.0%), Central, East, and South Asia (7.7%), and Latin American and the Caribbean (1.3%).

IIE-SRF works closely with each host partner institution to arrange a fellowship term and visiting position that works best for the scholar and the institution. As a visiting scholar, the IIE-SRF fellow might contribute to ongoing research or begin original research; complete pending publications; teach or co-teach; guest lecture in one or across departments; and/or serve as an on-campus resource to both students and faculty within any range of fields or subject matters. Beyond their academic fields, fellows may also be interested to share their personal experiences and knowledge related to their home countries and regions. IIE-SRF collaborates with the host partner institution to arrange fellowship appointments, typically for one year. Fellows are eligible to apply for a renewal award. If conditions in their home countries improve, fellows may return after their fellowships to make meaningful contributions to their national academies and civil society. If safe return is not possible, they may use the fellowship period to identify longer-term opportunities.

Popularly known as \\"Davidbabu\\", in his short life, he made a major contribution to the study of Hindu terracotta and brick temples of Bengal and was also one of the first scholars to write a study of the emerging field of Indian writing in English. Early life McCutchion was born in Coventry, England, and attended the red brick-built King Henry VIII Grammar School. While there it was bombed in a German raid and he was evacuated for a time. After the war he spent a year on national service in Singapore with the R.A.F.. He went up to Cambridge in 1950 to read Modern Languages (French and German) at Jesus College. An interest in the East was whetted by his time in Malaya, and after a period teaching in schools in southern France, he decided to travel out to India. An academic in Bengal In Jesus College his interest in the East had led to him being a keen member of the Tagore Society, a factor which must have drawn him to Bengal. He went out initially on a temporary six-month contract to teach English at Tagore's Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan. Thereafter in Calcutta he mixed with a circle of Indians writing in English around Purusottama Lal's Writers Workshop, a publishing house that went on to publish many of his works, some posthumously. As an academic McCutchion also took this phenomenon as his field. He became Professor, then Reader, in Comparative Literature at Jadavpur University in Calcutta after 1960, where he taught eighteenth-century French and English literature, and developed the critical theme of Indian writing in English, starting with an essay of 1962: The Novel as Sastra, a study of Raja Rao. Terracotta temples Around 1960 McCutchion met and developed an important friendship with Satyajit Ray based on a relaxed rapport. They both shared a taste for western baroque music. Ray asked him to help translate his film dialogue from Bengali into English, a task that helped inversely to increase McCutchion's command of Bengali. It was while on shooting location in Birbhum district for Abhijan in 1962, that McCutchion developed a fascination for the brick temples scattered across the Bengal landscape.Ray, Satyajit in 'Introduction' to Brick Temples of Bengal: From the Archives of David McCutchion edited by George Michell, (Princeton University Press, 1983) Over the next decade they became a passion; of categorising, conservation and documentation, driving his use of photography as a recording device. His photographic collection amounting to some 20,000 images (colour slides and b/w prints) was acquired by the V & A with copies held by the 'International Centre for Study of Bengal Art (ICSBA)'. He also studied and collected the Bengali patua art, or scroll paintings of traditional artists, which developed out of the religious art surrounding the temples. This collection was later bequeathed to the Herbert Art Gallery in Coventry. Early death David McCutchion's Grave, Bhawanipore Cemetery, Kolkata It was the arduous demands and hazards of tramping the Indian countryside that brought about his early and sudden death, a result of polio, in January 1972.W. Andrew Robinson. Satyajit Ray, The Inner Eye - (London: Andre Deutsch, 1989), pp329-331. A token of the affection he was held by those in Calcutta that knew him is evident in the tribute volume of recollections, David McCutchion: Shraddhanjali, and his correspondence with Purusottama Lal published soon after his death. In his last year McCutchion was a visiting lecturer at the University of Sussex where he introduced aspects of Indian culture to the student body through evening lectures and with visiting speakers, exhibitions, and film screenings. He is buried in the Bhawanipore Cemetery in Alipore and his grave lies in neglect.

Seward, was an American poet, composer, and prominent parliamentarian serving humanitarian and woman's club movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. A number of her works were published under the pseudonym \\"Agnes Burney\\"Duffield 1886, p. 639. , including several developed in collaboration with her spouse, Theodore F. Seward, an internationally known composer and music educator in his day. She became a groundbreaking advocate for the care and education of blind babies and young children during her later years, serving as president of the department for the blind of the International Sunshine Society. Early years Seward was born Mary Holden Coggeshall in New London, Connecticut. Her father, William Holden Coggeshall, was a veteran of the War of 1812 and a descendant of John Coggeshall, first president of the colony of Rhode Island.Packard 1906, p. 633. She was educated at the New London Female Academy where she studied under Hiram Warner Farnsworth. In 1860 she married Theodore F. Seward, a composer and music teacher who had previously worked as organist of a New London church. They lived in Rochester and Brooklyn in New York before relocating to East Orange, New Jersey in 1868.Hall 1914, p. 135. Poet and composer Words and music dedicated to singer Emma C. Thursby (1879) Though not prolific, her poems and tunes appeared in numerous periodicals and music books. They were published under her name, her pseudonym Agnes Burney, or anonymously on occasion. Her carol The Christmas Bells (circa 1869) has been set to music by at least five different composers. She produced tunes for her own lyrics as well as those of other poets; one of the most widely published was her setting of Mary A. Lathbury's Easter Carol (circa 1883). She had a long creative relationship with her composer husband and wrote verses for many of his songs. The 1867 collection The Temple Choir,Seward 1867. one of Theodore F. Seward's most successful hymnbooks, contained both words and music credited to her pseudonym. She frequently accompanied him on business trips, including the second European tour of the Fisk Jubilee Singers in 1875 for which he was voice trainer and musical director.Packard 1906, p. 633-634. Club woman and parliamentarian Exterior and library of the Woman's Club of Orange, NJ (circa 1908) Seward was involved with the woman's club movement for forty- seven years. She was a member of Sorosis, the first American club dedicated to the improvement and advancement of professional women, and an organizer of the National Society of New England Women which she served twice as president. She belonged to the Woman's Club of Orange since its inception where, as president, she made the motion calling for the formation of the New Jersey State Federation of Women's Clubs.Croly 1898, p. 826. She was a charter member of the International Sunshine Society founded by Cynthia W. Alden and served it many years as first vice president.Packard 1906, p. 634. She identified herself as a ‚Äúparliamentarian‚Äù, one proficient with ‚Äúthe minute details of presiding, of debating, of making motions, of conducting meetings.‚ÄùShattuck 1894, p. iv. Fellow ‚Äúclub women‚Äù described her as follows: Philanthropy and later years First blind babies and children education legislation of New York State (1912) ISS Department for the Blind advertisement (January, 1917) The International Sunshine Society, of which Seward was an officer, supported \\"Sunshine Homes\\" for the care and education of young children with a variety of disabilities. A Branch for the Blind was created in 1904 to provide services for blind children below the age of eight that existing public programs either ignored or had been housing with the mentally challenged.Barnard 1905, p. 653-654. The society opposed the then broadly held misconception that blind babies were \\"feeble-minded\\".State of New York 1918, p. 148. A preliminary Sunshine Home for blind babies was established in a three-room New York City flat and other donated space. Founder Cynthia W. Alden described the approach:State of New York 1918, p. 157. In 1905, the International Sunshine Department (originally Branch) for the Blind was separately incorporated with Seward serving as president. It acquired property in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn, New York for a larger facility to function as a combined home, nursery, hospital, and kindergarten. They petitioned the New York City Board of Education for support and in 1907 the Dyker Heights Home for Blind Babies became the site of the first public kindergarten for blind children in the United States operated by a major board of education. Seward subsequently became president of the Arthur Home for Blind Babies in Summit, New Jersey when it was established as a second combined facility in 1909.State of New York 1918, p. 150-152. The Department for the Blind also pursued critical legislative support. New York City passed the first legislation addressing the education and training of blind babies and young children in 1908. Thirteen states implemented relevant laws during the decade that followed, including New Jersey in 1911 and New York in 1912. Seward reported that \\"legislation in behalf of the blind baby was conceded by all members to be the greatest work of the society.\\"State of New York 1918, p. 107-108. Seward continued to work as an advocate for blind babies and director of Arthur Home for the remainder of her life. As an officer of the International Sunshine Society, she performed these tasks without pay or other compensation. She died suddenly on board a train bound for Buffalo, New York a few days before September 3, 1919.New York Times 1919, p. 13.

He became a member of the Society of Artists, and exhibited various pictures in its galleries in 1760‚Äì1764. He was outstanding as a coach painter, producing ornamental panels for carriages, floral embellishments, and heraldic devices to the highest quality, eventually becoming coach-painter to King George III. Duke of Devonshire arms He was a founding member of the Royal Academy, and, in 1784, was master of the Worshipful Company of Painter- Stainers. He exhibited at the Academy from its foundation until the year of his death. The works he showed were usually landscapes, but occasionally subject and animal paintings, his last exhibits there being Jupiter and Leda and Child at play. He painted an altarpiece, The Angel delivering St. Peter, for the church of St Peter Mancroft in Norwich. He retired from painting some years before his death. He died at his house in Judd Place, New Road, London, on 28 August 1798, and was buried in Bloomsbury cemetery.Nos 3 and 4 Gate Street (British History Online).

The Dutch and British were not yet at war, but the British wished to inspect the Dutch merchantmen for what they considered contraband destined for France, then engaged in the American War of Independence. Bylandt attempted to avoid the engagement by offering the ships' manifests, but when Fielding insisted on a physical inspection, Bylandt put up a brief show of force, before striking his colours. The British then seized the Dutch merchantmen and conducted them as prizes to Portsmouth, followed by the Dutch squadron. The incident worsened the diplomatic relations between Great Britain and the Dutch Republic almost to breaking point. It also contributed to the formation of the First League of Armed Neutrality to which the Dutch acceded in December, 1780. To prevent their receiving assistance from other members of that League, Britain declared the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War shortly afterwards. Background The Dutch Republic had, after a period of strife during the second half of the seventeenth century, become a steadfast ally of the Kingdom of Great Britain, initially (after the Glorious Revolution of 1688) as the senior partner in the alliance, but later in the eighteenth century as the increasingly junior partner. It was bound to Britain by a number of treaties of military alliance (notably those of 1678, 1689 and 1716) which arguably obliged it to offer armed support. On the other hand, it had obtained in the Treaty of Breda and its offshoot, the Commercial Treaty of 1668 (confirmed in the Treaty of Westminster) an important concession from England: the right to transport non- contraband goods in its ships to countries with which Britain was at war, without these goods being subject to seizure by Britain even if they were owned by subjects of belligerent powers (this was usually referred to as the principle of \\"free ship, free goods\\"). The concept \\"contraband\\" was narrowly defined in these treaties as \\"arms and munitions.\\" So-called \\"naval stores\\" (by which were commonly understood: ship's timbers, masts and spars, rope, canvas, tar and pitch) were not to be considered contraband.Edler, p. 96 This right became important during wars in which Britain was a participant, but the Republic remained neutral, like the Seven Years' War and after 1778 the American Revolutionary War, in which Britain opposed the rebelling American Colonies and their allies, France and Spain. Arguably it exempted Dutch bottoms from inspection by the Royal Navy (or at least from confiscation of the goods in British prize courts), thereby undermining Britain's ability to maintain an effective embargo on the trade of her enemies, especially because Dutch shipping at the time still played a major role in the European carrying trade.Edler, p. 100 William V, Prince of Orange, c. 1768-69 Though public opinion in the Republic became more and more sympathetic to the American Revolution in the years after 1776, the Dutch government that was dominated by stadtholder William V and his autocratic regime, inclined to support the British.Edler, p. 209; William was a cousin of king George III. Edler suggests that he had a personal stake in good relations with the British crown because he wished to marry off his only daughter to the Prince of Wales. However, in reality this happened much later (the daughter, Frederika Luise Wilhelmina, was born in 1770), and is unlikely to have had an influence at the time. To illustrate William's personal animosity toward the American Revolution: there exists a letter by him from August 1776 in which he calls the American Declaration of Independence \\"the parody of the proclamation issued by our forefathers against King Philip II.\\"; (2007) The declaration of independence: a global history. Harvard University Press, , p. 43 However, the highly federalized structure of the Republic prevented the central government from effectively interfering with the commerce of cities like Amsterdam, which conducted a highly profitable trade with the American rebels (exchanging arms and munitions for colonial wares, like tobacco) via the entrep√¥t of the Dutch West India Company in its colony of St. Eustatius. The Amsterdam merchants also supplied France with naval stores, which that country needed for its naval construction, but was unable to procure itself in Norway and the Baltic countries, due to the British blockade. The Republic as a neutral power was therefore very useful for the French and their war effort. Britain, of course, viewed these developments with disfavour, and tried to force the Dutch government to put a stop to them. Diplomatic means failed, however. The Republic refused to provide military assistance in the form of the \\"loan\\" of its mercenary Scottish Brigade, when Britain requested that brigade for service in America. It also (reluctantly) provided shelter in Dutch territorial waters for the squadron of the American privateer John Paul Jones in 1779, and refused to embargo the export of arms and munitions. These refusals were due to the influence of Amsterdam, but also to diplomatic counter-pressure of France, exerted by its highly able ambassador Paul Fran√ßois de Quelen de la Vauguyon. When diplomatic means did not suffice, Britain resorted increasingly to seizure of what it considered \\"contraband\\" in Dutch bottoms on the high seas by the Royal Navy and British privateers. This elicited howls of protest from the affected merchants, for which the Dutch government at first remained deaf. France then started to exert pressure on the Dutch government to \\"defend its treaty rights\\" by selectively imposing economic sanctions on the Dutch cities that supported the stadtholder in his opposition to taking countermeasures against the British \\"depredations\\". This soon convinced those cities to fall in line with Amsterdam and start clamouring for escort by Dutch naval vessels of convoys of merchantmen.Edler, pp. 100-117 The States-General of the Netherlands (the governing body of the Republic) changed its position in November, 1779 and ordered the stadtholder, in his quality of commander-in-chief of the Dutch armed forces, to start offering limited convoy services to Dutch shipping. This despite the fact that the Dutch navy, because of long neglect, had become only a shadow of its former self. The 20 ships of the line that were not too old to serve, were no match for the British ships armed with 90 or 80 guns. According to the Dutch historian De Jonge the Royal Navy at the time had 137 ships of the line and France 68. After much discussion the States-General had decided on a programme of naval construction in 1778. Twenty-four new ships of the line were to be built, but this programme progressed only slowly, mainly because only the province of Holland paid its share of the cost.De Jonge, pp. 391- 395 None of the new ships were as yet available. This did not bode well for a future naval conflict between the Republic and Great Britain and may help explain a certain lack of enthusiasm in the Dutch navy to engage in such a conflict. Though the Republic did not concede the British interpretation of the Commercial Treaty that naval stores were to be considered contraband after all, the stadtholder prevailed in his policy of nevertheless excluding such stores from the convoys, to minimize friction with the British.De Jonge, pp. 396-398 The incident When the first convoys were prepared in December 1779 (one to the West Indies, under Rear-Admiral Willem Crul, and another to France and the Mediterranean under Rear-Admiral Count Lodewijk van Bylandt), the stadtholder gave written instructions that these should exclude ships that transported naval stores (as he at the time understood that the British defined those: in essence ships' timbers). He also prohibited allowing ships from \\"nations not recognized by the Republic\\" (i.e. the ships of John Paul Jones) to become part of the convoys. Finally, he enjoined Bylandt to avoid anything that might jeopardize the neutrality of the Republic.De Jonge, p. 407, note 1 The British commander, Commodore Charles Fielding, c. 1780 The squadron of Admiral Bylandt departed from the Texel on 27 December 1779. It consisted of his flagship, the 54-gun ship of the line Prinses Royal Frederika Sophia Maria, the 40-gun Argo (Captain Jan Hendrik van Kinsbergen), the 44-gun Zwieten (Captain Nauman), the 26-gunValk (Captain Silvester) and the 26-gun Alarm (Captain Mulder).De Jonge, p. 407 They escorted 17 Dutch merchantmen.Fiske, p. 153 After progressing calmly a few days through the English Channel the convoy encountered a British squadron in the morning of 30 December. This consisted of the 90-gun , flying the broad pennant of Commodore Fielding, the 74-gun ships (Captain Thomas Allen), (Captain J. N. P. Nott), (Captain James Bradby) and (Captain Samuel Goodall), the 60-gun HMS Buffalo (Captain H. Bromedge), the 50-gun (Captain Anthony Hunt), the 32-gun (Captain Samuel Marshall), the 20-gun ships (Captain Isaac Prescott) and (Captain Richard Rodney Bligh), the 12-gun (Captain Richard Murray) and the 8-gun (Captain M. Cole).Beatson, p. 198 Courageux hailed the Dutch flagship and asked for a parley to which Bylandt agreed. Fielding then sent a boat with two parlimentaires, one of which was his flag captain Marshall. Marshall demanded Bylandt's acquiescence in a physical inspection of the Dutch merchantmen by the British.De Jonge, pp. 408- 409 Bylandt replied that such a request was unprecedented as in peacetime the bona fides of the naval escorts of the convoy were usually accepted when the commanding officer asserted on his word of honour that the convoy did not transport contraband. He produced the manifests of the ships in the convoy and sworn statements of the captains of the merchantmen that they did not transport contraband, and added that he had personally satisfied himself that the convoy did not contain ship's timbers, though the Dutch did not consider this contraband. Marshall asked whether the ships carried hemp or iron (he apparently was well informed) and Bylandt admitted that they did and that this had never been considered contraband. Marshall replied that according to the British these particular commodities now constituted contraband. Seeing that he would not get any further with Marshall, Bylandt then sent his own flag captain, his nephew Frederik Sigismond van Bylandt, to the Namur to negotiate directly with Fielding. This failed to produce agreement. Fielding announced that he would start searching the Dutch vessels the next morning (as night had now fallen) and the younger Bylandt replied that in that case the Dutch would open fire.De Jonge, pp. 409-411 During the night twelve of the Dutch merchantmen managed to slip away so that the next morning the convoy only consisted of the remaining five. Fielding now closed in with three of his ships of the line (Namur and two 74s) but was blocked by Bylandt with Prinses Royal, Argo and the frigate Alarm (the other two Dutch ships were out of reach). Nevertheless, Namur sent a launch to one of the Dutch merchantmen and Prinses Royal then fired two shots across its bow to make it veer away. About what happened next the British and Dutch versions differ. According to Bylandt and his captains in their depositions under oath during his court martial the three British ships immediately fired a broadside, to which the Dutch ships replied with one broadside of their own. According to Fielding he fired a single shot, which was answered by a broadside, to which the British answered with broadsides of their own.Fiske, p. 153; De Jonge, pp. 412- 413 and fn. 2 on 412 After this exchange of fire Bylandt immediately struck his colours and signalled the other Dutch ships to do the same. This was remarkable, as the Dutch standing orders explicitly prohibited Dutch ships from surrendering if they were still capable of fighting, even when the flagship surrendered. It transpired at Bylandt's court martial that he had given sealed orders to his captains before departure from the Texel that they had to surrender when he gave a designated signal. He later explained that he had written these secret orders, because he foresaw that he would be confronted with an overwhelming superiority in numbers and guns, against which resistance would be useless. He had decided to offer only token resistance in such a case, just enough to \\"satisfy honour\\", but that it was imperative to restrain his captains of undue displays of courage in such a case, as that would defeat his purpose of avoiding needless bloodshed.De Jonge, pp. 413-414 and p. 413 fn. 1 This was a typical example of eighteenth-century warfare that, more than modern warfare, was aimed at avoiding needless casualties. The British interpreted the striking of the colours as it was intended: to break off the fight and not a real surrender. They made no attempt to board the Dutch warships. Fielding proceeded with his inspection of the five merchantmen and duly arrested them when he found the \\"contraband\\" hemp. He then sent a message to Bylandt allowing him to rehoist his colours and proceed on his way. Bylandt replied, however, that he would stay with the merchantmen. Possibly annoyed by this, Fielding then demanded that the Dutch warships would salute the British flag as was his right under the several Anglo-Dutch treaties. Normally the Dutch did not object to this procedure, but in this case Bylandt hesitated. However, to avoid a needless firefight, and because he wished to carefully observe the treaties (as in his view Fielding had failed to do), so strengthening the Dutch case for presenting the British as aggressors, Bylandt complied under protest with this demand. Dutch public opinion would hold it against him. Finally the British sailed with their captives to Portsmouth, followed into port by Bylandt, who sent a complaint to the Dutch ambassador in Britain, count Van Welderen, as soon as he arrived.De Jonge, pp. 414-416 Aftermath The Dutch commander Lodewijk van Bylandt depicted in a caricature during the 1782 Brest Affair Dutch public opinion was understandably outraged, both by the British action and by what they considered Bylandt's pusillanimity, that in the view of many amounted to cowardice, if not treason. To defend his honour Bylandt then demanded a court martial to clear his name. This blue- ribbon panel, consisting of no less than seven admirals, soon acquitted him of all charges brought against him though his secret surrender orders required some suppleness of mind in explaining them away. However, the prosecutor delivered a statement for the prosecution that might easily have been taken for a statement for the defence, thereby giving a strong impression of a whitewash to contemporaries (though not to sympathetic historians like De Jonge). Many even suspected that Bylandt's conduct was the result of a conspiracy by the stadtholder to support the British.De Jonge, pp. 418-428 As a consequence of the political unrest, the stadtholder had to cease his resistance to unlimited convoy. The Dutch would henceforth try to defend their full treaty rights, to the satisfaction of France, which suspended its economic sanctions. The British, on the other hand, ceased all pretence of respecting those treaty rights. In April, 1780 the British abrogated the Commercial Treaty of 1668, and declared that they would henceforth treat the Dutch like any other neutral, without benefit of \\"free ship, free goods.\\" Edler, pp. 134-136 Meanwhile, however, Empress Catherine II of Russia, shocked by the incident and even more by a similar mistreatment by Spain of two Russian ships, decided to issue a manifesto in which she demanded respect of the \\"free ship, free goods\\" principle for all neutrals by the belligerents. France and Spain were quick to comply (Spain issued abject apologies), but Britain, of course, demurred: the declaration was mainly aimed at the practices of the Royal Navy. Catherine then started negotiations with other neutral powers, including the Republic, to form what was to become the (First) League of Armed Neutrality. The Republic saw an opportunity in it to protect itself from the British attacks on its trade without having to join the war against Great Britain. However, the Dutch overplayed their hand by asking for a guarantee of their colonies by the other members of the League. This Catherine was loath to grant. Eventually the Dutch settled for what was on offer and joined the League in December, 1780. The British then negated this gambit by declaring war on the Dutch for ostensibly unrelated reasons, thereby providing the other members of the League with an excuse to withhold their armed assistance to the Dutch. The Fourth Anglo-Dutch War had started.Edler, pp. 138-173 Notes and citations ;Notes ;Citations Sources (2001; repr. 1911 ed.) The Dutch Republic and The American Revolution.

Medieval use  Chroniclers of the Crusades from the 11th through the 13th centuries often used the various Classical Latin terms for trumpets and horns‚Äîincluding tuba, cornu, buccina, and lituus‚Äîalongside the more up-to-date French term trompe with reference to instruments employed in the Christian armies.

In the early 15th century, Jean de Gerson listed the lituus among those string instruments that were sounded by beating or striking, either with the fingernails, a plectrum, or a stick.

With an added adjective, the term lituus alpinus, was used in 1555 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in the earliest published description of the Alphorn: \\"nearly eleven feet long, made from two pieces of wood slightly curved and hollowed out, fitted together and skillfully bound with osiers\\".\\"longum fer√® ad pedes undecim, duobus lignis modic√® incuruis & excauatis compactum, & uiminibus scit√® obligatum\\" (Conrad Gessner, De raris et admirandis herbis qvae sive qvod noctv luceant, siue alias ob causas, lunariae nominantur, commentariolus : & obiter de alijs etiam rebus qu√¶ in tenebris lucent : inferunter & icones quedam herbarum nove : eivsdem descriptio Montis Fracti, siue Montis Pilati, iuxta Lucernam in Heluetia : his accedvnt Io.

Johann Sebastian Bach specified the use of two litui for his composition O Jesu Christ, Meins Lebens Licht (BWV 118). This motet or cantata, written in the 1730s, is believed to be the only surviving score that specifies the use of the lituus, and the only known piece ever written for the instrument. Since there are no known surviving examples of a Baroque lituus, the exact appearance and sound is unknown. However, researchers have relied on depictions of instruments they believed to be similar to the lituus in order to approximate its characteristics.  Reconstruction  The modern design and construction of Bach's lituus was initiated when the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis (SCB) in Switzerland approached a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh to assist with the recreation. The student and his research team had developed a software application for working with brass instrument design. The SCB provided the Edinburgh team with details and assumptions about the correct design of the lituus. The software application was then to convert those designs into an accurate representation of the shape, pitch, and tone of the medieval instrument. The Edinburgh team produced two identical prototypes, approximately 2.5 meters long. The lituuses are straight and thin, with a flared bell at the end. The horns are made of pine and feature cow horn mouthpieces. The Edinburgh team noted that the reconstructed instrument could easily have been made in Bach's time using then-current technology. The tone of the finished instruments is described as \\"piercing\\" and they have a limited range. One member of the development team referred to the tone as being \\"broadly like a trumpet\\" but more \\"haunting\\". The reconstructed lituus has also been described as difficult to play. SCB musicians used the reconstructed lituus in a performance of O Jesu Christ, Meins Lebens Licht, believing they are the first to do so since Bach's time.

The airport is home to Diamond Aircraft Industries  Location  Wiener Neustadt East Airport is located northeast of the city of Wiener Neustadt and south of Theresienfeld. The next larger commercial airport is Vienna International Airport which is located about 60 km north of Wiener Neustadt. Wiener Neustadt East Airport is the second largest airport in the city of Wiener Neustadt. The largest is Wiener Neustadt West Airport which is a military airport.  History  In 1915 the √ñsterreichische Flugzeugfabrik (√ñFFAG) opened Wiener Neustadt Airport as their factory airfield. During World War II, the airfield was used for military purposes. The airfield was closed until 1972 the Sport Flieger Club Austria (SFCA) rented the airfield to continue its operations. The SFCA overhauled and rebuilt the airport. The airport had four grass runways until the SFCA decided to build an asphalt runway, which is still un use today. One year later Diamond Aircraft, Austria's most famous aircraft factory, located their headquarters and factories at Wiener Neustadt Airport. In 1998 Diamond Aircraft Industries bought 51% of the airfield and the Diamond SFCA Ges.m.b.H. was created to manage all operations of the airport. Wiener Neustadt East Airport is one of the oldest airports in Europe.  Facilities  The airport has two aprons which are approved for commercial operations. Mostly the southern apron is only used by business jets, while the north apron is used for general aviation and formerly for commercial operations. For passengers there are two restaurants.

Education and early life Milstein was born in 1947 in Ulm, Germany where his family took refuge after being displaced during the Holocaust. With his family, he immigrated to the newly founded state of Israel at the age of two. Milstein was first fascinated by chemistry when attending high school in the town of Rehovot where ‚Äúan enthusiastic, old-fashioned chemistry teacher who didn‚Äôt care much about orbitals‚Äù inspired him ‚Äúwith vivid, thought-provoking experiments‚Äù.The Skeptical Chymist (http://blogs.nature.com/thescepticalchymist/2008/09/reactions_david_milstein.html) Pursuing his interest, Milstein received B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in chemistry from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Career and research Milstein carried out postdoctoral research at the University of Iowa and at Colorado State University with John Kenneth Stille, where he performed key research leading up to the Stille reaction. This reaction remains highly topical. In 1979 at the conclusion of his postdoc, Milstein joined DuPont Central Research & Development in Wilmington, Delaware, where he became a group leader in the area of homogeneous catalysis. In 1987, he took position at the Weizmann Institute of Science, where he is now the Israel Matz Professorial Chair of Organic Chemistry. =Independent research= Milstein's research has mainly focused on complexes of groups 8, 9, and 10 transition- metal complexes. A hallmark of his research is the use of pincer ligands, particularly those with substituents that absorb or release hydrogen. Reaction of H2 with a Milstein catalyst. In early independent research, he examined the activation of C-C, C-H, C-F, N-H, and O-H bonds.. In one case, he described insertion of rhodium into a C-C bond using a pincer-type substrate. This paper established a general strategy for C-C activation in homogeneous systems.The Fall of the C-C Bond http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v364/n6439/abs/364676a0.html Related research focused on other strong bonds to carbon, e.g. the C-F bond. In other research at the early stages in his independent career, he examined the then rare oxidative addition of N-H and O-H.Zhang et al. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja059914h Milstein achieved acclaim for the discovery of pincer complexes that catalyze dehydrogenation reactions concomitant with condensations. In one breakthrough, amides are generated by dehydrocoupling of a mixture of alcohols and amines: : RCH2OH + R'NH2 ‚Üí RC(O)NHR' + 2 H2 This discovery was selected by Science magazine as one of the top ten breakthroughs of 2007. The reaction has been praised for its selectivity and mildness.

In this system, he devised ruthenium catalysts to promote the evolution of hydrogen and oxygen in consecutive thermal- and light-driven steps. The process embodied a new light- driven water splitting strategy that does not require a sacrificial chemical in the process.New way to split water https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090406102555.htm =Honors and awards= * 2019 Elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) * 2018 Elected a member of the US National Academy of Sciences * 2017 Recipient of the European Prize of Organometallic Chemistry * 2017 Recipient of the Israel Chemical Society Gold Medal * 2016 recipient of the ENI Award for Protection of the Environment2016 recipient of the ENI Award for Protection of the Environment https://www.eni.com/en_IT/innovation/eni-award/2016-milstein- environment-protection.page * 2012 Election to the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities * 2012 Israel Prize recipient in Chemistry and Physics * The Humboldt Research Award by the Alexander Von Humboldt Foundation, 2011 * Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry (FRSC), 2010 * The 2010 Royal Society of Chemistry Sir Geoffrey Wilkinson Award * The 2007 American Chemical Society Award in Organometallic Chemistry * Research selected by Science among the top 10 major scientific breakthroughs of the year 2007 * The 2006 Israel Chemical Society Prize * Election to the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, 2006 * Miller Visiting Professor, Miller Institute, UC Berkeley, spring 2006 * The I.M.

For law enforcement, corrections, military, and other personnel involved in emergency response operations, the protection against blunt impact threats can be a matter of life or death. To quantify the levels of protection of a Blunt Trauma PPE, users and industry rely on technical standards. A balance between protection and functionality allow users to have good flexibility and mobility. Good air ventilation underneath the PPE suit can protect users against heat stroke or hyperthermia.  Blunt impact threats  Law enforcement and corrections officers are involved in crowd management, civil disturbances, cell extractions, riot control, violent disturbances, and other emergency response operations. During these highly dynamic situations, blunt impact threats are associated with hand-held objects, thrown objects, improvised weapons, personal assaults, punches, thrusts, kicks or falls. Those threats can result in minor to unsurvivable injuries, which are quantified with an injury severity score on the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS).  Impact attenuation standards  To assure their blunt trauma equipment is safe, end-users and industry refer to the impact attenuation criteria as the test methods and criteria set out in the following standards, which apply to personal protective apparel intended to provide protection to the torso, arms and legs, including joints. * Canadian Standards Association: CAN/CSA Z617-06 Personal Protective Equipment for Blunt Trauma.CAN/CSA Z617-06 Standard .

Problems that arise from living in poverty may include not having enough money to spend on food and clothes, poor housing conditions, homelessness, and limited lifestyle choices that may lead to social exclusion. Inspired by its founding principle of solidarity, the European Union joined forces with its Member States to make 2010 the European Year For Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. The objectives were to raise public awareness about these issues and renew the political commitment of the EU and its Member States to combat poverty and social exclusion. The year also challenged stereotypes and collective perceptions of poverty.  How will it work?  Civil society organisations and social partners joined participating countries and the European Commission to run activities throughout 2010. Two European-level conferences took take place in January and December; an art initiative built a bridge between people experiencing poverty and social exclusion and the creative world; while a journalist competition rewarded the best articles about poverty and social exclusion in Europe. National and local events took place in every EU member state, plus Norway and Iceland. Activities included awareness raising campaigns, workshops and information seminars in schools. Films, magazines and other information material were produced across participating countries to help people understand how poverty and social exclusion affect their communities, what initiatives there are to fight it, and for those directly affected, to increase awareness of their rights.

Early life She was born in New York City on November 16, 1851, the only child of Francis Hauck, a German emigrant, and his American wife. Soon after Minnie's birth the Haucks moved to Providence, Rhode Island, and then to Sumner, Kansas, in 1857. It was later wrongly rumoured that Hauk was the daughter of the financier Leonard Jerome, who was a devotee of the opera.Million Dollar Princesses (ITV3, 8 October 2015) Career In 1865, Hauk began vocal studies with Achille Errani, who secured her a spot with the Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company. At age fourteen she made her public debut as opera singer in Brooklyn as Amina in La sonnambula, and a month later, in November 1866, her New York City debut as Prascovia in L'√©toile du nord. In the American premiere of Gounod's Rom√©o et Juliette (November 15, 1867) she sang Juliette. Hauk sang for the first time in Europe at Covent Garden, London, on 26 October 1868, and debuted in Paris in 1869. The soprano then appeared in Italian and German opera at the Grand Opera in Vienna (1870‚Äì1874) and other venues throughout Europe. Hauk interpreted the role Carmen, the previously unsuccessful opera by Georges Bizet, in a new intensive way for the first time on January 2, 1878 in Brussels. The immediate success brought the opera to longlasting fame. She then played the role at the opera's British and American premieres in 1878. Hauk performed Manon at its American premiere in 1885. Her voice became a mezzo-soprano of great strength and depth. Hauk stopped to sing intensive opera tours by end of 1893. Hauk's enormous repertory included approximately one hundred roles, and she sang Carmen in four languages. Later life and death In 1878 she married Ernst von Hesse- Wartegg, the Austrian-American writer and traveler. Much of Hauk's fortune was lost during World War I. By 1920 she was thought to be impoverished and was nearly blind. Hauk died at her home near Lucerne, Switzerland, in 1929. Notes References *Edward T. James, Janet Wilson James, Paul S.

Much of Allentowns's park system can be attributed to the efforts of industrialist General Harry Clay Trexler (1854-1933). Inspired by the City Beautiful movement in 1906, Trexler brought in B. A. Hamilton, a nationally known city park consultant. Haldeman provided the plans for the development of the growing city, and J. Franklin Meehan of Philadelphia was the landscape architect who laid out the parks.Allentown, 1762‚Äì1987, a 225 Year history, Volume II, 1921‚Äì1987, Lehigh County Historical Society, 1987. Allen Park, in the vicinity of Trout Hall, was the first city park in Allentown, although it did not become city property until 1908. West Park, a park in what was a community trash pit and sandlot baseball field became the first public park established in an upscale area of the city. In 1906 General Trexler hired Meehan to lay out a park on the land, which opened in 1909. West Park features a bandshell, designed by noted Philadelphia architect Horace Trumbauer, which has long been home to the Allentown Band and other community bands. Soon afterwards, it became apparent that a need existed for recreational facilities for children and young people. Meetings of the Allentown City Council were held about this and several proposals were presented and discussed. In 1912, the city's first public playground was established at Fountain Park. During the summer vacation months, all Allentown School District school grounds are open as neighborhood playgrounds. Trexler also facilitated the development of Cedar Creek Park, the Allentown Municipal Golf Course and the Trout Nursery in Lehigh Parkway. After his death in 1933, Trexler's summer estate, a 142-acre tract was willed to the City of Allentown and was renamed Trexler Memorial Park. Today, the Harry C. Trexler Trust continues to provide private funding for the maintenance and development of Allentown's park system.

He served on the Fullerton City Council (1984-2002) including 3 years as Mayor, on the Orange County Board of Supervisors (2003-2010), on the California State Assembly (2010-2012) and was elected to the Orange County Republican Central Committee in 2016. Early life A native of Fullerton, California, Chris Norby was one of four children born to Cornell and June Norby. During his youth, Chris Norby played Little League baseball, Pop Warner football, and sang in the First Presbyterian Church children's choir. He was also a Boy Scout and worked in the Norby family's lumber yard. As a teenager, Norby volunteered for Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign and worked as a guide at the Haunted Shack at the Knott's Berry Farm amusement park. Attending Fullerton Union High School, he played on the football and track teams and was elected Student Body President. He wrote for both the school newspaper and the Fullerton News Tribune. Norby volunteered for Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign in 1964 and Eugene McCarthy's presidential campaign in 1968. He enrolled at Occidental College in Los Angeles, where he graduated with a B.A. in Religious Studies in 1972. He was Co-Chair of Occidental's first Earth Day in 1970, elected to the Board of Governors (1970‚Äì71) co-founded the Omega Tau Rho fraternity and was active as a Yell Leader (1970‚Äì72). He later earned a teaching credential and Master's degree in History at Cal State University, Fullerton.[1] During most of 1973, Norby traveled around the world, visiting 24 countries, mostly by hitch-hiking and taking local buses and trains. He wrote about his experiences in his book called ‚ÄúThe Hippy Trail.\\" Teaching career Norby taught secondary students in both Catholic and public schools for 25 years, including St. Joseph School in Placentia, Alverno High School in Sierra Madre, Arcadia High School and 18 years at Brea-Olinda High School in Brea, At Brea-Olinda, he served as Pep Squad Advisor, Assistant Wrestling Coach, and advisor to the Swing Dance and Young Republicans Clubs. Students voted Norby ‚ÄúMr. Brea Teacher-of-the-Year‚Äù in 1998. Fullerton city council In April 1984, Norby was elected to the Fullerton City Council and was re-elected in 1988, 1992, 1996, and 2000, serving 18 years until his election to the Orange County Board of Supervisors in 2002. Norby was awarded the 1997 Samuel Adams Award for Leadership in Local Government from the Local Government Council, a nonprofit organization that seeks to promote free market policies. County supervisor In March 2002, Norby became the first person in 22 years to defeat an incumbent Orange County Supervisor when he won 54% of the vote in the Fourth Supervisoral District, representing Fullerton, Placentia, La Habra, Buena Park, and West Anaheim. The Los Angeles Times described it as \\"one of the biggest upsets in the county's political history.\\" Norby was re-elected in 2006 and elected Chairman of the Board of Supervisors in 2007. While Supervisor, Norby helped end the County's futile efforts at converting El Toro Marine base into an unneeded commercial airport and pushed for reforms of public pensions and public contracting. In response to the U.S. Supreme Court decision Kelo v. City of New London expanding government's power to seize private property, Norby authored Measure A, which strengthened the rights of homeowners and other private property owners by prohibiting Orange County government from seizing private property to give to a different private owner. The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to put Measure A on the ballot, which voters approved by a 76%‚Äì24% margin. Norby also proposed and gained passage of a county ordinance issuing medical marijuana identification cards to eligible patients to show to police officers when questioned about marijuana possession. Norby served on the Orange County Transportation Authority as chairman, Eastern/Foothill Toll Road Authority, OC Sanitation District, OC Fire Authority Board and represented Orange County on the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) where he served as Co-Chair of the Committee on Local Government Fiscal Reform. State legislator Norby won a special election to represent the 72nd State Assembly District in 2009, following the resignation of Michael D. Duvall, and was re-elected to a full term in 2010, representing Fullerton, Brea, La Habra and parts of Orange, Yorba Linda and Anaheim. In 2012, Norby was reapportioned into the 65th State Assembly District, where he narrowly lost the 2012 election, being outspent 3-1 by public employee unions. While in the legislature, Norby worked for bipartisan reforms in criminal justice reform, particularly for non-violent drug offenders. He introduced bills to curb asset seizure abuse. He worked directly with Governors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jerry Brown for the reform and ultimate dissolution of state redevelopment agencies, ending decades of fiscal and eminent domain abuses. =Fighting redevelopment agencies= As a Fullerton City Councilman, Norby had \\"gained a name statewide as a fierce critic of redevelopment projects.\\" In 1996, while Mayor of Fullerton, he founded Municipal Officials for Redevelopment Reform (MORR), a statewide coalition dedicated to fighting redevelopment agencies' provision of taxpayer subsidies to private development and eminent domain abuse. Norby also wrote Redevelopment: The Unknown Government, a book describing the distortions caused by the fiscalization of land use, eminent domain abuse, and sales tax competition that results in big- box stores, car dealerships, and sports teams receiving huge public subsidies. During his time as an Orange County Supervisor, Norby continued his fight against redevelopment agencies, sponsoring conferences to share information on how to combat redevelopment agencies, testifying against efforts to extend redevelopment project deadlines beyond 40 years, creating and gaining passage of Measure A to prevent eminent domain from being used to seize private property to give to another private party. As a California state Assemblyman, Norby continued his fight against redevelopment agencies, citing it as one of his top legislative priorities. He argued against redevelopment agencies in media-sponsored debates, spoke at community meetings across the state, and published articles in various state publications calling for redevelopment money to be spent on education instead. Norby introduced legislation in the Assembly to prohibit redevelopment agencies from using tax revenue to subsidize professional sports teams or their stadiums. He also introduced legislation to force redevelopment agencies to be subject the Local Agency Formation Commission process, as other local agencies were required to be. Norby crossed party lines to partner with Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat, in an eventually successful effort to abolish redevelopment agencies. When redevelopment agencies filed a lawsuit to overturn California's new law abolishing the agencies, Norby filed an amicus curiae brief with the Supreme Court of California in defense of the new law. Personal life Norby currently works as a land-use consultant for several housing developers and helped successfully develop digital signs along the 91 Freeway with the City of La Palma. He is active in Buena Park Rotary Club, Sons of Norway, Fullerton Elks Lodge and YMCA. He serves on the Fullerton High School's English Learners Advisory Committee (ELAC) and Chairs the District English Learners Advisory Committee (DELAC) for the Fullerton Joint Union High School District. Norby resides in Fullerton and is the father of five children, Ana, Iris, Gary, Alex and Johnny. Norby is the head usher at his family's church, the First Presbyterian Church of Fullerton.

From then on the club ‚Äì now renamed Jewish Guild ‚Äì went from strength to strength, reaching the Castle Cup final in 1964 while still playing in the provincial league. When South Africa's National Football League voted to establish a national second division to start in 1969, Jewish Guild was among the 10 clubs admitted. The first season, they ended in fifth place. The following season, 1970, they ran away with the championship with a nine-point margin over runners-up Durban Celtic in the era of two points for a win. Thus Jewish Guild were promoted to the highest level of South African association football in the days of apartheid in the whites-only league. Their best season in the top division was 1975, when they placed sixth in a 15-team league. After that 1975 season, the club officially merged with Johannesburg Corinthians to form Guild Apollo, which in turn played as Roodepoort Guild in 1977, the final NFL season, before finally folding.

The overall anti- nuclear movement gained significant traction in 1954 after public attention was drawn to a particular incident, where the testing of a hydrogen bomb on March 1 accidentally contaminated the \\"Lucky Dragon\\", a Japanese fishing vessel. The incident drew sharp criticism from Japanese officials, seeing that the nuclear legacy of World War II was still fresh in Japanese culture.

Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts at Stanford University, formerly the Stanford University Museum of Art, and commonly known as the Cantor Arts Center, is an art museum on the campus of Stanford University in Stanford, California. The museum first opened in 1894 and now consists of over 130,000 square feet of exhibition space, including sculpture gardens. The Cantor Arts Center houses the largest collection of sculptures by Auguste Rodin in an American museum, with 199 works by Rodin, most in bronze but also other media. The museum is open to the public and charges no admission. History Historic facade and main entrance. When it first opened its doors to the public in 1894, the Leland Stanford Jr. Museum was unique among American museums, having been privately founded by a family with a general collection of world art on a par with the major public museums being built at the time. For decades Leland Stanford and his wife Jane Stanford had traveled extensively, collecting American paintings and European Old Master paintings, as well as a wide array of antiquities from Egypt, Greece, Rome, Asia, the Americas, and other parts of the world. By the turn of the century, the Stanford museum, with its large archeological and ethnological holdings as well as art, was the largest privately-owned museum building in the world. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake was an enormous disaster for the museum. The Roman, Egyptian and Asian galleries were destroyed, and three-quarters of the building was damaged beyond repair. The Oxford Assyriologist Archibald Sayce, recalling a visit to Stanford in 1917, wrote that \\"the rooms of its spacious Museum were still a scene of wreckage. The magnificent collection of Greek vases it once contained had been hopelessly shattered; even the Egyptian mummies were torn and dismembered.\\" The earthquake, along with the death of co-founder Jane Stanford the previous year, sharply curtailed the budget of the museum, which had no endowment. Faculty and administration had little interest in restoring the museum, and the building and its collection fell into disrepair. Curatorial duties ceased. The Thinker by Rodin in the rotunda of the new wing.In 1917 Pedro Joseph de Lemos resigned as head of the San Francisco Art Institute to teach at Stanford, where he also served as Curator and Director of the Stanford University Museum and the Thomas Welton Stanford Art Gallery until 1945. He reorganized the museum and began a regular series of exhibitions at both venues. But during this period the art collection was decimated by loss, sales, and gifts, and the poorly secured storage area became a quarry for local collectors and dealers. In 1945, after de Lemos' departure, the museum was officially closed in order to conduct an inventory of the art holdings. The university's art department saw the inventory as an opportunity to divest the museum of works of art lacking aesthetic merit. An enormous accumulation of worthless material was disposed of, but so too were paintings and sculptures from the original Stanford family collection judged now to be of greater value than was believed in the 1950s, including works by Albert Bierstadt, William Bradford, Norton Bush, and Thomas Hill. In 1953, the Committee for Art at Stanford was founded, with the intention of recruiting members and raising funds to reopen the museum, and in 1954, after nine years of stocktaking, the museum reopened. Athena, by 19th century Italian sculptor Antonio Frilli, presides over the marble vestibule.In 1963, as part of the university's revitalization of the humanities under Dean Robert R. Sears, Professor Lorenz Eitner was instated as chair of the department of art and architecture. Assisted by faculty, staff, and The Committee for Art, Eitner began to revive the museum. Over the next 25 years, galleries were gradually refurbished, collections were significantly strengthened, and a program of exhibitions, educational services, and publications was put in place. 1985 saw a major development when professor Albert Elsen worked with art collector B. Gerald Cantor and other donors to open the B. Gerald Cantor Rodin Sculpture Garden. Facade of the new wing.In 1989, the museum suffered severe damage from the Loma Prieta earthquake and was forced to close. In 1991, Stanford hired Thomas K. Seligman to direct the rebuilding of the museum. Polshek & Partners of New York (now Ennead Architects) won the architectural competition, with Richard Olcott as principal designer. Groundbreaking took place on October 26, 1995, and the museum reopened in late 1999 as the Iris & Gerald Cantor Center for the Visual Arts, named after Iris and B. Gerald Cantor. The project cost $36.8 million, which included seismic upgrade of the entire 78,000 square foot historical building, and construction of a new 42,000 square foot wing including galleries, a sculpture terrace, auditorium, bookshop and cafe. The Rodin Sculpture Garden was renovated, and new gardens were installed for displaying contemporary art. Gates of Hell (detail) in the Rodin Sculpture Garden.In 2011, Stanford University announced the donation of 121 paintings and sculptures from Harry W. and Mary Margaret Anderson, and their daughter, Mary Patricia Anderson Pence, of Atherton, California. The collection, mostly of post-WW2 American art, includes works by Mark Rothko, Richard Diebenkorn, Manuel Neri, Frank Lobdell and Willem de Kooning, and Jackson Pollock's Lucifer (\\"probably the privately owned 20th century American artwork most coveted by museums nationwide\\"). To house and display this collection, a new museum, the Anderson Collection at Stanford University, was built directly adjacent to the Cantor Arts Center. Designed by the same architect who designed the new wing of the Cantor, Richard Olcott of Ennead Architects, the Anderson Collection opened in 2014. The building has 15,000 square feet of exhibition space. Like the Cantor, the Anderson Collection is free and open to the public. Collection The Cantor Arts Center's collection is encyclopedic in nature, with over 38,000 items. The collections include: African Art, American Art, Ancient Art, Andy Warhol Photography Archive, Art of Asia and Oceania, Art of the Indigenous Americas, Auguste Rodin, Eadweard Muybridge, European Art, Modern and Contemporary Art, Photographs, Prints and Drawings, Richard Diebenkorn Sketchbooks, Sculptures on Campus, and collectons and memorabilia of the Stanford Family.

The school is a full member of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs (APSIA), a group of schools of public policy, public administration, and international studies. FSI's core and affiliated faculty represent a range of academic backgrounds and perspectives, including medicine, law, engineering, history, political science, economics, and sociology. The faculty's research and teaching focus on a variety of issues, including governance, domestic and international health policy, migration, development, and security. Their work often examines regional dynamics in areas such as Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America. FSI faculty conduct research, lead interdisciplinary research programs, educate graduate and undergraduate students, and organize policy outreach that engages Stanford in addressing some of the world's most pressing problems. The institute is composed of 12 centers and programs, including six major research centers: *Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law (CDDRL) *Center on Food Security and the Environment (FSE) *Center for Health Policy, Primary Care and Outcomes Research (CHP/PCOR) *Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC) *The Europe Center (TEC) * Walter H. Shorenstein Asia‚ÄìPacific Research Center (APARC) History The institute was founded in 1987 following a faculty committee review that concluded Stanford \\"should be leading the way in International Studies as we do in science and technology\\", encompassing interdisciplinary teaching, research, public service and administrative functions. It was first called the institute for International Studies, and was created under the direction of former Stanford President Richard Wall Lyman. The institute was renamed the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies in 2005 following a $50 million gift made by Stanford alumni Bradford M. Freeman and Ronald P. Spogli. The immediate past director of FSI was Mariano-Florentino Cu√©llar, the former Stanley Morrison Professor of Law at Stanford Law School, a former official in the Obama and Clinton presidential administrations, and current Justice of the California Supreme Court. Previous Directors include Stanford President Emeritus Gerhard Casper; Coit D. Blacker, who served as Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and Senior Director for Russian, Ukrainian and Eurasian Affairs at the National Security Council under National Security Advisor Anthony Lake during the Clinton administration; David Holloway; Walter Falcon; and Stanford President Emeritus Richard Lyman. FSI appoints faculty and research staff, funds research and scholarly initiatives, directs research projects, and sponsors lectures, policy seminars and conferences. By tradition, FSI undertakes joint faculty appointments with Stanford's seven schools and draws faculty together from the University's academic departments and schools to conduct interdisciplinary research on international issues that transcend academic boundaries. The institute is home to 40 billeted faculty members ‚Äì most with joint appointments ‚Äì and 115 affiliated faculty members with a wide range of academic perspectives. In addition to its six centers, the institute sponsors the Ford Dorsey Master's in International Policy, the Inter-University Center for Japanese Language Studies, the Program on Energy & Sustainable Development, the Rural Education Action Program, the Stanford Center at Peking University, and the Stanford Program on International and Cross-Cultural Education.

History Since its founding in 1980, the Stanford Humanities Center has been sponsoring advanced research into the historical, philosophical, literary, artistic, and cultural dimensions of the human experience. The Humanities Center's annual fellows, international visitors, research workshops, digital humanities laboratory, and roughly fifty annual public events strengthen the intellectual and creative life of the university, foster innovative and interdisciplinary scholarship and teaching, and enrich our understanding of our common humanity. The humanities support democratic culture by nurturing an informed citizenry and seeking solutions to society's most formidable challenges. Fellowships The Center offers approximately twenty-five year-long residential fellowships to Stanford and non-Stanford scholars at different career stages, giving them the opportunity to pursue their research in a supportive intellectual community. Research Workshops Each year, Stanford faculty and graduate students create fifteen diverse research workshops to ask new intellectual questions that often challenge disciplinary boundaries. In addition to providing a space for incubating new ideas in a collegial setting, the workshops professionalize graduate students by introducing them to the conventions of academic life.  Manuscript Review Workshops  Assembling a team of faculty experts from Stanford and other universities, the Manuscript Review workshops provide critical feedback to junior faculty preparing monographs or other academic manuscripts of similar scope for submission for publication. Public Lectures The Center brings eminent scholars, public intellectuals, and renowned critics to the Stanford campus for lectures and interdisciplinary conferences that enrich the Stanford community with a lively exchange of ideas. Speakers have included Isabel Allende, Roger Chartier, Stephen Jay Gould, Douglas Hofstadter, Gayatri Spivak, Marilynne Robinson, David Adjaye, David Eggers, and other well-known scholars.  Digital Humanities  The Humanities Center, with the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA), is expanding the possibilities of humanities research and teaching at Stanford by creating opportunities for the discovery and dissemination of new knowledge. Humanities Center scholars are on the forefront of innovation with access to new digital tools to interpret the human experience.  International Visitors Program  The Center's short-term visitorships draw distinguished international scholars to Stanford to share their research in lectures and seminars with Stanford faculty and students.  Hume Undergraduate Fellowships  The Humanities Center awards Hume Humanities Honors Fellowships to Stanford seniors writing an honors thesis in a humanities department. In residence for an academic year, Hume fellows contribute to the collegial life of the Center and receive intellectual guidance and mentoring from staff and fellows. Directors *Ian P.

Fellows are selected based on \\"how their participation in the program will shape their future life journeys\\" as well as \\"what future Fellows will contribute to the program and the broader global community.\\" Other research centers = Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory = The Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (also known as the Stanford AI Lab, or SAIL) is the artificial intelligence (AI) research laboratory of Stanford University. The current director is Professor Chris Manning. Early years SAIL was started in 1963 by John McCarthy, after he moved from Massachusetts Institute of Technology to Stanford. Lester D. \\"Les\\" Earnest, also previously of MIT, served as executive officer (self- deprecatingly, \\"Chief Bureaucrat\\") at SAIL from 1965 to 1980. During the same years, SAIL was housed in the D.C. Power building, named not for \\"Direct Current\\" but rather for Donald Clinton Power, who held the positions of president, C.E.O. and chairman of General Telephone & Electronics Corporation (later GTE Corporation) between 1951 and 1971. GT&E; donated the unfinished building to Stanford University after abandoning plans to establish a research center there. During this period SAIL was one of the leading centers for AI research and an early ARPANET site. The Stanford arm, designed at SAIL in 1969, is the forerunner of most industrial robots in use today.Stanford Arm history, Stanford University D.C. Power was on a hill overlooking Felt Lake in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains behind Stanford. It was about 5 miles (8 km) from the main campus, at 1600 Arastradero Road, midway between Page Mill Road and Alpine Road. This area was, and remains, quite rural in nature. Combined with the rather extreme 1960s architecture of the place, this remote setting led to a certain isolation. Some people who worked there reported feeling as if they were already in the future. The building was demolished in 1986; as of 2003, the site is home to Portola Pastures (an equestrian center adjacent to the Arastradero Open Space Preserve). SAIL created the WAITS operating system on a computer called SAIL. WAITS ran on various models of Digital Equipment Corporation PDP computers, starting with the PDP-6, then the KA10 and KL10. WAITS also ran on Foonly systems at CCRMA and LLL. The SAIL system was shut down in 1991. SAIL, the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Language, was developed by Dan Swinehart and Bob Sproull of the Stanford AI Lab in 1970. Alumni of the original SAIL played a major role in many Silicon Valley firms, becoming founders of now-large firms such as Cisco Systems and Sun Microsystems as well as smaller companies such as Vicarm Inc. (acquired by Unimation), Foonly, Elxsi, Imagen, Xidex, Valid Logic Systems, and D.E. Shaw & Co. Research accomplishments at SAIL were many, including in the fields of speech recognition and robotics.The autobiography of SAIL, a copy of a 1991 email about SAIL, from a Stanford website Among notable people that had worked at SAIL before its closure included Raj Reddy, Hans Moravec, Alan Kay, Victor Scheinman, Larry Tesler, Don Knuth, and Edward Feigenbaum. Demise and rebirth In 1980, SAIL's activities were merged into the university's Computer Science Department and it moved into Margaret Jacks Hall on the main Stanford campus. SAIL was reopened in 2004, now in the Gates Computer Science Building, with Sebastian Thrun becoming its new director. SAIL's 21st century mission is to \\"change the way we understand the world\\"; its researchers contribute to fields such as bioinformatics, cognition, computational geometry, computer vision, decision theory, distributed systems, game theory, general game playing, image processing, information retrieval, knowledge systems, logic, machine learning, multi-agent systems, natural language, neural networks, planning, probabilistic inference, sensor networks, and robotics. The best-known achievement of the new SAIL is the Stanley self- driving car that won the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge. =Stanford Center for Entrepreneurial Studies= The Center for Entrepreneurial Studies (CES) at Stanford University is a multidisciplinary business oriented program targeted to both undergraduate and graduate students. It incorporates courses from Stanford University School of Engineering and Stanford Graduate School of Business. It also incorporates Stanford Mayfield Scholars Program that seeks to give select undergraduate students an opportunity to take business related coursework and to intern in high tech startups. CES was founded by Tom Byers and Charles A. Holloway. =Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics= The Knoll, home to CCRMA The Stanford University Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA), founded by John Chowning, is a multi-discipline facility where composers and researchers work together using computer-based technology both as an artistic medium and as a research tool. CCRMA's director is Chris Chafe. CCRMA's current faculty includes a mix of musicians and engineers including Julius Smith, Jonathan Berger, Max Mathews (emeritus), Ge Wang, Takako Fujioka, Tom Rossing, Jonathan Abel, Marina Bosi, David Berners, Patricia Alessandrini, Jay Kadis, and Fernando Lopez-Lezcano. Emeritus professor Max Mathews died in 2011. Widely used digital sound synthesis techniques like FM synthesis and digital waveguide synthesis were developed CCRMA and licensed to industry partners. The FM synthesis patent brought Stanford $20 million before it expired, making it (in 1994) \\"the second most lucrative licensing agreement in Stanford's history\\". Stanford CCRMA is a research center, studying areas of audio and technology including composition, computer music, physical modeling, audio signal processing, sound recording and reproduction, psychoacoustics, acoustics, music information retrieval, audio networking, and spatial sound. The center houses academic courses for Stanford students as well as seminars, small interest group meetings, summer workshops and colloquia for the broader community. Concerts of computer and experimental music are presented regularly throughout year. The Knoll Almost 100 years ago, this Spanish Gothic residence, known as the Knoll, was originally designed by Louis Christian Mullgardt, and built as a residence for the University's President. In 1946, the building became home to the Music Department, and then in 1986, CCRMA took over residency. Damaged in 1989 during the Loma Prieta earthquake, the Knoll nonetheless housed CCRMA in its damaged condition until a complete internal reconstruction between 2004‚Äì2005. The reopening of the facility was celebrated in the Spring of 2005 with the CCRMA: newStage Festival. This unique building now comprises several state-of-the-art music studios and top-notch research facilities, hosting a variety of students, artists and scientists. CCRMA is affiliated with the Center for Computer Assisted Research in the Humanities (CCARH), also located at Stanford. CCARH conducts research on constructing computer databases for music and on creating programs that allow researchers to access, analyze, print, and electronically perform the music. =Stanford Institute for Creativity and the Arts (SiCa)= The Stanford Institute for Creativity and the Arts (SiCa), established in 2006, serves as the core programmatic hub for the Stanford Arts Initiative, leading the development of new undergraduate arts programs, hosting artists in residence, awarding grants for multidisciplinary arts research and teaching, incubating collaborative performances and exhibitions with campus partners and other institutions, and providing centralized communication for arts events and programs at Stanford University. = National Performance of Dams Program= The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering maintains the National Performance of Dams Program, a national database of structural and operational data related to dam systems in the U.S. Begun in 1994, this program provides data to the dam engineering and safety community about the in-service performance of dam systems. The analysis of this data covering both successful operations and incidents, including failures, is intended to lead to improvements in design and requirements, engineering processes and standards, operational procedures and guidelines, and public policy development. =Michelle R. Clayman Institute for Gender Research= Founded in 1974, and named after economist Michelle R. Clayman, the Michelle R. Clayman Institute for Gender Research at Stanford University is one of the nation's oldest research organizations focused on the study of gender. The Clayman Institute designs basic interdisciplinary research, creates knowledge, networks people and ideas at Stanford, nationally, and internationally to effect change and promote gender equality. The Clayman Institute plays an integral role in the Stanford community by bringing together local, national and international scholars and thought leaders from across disciplines to create knowledge and effect change. The place where the Clayman Institute is located was renamed the Carolyn Lewis Attneave House in 2019. It was formerly named Serra House after Jun√≠pero Serra.  History  In 1972 faculty and graduate students in the feminist movement were the impetus behind the formation of the Institute. In 1974, the Center for Research on Women (CROW) was the first interdisciplinary center or institute of its kind and quickly built a strong reputation under the direction of Myra Strober, the founding Director. The reputation of CIGR grew outside Stanford, and the University of Chicago Press chose Stanford as the base of the second five-year rotation of its new interdisciplinary journal, Signs.Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, University of Chicago Press In 1983 the Institute was renamed the Institute for Research on Women and Gender (IRWG) and continued to expand the gender conversation with the ‚ÄúDifficult Dialogues‚Äù program, which ran in the 1990s through 2004. In 2004, the new Director, Professor Londa Schiebinger, a historian of science, formed a plan to create a series of research initiatives on gender issues, backed by a research fellowship program, that would attract scholars from Stanford and abroad. With the help of matching funds from the Hewlett Foundation and strong support from the Institute's Advisory Council, Schiebinger spearheaded a fundraising drive to create an endowment for the Institute. IRWG was renamed in honor of Michelle R. Clayman, the major donor in the campaign, who serves as the Chair of the Institute's Advisory Council.  Research  The Clayman Institute designs basic research and supports the creation of knowledge through its Fellowships and interdisciplinary programs. Recent reports/publications include: * Gendered Innovations in Science and Engineering, Londa Schiebinger, ed., 2008. * Dual-Career Academic Couples: What Universities Need to Know. The Michelle R. Clayman Institute, 2008. This Clayman Institute research study shows that over 70% of faculty are in dual- career relationships.

The Michelle R. Clayman Institute and the Anita Borg Institute, 2008. This report provides an in-depth look into the barriers to retention and advancement of technical women in Silicon Valley's high tech industry and provides practical recommendations to employers on overcoming these barriers.  Fellowships  The Clayman Institute runs two fellowship programs. The Faculty Research Fellowships seek to drive intellectual and social innovation through interdisciplinary gender studies. They include residential fellowships for tenured, tenure-track, and postdoctoral scholars from Stanford University, and U.S. and foreign universities. The Clayman Institute also offers Graduate Dissertation Fellowships for Stanford University doctoral students. Fellowships are awarded to students who are in the writing stages of their dissertations, and whose research focuses on women and/or gender.

The group is stationed at Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska. Overview The 354th Operations Group provides air-bridge support and realistic combat flying training in support of 354th Fighter Wing, Air Force and national objectives. The Group's major mission is RED FLAG-Alaska, 10-day air combat training exercise held up to four times a year. Each exercise is a multi-service, multi-platform coordinated, combat operations exercise and corresponds to the designed operational capability of participating units. In other words, exercises often involve several units whose military mission may differ significantly from that of other participating units. RED FLAG-Alaska planners take those factors into consideration when designing exercises so participants get the maximum training possible without being placed at an unfair advantage during simulated combat scenarios. Assigned units The 354 OG (Tail Code: AK) is the flying component of the 354th Fighter Wing. Its component units are: * 18th Aggressor Squadron (18 AGRS) (Block 30 F-16C Falcon) : Aircraft are painted in a grey, black and white aggressor color scheme.

A 354th FG P-51D at Ober-Olm, Germany, in April 1945. : see also: Colonel James H. Howard, Medal of Honor recipient The 354th Fighter Group was constituted on 12 November 1942 and activated on 15 November 1942. They trained on the Bell P-39 Airacobra and served as part of the Western Air Defense Force. The three operational squadrons of the group were the 353rd FS (\\"FT\\"), the 355th FS (\\"GQ\\") and the 356th FS (\\"AJ\\") Fighter Squadrons. On 4 November 1943, the group was moved to Portland AAF, Oregon and were informed that they were to fly the brand new North American P-51B Mustang. This was a big change of equipment for the Fighter Group‚Äîthe Mustang being a more capable aircraft with excellent high-altitude performance that would be required for escorting heavy bomber groups of the Eighth Air Force against Germany. The 354th FG was then transferred to RAF Greenham Common in England, but only remained at that base for a few days, next being transferred to RAF Boxted in Essex on 13 November 1943. At RAF Boxted, the 354th provided long-range escort for USAAF heavy bombers and received a Distinguished Unit Citation for its activities up to mid-May 1944, during which the 354th was instrumental in the development of the P-51 for use in long-range missions to escort heavy bombers on raids deep into enemy territory. As a result, priority for the Mustang was shifted from the Ninth to the Eighth Air Force, which eventually converted 14 of its 15 Fighter Groups to the P-51. The 354th also gained the distinction of destroying more enemy aircraft in aerial combat than any other USAAF fighter group (701 enemy aircraft). During that same period, Colonel James H. Howard won the Medal of Honor for his single-handed efforts defending a bomber formation that was attacked by a large force of enemy planes while on a mission to Oschersleben, Germany on 11 January 1944. Colonel Howard single- handedly attacked a formation of thirty German aircraft. Pressing home the attack for more than thirty minutes, he destroyed three aircraft, and even when he was low on fuel and his ammunition was exhausted, he continued his aggressive tactics to protect the bombers. In mid-April 1944, the 354th flew south to RAF Lashenden in Kent prior to moving to the continent after the invasion of Normandy. Although assigned to Ninth Air Force, the 354th was under the operational control of the Eighth Fighter Command and many missions flown by the 354th in April and May were long-range escorts of Eighth Air Force heavy B-17 and B-24 bombers. It was on these occasions that the group displayed its expertise in air fighting. On 25 April on an escort to Mannheim. The group returned to RAF Lashenden with claims of 18 destroyed, five probably destroyed and 31 damaged. all for the loss of two Mustangs. On 11 May, claims of 11 Luftwaffe aircraft destroyed on another long-range escort included the 354th's 100th victory. Yet another high score resulted from an air battle near Magdeburg on 28 May when 19¬Ω enemy aircraft were credited as shot down. An increasing number of dive-bombing missions were flown during the weeks prior to the invasion, each Mustang carrying two 250 or 500 pound bombs on wing racks, the targets being frequently rail installations. When D-Day arrived, the 354th's pilots were disappointed to be kept on the ground until 21:00 hours, when they took off to escort Douglas C-47 Skytrains towing gliders for a landing on the Cotentin Peninsula near Cherbourg. Following the invasion, the group's Mustangs found their primary tasks were patrols over the battlefield areas. These were often uneventful as far as contact with enemy aircraft was concerned. The 354th group headquarters had learned that they would probably be one of the first Ninth Air Force flying units to move to one of the advanced landing strips being prepared in the Normandy bridgehead, and the advance party left Lashenden for Criqueville, France (ALG A-2) on 13 June 1944. The main party moved on 17 June, although the group's P-51s continued to return to RAF Lashenden throughout the following week. During its stay at RAF Lashenden, the 354th FG lost 23 aircraft, but was credited with destroying 68 of the enemy. The group's operations from France assisted the Allied drive across France by flying close-support, armed-reconnaissance, fighter-sweep, dive-bombing, strafing, and escort missions. The 354th Fighter Group received a Distinguished Unit Citation for a series of fighter sweeps in which the group destroyed a large number of enemy aircraft in the air and on the ground on 25 August. The unit flew missions to support the airborne attack on the Netherlands in September, and it attacked and destroyed many enemy barges, locomotives, vehicles, buildings, and troops to assist the Allied assault on the Siegfried Line. The group participated in the Battle of the Bulge by supporting ground forces and by conducting armed reconnaissance operations to destroy enemy troops, tank artillery, and rail lines. Assisted ground forces in their advance to and across the Rhine and was based at Herzogenaurach, Germany (ALG R-29) when V-E Day arrived. By war's end, the 354th FG was officially credited by USAAF Command with the highest number of enemy aircraft destroyed in the air (701 confirmed kills) of any U.S. Fighter Group in the ETO during World War II.Air Force Fifty, p. 76By counting aircraft destroyed both in the air and on the ground, the 56th Fighter Group claimed the highest number of kills in the ETO during World War II. After hostilities ended, the 354th Fighter Group served with United States Air Forces in Europe army of occupation until February 1946, being returned to the United States and inactivated on 31 March 1946. =Cold War= : see also: Brigadier General James F.

Sent to Moody AFB in 2007 now part of 23d OG On 19 November 1956 the Air Force replaced the 342d Fighter-Day Wing at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina with the 354th Fighter-Day Wing. The 342d Fighter-Day Group's fighter squadrons (33d, 572d and 573d) were replaced by the 353d, 355th and 356th Fighter-Day Squadrons and assigned to the 354th Fighter-Day Group. In addition, the 352d Fighter-Day Squadron was activated and assigned to the Group. Upon activation the new group was assigned to the wing. The group was active for a brief period training in fighter operations. It was inactivated on 25 September 1957 and its components assigned directly the wing when the Air Force reorganized its wings into the dual deputate system. =Modern era= On 20 August 1993, the 354th Operations Group was activated as part of the 354th Fighter Wing's activation at Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska, replacing the organization and components of the 343d Wing. This change was part of a service-wide effort to preserve the lineage of the Air Force‚Äôs most honored wings. Upon activation, the 354th OG was bestowed the history, lineage and honors of the 354th Fighter Group from the 354 FW. The 353d and 355th Fighter Squadrons were also reactivated at Eielson and assigned to the 354 OG under the objective wing structure. The group trained for close air support, battlefield air interdiction, and anti-maritime operations. In 1994, the 353d was redesignated as a Combat Training Squadron. It's assigned mission was to coordinate and direct PACAF's premier training exercise, COPE THUNDER. Additionally, it was given oversight and management of the largest air training complex in the world, the Pacific Alaska Range Complex. Though the exercise has been renamed RED FLAG-Alaska, the 353 CTS mission remains unchanged. In 2003 it was reassigned to the 3d Wing at Elmendorf AFB. Under BRAC 2005 the 354th's 355th Fighter Squadron was inactivated on 24 August 2007, and its Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft sent to Moody Air Force Base, Georgia, becoming part of the 23d Fighter Group. The same day, the 18th Fighter Squadron became the 18th Aggressor Squadron and reequipped with Block 30 General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft, sending its newer Block 40s to Kunsan Air Base, South Korea and becoming part of Red Flag - Alaska.

Article VI is the part of the Treaty that provides for disarmament, including nuclear disarmament. It was adopted mainly on the initiative of the New Agenda Coalition, a group of countries favouring early nuclear disarmament, including Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia, South Africa, and Sweden. Text Article VI of the Treaty itself says: > Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good > faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race > at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and > complete disarmament under strict and effective international control. The paragraph containing the 13 steps may be found in the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference in the section 15. It says: > The Conference agrees on the following practical steps for the systematic > and progressive efforts to implement Article VI of the Treaty on the Non- > Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and paragraphs 3 and 4(c) of the 1995 > Decision on \\"Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and > Disarmament\\": > >> 1\\\\.

Born in 1898 in Poland, Goldfeder studied at the University of Prague and worked at the Masaryk University before earning her doctorate in natural sciences (D.Sc.) in 1922. She was invited to conduct research in the United States, and immigrated in 1931. During her 66-year career as a research scientist, she worked at the University of Vienna, Harvard University, Columbia University, Lenox Hill Hospital, the Rockefeller Institute, the New York City Hospitals Department and the Department of Biology at New York University Washington Square, where she was director of the Cancer and Radiobiology Research Laboratory. Goldfeder is known both for her role as a pioneering woman in advanced scientific research and for her many accomplishments as a researcher. Autumn Stanley, member of the Institute for Historical Study (Berkeley), writes \\"The contributions of this distinguished Polish-born researcher to cancer therapy in general and to radiology in particular can scarcely be overestimated.\\" Goldfeder created a strain of white lab mice, named X-GF (after her initials), that is resistant to both natural and lab-induced cancerous tumors and is widely used in experimentation. She discovered that radiation treatment could (in mice) completely destroy a malignant tumor without otherwise harming the subject; she also improved use of lead shielding, and discovered that the effects of radiation varied with the emission medium. Sol Siegelman, writing a tribute to Goldfeder in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, wrote: > \\"I should like to note briefly just a few of her contributions to provide at > least a slight indication of her originality and foresight. (1) Anna > Goldfeder was one of the first to succeed in establishing tissue culture > with human epithelial cells -- an achievement made even more monumental by > the fact that it was accomplished prior to the introduction of antibiotics. > (2) She was one of the first to identify the importance of ensuring > isogenicity of the host in attempting to obtain useful therapeutic and > biological information from tumor transplants. (3) Anna established the > therapeutic value of fractionated and localized radiation in treating tumors > and showed that cures could in fact be obtained using animal models. These > results had a significant impact on the design of protocols for clinical > radiotherapy. (4) She developed the famous XgF strain of mice, which were > highly resistant to spontaneous as well as to induced tumors. These mice > became a useful experimental tool for the analysis of questions related to > both the cure and the cause of cancer. Goldfeder was also known for her devotion to her scientific pursuits. Long past the age of mandatory retirement when Delafield Hospital in New York was closed, Goldfeder was unable to convince city officials to relocate her laboratory. Rather than close, and with some self-funding, she remained in the abandoned building for two years before she secured enough grant money to move her work to New York University facilities. She established, with a bequest, the Dr. Anna Goldfeder Scholarship award for Ph.D students at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel.

Born in Palermo, Sicily, he became a made member of the Gambino crime family in 1975 and a capodecina or captain, and head of the crime family's Sicilian faction, appointed by family boss John Gotti in 1986, according to Mafia turncoat Sammy Gravano.Rackets Trial for Gambino Brothers Opens, The New York Times, February 2, 1993Drug Dealing Was Banned By Mob, U.S. Witness Says, The New York Times, April 15, 1993 Transatlantic Mafia clan Together with his younger brothers Rosario and Joseph Gambino he formed a faction in the crime family known as the Cherry Hill Gambinos for their base of operation in the New Jersey town of that name. Although they were distant cousins of family boss Carlo Gambino, they did not owe him allegiance. They were Sicilian Mafiosi, men from Palermo, whose father had brought the family to New York in 1964. The Gambino brothers ran the Cafe Valentino on 18th Avenue in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn (later renamed as Cafe Giardino).Sterling, Octopus, p. 107 The Gambinos hailed from the Passo di Rigano neighbourhood in Palermo, just as the Inzerillo clan, headed by Salvatore Inzerillo. Together the Inzerillo-Gambino Mafia clan formed a transatlantic Mafia family, based in Palermo and New York. The Inzerillo clan had been on the verge of total extermination by Tot√≤ Riina and the Corleonesi during the Second Mafia War in Sicily when in 1981 the family boss Salvatore Inzerillo was killed. With the intervention of the Gambino crime family in New York, a deal was worked out that allowed the surviving Inzerillos to take refuge in the US, with the agreement that none of them, or their offspring, could ever return to Sicily.Changes in Mafia Leadership Reveal New Links to US-Based La Cosa Nostra, DNI Open Source Center, November 19, 2007 Many went to the New York area and joined forces with the Gambino family. They were dubbed \\"gli scappati\\" (the escapees).Top Sicilian Mafia Boss Arrested, Time Magazine, November 5, 2007 Heroin trafficking Despite a ban on drug dealing, the Gambinos were heavily involved in international heroin trafficking out of Bensonhurst.Davis, Mafia Dynasty, p. 219 John Gambino was the converging point in the United States for a consortium of heroin traffickers of the Sicilian Mafia, composed of the Inzerillo family and Stefano Bontade, and the final destination for its shipments of heroin that was refined in laboratories in Sicily from Turkish morphine base. His relative Salvatore Inzerillo was the Gambino brothers‚Äô principal interlocutor, the central personage in Sicily, with myriads interests and heavy capital investments.Sterling, Octopus, pp. 199-200 Giovanni Falcone, the investigating magistrate who was assigned the investigation into heroin trafficking case in 1980, estimated that by the late 1970s the Inzerillo-Gambino-Spatola network was smuggling US$600 million worth of heroin into the US each year.Shawcross & Young, Men Of Honour, pp. 77-78 Money laundering Gambino had close relationship with the Italian banker Michele Sindona. They dined often and openly at the luxurious Hotel Pierre on Fifth Avenue or the Gambino‚Äôs Caf√© Valentino. Gambino was a frequent guest at New York dinner parties in Sindona‚Äôs honour. When Sindona got in trouble and was indicted for the bankruptcy of the Franklin National Bank, John Gambino procured a false passport and helped to stage a bogus kidnap in August 1979, to conceal a mysterious 11-week trip to Sicily before his scheduled fraud trial.Sterling, Octopus, pp. 190-202 However, Sindona also had put the Mafia‚Äôs heroin money at risk, due to his financial malpractice. The real purpose of the kidnapping was to issue sparsely disguised blackmail notes to Sindona‚Äôs past political allies ‚Äì among them Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti ‚Äì to engineer the rescue of his banks and recuperate Cosa Nostra‚Äôs money. Gambino accompanied Sindona‚Äôs attempt to recover the money, but the plans failed and Sindona was arrested, leading to the indictment of the Inzerillo-Spatola-Gambino network. It remains unclear if any of the Mafia money Sindona had lost was recovered. Indicted in 1980 in relation with the heroin trafficking network, he was convicted and sentenced to six-and-a-half years jail sentence for heroin trafficking in Palermo (the sentence in absentia was confirmed by Italy‚Äôs Supreme Court in 1985). However, Gambino remained free because the US did not agree with Italian requests for extradition.Sterling, Octopus, pp. 304-07 John and Joe Gambino were acquitted in a 1984 New Jersey drug case in which their brother, Rosario, was convicted and sentenced to 45 years in prison.Dozens Are Seized in New U.S.-Italian Drug Sweep, The New York Times, December 2, 1988 Operation Iron Tower On December 1, 1988, Italian and US law enforcement cracked down on the Gambino-Inzerillo network again with Operation Iron Tower. Italian and federal prosecutors indicted some 200 defendants in Italy and the US on drug trafficking charges. Among the arrestees was Joe Gambino, the owner of Cafe Giardino. A crowd of about 100 had gathered at the cafe to hear a newly arrived Italian singer. Federal agents moved in as the entertainment ended with one agent coming to the mike and saying, in effect, \\"This is your last dance.\\" Some of the partygoers thought it was a joke and laughed, while a few tried to run but were caught. John Gambino was not charged ‚Äì the FBI could not gather enough evidence against him ‚Äì but was described in the court affidavit as the current leader of the \\"Brooklyn-based Sicilian faction of the Gambino family.\\" The brothers were released after initial indictments in 1988 and 1989.Monitoring Had Been Stopped On Two Mob Suspects Who Fled, The New York Times, September 4, 1992 John Gambino was arrested on January 4, 1990. He later was charged in a superseding indictment with narcotics and racketeering violations. On January 5, 1990, he was released on a US$2 million personal recognizance bond signed by his wife Vittoria Gambino and his son Tommy Gambino.United States of America v. John Gambino, United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit. - 17 F.3d 572, February 24, 1994 Due to testimonies of Mafia turncoats such as Sammy Gravano of the New York Gambino crime family and Francesco Marino Mannoia, an Italian pentito who had become a government witness, Joe and John Gambino and six other defendants ‚Äì including Francesco Inzerillo ‚Äì were indicted on charges that they smuggled and distributed drugs, operated a number of organized-crime enterprises and took part in the 1988 murder of Francesco Oliveri.

Arrest and trial On September 17, 1992, they were arrested in a secluded motel suite in Fort Lauderdale, South Florida, where they were said to have associates who would help them flee to Venezuela, where they owned an interest in a ranch. They were returned to Manhattan for trial.2 Gambinos Are Seized In Florida, The New York Times, September 22, 1992 In February 1993, the trial against John and Joe Gambino, and their associates Lorenzo Mannino and Matteo Romano, started. The prosecution portrayed them as the main distributors of heroin smuggled from Italy and South America to Miami and New York by the Sicilian Mafia, while the defense countered that the central drug and murder charges in the case were based on the uncorroborated testimony of Marino Mannoia and Gravano, whom the defense depicted as \\"killers and liars\\". The trial ended in mistrial in June 1993 when a jury was unable to reach a verdict on charges of racketeering, drug trafficking and murder. Marino Mannoia was admitted into the Witness Protection Program in the United States (Italy had no such programme at the time). He testified he had met with John Gambino personally, who had inspected the quality of the heroin Marino Mannoia was refining in Palermo. His testimony finally induced the Gambinos to plead guilty to drug trafficking in an arrangement with prosecution.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 304 Guilty plea In June 1994, after prosecutors recommended 15-year sentences without parole, the men agreed to plead guilty to the racketeering charges stemming from activity that took place from 1975 to 1992.3 Mob Figures Draw 15-Year Terms in Drug Case, The New York Times, June 15, 19942 Admit Importing Heroin For Mafia Crime Family, The New York Times, January 7, 1994 The pentito Gaspare Mutolo revealed that he organised a 400-kilogram shipment of heroin to the US in 1981. The Cuntrera-Caruana Mafia clan received half of the load, while John Gambino took possession of the other 200 kilograms. The shipments were financed by a consortium of Sicilian Mafia clans, who had organized a pool to provide the money to buy the merchandise from Thai suppliers.The Rothschilds of the Mafia on Aruba, by Tom Blickman, Transnational Organized Crime, Vol. 3, No. 2, Summer 1997.

In September 2006, he was freed when a federal judge overruled a decision that would have extradited him to Italy to face drug charges. The judge ruled that Gambino had already served a 15-year sentence in the US for drug trafficking and murder and could not be tried again for the same charges in Italy.Reputed mobster freed from prison, The Boston Globe, September 12, 2006 According to court papers filed in Brooklyn Federal Court, John Gambino was one of a three-man panel that ran the Gambino family, jointly with Daniel Marino and Bartolomeo \\"Bobby\\" Vernace after Operation Old Bridge in February 2008 decapitated the leadership.

The notably large shell of Melo melo has a bulbous or nearly oval outline, with a smooth outer surface presenting distinguishable growth lines. The outside of shell colour is commonly pale orange, sometimes presenting irregular banding of brown spots, while the interior is glossy cream, becoming light yellow near its margin. The columella has three or four long and easily distinguishable columellar folds. It has a wide aperture, nearly as long as the shell itself, yet this species is known to have no operculum. The shell's spire is completely enclosed by the body whorl, which is inflated and quite large, and has a rounded shoulder with no spines. The apex is of smooth type. Pearls This volute is known to produce pearls; however the Melo melo pearl has no nacre, unlike the pearl of a pearl oyster.

Both countries have established diplomatic relations on May 3, 1968. Barbados is represented in France through its embassy in Brussels (Belgium). France is represented in Barbados through its embassy in Castries (Saint Lucia), led by and an additional honorary consulate in Bridgetown.  Bilateral relations  The bilateral relations and trade between the two nations remain modest. In 2006, France exported to Barbados mainly: electrical equipment, wood, paper, and cardboard products. Barbados also has trade with France's territories in the Caribbean, such as Guadeloupe and Martinique. The Government of France supports 22 programmes in Barbados and ties including trade between Barbados and the French Departments in the Americas has been steadily increasing.Barbados and France bilateral relations Attention in Barbados is currently being paid towards the creation of the \\"CARIFORUM French Caribbean Task Force\\" which will guide the way forward on regularised cooperation with the overseas areas of France. In 2006 the former Prime Minister Owen Arthur had announced that Barbados would begin to settle its maritime boundaries with France due to Martinique's overlapping maritime boundary with Barbados.Barbados and France Discuss Delimitation of their Maritime Boundaries - 7 June 2006 Preliminary discussions have started and are on-going to settle the maritime boundary between France and Barbados. In 2007 the Dominican Republic and Caribbean Community bloc known as CARIFORUM began final negotiates for an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between the Caribbean and European Union regions. During the negotiations an intense debate developed between Barbadian and French authorities over a provision that would allow certain classes of Caribbean nationals to be granted free movement within the European Union in exchange for the removal of tariffs on European products such as automobiles and mobile phones to the Caribbean. The Barbadian Prime Minister Owen Arthur said the disagreement threatened to derail talks and stating to the media: > \\"The Caribbean could clearly not enter any new trade arrangement with > anybody and accept a limitation on market access to our cultural workers, > our artistes and our entertainers when we give people access to our markets. > [ . . . ] \\"The heads have made a very clear decision that we could not > conclude the agreement with Europe at all unless there is a removal on the > restriction\\". Talks proceeded shortly after and the agreement was agreed upon between the two regions on 16 December 2007. As a followup of the Economic Partnership Agreement, in May 2009 the European Union (Schengen Area) signed a visa waiver agreement with Barbados and five other nations around the world allowing the citizens of the nations involved to travel visa free for up to three months to each other's territories. The visa-waiver agreement covers both Barbados and France however not the French territories. The Barbados Government indicated though that negotiations would be on-going to reach an agreement with France to allow for visa-free travel to the French Territories and Outer Departments (French: d√©partements d'outre-mer and territoires d'outre-mer) in future. The Barbadian private sector organisation known as the Private Sector Trade Team (PSTT) has taken an increasingly active interest in encouraging Barbadians businesses to expand their trade with the territories of France under the same EPA agreement.Barbadian companies to get help exploiting EPA, 26 March 2009, Caribbean360 News French citizens in Barbados held the second Bastille Day celebration in 2009. The celebration at Brandon's Beach, Saint Michael was sponsored by the French Honorary Consulate in Barbados, as well as the Mount Gay Rum company. During the event it was outlined that Alliance Fran√ßaise de Bridgetown was actively pursuing several initiatives with the Barbadian Ministry of Education concerning French culture. In 2009 the Barbados Tourism Authority began placing large emphasis on developing air-links between the French West Indies and Barbados through the sponsorship of charter flights. In September 2009 the French Frigate \\"The Vent√¥se\\", commanded by Captain Pascal Le Barbier docked in Bridgetown, Barbados following a joint anti-drug campaign by both nations. During the visit the Ambassador of France in Trinidad & Tobago and Barbados, Mr. Michel Trinquier visited with French nationals living in Barbados. In June 2010 French officials from Martinique's Regional Council and Chamber of Commerce visited Barbados for a three-day dialogue on formal cultural exchanges and joint-collaboration between industries in the both countries. In July 2011 the French Mayor Jose Toribio of Lamentin, Guadeloupe, toured over a dozen primary schools in Barbados. He met with the Barbadian Minister of Education, Ronald Jones where both counterparts discussed several avenues of cooperation between Barbados and France including a student and teacher exchanges and cooperation in furthering an English-French immersion between Barbados and the French Departments.

The game was announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo on June 2009. The game was later re-released on the Xbox Live Marketplace on December 6, 2011. Plot Tornado Outbreak follows a group of Wind Warriors, that is led by Captain Nimbus. The Wind Warriors are a noble group of Air Elementals given the task of providing an atmosphere on lifeless planets. Players take control of a blue spiraling Wind Warrior named Zephyr, who has been selected by Nimbus to take over the reins of the squad of Wind Warriors. The Wind Warriors along with Zephyr and Nimbus uncover the anti-matter being known as Omegaton, whose six orbs of power were taken away from him by his enemies; flaming little creatures known as the Fire Flyers. In return for helping him regain his orbs of power, Omegaton provides the Wind Warriors with a Light Weight Object Amalgam Device (shorten as L.O.A.D. STARR) to protect them from the sun's deadly radiation. Near the end of the game, it's revealed that Omegaton was from a backwards dimension; a hero in space is a villain on Earth. The game ends with Zephyr, Nimbus, and the Wind Warriors defeating Omegaton, and returning to their homeworld, Harmonia. Gameplay The player destroying several buildings to collect the fire elementals known as Fire Flyers. Tornado Outbreak's gameplay is in line with that of Katamari Damacy, in that (as Zephyr), players are required to suck ordinary Earth objects into their funnel to grow in size. An added level of complexity is present in Tornado Outbreak, in that players must stay in the shade at all times (shade is created by an object called the L.O.A.D. STARR), as Wind Warriors will die under direct sunlight. Each level is split into five stages. The first three stages are Zephyr pillaging the landscape in search of hiding Fire Flyers (with the location of Fire Flyers being designated by an orange glow under objects). After collecting fifty Fire Flyers in each of these three stages, a totem appears from underground, surrounding a large object on the outskirts of the playing field (a skyscraper, mountain, hotel complex, etc. depending on the geographical location ‚Äì Vegas, Britain, a theme park, and so on). The fourth stage of each level is a race of sorts, which sees Zephyr flying through vortex rings surrounding the totems. This creates a massive storm above the landscape, complete with moving clouds and patches of sunlight. In the fifth stage, players must navigate these moving clouds to reach the Totems so that they can be destroyed in a button-mashing mini-game, thus revealing one of Omegaton's orbs and unlocking the next level.  Reception  The game got moderate to good reviews. GameSpot gave it 6.5 out of 10, Game Informer game it 6.75 out of 10, and IGN gave it 8.1 out of 10.

His contributions to mathematics include his contributions to Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem in number theory, Mazur's torsion theorem in arithmetic geometry, the Mazur swindle in geometric topology, and the Mazur manifold in differential topology. Life Born in New York City, Mazur attended the Bronx High School of Science and MIT, although he did not graduate from the latter on account of failing a then-present ROTC requirement. Regardless, he was accepted for graduate studies at Princeton University, from where he received his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1959 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled \\"On embeddings of spheres.\\" He then became a Junior Fellow at Harvard University from 1961 to 1964. He is the Gerhard Gade University Professor and a Senior Fellow at Harvard. He is the brother of Joseph Mazur. Work His early work was in geometric topology. In an elementary fashion, he proved the generalized Schoenflies conjecture (his complete proof required an additional result by Marston Morse), around the same time as Morton Brown. Both Brown and Mazur received the Veblen Prize for this achievement. He also discovered the Mazur manifold and the Mazur swindle. His observations in the 1960s on analogies between primes and knots were taken up by others in the 1990s giving rise to the field of arithmetic topology. Coming under the influence of Alexander Grothendieck's approach to algebraic geometry, he moved into areas of diophantine geometry. Mazur's torsion theorem, which gives a complete list of the possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over the rational numbers, is a deep and important result in the arithmetic of elliptic curves. Mazur's first proof of this theorem depended upon a complete analysis of the rational points on certain modular curves. This proof was carried in his seminal paper \\"Modular curves and the Eisenstein ideal\\". The ideas of this paper and Mazur's notion of Galois deformations, were among the key ingredients in Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Mazur and Wiles had earlier worked together on the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory. In an expository paper, Number Theory as Gadfly, Mazur describes number theory as a field which He expanded his thoughts in the 2003 book Imagining Numbers and Circles Disturbed, a collection of essays on mathematics and narrative that he edited with writer Apostolos Doxiadis. Awards and honors In 1982 he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and in 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2013-02-04. Mazur has received the Veblen Prize in geometry, the Cole Prize in number theory, the Chauvenet Prize for exposition, and the Steele Prize for seminal contribution to research from the American Mathematical Society. In early 2013, he was presented with one of the 2011 National Medals of Science by President Barack Obama.

(1965) \\"Pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,\\" in Slow Latent and Temperate Virus Infections, National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness (NINDB) monograph No.2, pp. 23-37. The eponym ‚ÄòHirano bodies‚Äô was not introduced until 1968, by Schochet et al., three years after Hirano first observed the proteins. Hirano bodies are found in the nerve cells of individuals afflicted with certain neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease. Hirano bodies were first described in the CA1 in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and parkinsonism-dementia complex (ALS-PDC). Hirano bodies (Hb) are found mostly in the neuronal processes in the pyramidal layer in the Sommer‚Äôs sector (CA1) of the hippocampus, mostly arising from age related changes in the microfilament system. Hirano bodies are often described as rod-shaped, crystal-like, and eosinophilic (pink after staining with haematoxylin and eosin). They are frequently seen in hippocampal pyramidal cells. An experimental model of Hirano body formation has been reported, using a genetically altered strain of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum.Maselli, A. G., Davis, R., Furukawa, R. and Fechheimer, M. (2002).\\"Formation of Hirano bodies in Dictyostelium and mammalian cells induces by expression of a modified form of an actin-crosslinking protein,\\" J.Cell Sci. 115, 1939-1952. Hirano bodies have been noted as a function of age without obvious underlying neurodegeneration.  Alzheimer's Disease  The Sommer‚Äôs sector (CA1) of the hippocampus has been described to be influential in the formation of new memories, as well as, containing inclusion bodies that contribute to a hallmark of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD), intellectual deficit. Alzheimer‚Äôs neurofibrillary tangles show a preference to form in the CA1, which is one of the major areas in which Hb‚Äôs have been observed. There are a larger number of Hb‚Äôs found in people with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease than those without the disease. Additionally many processes of Alzheimer‚Äôs neurofibrillary tangles have been observed to contain Hirano bodies. Hirano bodies are described as cytoplasmic paracrystalline lattices, which are a main form of a pathological feature seen in a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD). There is an upregulation of a macroautophagic pathway related to AD that can be related to an actin aggregate thought to be an intermediate in the formation of Hirano bodies. More specifically the actin and actin binding proteins seen in Hirano bodies are a significant feature of an Alzheimer‚Äôs disease brain. Additionally, variations in the locational characteristics of Œ≤-amyloid precursor proteins seen in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease are connected to Hirano bodies. It was observed that Hirano bodies are a specific site of a C-terminal fragment of Œ≤-amyloid precursor proteins. Notes References * Gajdusek, D. Carleton, Clarence J. Gibbs, Jr. and Michael Alpers.

There are two types of incorporated municipalities in Maine, towns and cities. The tables in the New England Historical U.S. Census Totals series differentiate between towns and cities; however, there have never been any cities in Piscataquis County. Most areas of New England are entirely divided into incorporated municipalities, with no unincorporated territory. In the three northern New England states, however, some unincorporated territory does exist, generally in areas that are very sparsely populated. Maine contains significantly more unincorporated territory than the other states, with the bulk of it in interior and northern counties, including Piscataquis County. Some unincorporated territory in Maine is organized into a third type of town-level municipality unique to Maine, called a plantation (considered to be ‚Äúorganized‚Äù, but not incorporated), while some is entirely unorganized. Due to the large extent of unorganized territory in Piscataquis County, separate sections with detailed historical census totals for such areas follows the main tables below. For any census, adding up the totals for each town-level municipality, including any plantations or unorganized entities, should yield the county total.

This consisted of 52 residents in organized plantations, and 843 residents in unorganized territory: Plantations As of 1900, Piscataquis County contained five plantations: Barnard, Bowerbank, Elliotsville, Lake View and Kingsbury. Four had been incorporated as towns in the 19th century, but had disincorporated and changed to a plantation form of government prior to 1900. The only one of the five that had never been a town is Lake View. Only two plantations remain today, Lake View and Kingsbury. Bowerbank re-incorporated as a town in 1907. The other two surrendered their organization and reverted to unorganized territory in the early 1980s: Barnard (1982) and Elliotsville (1983). Four other plantations have also existed at some point since 1900: *The isolated community of Chesuncook, to the northeast of Moosehead Lake, was organized as a plantation for a short time, from 1921 to 1933. The 1930 Census was the only census in which it was reported as a plantation. *After its disincorporation, the former town of Medford operated as a plantation for about three years, from 1942 to 1945. It then surrendered its organization and reverted to unorganized territory. (It would later re-incorporate as a town in the 1960s.) *After the town of Blanchard disincorporated in 1951, it adopted a plantation form of government. It remained a plantation until 1984, when it surrendered its organization and reverted to unorganized territory. *Beaver Cover Plantation was formed from previously unorganized territory in 1975. It incorporated as a town in 1978. 1900 *Lake View 173 *Kingsbury 106 *Barnard 98 *Elliottsville 86 *Bowerbank 66 1910 *Lake View 245 *Elliottsville 120 *Kingsbury 108 *Barnard 101 1920 *Lake View 368 *Barnard 155 *Elliottsville 73 *Kingsbury 63 1930 *Elliottsville 77 *Chesuncook 70 *Barnard 61 *Lake View 57 *Kingsbury 50 1940 *Elliottsville 100 *Barnard 74 *Lake View 70 *Kingsbury 63 1950 *Barnard 66 *Elliottsville 39 *Kingsbury 35 *Lake View 23 1960 *Blanchard 57 *Barnard 32 *Elliottsville 23 *Lake View 18 *Kingsbury 8 1970 *Blanchard 56 *Elliottsville 26 *Barnard 24 *Lake View 16 *Kingsbury 7 1980 *Blanchard 64 *Barnard 48 *Elliottsville 26 *Lake View 20 *Kingsbury 4 1990 *Lake View 23 *Kingsbury 13 2000 *Lake View 43 *Kingsbury 9 Unorganized Territory Like all of Maine's interior counties, Piscataquis County contains a significant amount of unorganized territory. Most of it is in the northern and central parts of the county, in areas which are very sparsely populated. Historically, only about the southern third of the county (roughly, south of Moosehead Lake) has been incorporated or organized. The northern edge of the organized part of the county followed Shirley, Greenville, Elliotsville, and a line running along the northern edge of Bowerbank, Barnard, Williamsburg, Brownville and Lake View. All territory south of that line was historically organized, with all but Lake View once incorporated as towns (Note that Barnard, Elliotsville and Kingsbury were all towns at one time but had changed to plantations prior to 1900). North of that line, the entire county has historically been unorganized, with only a few minor exceptions. From 1921 to 1933 the isolated community of Chesuncook, to the northeast of Moosehead Lake, was organized as a plantation. Beaver Cover Plantation was established in 1975 from previously unorganized territory at the southeast corner of Moosehead Lake, adjacent to Greenville (‚ÄúGore A‚Äù, also known as TA2R13 & TA2R14). Beaver Cover later incorporated as a town. Most of the northern two-thirds of the county is quite remote and has never had any significant population on more than a transitory basis. The distinction between a ‚Äútownship‚Äù and a ‚Äúgore-like entity‚Äù, etc. in Piscataquis County is not always clear, as there are some surveyed townships labeled as ‚Äúgrants‚Äù. There are at least seventy townships in the county which have never been organized, however, along with some additional gore-like entities. Some islands in Moosehead Lake are not part of any larger unorganized entity, but constitute their own. Between 1935 and 1945, a large number of municipalities in Maine dissolved and reverted to unorganized townships. In Piscataquis County, this included three communities which had historically been towns (Williamsburg, Medford and Orneville). Since that time, Piscataquis County has both gained and lost municipalities. In 1951, the town of Blanchard disincorporated; Blanchard subsequently maintained a plantation form of government until the 1980s, when it was one of three plantations in the county that dissolved and reverted to unorganized territory (the others were Barnard and Elliotsville). On the other hand, the former town of Medford re-incorporated as a town in 1967, and the new municipality of Beaver Cove was later created from previously unorganized territory. The areas of Piscataquis County that are entirely unorganized cover about , with a population of about 850 people. This covers about three-quarters of the county‚Äôs land area, but includes only about 5% of its population. Two unorganized townships have a large enough population to maintain a registrar and clerk to conduct elections for state and federal offices, although they do not have true organized municipal governments. One is the former town of Orneville. The other is the unnamed township designated as T1R9 (this township is not close to the populated areas of the county, but is along the border with Penobscot County, not far from Millinocket). Two similar entities have also been formed by groups of multiple unorganized townships banding together: ‚ÄúGreenville Townships‚Äù, and the ‚ÄúUnorganized Townships of Big Moose, Harford‚Äôs Point, Lily Bay, Little Moose Township, TAR10/12‚Äù. Over the years, the U.S. Census Bureau has used different methods to compile data for unorganized territory in Maine. From 1900 to 1950, data was tabulated for each individual unorganized entity. In 1960, a single catch-all ‚ÄúUnorganized Territory‚Äù listing was provided for each Maine county, generally with no further breakdown. Since 1970, the Census has grouped contiguous areas in each county into one or more ‚Äúunorganized territories‚Äù. As of the 2000 Census, four such areas are recognized within Piscataquis County: *Northwest Piscataquis Unorganized Territory: the western portion of the historically unorganized northern and central parts of the county. This covers all of the unorganized territory around Moosehead Lake that is within Piscataquis County, including an area at the southwest corner of the lake, west of Greenville, that has no land connection to the rest of the Territory. The eastern boundary of this Territory, bordering Northeast Piscataquis Unorganized Territory, is an irregular line that appears to follow roads and watercourses in most places, not township boundaries. *Northeast Piscataquis Unorganized Territory: the eastern portion of the historically unorganized northern and central parts of the county. At its southern end, it includes the territory of the former towns of Elliotsville, Barnard and Williamsburg. The western boundary of this Territory, bordering Northwest Piscataquis Unorganized Territory, is an irregular line that appears to follow roads and watercourses in most places, not township boundaries. *Southeast Piscataquis Unorganized Territory: the former town of Orneville, in the southeast corner of the county. (It is unclear why this territory is called ‚ÄúSoutheast Piscataquis Unorganized Territory‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúOrneville Unorganized Territory‚Äù. A possible explanation may be that the Territory was originally intended to include Medford, which had re-incorporated as a town by the time the 1970 Census was taken.) *Blanchard Unorganized Territory: the former town (later plantation) of Blanchard, which is its own Unorganized Territory because it does not border any other land that is both unorganized and within Piscataquis County. When the Unorganized Territories were first created for the 1970 Census, there were just two in Piscataquis County: North Piscataquis and Southeast Piscataquis. Southeast Piscataquis was the same as it is currently (Orneville Township). North Piscataquis was all other unorganized territory in the county, (including the present-day town of Beaver Cove, which was unorganized at the time). For the 1980 Census, North Somerset was broken up into Northeast Somerset and Northwest Somerset. Blanchard Unorganized Territory was added for the 1990 Census, after Blanchard Plantation surrendered its organization and reverted to unorganized territory. The listings below provide population figures for 1) all unincorporated territory, including plantations; 2) organized plantations, for which breakouts are available in the main tables above; and 3) unorganized territory, with any available breakouts provided. 1900 All unincorporated territory 1,066 Organized plantations 529 Unorganized territory 537 *Big Squaw (T2R6) & Little Squaw (T3R5) Twps. 131 *Kathadin Iron Works Twp.

No breakdown is available. 1970 All unincorporated territory 526 Organized plantations 129 Unorganized territory 397 Starting with the 1970 Census, the unorganized territory in Piscataquis County was broken into groups of contiguous territory. Two such entities were recognized in 1970. *North Piscataquis Unorganized Territory 241 *Southeast Piscataquis Unorganized Territory 156 1980 All unincorporated territory 576 Organized plantations 162 Unorganized territory 414 For the 1980 Census, the former North Piscataquis Unorganized Territory was broken into two entities, for a total of three recognized within the county. *Southeast Piscataquis Unorganized Territory 183 *Northeast Piscataquis Unorganized Territory 132 *Northwest Piscataquis Unorganized Territory 99 1990 All unincorporated territory 720 Organized plantations 36 Unorganized territory 684 A fourth Unorganized Territory was added for 1990, reflecting the dissolution of the former Blanchard Plantation (Blanchard got its own listing because it does not border any other unorganized territory within Piscataquis County). *Southeast Piscataquis Unorganized Territory 247 *Northeast Piscataquis Unorganized Territory 218 *Northwest Piscataquis Unorganized Territory 141 *Blanchard Unorganized Territory 78 2000 All unincorporated territory 895 Organized plantations 52 Unorganized territory 843 *Northeast Piscataquis Unorganized Territory 347 *Southeast Piscataquis Unorganized Territory 254 *Northwest Piscataquis Unorganized Territory 159 *Blanchard Unorganized Territory 83 Note: the unorganized townships in Piscataquis County are on three different grids: *WELS (west of the Easterly Line of the State): as its name suggests, the baseline for this grid is the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick in Aroostook County. In places, it has up to 20 numbered rows, arranged from north to south. The upper rows exist only in Aroostook County, however, so that only rows 1 through 10 enter the modern borders of Somerset County. A row ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù also exist in some areas to the south of row 1; the boundary between this grid and the one to the south of it (NWP) is irregular. The townships on this grid in Piscataquis County are generally in ranges 9 through 15, although Moosehead Lake cuts off range 15 in some of the rows, and rows A and B do not exists in all ranges. The area of Piscataquis County covered by the WELS system is for the most part very remote and very sparsely populated. Most of the townships are identified only by their row and range numbers and have never developed informal township names. *NWP (North of Waldo Patent): covers the area to the immediate south of the WELS grid, to the southeast of Moosehead Lake. Much of the organized portion of Piscataquis County was originally on this grid, but the last few ranges at the northern end have remained mostly unorganized. Ranges are numbered south to north, rows east to west. The northernmost range is generally range 9, although there is a range 10 in some places, as the boundary between this grid and the one to the north of it (WELS) is irregular. All of the never-organized townships on this grid in Piscataquis County are in those two ranges. The never-organized townships on this grid in Piscataquis County are in rows 4 through 8. (Lower-numbered rows are further east, in Penobscot County). *BKP EKR (Bingham‚Äôs Kennebec Purchase, East of the Kennebec River): covers a small portion of Piscataquis County that lies southwest of Moosehead Lake. The rows of townships on this grid are numbered west to east, with the baseline at the Kennebec River; most of the grid is in Somerset County. The only two unorganized townships in Piscataquis County numbered on this grid are Big Squaw Twp. (T2R6) and Moosehead Junction Twp. (T3R5). Because the Kennebec River does not run at all due north-south in this area, row numbering is somewhat irregular, accounting for why T2R6 is directly north of T3R5. Some of the current or former municipalities to the immediate south of those two townships were originally on this grid (e.g., Blanchard, Shirley, Kingsbury, Wellington). In 1999, the Maine state legislature officially changed the name of Big Squaw Township (T2R6) to Big Moose Township, and Little Squaw Township (T3R5) to Moosehead Junction Township. In 2003, the legislature officially named T5R9 NWP, which had not previously had a generally used name, as Ebemee Township. Notes Unorganized Islands The censuses from 1900 through 1950 contain listings for islands in Moosehead Lake which were unorganized, but treated as distinct from any larger unorganized entity. These listings are as follows: *1900: Deer Island and adjoining islands (pop. 9) and Moose Island (pop. 1). *1910: Deer Island (pop. 11) and Sugar Island (pop. 3). A footnote describes these areas as ‚Äúnot within the limits of an organized town or plantation‚Äù. *1920: Deer Island (pop. 8) and Sugar Island (pop. 2). A footnote again describes these areas as ‚Äúnot within the limits of an organized town or plantation‚Äù. *1930: Deer Island (pop. 9) and Sugar Island (pop. 9). *1940: ‚ÄúIslands not belonging to any town‚Äù (pop. 7). The specific islands are not identified, but totals provided for the 1920 and 1930 censuses match the figures above for Deer and Sugar islands. *1950: ‚ÄúIslands not belonging to any town‚Äù (pop. 2). In the 1960 Census, these islands were presumably included under the catch-all listing for unorganized territory; since 1970, they have presumably fallen under North Piscataquis Unorganized Territory and its successors. 1900 Census In the 1900 Census, Big Squaw (T2R6) and Little Squaw (T3R5) Townships were combined in a single listing, as ‚ÄúSquaw Mountain Township‚Äù. 1940 Census The 1940 Census reported Medford as an unorganized township. Even though Medford did not permanently dissolve its municipal government until 1945, this was not in error. While Medford adopted a plantation form of government following its disincorporation as a town, there was apparently a lag between the time it disincorporated as a town and the time it became a plantation. The 1940 Census fell within this interim period when Medford was technically, if only briefly, an unorganized township.

The case with A an elliptic curve E and K the rational number field Q is Mordell's theorem, answering a question apparently posed by Henri Poincar√© around 1901; it was proved by Louis Mordell in 1922. It is a foundational theorem of Diophantine geometry and the arithmetic of abelian varieties. History The tangent- chord process (one form of addition theorem on a cubic curve) had been known as far back as the seventeenth century. The process of infinite descent of Fermat was well known, but Mordell succeeded in establishing the finiteness of the quotient group E(Q)/2E(Q) which forms a major step in the proof. Certainly the finiteness of this group is a necessary condition for E(Q) to be finitely- generated; and it shows that the rank is finite. This turns out to be the essential difficulty. It can be proved by direct analysis of the doubling of a point on E. Some years later Andr√© Weil took up the subject, producing the generalisation to Jacobians of higher genus curves over arbitrary number fields in his doctoral dissertation published in 1928. More abstract methods were required, to carry out a proof with the same basic structure. The second half of the proof needs some type of height function, in terms of which to bound the 'size' of points of A(K). Some measure of the co-ordinates will do; heights are logarithmic, so that (roughly speaking) it is a question of how many digits are required to write down a set of homogeneous coordinates. For an abelian variety, there is no a priori preferred representation, though, as a projective variety. Both halves of the proof have been improved significantly, by subsequent technical advances: in Galois cohomology as applied to descent, and in the study of the best height functions (which are quadratic forms). Further results The theorem left unanswered a number of questions: *Calculation of the rank. This is still a demanding computational problem, and does not always have effective solutions. *Meaning of the rank: see Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. *Possible torsion subgroups: Barry Mazur proved in 1978 that the Mordell-Weil group can have only finitely many torsion subgroups. This is the elliptic curve case of the torsion conjecture. *For a curve C in its Jacobian variety as A, can the intersection of C with A(K) be infinite? Because of Faltings's theorem, this is false unless C = A. *In the same context, can C contain infinitely many torsion points of A? Because of the Manin‚ÄìMumford conjecture, proved by Michel Raynaud, this is false unless it is the elliptic curve case.

The space of symmetric tensors of order r on a finite-dimensional vector space V is naturally isomorphic to the dual of the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree r on V. Over fields of characteristic zero, the graded vector space of all symmetric tensors can be naturally identified with the symmetric algebra on V. A related concept is that of the antisymmetric tensor or alternating form. Symmetric tensors occur widely in engineering, physics and mathematics. Definition Let V be a vector space and :T\\\\in V^{\\\\otimes k} a tensor of order k. Then T is a symmetric tensor if :\\\\tau_\\\\sigma T = T\\\\, for the braiding maps associated to every permutation œÉ on the symbols {1,2,...,k} (or equivalently for every transposition on these symbols). Given a basis {ei} of V, any symmetric tensor T of rank k can be written as :T = \\\\sum_{i_1,\\\\ldots,i_k=1}^N T_{i_1i_2\\\\cdots i_k} e^{i_1} \\\\otimes e^{i_2}\\\\otimes\\\\cdots \\\\otimes e^{i_k} for some unique list of coefficients T_{i_1i_2\\\\cdots i_k} (the components of the tensor in the basis) that are symmetric on the indices. That is to say :T_{i_{\\\\sigma 1}i_{\\\\sigma 2}\\\\cdots i_{\\\\sigma k}} = T_{i_1i_2\\\\cdots i_k} for every permutation œÉ. The space of all symmetric tensors of order k defined on V is often denoted by Sk(V) or Symk(V). It is itself a vector space, and if V has dimension N then the dimension of Symk(V) is the binomial coefficient :\\\\dim\\\\operatorname{Sym}^k(V) = {N + k - 1 \\\\choose k}. We then construct Sym(V) as the direct sum of Symk(V) for k = 0,1,2,... :\\\\operatorname{Sym}(V)= \\\\bigoplus_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\operatorname{Sym}^k(V). Examples There are many examples of symmetric tensors. Some include, the metric tensor, g_{\\\\mu u}, the Einstein tensor, G_{\\\\mu u} and the Ricci tensor, R_{\\\\mu u}. Many material properties and fields used in physics and engineering can be represented as symmetric tensor fields; for example: stress, strain, and anisotropic conductivity. Also, in diffusion MRI one often uses symmetric tensors to describe diffusion in the brain or other parts of the body. Ellipsoids are examples of algebraic varieties; and so, for general rank, symmetric tensors, in the guise of homogeneous polynomials, are used to define projective varieties, and are often studied as such. Symmetric part of a tensor Suppose V is a vector space over a field of characteristic 0. If is a tensor of order k, then the symmetric part of T is the symmetric tensor defined by :\\\\operatorname{Sym}\\\\, T = \\\\frac{1}{k!}\\\\sum_{\\\\sigma\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{S}_k} \\\\tau_\\\\sigma T, the summation extending over the symmetric group on k symbols. In terms of a basis, and employing the Einstein summation convention, if :T = T_{i_1i_2\\\\cdots i_k}e^{i_1}\\\\otimes e^{i_2}\\\\otimes\\\\cdots \\\\otimes e^{i_k}, then :\\\\operatorname{Sym}\\\\, T = \\\\frac{1}{k!}\\\\sum_{\\\\sigma\\\\in \\\\mathfrak{S}_k} T_{i_{\\\\sigma 1}i_{\\\\sigma 2}\\\\cdots i_{\\\\sigma k}} e^{i_1}\\\\otimes e^{i_2}\\\\otimes\\\\cdots \\\\otimes e^{i_k}. The components of the tensor appearing on the right are often denoted by :T_{(i_1i_2\\\\cdots i_k)} = \\\\frac{1}{k!}\\\\sum_{\\\\sigma\\\\in \\\\mathfrak{S}_k} T_{i_{\\\\sigma 1}i_{\\\\sigma 2}\\\\cdots i_{\\\\sigma k}} with parentheses () around the indices being symmetrized. Square brackets [] are used to indicate anti-symmetrization. Symmetric product If T is a simple tensor, given as a pure tensor product :T=v_1\\\\otimes v_2\\\\otimes\\\\cdots \\\\otimes v_r then the symmetric part of T is the symmetric product of the factors: :v_1\\\\odot v_2\\\\odot\\\\cdots\\\\odot v_r := \\\\frac{1}{r!}\\\\sum_{\\\\sigma\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{S}_r} v_{\\\\sigma 1}\\\\otimes v_{\\\\sigma 2}\\\\otimes\\\\cdots\\\\otimes v_{\\\\sigma r}. In general we can turn Sym(V) into an algebra by defining the commutative and associative product ‚äô. Given two tensors and , we use the symmetrization operator to define: :T_1\\\\odot T_2 = \\\\operatorname{Sym}(T_1\\\\otimes T_2)\\\\quad\\\\left(\\\\in\\\\operatorname{Sym}^{k_1+k_2}(V)\\\\right). It can be verified (as is done by Kostrikin and Manin) that the resulting product is in fact commutative and associative. In some cases the operator is omitted: . In some cases an exponential notation is used: :v^{\\\\odot k} = \\\\underbrace{v \\\\odot v \\\\odot \\\\cdots \\\\odot v}_{k\\\\text{ times}}=\\\\underbrace{v \\\\otimes v \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes v}_{k\\\\text{ times}}=v^{\\\\otimes k}. Where v is a vector. Again, in some cases the ‚äô is left out: :v^k=\\\\underbrace{v\\\\,v\\\\,\\\\cdots\\\\,v}_{k\\\\text{ times}}=\\\\underbrace{v\\\\odot v\\\\odot\\\\cdots\\\\odot v}_{k\\\\text{ times}}. Decomposition In analogy with the theory of symmetric matrices, a (real) symmetric tensor of order 2 can be \\"diagonalized\\". More precisely, for any tensor T ‚àà Sym2(V), there are an integer r, non-zero unit vectors v1,...,vr ‚àà V and weights Œª1,...,Œªr such that :T = \\\\sum_{i=1}^r \\\\lambda_i \\\\, v_i\\\\otimes v_i. The minimum number r for which such a decomposition is possible is the (symmetric) rank of T. The vectors appearing in this minimal expression are the principal axes of the tensor, and generally have an important physical meaning. For example, the principal axes of the inertia tensor define the Poinsot's ellipsoid representing the moment of inertia. Also see Sylvester's law of inertia. For symmetric tensors of arbitrary order k, decompositions :T = \\\\sum_{i=1}^r \\\\lambda_i \\\\, v_i^{\\\\otimes k} are also possible. The minimum number r for which such a decomposition is possible is the symmetric rank of T. This minimal decomposition is called a Waring decomposition; it is a symmetric form of the tensor rank decomposition. For second-order tensors this corresponds to the rank of the matrix representing the tensor in any basis, and it is well known that the maximum rank is equal to the dimension of the underlying vector space. However, for higher orders this need not hold: the rank can be higher than the number of dimensions in the underlying vector space. Moreover, the rank and symmetric rank of a symmetric tensor may differ.

History In 1815, Louis- Auguste Petitma√Ætre created the first private bank in Neuch√¢tel at the age of 18, while the city had only around 4,000 inhabitants. The company initially specialised in metal trading before becoming a real banking institution in the years which followed. Louis-Auguste Petitma√Ætre‚Äôs bank was taken over by his son Louis-√âdouard in 1872, who was previously elected as deputy at the beginning of the 1860s. In 1895, the latter partnered with Paul Bonh√¥te, leading to the creation of the Antenen Bonh√¥te & Cie Bank, which became the Bonh√¥te & Cie Bank in 1903. In 1936, Claude Bonh√¥te took over from his father, maintaining control of the bank‚Äôs management until 1988. In 1987, he sold the business to the financial holding company Prigest SA. In 1992, Jean Berthoud and a group of partners repurchased the bank. Jean Berthoud took over the managing of the institution and reintegrated a member of the Bonh√¥te family to the board of directors. Jean Berthoud came himself from a family which was active in the sector of wealth management in France from the end of the 18th century, with his relative Jonas Berthoud having launched the Berthoud & Son Bank in 1785, which later became the Neuflize OBC bank, which was nationalised from 1981 to 1988. In 1999, the newspaper Le Temps wrote that ‚ÄúBonh√¥te was the latest of twelve investment banks which put Neuch√¢tel on the map in the 1920s‚Äù. From 2004, Bonh√¥te started to expand, with the opening of several branches in Switzerland. A first one opened in Bienne in 2004, followed by Geneva (2009), Bern (2011), Lausanne (2016), Solothurn and Z√ºrich (2020). In 2014, Yves de Montmollin took over managing the bank. Jean Berthoud, majority shareholder of the institution, at this time took up the post of president of the board of directors. Jean Berthoud has also sat on the board of directors for the Swiss Bankers Association since 2010.  Operations  The operations of the Bonh√¥te Group cover a range of services in the wealth and asset management sectors. In wealth management, the Bank‚Äôs clients are made up of 85% Swiss residents. The banking services are provided by Bonh√¥te & Cie SA Bank. These include expertise in asset management through a range of UCITS- type investment funds: equity funds, bond funds, hedge funds and property investment funds. The Bonh√¥te Bank‚Äôs asset management branch remains mainly known for having launched the Bonh√¥te-Property fund in 2006, who later took over the funds from Dynamic Real Estate Fund (DREF) making it one of the most significant property funds in the Romandy area. The advisory services, meanwhile, are provided by three specialist subsidiaries, each enjoying a level of autonomy in its operations: * Bonh√¥te Services SA: a subsidiary specialising in legal and financial advice (Swiss and international) for individuals and legal entities. *BT Swiss Trustee SA: a subsidiary specialising in the administration of trusts. *Private Client Partners: a division dedicated to huge wealth and based in Z√ºrich. Governance In 2017, the Bonh√¥te Bank was made up of around 100 collaborators, of which 4-5 employees were posted in each of its Swiss Romandie branches. The board of directors has most notably counted among its members the former radical MP Yann Richter and the former Swiss National Bank president Jean Zwahlen at the end of the 1990s, as well as the administrator of the Swiss BNP Paribas and the Union Bancaire Priv√©e around the same time.

Botrydial was first isolated and described in 1974.Lindner, H.J.; von Groose, B. Chem. Ber. 1974, 107, 3332-3336 Botrytis Cinerea is the causal agent of gray mold disease and is known to attack a wide range of plants (over 200 species) producing leaf-spot diseases and mildews on lettuces and tomatoes as well as rotting berries.Collado, I.G.; Hernandez-Galan, R.; Duran-Patron, R.; Cantoral, J.M. Phytochemistry. 1995, 38, 647-650 For this reason, botrydial, as well as other Botrytis Cinerea originated sesquiterpene metabolites, represent an economically important disease for ornamental and agriculturally important crops.(a) Williamson, B.; Tudzynski, B.; Tudzynski, P.; van Kan, J. A. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2007, 8, 561‚Äì580. (b) Choquer, M.; Fournier, E.; Kunz, C.; Levis, C.; Pradier, J. M.; Simon, A.; Viaud, M. FEMS Microbiol.

G.; Hernandez-Galan, R. J. Chem. Ecol. 2002, 28, 997-1005  Biosynthesis  Botrydial originates from the BcBOT2 (Botrytiscinerea BOTrydial biosynthesis) mediated cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to key intermediate tricyclic alcohol presilphiperfolan-8Œ≤-ol. Pinedo et al. demonstrated that BcBOT2 is in fact a sesquiterpene synthase by incubation of FPP with recombinant BcBOT2 protein, which yielded the expected presilphiperfolan-8-ol as the major product. Image:GeneralBiosynBotrydial.png 4 other genes are then involved in the biosynthesis of botrydial: 3 genes that encode for a P450 monooxygenase (BcBOT3, BcBOT1, BcBOT4) and a BcBOT5 gene whose amino acid sequence showed high homology to known acetyl transferases. Figure 1. Five open reading frames of the botrydial biosynthetic gene cluster This brought Pinedo et al. to the conclusion that BcBOT5 is probably responsible for introducing the acetyl group on C-4. They also concluded from quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis that the five consecutive genes are co-regulated by the same BCG1-calcineurim transduction pathway.Pinedo, C.; Wang, C. M.; Pradier, J. M.; Dalmais, B.; Choquer, M.; Le Pecheur, P.; Morgant, G.; Collado, I. G.; Cane, D. E.; Viaud, M. ACS Chem. Biol. 2008, 3, 791-801.  Mechanism of enzymatic formation of presilphiperfolan-8Œ≤-ol  Recently in an ASAP article in The Journal of the American Chemistry Society, Cane et al. confirmed experimentally, using deuterium labeling and NMR spectroscopy, the mechanism by which FPP cyclizes into presilphiperfolan-8Œ≤-ol. The mechanism consist of elimination of the diphosphate group followed by carbocation mediated cyclizations and rearrangements.Wang, C.; Hopson, R.; Lin, X.; Cane, D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, ASAP, 750px After the formation of presilphiperfolan-8Œ≤-ol, BcBOT5 gives way to acetylation of C-4 position, then hydroxylation of the probotryane skeleton occurs in a two-step process followed by oxidative cleavage of the new formed diol to yield botrydial.Duran-Patron, R.; Colmenares, A.J.; Hernandez-Galan, R.; Collado, I.G. Tetrahedron. 2001, 57, 1929-1933 750px  Mechanism of action  Botrydial is produced by Botrytis Cinerea when the host plant is infected. As a result, botrydial induces chlorosis and cell collapse.Deighton, N.; Muckenschnabel, I.; Colmenares, A. J., Collado, I. G.; Williamson, B. Phytochemistry 2001 57, 689-692 Additionally, aggressive strains of the fungus secrets polyketides such as botcinic acid that exhibit phytotoxic and antifungal activity.

Its public gardens are located at Philosophenweg 39, Oldenburg, Lower Saxony, Germany, and open daily without charge. The garden was established in 1882 as a teaching garden, enhanced in 1913, and in 1916 augmented by a systematic garden (still existing) of 1200 plant species from Oldenburg and East Frisia. Four geographic divisions were created in 1932 for Boreal, Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Pontic species, with an additional area for species from the Central Mountains. Starting in 1933 the garden was administered by Oldenburg, and in 1951 it was taken up by Lower Saxony and extended to its current size. Its heath, marsh, dunes, and forest areas were redesigned in 1966, as well as the medicinal plant garden in 1967, and in 1968 a Department of Central and Southern German plant communities was created. In 1976 the garden was incorporated into the University of Oldenburg, and in 1984 today's nonpublic K√ºpkersweg site added. Through the 1990s, the alpine garden, Mediterranean collection, and medicinal garden were reorganized, and a new cactus house built. A new cottage garden was added in 2000, with heath, marsh, and dune areas again reworked in 2001. Today the garden is a scientific institution for teaching and research at the university.

It is about a photographer named George G. Keane, his grandchildren, Jason and Margaret, and how they affected the lives of different people, such as a Russian prisoner and an Irish teen. Plot George G. Keane, or \\"Gee\\", was a photographer who travelled around the world taking pictures. In Gee's will he leaves his granddaughter, Margaret, a box containing seven lettered boxes and a message stating \\"throw them all back\\". Each lettered box contains a shell. She discovers that each letter on each box represents the continent that the shell came from, and that her grandfather intended for her to put them back where they came from over her lifetime. This is a gift that will last Maggie's whole life. Meanwhile, Jason, Margaret's brother, is left with a camera and uses it to construct multiple photo albums, one of which consisted of a girl doing ordinary things throughout the day while holding a large piece of glass. The last chapter of the book depicts an elderly Margaret living in the future with her great-niece, watching a documentary about her grandfather, her brother, and herself.

The campaign is a partnership between 28 road safety stakeholders from across Europe, claiming that a formal safe road infrastructure initiative could reduce the number of killed and seriously injured by 50,000 per year in less than a decade, saving 0.5% of GDP - ‚Ç¨50 billion, saving at least 300 deaths and serious injuries per day. The European campaign builds on the UK Campaign for Safe Road Design which has worked to influence the UK government since 2008. Case for the campaign The Campaign argues that 2,000,000 people have been killed or seriously injured on Europe's roads in the last decade, costing ‚Ç¨160billion per year, or 2% of GDP. They state that road deaths are the leading cause of death amongst healthy young adults. Two-thirds of road deaths occur on national or regional roads outside major towns. The EC has started its 10-year road safety review, and the campaign suggests that systematic Safe Road Infrastructure Initiatives could cut casualties by one third in a decade, a reduction of 50,000 annually. This would equate to a saving of 0.5% of GDP or ‚Ç¨50 billion, saving 300 deaths and serious injuries every day. The campaign argues that all it takes for the achievement of its objectives is a modest investment in simple safety engineering, particularly in the area of safe road and junction layouts as well as equipment like safety barriers. The idea is that the European roads must be \\"self-explaining\\" and forgiving so that they address or do not exacerbate routine human driving errors. These road infrastructure safety measures can reduce serious crashes by more than half. Examples of unsafe road design and resulting consequences According to Joanne Hill, head of the UK‚Äôs Campaign for Safe Road Design, the way risks are managed in most European roads is a century out of date and that the situation calls for actions that are more than just treating black spots and focus on systematically eliminating high risks. The European Road Assessment Programme (EuroRAP) has published a map of busy, high-risk road networks in 15 EU countries based on crash rates. The following are examples of unsafe road designs: =Unsafe outercurves= Old roads, designed before entering the automobile speed era, often have improperly banked outercurves (for physical analysis, see banked turn). This causes instability to cornering vehicles. While almost all outercurves have insufficient banking, some few outercurves have too much banking. In slippery condition, such as in rain or on ice, such over-banked curves cause most problem to vehicles driven at too slow speed. Then the driver may need to turn the steering wheel to the opposite direction, compared to the road curvature. Both new and old roads often have insufficient drainage gradient at the entrance and exit of sharp outercurves, causing water pooling in rain and forming local surprising ice spots in cold climate. A large study in Sweden (see the linked \\"Analysis of single vehicle accidents with fatal outcome\\" below) showed that fatal single crashes are 5 times more common in outercurves, than in innercurves. This extreme overrisk is considered strongly related to improper banking and insufficient drainage gradient at outercurves. Both Drainage gradient and curve banking can be monitored by measurement with a modern Profilograph. The linked EU Roadex III report below gives demonstrations as on how to analyze Profilograph data to identify excessive accident risk in outercurves. =Ramp-shaped crash barriers= Crash barriers are very efficient at increasing road safety. However, many barriers starts off with a ramp-shaped end. As a car slightly out of control hits such a ramp, the car become airborne and all tendency to recover control is lost. Often the car rotates and hit a hard object with its roof. Since the roof is the cars weakest section, such crashes often end fatally. In many cases the car flips totally. If it lands in water, the doors may be blocked, stopping the driver and passengers from getting out before the car is filled with water. A surprisingly high number of car drivers have drowned during their rides. Partners The campaign is a partnership between 28 motoring clubs and road safety organisations from across Europe including: * Lead partner EuroRAP * Austria - OEAMTC * Belgium - TCB * Croatia - HAK * Czech Republic - UAMK * Denmark - FDM - FDM * Finland - Autoliitto Autolitto * France - FFAC * German - ADAC * Hungary - KTI and MAK * Iceland - FIB * Ireland - AA Ireland * Italy - ACI * Macedonia - AMSM * Montengero - AMSCG * Netherlands - ANWB * Norway - NAF * Poland - PZM and FRIL * Serbia - AMSS * Slovakia - SATC * Slovenia - AMZS * Spain - RACC and RACE * Sweden - Motormannen Riksforbund * Switzerland - TCS * UK - Road Safety Foundation See also * EuroRAP * Road safety in Europe References * Analysis of single vehicle accidents with fatal outcome (In Swedish) * Health and Safety Issues, the EU Roadex III project on health and safety issues raised by poorly maintained road networks.

Everyone Orchestra creates completely different music every time it appears through conducted improvisational musical exploration and audience participation. Everyone Orchestra is led and conducted by musician, multi-instrumentalist and activist Matt Butler. Butler conceived the project in 2001 after traveling the country extensively in the 1990s as the drummer and percussionist for the touring band Jambay. Everyone Orchestra has appeared at top-level summer music festivals as well as individual shows and benefit performances around the country. Shows sometimes include live painters and performance artists alongside the musicians. Performances by Everyone Orchestra have featured members of The Grateful Dead, Phish, moe., The String Cheese Incident, The Flecktones, ALO, Tea Leaf Green, Living Colour and Dave Mathews Band among others. Through benefit events for charitable causes, Everyone Orchestra has raised more than $100,000 in contributions for non-profit and environmental organizations around the nation. Beginnings Matt Butler got the idea for what has become Everyone Orchestra while traveling in India. While in the country on vacation, he attended a multi-national open-mic night, and was exposed to a large number of different musicians, most of whom didn't speak the same language, playing together and communicating purely through music and improvisation. Upon returning home to the San Francisco bay area, Butler began hosting open-mic nights aimed at achieving the same kind of purely musical communication. Inviting various musicians to come down to take part in large-scale improvisational evenings, Butler refined the process of conducted improvisation, eventually taking the concept beyond open-mic night jam sessions, booking the first official Everyone Orchestra concert for New Year's Eve in 2001. Butler was also inspired by musical visionaries and projects that previously incorporated conducted improvisation such as Zambiland Orchestra conducted by Ricky Keller, Butch Morris's Conduction, John Zorn's Cobra and others. The music There is usually little formal rehearsal for an appearance of Everyone Orchestra. The music is mainly improvised, with the various members of the band (as well we the audience) taking cues from a conductor. In addition to using hand signals and vocal cues, the conductor makes use of white boards to guide what would be a cacophonous mass- improvisation into a coherent musical journey. The musicians performing will very often be appearing on stage together for the first time, so by taking cues from the conductor as well as their fellow musicians, Everyone Orchestra strives to create something new and different each time they perform. The audience is as much a part of an Everyone Orchestra performance as the musicians on stage. Urged by cues from the conductor, the audience will be asked to sing, make sound effects, become louder or softer, and becomes a large part of the performance.

He appears in the books Seven Ancient Wonders, The Six Sacred Stones, The Five Greatest Warriors, The Four Legendary Kingdoms, The Three Secret Cities and The Two Lost Mountains.  Biography  Jack West Junior's father was a cold and ruthless American, Colonel Jack West Senior (\\"Wolf\\"), and his mother Mabel Merriweather, an Australian high school History Teacher. He had an older sister but she was killed in a plane accident a few years before the events of Seven Ancient Wonders. West Junior was encouraged to join the US Army by his father, but instead joined the Australian Armed Forces. There he proved to be an extremely efficient soldier and attained the rank of Captain, was fast tracked to the Special Air Service Regiment, set a new record on a desert survival course and became a more formidable soldier than his father. His desire to learn archaeology led to the Australian Army allowing him to attend university at Trinity College in Dublin, under the guidance of Professor Maximilian T. Epper, with whom he formed a close friendship. He was also sent to a series of multi-national special forces exercises at Coronado in 1990, hosted by the US at their Navy SEALs base. These exercises were hosted by Jack's future enemy, Marshall Judah. Jack was injured in a helicopter accident at Coronado and lay unconscious in a hospital for four days. (The four missing days of Jack West Junior's life.) When he woke up, he was sent back to Australia with no serious damage done. Jack made his name at Operation Desert Storm, being one of the first troops to land in Iraq in 1991, blowing up communication towers, completing dangerous missions behind enemy lines. and serving under his future foe, Marshall Judah, who had personally requested him. At a Scud base in Basra, he was left for dead by Judah but escaped through 300 enemy soldiers. He then returned to Australia and handed in his resignation to his commanding officer, Lt. General Peter Cosgrove and began working with his friend Professor Epper aka Wizard, on the Dark sun project. Family =Lily= Lily \\"Eowyn\\" West is Jack's adopted daughter. She was born to the wife of the former Oracle of Siwa, who was kidnapped and taken to a chamber in the heart of a Ugandan volcano. Her captors, led by the priest Del Piero took the mother's first-born child, Lily's older twin brother Alexander, and left her mother for dead. Jack and Max Epper were able to perform a caesarian on the dead mother using Jack's Leatherman knife, and rescued Lily, though Jack lost his arm triggering a release lock behind a curtain of lava during their escape. Lily is described as being of Egyptian descent, and, like her twin brother, is an Oracle of Siwa. This grants her the ability from the age of 10 to read the Word of Thoth. She is also highly competent with other languages. =Wolf= Jonathan 'Jack' 'Wolf' West Sr is Jack's father and has attempted to kill Jack several times. He is an American and referred to by J.J. Wickham as \\"one motherfucker of a father in-law\\". He has another son with the callsign of \\"Rapier\\". He is killed by his own greed at the end of The Five Greatest Warriors (by a similar fate to Jack's previous ordeal at the Second Vertex) after the Sixth Pillar was laid, trying to get its reward, power. =Mabel Merriweather= Mabel Merriweather is Jack's mother (first named in The Four Legendary Kingdoms), who lives in Australia. Prior to FLK, she was only seen by Jack once every several years due to the facts of Wolf's violent relationship with her and Wolf's affair. She divorced Wolf and humiliated him even further by divorcing him in an Australian court. =Lauren= Jack's sister Lauren is deceased after being killed in a plane crash. She was two years older than Jack. =J.J. Wickham= J.J. 'Sea Ranger' Wickham is Jack's brother in-law and oldest friend. He married Jack's sister, Lauren West. An expert submariner, he stole a Russian Kilo-class submarine & is now a rogue submariner living on the island of Zanzibar. He helps Jack in his mission and has a mutual hatred of Jack West Snr, referring to him as one \\"arsehole of a father in law.\\" =Zoe Kissane= Sergeant Zoe \\"Bloody Mary\\" \\"Princess\\" Kissane is Jack's good friend and, at the end of The Five Greatest Warriors, the two are married in a civil service. =Rapier= Rapier is Jack's half- brother. Determined that their father respects West over him, he constantly makes threats to kill West for the respect he desires. Colleagues/friends =Wizard= Maximillian \\"Wizard\\" Epper was a Canadian born professor who taught at Trinity College in Dublin, teaching Jack West, Jack's future wife Zoe Kissane & two Scottish students (his personal favourites) Lachlan & Julian Adamson \\"The Cowboys\\". He first met Jack when he joined the class he was teaching and they went on from there. In 1996, Wizard was involved in saving Lily. Wizard and Lily have always hit it off, so naturally Lily was one of the most hurt when Wizard died tragically, killed by Jack's father, Wolf, in Five Greatest Warriors at Genghis Khan's arsenal and tomb. =Pooh Bear= Sergeant Zahir \\"Saladin\\" \\"Pooh Bear\\" al Anzar al Abbas of the United Arab Emirates is the second son of Sheik Anzar al Abbas. Pooh Bear is a slightly chubby fellow, known for his explosive experiments & wit. He is one of Lily West's closest friends. During a fight with him and Stretch vs Scimitar and Vulture, he lost an eye. =Stretch= Lieutenant Benjamin \\"Archer\\" \\"Stretch\\" Cohen of Israel was once with the famed Israeli sniper force, the Sayeret Matkal. He joined the ruthless Israeli Mossad in 2003 & was ordered to infiltrate Jack West's team. Known for his expertise with snipers, he is first at odds with the Muslim Pooh Bear (himself being a Jew) but his defiance of his orders from the Mossad & his assistance in saving Lily's life caused the two to realize they had a common goal in keeping Lily safe and work together. He was captured and turned over to the Mossad where he was rescued by Pooh Bear, West, and Zoe. During the aforementioned fight between him/Pooh Bear and Vulture/Scimitar, he was stabbed in the back by Vulture but survived. =Sky Monster= \\"Sky Monster\\" hails from New Zealand, after being trained in the RNZAF. According to Reilly, his full name is known only to his mother and father, both of which live in Dunedin, New Zealand, and after the events of The Five Greatest Warriors, look after Lily's twin brother, Alexander. His name is later revealed to be Ernest Q. Shepherd II in The Two Lost Mountains. He is West's pilot during the novels, taking him and his team to various locations over the course of their adventures. He has performed upgrades to the 747 given by West. His 747 plane, the Halicarnassus, was destroyed at the end of The Five Greatest Warriors, and he now owns a smaller, faster plane‚Äîa Russian-made Tupolev Tu-144. He christened it the \\"Sky Warrior\\". Bionic arm Jack's original arm was burnt off when he thrust his arm into a waterfall of lava to grab an off lever in order to escape with Max \\"Wizard\\" Epper and Lily. Wizard, as he promised, built Jack a new and 'better' arm, using a superstrong titanium alloy, and adding a hidden compartment containing a wad of C2 explosive. Jack has made use of these benefits many times during the books, such as using the fist to block a slab of stone from crushing him (The Six Sacred Stones), and hanging on to a ceiling rung for several hours (Seven Ancient Wonders). It is detachable, as seen in Jack's escape from the Ethiopian mine in Six Sacred Stones.

It is located in the Victorian Village district of Memphis. It has been identified as one of numerous contributing properties in the historic district. History Around 1852, the mansion was built in the Italianate style as an early Victorian villa. From 1852 until 1969, the mansion was home to the families of Isaac Kirtland, Benjamin Babb, James C. Neely, Daniel Grant, and Barton Lee Mallory.Historical marker - Historical marker on the property erected by the Tennessee Historical Commission In the 1880s and 1890s, the house was extensively renovated. During the renovation, the original two and one half stories of the building were extended to three full stories and the tower of the building was enlarged. After the renovation, the house consisted of 25 rooms. The Neely family decorated the mansion in the Victorian style, with parquet flooring, ornamental plasterwork, and ceiling stenciling. In 1969, the last resident of the mansion, Daisy Neely-Mallory, died at age 98. According to her wish, the house was deeded to the Daughters, Sons, and Children of the American Revolution. Museum In 1972, the Victorian Village district of Memphis was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In 1973 the mansion was adapted for use as a house museum, featuring furnishings of the Victorian era. The museum is operated by the City of Memphis and Museums Inc. since 1987 and is part of the Pink Palace Family of Museums. In 2005, the Mallory‚ÄìNeely House was closed to the public due to the need for expensive renovations and funding problems of the City of Memphis. the house is open to the public.

In the 9th and 10th centuries, the kings of Wessex became the rulers of Cornwall, and after a period of independence during the wars with the Danes, this rule by the kings of England became permanent (see History of Cornwall). The charters below relate either to the tin mines of Cornwall and Devon or to the Earldom or Duchy of Cornwall. The stannary charters are dated between 1201 and 1508, the others between 1231 and 1338. In 1337, the earldom of Cornwall was made into a royal duchy to support the heir to the throne. Centralisation in the reign of Henry VIII meant that Cornwall's distinct status was no longer recognised in royal documents; though unlike the situation for Wales, no legislation was enacted to formalise this. The rights of the Duke of Cornwall still rely on medieval legislation. When no one is duke of Cornwall, the lands and rights of the Duchy are exercised by the Crown since the heir apparent may not always inherit the Duchy.

Vice Premier Wang Qishan and State Councilor Dai Bingguo who are special representatives of Chinese President Hu Jintao and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner who are special representative of US President Barack Obama co- chaired the SED and delivered speeches respectively. US Vice President Joe Biden also addressed the SED. Officials from more than 20 Chinese government agencies also participated in the dialogue, including the Foreign Ministry, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Commerce and the People's Bank of China. =Important Addresses= Vice Premier Wang Qishan said in his speech that History and reality both have shown and future will ultimately prove that no difficulty can ever stop the trend of cooperation between China and the US, in which we are full of confidence. Such confidence comes from the wide common interest between the two countries, from the common aspiration of the Chinese and the US people and from historic and philosophic thoughts. The two sides should take the opportunity of this round of SED to carefully implement the important consensus reached between the two heads of state, comprehensively deepen cooperation in the fields of trade and economy, investment, finance and infrastructure and boost the strong, sustained and balanced growth of their own economy and the world economy at large. State Councilor Dai Bingguo said that China and the US launched the \\"ping pong diplomacy\\" 40 years ago and Dr. Henry Kissinger paid a secret visit to China. The aspiration of friendship between the Chinese and the US people and the determination and courage of politicians of the two countries converged into an irresistible historical trend and opened the door of China-US relations which had been closed for more than 20 years. Since then, there has been no force in the world capable of closing that door again. China-US relations stand at an equally critical historic moment at present. President Hu and President Obama, when meeting in Washington in January this year, agreed to establish and develop the cooperative partnership based on mutual respect and mutual benefit, pointing out the direction for the future development of bilateral ties. History is proving and will continue to prove that this critical decision with historical significance complies with the trend of history and will benefit the Chinese and the US people and the entire mankind. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the third round of SED aims at strengthening the bilateral understanding and trust, in particular understanding each other's strategic purpose and common interest, avoiding misunderstanding and wrong judgment. The way the US and China jointly address regional and international challenges will determine the future of US-China relations as well as prosperity and peace in the world. The two countries should join hands to push forward their cooperative partnership. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said that the world economy was suffering from the heavy impact of financial crisis when the SED was initiated two years ago. With the concerted efforts of the US and China, the world has successfully stepped out of the crisis and resumed growth. But the US and China still face challenges. The US needs to consolidate the foundation of future economic growth, improve education, encourage innovation, increase investment and conduct financial reform. China needs to build a new growth mode, expand domestic demand and improve its market economy and financial system. The reforms of the US and China do not have any conflict but can help each other. The cooperation between the US and China is critical to the health and stability of the global economy and the two countries should cope with challenges together. =Highlights= U.S.-China Comprehensive Framework for Promoting Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth and Economic Cooperation A framework of comprehensive economic cooperation (the Framework) was elaborated in the third round of S&ED.; The United States and China affirm that both countries will, based on common interest, promote more extensive economic cooperation, from a strategic, long-term, and overarching perspective, to work together to build a comprehensive and mutually beneficial economic partnership, add to prosperity and welfare in the two countries, and achieve strong, sustainable, and balanced growth of the world economy. =Outline of the Framework= I.

Promoting Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ In order to promote a more balanced trade relationship, China will continue to take steps to expand domestic consumption and imports in accordance with the 12th Five-Year Plan; and the United States will increase domestic savings and exports, including through the National Export Initiative. China takes promotion of employment as the priority objective for economic development, and strives to achieve full employment. China strives to raise the proportion of residents‚Äô income in gross national income, increase the proportion of wages in the primary income distribution, and realize the increase of people's income in line with economic development and the increase of workers‚Äô pay in line with gains in labor productivity. China's minimum wage has steadily increased in recent years and will continue to do so in the future. China will raise the ratio of services value-added to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by four percentage points over the next five years, with measures to develop the services sector including expanding areas open to foreign involvement, encouraging and guiding a variety of categories of capital into the services sector, and actively developing services enterprises with diversified forms of ownership. The U.S. economy is rebalancing toward sustainable growth, emphasizing higher domestic savings, a commitment to improving long-term fiscal sustainability and productivity-enhancing investments. The personal savings rate was 5.8 percent in 2010, which is the highest rate since 1993 and well above the 2.7 percent average between 2000 and 2007. Thus, much of the transition on the private side to higher saving has already taken place. To increase public saving, the President's Budget freezes discretionary spending for five years, freezes government salaries for two years, and brings the deficit to three percent of GDP by the second half of this decade ‚Äì a path consistent with the Administration's commitments to cut the deficit in half by 2013, and to stabilize or reduce the national debt as a share of the economy. To lay the foundation for future growth, including through greater U.S. exports, the United States will increase and improve investment in innovation, infrastructure, and education. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ The two countries reiterate their support for the G-20 Framework for Strong, Sustainable, and Balanced Growth, and reaffirm their commitments to improve the living standards of our citizens through strong economic and jobs growth, and use the full range of policies required to strengthen the global recovery and to reduce excessive external imbalances and maintain current account imbalances at sustainable levels. The two sides support a bigger role for the G-20 in international economic and financial affairs, and pledge to strengthen communication and coordination to follow through on the commitments of the G-20 summits and push for positive outcomes at the Cannes summit in November. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ II. Strengthening Financial Systems and Improving Financial Supervision The two countries reaffirmed their commitment to deepen bilateral and multilateral cooperation on financial sector investment and regulation, in order to enhance global regulation, establish stronger international coordination to prevent future crises, and ensure a level playing field. Recognizing the positive contributions that financial institutions from each country can play, the two sides pledged to support open environments for investment in financial services and cross-border portfolio investment, consistent with prudential and national security requirements. The United States and China commit to further promote and strengthen financial sector reform. Following the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, the United States is implementing comprehensive financial reform that better serves households, workers, entrepreneurs, and businesses by reducing systemic risk, raising prudential standards, establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for derivatives, ending the problem of ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù financial institutions, creating a Federal Insurance Office, and ensuring robust consumer financial protection. China will continue to deepen the reform of its financial system, which has supported the process of transforming its economic development model, developing a financial system that consists of diverse institutions, provides efficient service, controls risks, and encourages financial innovation. China will increase the use of direct financing channels, including stocks, bonds and private equity, to better satisfy the diverse demands in its economy for investment capital and financing. In accordance with the medium- and long-term development perspectives, China will push forward the market-based reform of interest rates. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ The United States and China committed to further strengthen their respective financial systems against money laundering, counterfeiting, terrorism financing, and WMD proliferation financing activities. China will continue to develop and strengthen its regulatory framework for freezing terrorist assets. The two countries will continue to enhance both policy and operational cooperation on combating illicit finance. The two countries will also continue to work collaboratively in the freezing, seizing, and forfeiture of criminal proceeds. Both countries seek to rely on bilateral mutual legal assistance to implement forfeiture orders, and seek to avoid unilateral enforcement action of forfeiture orders to the extent possible. III. Enhancing Trade and Investment Cooperation The two countries, recognizing the importance of open trade and investment in fostering economic growth, job creation, innovation, and prosperity, re-affirmed their commitment to take further steps to liberalize global trade and investment, and to oppose all forms of trade and investment protectionism. The two sides reaffirmed their commitment to work proactively to resolve bilateral trade and investment disputes in a constructive, cooperative, and mutually beneficial manner. China will take stock of the results of the Special Campaign against IPR Infringement and Fake and Shoddy Products (Special Campaign), and improve on the high-level, long- term mechanism of IPR protection and enforcement, building on the Special Campaign currently in place. China will strengthen the government inspection mechanism so as to make sure that the software being used by the government agencies at all levels is legitimate. China and the United States will strengthen cooperation in the JCCT IPR Working Group on software legalization. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ China and the United States reaffirm their prior SED outcomes on transparency. The United States welcomes China's statement that it will issue a measure in 2011, to implement the requirement to publish all proposed trade- and economic-related administrative regulations and departmental rules on the SCLAO website for a public comment period of not less than 30 days from the date of publication, except as specified in China's Protocol of Accession to the WTO or in public emergency situations. China will steadily increase its solicitation of public opinions on regulatory documents with a direct influence on the rights and obligations of citizens, legal persons, or other organizations. China welcomes the United States‚Äô commitment to implement measures in 2011, to enhance regulatory transparency, including by taking steps to ensure the online publication of the text of proposed regulations, as well as supporting technical and scientific information, at www.Regulations.gov for a public comment period of 60 days, and the United States‚Äô decision to strengthen the Office of Management and Budget's participation in the ongoing Transparency Dialogue. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ The United States and China agree on the importance of fostering an open, transparent and predictable investment climate. The United States and China affirm that the enforcement policies of their national competition agencies are not to discriminate on the basis of nationality. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ The Civil Aviation Authorities of the United States and China will strengthen communication and cooperation in the field of aircraft airworthiness certification, through currently established channels, in order to promote reciprocal acceptance of civil transport category airplanes.

Most divisions returned one County Councillor under the first past the post system which is used for most local government elections in England and Wales. However, some divisions especially those that were based upon towns too small for two divisions but too large for one returned two Councillors using the block vote variant of FPTP used for some English and Welsh local elections.

Those who were temporarily away from their ordinary address (for example, away working, on holiday, in student accommodation or in hospital) were also entitled to vote in the local elections, although those who had moved abroad and registered as overseas electors cannot vote in the local elections. It is possible to register to vote at more than one address (such as a university student who had a term-time address and lives at home during holidays) at the discretion of the local Electoral Register Office, but it remains an offence to vote more than once in the same local government election.

The electoral divisions were the same as those used at the previous election in 2005. Elections in Portsmouth and Southampton do not coincide with this set, being unitary authorities outside the area covered by the County Council. All locally registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) who were aged 18 or over on Thursday 2 May 2013 were entitled to vote in the local elections. Those who were temporarily away from their ordinary address (for example, away working, on holiday, in student accommodation or in hospital) were also entitled to vote in the local elections, although those who had moved abroad and registered as overseas electors cannot vote in the local elections. It is possible to register to vote at more than one address (such as a university student who had a term- time address and lives at home during holidays) at the discretion of the local Electoral Register Office, but it remains an offence to vote more than once in the same local government election. Summary The election saw the Conservatives retain control of the council and increase their majority from 14 seats to 24 seats. As the largest opposition party, the Liberal Democrats lost seats overall, while Labour were reduced to holding just one seat (Basingstoke North). The Community Campaign in Hart also won a seat in Church Crookham and Ewshot.

The loss of the battleship Bismarck and near torpedoing of her sistership Tirpitz in May 1941 and March 1942, respectively, spurred the Kriegsmarine to acquire aircraft carriers. Europa was one of several vessels selected for conversion into auxiliary aircraft carriers. As designed, the ship would have had an air complement of 24 Bf 109T fighters and 18 Ju 87C Stuka dive-bombers. Conversion planning began in May 1942, and had the conversion been finished, she would have been the largest German aircraft carrier, longer even than the purpose-built s. The work was canceled in November 1942, however, after design problems, including serious instability and structural weaknesses, proved to be irreconcilable. No work was done on the ship, which was eventually seized by the US Army and used as a troop transport following the end of the war. Background and proposal The ship in her original guise as Europa The carrier I was a conversion proposal for the transport ship Europa. The ship was launched on 16 August 1928 and entered service on 19 March 1930 for the German Norddeutscher Lloyd shipping company. Starting in 1939, the ship was used as a floating barracks; the ship was requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine for use in the planned Operation Sea Lion, but the operation was abandoned when the Luftwaffe failed to achieve air superiority in the Battle of Britain.Gr√∂ner, p. 74 Following the loss of the battleship Bismarck in May 1941 and the near torpedoing of her sistership Tirpitz in March 1942, the Kriegsmarine was convinced of the need to acquire aircraft carriers. Several vessels were selected for conversion, including the incomplete heavy cruiser Seydlitz and several passenger liners.Garzke & Dulin, p. 296 Planning for the conversion of Europa into an auxiliary aircraft carrier was started in May 1942. The ship would have been faster and larger than any of the other ships Germany intended to convert into auxiliary carriers. However, a number of design problems emerged as the drawing up of the conversion plan progressed. Her speed and capacity advantages were offset by several serious practical problems. These included structural weakness, caused by the need to recess the hangar deck into the primary structural deck; instability, normally resolved by adding bulges; and high fuel consumption. Another significant obstacle was the unwillingness of Hermann G√∂ring, the commander in chief of the Luftwaffe, to provide the Kriegsmarine with sufficient aircraft and pilots.Miller, p. 33 By the time the design was completed in November 1942, these problems had proved impossible to rectify, and so the project was abandoned. As a result, no construction work began.Worth, p. 44 After the end of the war, Europa was seized by the US Army and commissioned as a troop transport under the name AP 177 before being transferred to France, where she resumed her commercial duties. Design =General characteristics and machinery= I was long at the waterline, and long overall,Gr√∂ner, p. 73 which was approximately longer than the s. The ship initially had a beam of , but bulges added during the design process to help stability increased the beam to . The ship had a draft of as designed, but the conversion would have increased it to . I displaced at the designed weight, and up to at maximum displacement. The ship's hull was divided into 16 watertight compartments and was equipped with a double bottom. The percentage of the length of the hull the double bottom extended is unknown. The ship's flight deck was long and wide. There was a single hangar that was long, wide forward, and wide aft. No armor was to have been added to the ship during the conversion process. The ship was propelled by four sets of Blohm & Voss geared turbines that drove four shafts, each with a four-bladed screw that was in diameter. The turbines were powered by 24 double-ended narrow water tube boilers that produced up to 21 atmospheres of pressure. The engines were rated for , and provided a top speed of . At the maximum speed, the ship could steam for ; at a cruising speed of , the cruising range doubled, to . The ship was designed to store up to of fuel oil, but total fuel bunkerage was . I had only one rudder. The electrical power plant comprised four diesel generators that provided 520 kilowatts and two emergency generators that provided 100 kW each. The total power output was 2,280 kW at 230 volts. =Armament= A Bf 109T-1, the type I would have carried The ship was to have been armed with twelve L/65 anti-aircraft guns in six twin mounts, three forward and three aft of the island and funnel. These guns had a total of 4,800 rounds, or 400 rounds per gun. The 10.5 cm guns fired two types of projectiles: a high explosive shell and a incendiary round. Both types of ammunition used a single propellant charge: the RPC/32 charge. The guns could elevate to 80 degrees, and could hit targets flying at . When the guns were used to engage surface targets, they could hit targets away, at an elevation of 45 degrees. There were also to have been twenty anti-aircraft guns, also in double mounts. These guns were placed along both sides of the flight deck, and had a total of 40,000 shells. The 3.7 cm guns fired high-explosive shells at a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute, and a muzzle velocity of 1,000 m/s (3,281 ft/s). The guns could elevate to 85 degrees and hit targets flying at , although the tracers were limited to . The anti-aircraft battery was rounded out by twenty-eight to thirty-six guns in the usual Flakvierling quadruple mounts, supplied by a store of up to 72,000 rounds.Gr√∂ner, pp. 73, 74 These guns fired at a rate of 480 shells per minute cyclic, but were limited in practice to around 200 rounds per minute. The shells were fired at a muzzle velocity of between 800‚Äì835 m/s (2,625‚Äì2,740 ft/s), depending on the type of shell fired. The effective ceiling of the guns was at 85 degrees elevation. The ship was designed to carry 18 Ju 87 \\"Stuka\\" dive-bombers and 24 Bf 109. The Ju 87s were to have been the \\"E\\" variant, which was a navalized version of the Ju 87D, and were modified for catapult launches and were equipped with arresting gear.Kay & Couper, p. 157 The Bf 109 fighters were a navalized version of the \\"E\\" model, designated as Bf 109T.

He immigrated to the United States in 1828 and settled in Memphis in 1833, where he was a pioneer teacher and civic leader. He died in the yellow fever epidemic of 1873.Historical marker - Historical marker on the property erected by the Tennessee Historical Commission During the late 1830s and early 1840s, three important events in Memphis religious history took place in the cottage. In 1839, the first Catholic mass in Memphis was celebrated in the house. In 1840, a priest officiated at the first Catholic marriage in the city. In 1841, the first Catholic baptism of Memphis was performed at the Magevney homestead. In 1941, the descendants of Eugene Magevney gave the property to the City of Memphis, which adapted and operated it as a house museum. In 1973, the Magevney House was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. From 2005 to 2009, the house and museum were closed to the public.

The lower station is located in Adliswil in the Sihl Valley, whilst the upper station is located on the Felsenegg hill on the Albis ridge near the Felsenegg-Girstel TV-tower. The upper station at Felsenegg forms one end of a panoramic walk to the Uetliberg mountain, whilst the lower station is some from Adliswil railway station. The cable car is owned by the Luftseilbahn Adliswil-Felsenegg AG and is operated by the Sihltal Z√ºrich Uetliberg Bahn (SZU), the railway company which links both Adliswil and the Uetliberg to the city of Z√ºrich.  History  The cable car was built by the Swiss company Von Roll and opening on December 30, 1954. The line reused the former two cabins of the \\"Landi-Schwebebahn\\", built to connect the two sites of the . In 1960, these cabins were replaced by new cabins with a capacity of 30 passengers, constructed by SIG Neuhausen, and the cables were replaced. In 1977, a majority shareholding was acquired by the Swiss company Denner AG. In 1986, the line was converted to automatic operation. In 1990, the line became part of the zonal tariff structure of the Z√ºrcher Verkehrsverbund (ZVV), and in 1994 self-service ticketing was introduced, with ticket machines at both stations. In 1997, the drive and brake systems were replaced. The line celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2004, when a complete renewal was planned according to the conditions for the license given by the Swiss government. The renewal cost 3.5 million Swiss francs, which was financed by the municipality of Adliswil, the city of Z√ºrich (300,000 each), the ZVV (2 million), and by public fundraising and sponsorship. The renewal included the control and monitoring system, whilst the cabins were replaced by more comfortable, spacious and \\"sleek\\" cabins constructed by CWA Constructions SA. The masts and carrying ropes were strengthened, and both the valley and mountain stations renewed. The renewal took place between February 4 and 30 April, with the line re-opening on 1 May 2008. On 31 March 2010, the 10th million passenger used the cableway. In 2014, the regular 6-yearly revision of the line was undertaken. In 2016, the upper station was renovated.  Operation  The Adliswil-Felsenegg cable car is technically an aerial tramway (), where the two cabins are suspended from a single support cable whilst being permanently attached to a second propulsion cable. The two cars shuttle between upper and lower stations, and must operate together so that when one car is at the lower station, the other will be at the upper station. The line is operated automatically, under the supervision of a single employee located at the lower station. The cabins and upper station are normally unmanned. The lower station is located at an altitude of , whilst the upper station is at an altitude of , giving a rise of . The line is long, and passes over a single intermediate tower with a height of , with a maximum height above ground level of . The span lengths between the stations and towers are and long and the average gradient is 34.1%. The suspension cable has a diameter of , and the propulsion cable of . The propulsion cable is driven by an electric motor with a continuous power rating of and a peak rating of ; a backup drive of is also available. The two cars each have a capacity of 30 passengers, and travel at a maximum speed of , giving a journey time of 5 to 6 minutes and a maximum hourly capacity of 345 passengers in each direction. The car runs every 15 minutes, or more often if traffic requires it. Depending on the time of the year and the day of the week, cars run from either 08:00 or 09:00 to either 20:00 or 22:00.

Born Emma Boaz Rayson into a working-class family in Birmingham, she became the common-law wife of a solicitor, George Barton. She was first introduced to photography by the brother-in-law of her stepfather, and first became known by publishing portraits of Dan Leno, the music hall star and relative of her husband, in 1898. She is one of the few women photographers highly respected for her work during this time period. In 1901 she had her work shown at the Royal Photographic Society for the first time. She then began to exhibit portraits and religious subjects, being awarded the Royal Photographic Society Medal in 1903 for The Awakening. In 1904 she had her first solo show at the Royal Photographic Society.The following year, she was awarded a $100 prize at the Second American Salon. Not only was her work highly regarded in England, but also internationally. Many of her photographic exhibitions were held in France, America, England, and Berlin. In Berlin, she held a solo exhibition organized by the Photo Club. In 1906 she exhibited 58 prints at the Birmingham Photographic Society‚Äôs Exhibition. From there, she presented work at the Third American Salon, the Salon of the Photo Club of Paris, and the Universal Exhibition of Photography in Berlin. By 1908, her work was published in The Sketch, The Sphere, Country Life, and Illustrated London News. When at the height of her career, Barton was possibly the most published female photographer of her time. In 1911 one critic, Charles E. Dawson, wrote in the Penrose Pictorial Annual and ranked her work alongside \\"the best works of Kasbier, Duhroop, Baron de Mayer, Steichen, Demachy, Puyo, and the other photographic giants...\\" Peter James of the Birmingham Central Library put on one exhibition featuring Emma Barton‚Äôs work. The exhibition featured and honored the work of women born and raised in Birmingham, U.K. Over the years, Emma Barton received several awards for her work. In the new century her photography was influenced by Old Master paintings, the Arts and Crafts movement and the Pre-Raphaelites, and she was also an early user of the Autochrome Lumi√®re process for color photography. After 1918 she ceased to exhibit and photographed only her family. She retired to the Isle of Wight in 1932. Emma Barton's work was later published in the book, Sunlight and Shadow: The Photographs of Emma Barton 1872-1938.

The 2009 Harmony Gold mine deaths occurred in late May and early June 2009 in Free State province, South Africa. At least 82 miners, many from Lesotho, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, died from inhalation of poisonous gasses created by a May 18 fire in the mineshaft. Critically, the ranks of unemployed, independent and redundant miners are unofficially tolerated within unsecured, less-profitable mines. Consequently, in reports from Africa the dead are being officially defined as \\"illegal miners\\" ‚Äî or \\"trespassers\\" ‚Äî onto the mineral-claims of the larger corporate mining operators and market consortiums which traditionally depend on government-supported mineral-extraction concessions and export rights granted in areas such as Free State. A former police officer with 12 years' experience in cases of \\"illegal mining\\" said he feared that hundreds more bodies of \\"illegals\\" could still be underground in mines in the city of Welkom, according to a report in the leading Afrikaans daily, Beeld. He estimated that about 3,000 illegal miners work underground in the mines in Welkom alone. \\"Illegal mining: More bodies found at Free State mine\\", Mail & Guardian (Johannesberg) online (June 4, 2009 12:55) The affected mine (the Eland shaft \\"Harmony reports success in combating criminal mining\\", Harmony News Release (1 June 2009) ) is owned by Harmony Gold. Africa's third-largest gold producer and the fifth-largest in the world, Harmony is especially exposed to trespassers because the company followed a strategy of buying up old, abandoned or marginally productive mines (alongside controversial, environmentally expensive extraction techniques), which fell into disuse when gold prices were lower. James Macharia, \\"More than 60 illegal miners killed at SA gold mine\\", Mail&Guardian; (Johannesberg) online (Jun 02 2009 12:02)  Deaths  The deaths were initially thought to have been caused by a fire. One miner who escaped had reported seeing smoke and running. Harmony states that the dead were members of an illegal mining syndicate commonly referred to as Zama-Zamas. The syndicate allegedly raid Harmony's mines regularly, 'armed' with explosives. However explosives are historically a necessary technology of mining; and Harmony has not related the deaths to an attack or explosion. Harmony did initially propose a theory that mercury used to coagulate gold combined with Zama-Zamas' explosives, and led to the fire. But the dead were not found in a burnt condition, indicating their deaths may be from gas or smoke inhalation, also common effects of fire. The numerous deaths occurred within passable sections of a mine which Harmony defined as \\"closed-up\\". Initially, 36 people were reported as dead. Fellow illegals requested body bags in which to place the bodies of their companions; these were provided by Harmony and the 36 were brought to the surface between 31 May and 1 June 2009. A further twenty-five dead were pulled from \\"closed-up\\" sections of the mine on 2 June 2009. These were located by other illegals who searched when it was determined by Harmony that the \\"closed\\" sections occupied by illegals were too dangerous to be entered by any of the firm's staff. 63 corpses had been found by 4 June. Both Harmony and the South African government have since said they will not compensate the families of the suffocated. On Thursday 28 September 2017 at around 6pm the regional manager of Harmony Gold, Simphiwe Kubheka was shot dead at Harmony Mines in Welkom.  Previous incidents  The corpses of illegal miners are regularly found in the same mine shaft but this is the first time such a high death toll has been recorded from one incident. Five dead were found fourteen days before this incident and twenty-five more were recovered following a fire in 2007. South African miners typically enter one mine shaft and then exit from another one several miles away. Harmony described all the miners as \\"criminals\\", issuing an initial statement reported by Reuters: \\"The bodies of 36 criminal miners have been brought to surface at the shaft during the past weekend by fellow criminal miners\\". 294 illegal miners were arrested in the same province in the previous month and another 114 in March 2009. These figures included miners from Harmony.  Responsibility  On June 5, 2009, Harmony suspended 77 Harmony employees and 45 contractors who allegedly had helped the illegal mining activities,gfArticleId=nw20090605144455217C506498 \\"Workers suspended for helping illegal miners\\", Saturday Star (Johannesberg) (5 June 2009, 16:47) and 100 implicated employees have been arrested.

She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet in June 1910. She was armed with a main battery of twelve 10.5 cm SK L/45 guns and had a top speed of . Kolberg saw action in several engagements with the British during the war, including the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in December 1914 and the Battle of Dogger Bank the following month. She also saw action against the Russians on two occasions, during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915 and Operation Albion in November 1917. After the end of the war, she was ceded to France as a war prize and renamed Colmar. She served only briefly in the French Navy, including a deployment to Asia in 1924. She was stricken in 1927 and broken up two years later. Design Kolberg was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced normally and up to at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of Melms & Pfenniger steam turbines driving four propellers. They were designed to give . These were powered by fifteen coal-fired Marine water-tube boilers. These gave the ship a top speed of . Kolberg carried of coal that gave her a range of approximately at . Kolberg had a crew of eighteen officers and 349 enlisted men. The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve SK L/45 guns in single pedestal mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle, eight were located amidships, four on either side, and two were side by side aft. These were replaced in 1916-1917 with six 15 cm SK L/45 guns. She also carried four SK L/55 anti-aircraft guns, though these were replaced with a pair of two SK L/45 anti-aircraft guns in 1918. She was also equipped with a pair of torpedo tubes submerged in the hull. Two deck-mounted torpedo tube launchers were added in 1918. She could also carry 100 mines. The conning tower had thick sides, and the deck was covered with up to thick armor plate. The main battery guns were fitted with gun shields that were thick. Service history =Pre- war career= Kolberg was ordered under the contract name Ersatz and the contract for her construction was awarded to the Schichau-Werke shipyard in Danzig on 24 August 1907. Her keel was laid down on 15 January 1908; work proceeded quickly and she was launched on 14 November. At the launching ceremony, Oberb√ºrgermeister (Lord Mayor) of Kolberg Dr. Schmieder christened the ship after his city. Fitting-out work took another twenty months and she conducted builder's trials in early 1910. She was commissioned on 21 June 1910 for full sea trials, though these were delayed twice by crew shortages. During trials she visited her namesake city on 30 April and again from 5 to 8 June 1911. On 13 June, Kolberg was finally pronounced ready for service; the following day, her first active duty commander Fregattenkapit√§n (Frigate Captain) Paul Heinrich came aboard the ship. On 15 June, Kolberg steamed from Danzig to Kiel, where she joined the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet, taking the place of the light cruiser . She thereafter was ordered to accompany Kaiser Wilhelm's yacht Hohenzollern II to a sailing regatta held in the mouth of the Elbe and then for a visit to Bergen and Balestrand, Norway. She arrived back in Kiel on 2 August and five days later joined the rest of the fleet scouts in the Kattegat for annual fleet training. After the conclusion of the exercises in September, Kolberg took part in a naval review held off Swinem√ºnde during a visit of the Austro-Hungarian crown prince, Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Kolberg thereafter underwent periodic maintenance, which prevented her from joining the rest of the reconnaissance force on a cruise to Norway. Kolberg began the year 1912 with training exercises in the North Sea in February. In March, she was again assigned to escort Hohenzollern for a cruise abroad; the two ships left Kiel on 5 March and steamed south through the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea. They stopped in Gibraltar from 11 to 12 March before proceeding on to Venice, Italy on 17 March. The ships then began a tour of Mediterranean ports that lasted from 26 March to 10 May. During this period, Kolberg steamed from the island of Corfu to Brindisi, Italy on 11 April, where she embarked the German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg to carry him to Corfu and then later back to Brindisi. Kolberg was in Genoa, Italy when she was recalled to Germany on 12 May. She stopped in Vigo, Spain on 16‚Äì17 May and arrived off Helgoland on 23 May, where she rejoined the High Seas Fleet. From 23 June to 9 July, she temporarily served as the flagship of I Scouting Group while the battlecruiser was under repair and the new battlecruiser had not yet entered service. The rest of the year was occupied with peacetime training exercises and routine cruises in the North and Baltic Seas. The same pattern followed in 1913 and the first half of 1914; Kolbergs service during this period was uneventful, apart from another period escorting Wilhelm II, who this time cruised aboard the HAPAG steamship , on a tour of Norwegian ports in July 1913. =World War I= North Sea operations Following the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, Kolberg and the rest of II Scouting Group were tasked with patrolling the German North Sea coast and supporting the torpedo-boat screen that kept watch for hostile sea forces. On 17‚Äì18 August, Kolberg and the light cruisers and went on a patrol out to the Broad Fourteens but encountered no British vessels. Kolberg was stationed in the mouth of the Ems river on the morning of 28 August, when the sound of distant gunfire alerted the crew to the Battle of Helgoland Bight, then underway. She, Stralsund, and the light cruiser immediately sortied to reinforce the German vessels in the bight, but they arrived too late to see action with the British cruisers. Kolberg reached the burning cruiser and took off her surviving crew before the latter vessel sank. Kolberg was erroneously said to have been sunk in the battle in initial reports. On 9 September, Kolberg escorted the minelaying cruisers and and the auxiliary minelayer while they laid the defensive minefield \\"Alpha\\" on the western side of the German Bight. She escorted Nautilus again on 16‚Äì18 October to lay an offensive minefield off the Firth of Forth, but the presence of British warships in the Dogger Bank forced the Germans to break off the operation. Beginning in November, the German fleet began a series of raids on coastal British towns in the hopes of provoking part of the British Grand Fleet to sortie, which could then be cut off and destroyed by the High Seas Fleet. Kolberg participated in the first of these, the raid on Yarmouth on 2‚Äì4 November, where she supported the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group that were commanded by Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Franz von Hipper. During the operation, she covered Stralsund, which had been fitted to carry a load of naval mines that were laid off the British coast. During the subsequent raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby on 15‚Äì16 December, Kolberg was also modified to carry 100 mines, which she laid off Filey Brigg while the battlecruisers shelled the ports. When the German forces withdrew, the weather became bad enough that Hipper ordered the other light cruisers to steam independently to the rendezvous with the main fleet; Kolberg had meanwhile joined up with the battlecruisers and proceeded with them. The heavy weather caused some damage to the ship, and so Kolberg had to be repaired from 16 December to 6 January 1915. A little over a month later, she saw action at the Battle of Dogger Bank, on 24 January 1915. The engagement began when Kolberg encountered the British cruiser at about 08:10; both ships opened fire, drawing the British and German battlecruiser squadrons to the action. In the span of about fifteen minutes, Kolberg quickly scored three hits on Aurora, which replied with two hits of her own. One of the shells struck Kolberg below the waterline and the other shell hit the ship above the waterline; the hits killed two men and wounded two others. On 26 January, Kapit√§n zur See (KzS‚ÄîCaptain at Sea) Karl von Restorff, the II. F√ºhrer der Torpedoboote (Leader of Torpedo Boats), raised his flag aboard Kolberg, making her his flagship. For the rest of 1915, she continued in her role with the fleet, participating in the sorties conducted by Admiral Hugo von Pohl and patrolling the German Bight. In August 1915, she and significant portions of the fleet were transferred to the Baltic for the Battle of the Gulf of Riga. Kolberg was part of the covering force for the I Scouting Group battlecruisers, she was assigned to serve as a flotilla leader for three and a half flotillas of torpedo boats, as part of an assault force into the Gulf of Riga. On 10 August she was tasked with bombarding Russian coastal batteries on the island of Ut√∂ and the harbor of Hanko in southern Finland. While shelling the positions, Russian destroyers sortied to intercept Kolberg, and the ensuing battle prompted Hipper to send Von der Tann to support her. Numerous reports of submarines in the area convinced the Germans to withdraw. A few days later, on the night of 13‚Äì14 August, Kolberg was present off the Irbe Strait at the southern entrance to the Gulf of Riga when she was attacked by Russian destroyers and coastal guns. On either 15 or 16 August 1915, a Russian submarine fired a single torpedo at Kolberg which missed. On 21 August, she returned to the North Sea, where she resumed patrol duties. Kolberg participated in the fleet operation on 11‚Äì12 September to cover a group of minelayers off the Swarte Bank, but she was in dock for maintenance during the sortie of 23‚Äì24 October, prompting Restorff to temporarily transfer to the cruiser . On 12 November, KzS Max K√∂thner replaced Restorff. Baltic Sea operations In January 1916, Kolberg was transferred to the Baltic Sea naval forces. She was occupied with training exercises in February, and on 27 February she steamed to Libau, where she replaced the cruiser as the flagship of VI Scouting Group, which had been formed only on 15 January 1916. Kommodore (Commodore) Hugo Langemak raised his flag aboard the ship, though she served as his flagship only briefly, before being replaced by Strassburg on 12 September. By 1916, the naval war in the Baltic had become a stalemate, with neither side's fleet willing to engage the other, instead preferring to use minefields. As a result, Kolberg was primarily occupied with patrolling the Baltic and supporting minelayers. She operated primarily with Strassburg, the cruiser , the torpedo boat , and VIII and X Torpedo Boat Flotillas. From 12 to 15 September, now-KAdm Langemak attempted to force his way into the Gulf of Riga to destroy the Russian pre-dreadnought battleship , but the Germans failed to break into the gulf. Kolberg was thereafter transferred to Windau and Langemak shifted his flag to Augsburg. On 11 November, Kolberg returned to Libau, and a month later, she went to Kiel on 12 December to be modernized at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) there. The work lasted from 16 December to 11 May 1917, and included a reconstruction of her bridge that significantly changed her silhouette, the installation of two 50 cm torpedo tubes in deck launchers, and the replacement of her original battery with 15 cm guns. She left Kiel on 7 June to return to her unit, arriving in Libau four days later. Langemak briefly returned to Kolberg from 18 to 23 July before transferring back to Augsburg. Map of German movements during Operation Albion Most of 1917 passed uneventfully for Kolberg until significant elements of the High Seas Fleet were transferred to the Baltic for Operation Albion, the conquest of the Gulf of Riga after the German Army captured the city during the Battle of Riga the month before. During the operation, Vizeadmiral (VAdm‚ÄîVice Admiral) Albert Hopman‚Äîwho had replaced Langemak in December 1916‚Äîused Kolberg as his flagship. At 06:00 on 14 October, Kolberg, Strassburg, Augsburg, and the old aviso , with escorting torpedo boats and minesweepers, sortied from Libau. The ships broke through the Irbe Strait and began minesweeping operations in the Gulf of Riga. They were attacked by Russian coastal guns on their approach and were temporarily forced to turn away. By 08:45, however, they had anchored off the Mikailovsk Bank and the minesweepers began to clear a path in the minefields. Two days later, Strassburg and Kolberg joined the dreadnoughts and for a sweep of the Gulf of Riga. In the ensuing Battle of Moon Sound, the battleships destroyed Slava and forced the pre-dreadnought to leave the Gulf. Later that day, Kolberg moved into the Gulf and engaged a Russian coastal battery at Woi on Moon Island for ten minutes, starting at 13:35. The Russian guns did not return fire, so Kolberg ceased firing, and at 14:25, anchored in the Kleinen Sound with Strassburg. A landing party of forty men was assembled to capture the Russian guns at Woi; they landed on the island at 15:45 and by 17:30, the landing party had captured the guns and rendered them inoperable. On 4 November, Kolberg steamed from Arensburg to Windau, where she embarked Prince Leopold of Bavaria, the Ober Ost, the supreme commander of German forces on the Eastern Front. She carried Leopold back to Arensburg before returning him to Windau on 11 November. From there, Kolberg steamed to Libau to reembark Hopman. KAdm Ludolf von Uslar replaced Hopman on 7 December; Uslar raised his flag aboard Kolberg that day, but he remained aboard only for a short time before she was recalled to Kiel for an overhaul; she left Libau on 29 December, and the shipyard work lasted from 1 January to 17 March 1918. During this period, she had a pair of 8.8 cm Flak guns installed. The Russian government had agreed to an armistice with the Central Powers in December 1917, and while Kolberg was in the shipyard, the Baltic Sea reconnaissance force was dissolved on 24 January. A new command, the Befehlshaber der Sicherung der Ostsee (BSO‚ÄîCommander of the Defense of the Baltic Sea) was created, with separate western and eastern divisions. On returning to service, Kolberg became the flagship of the western division of the BSO, KAdm Hermann Nordmann, though he was replaced by KAdm Walter von Keyserlink on 28 October. Kolberg was transferred to the \\"Sonderverband f√ºr der Ostsee\\" (Special Unit for the Baltic Sea) on 28 March, which was tasked with supporting the German intervention in the Finnish Civil War. Kolberg took part in the attack on Hanko by the 14th J√§ger Battalion. She later replaced the battleship , which had been stationed in the √Öland Islands to support German forces there. She remained there until 19 May, when she was replaced by Stralsund; Kolberg left Mariehamn in the √Ölands the following day, bound for Kiel. She arrived there on 22 May and was returned to the BSO. The ship briefly patrolled the Little Belt before returning to the Baltic on 18 June, resuming her role as Uslar's flagship. Uslar's command had by that time been renamed the Befehlshaber der Baltischer Gew√§sser (BBG‚ÄîCommander of Baltic Waters). She carried the Chief of the Marinestation der Ostsee (Baltic Sea Naval Station), Admiral Gustav Bachmann on a tour of Danzig, Libau, Windau, Reval, and Arensburg before disembarking him in Riga. From 3 to 23 July, Kolberg went to Kiel before returning to Libau. She went on a tour of the Baltic, stopping in Reval, Helsinki, Kotka, Hungerburg, Bj√∂rk√∂sund, and Hanko. The ship was assigned to IV Scouting Group under VAdm Friedrich Boedicker for Operation Schlu√üstein, a planned amphibious attack on the Russian capital at St. Petersburg, but the operation was called off on 5 September. Kolberg was then transferred back to the BBG and assigned as the station ship for Helsinki. On the way there, she stopped in Mariehamn, Jakobstad, and Nikolaistad. On 25 September, the ship went to Reval, where she received orders to return to Kiel, where she was to be decommissioned. She left the city two days later and arrived in Kiel on 29 September. Between 2 and 5 October, parts of her crew were transferred to the Naval Detachment in Crimea. Kolberg was decommissioned on 17 December, after the end of the war; she was not included in the list of ships to be interned at Scapa Flow, and so she remained behind in Kiel. =Service with the French Navy= Colmar in Shanghai, c. 1924 Kolberg was stricken from the naval register on 5 November 1919, and subsequently surrendered to the French in Cherbourg on 28 April 1920, under the name \\"W\\". She was commissioned in the French Navy as Colmar in 1922. She was not significantly modified in French service, the primary change being the replacement of her 8.8 cm guns with anti-aircraft guns. Colmar also had a new aft deckhouse built and the 75 mm guns were installed on its roof. After the work was completed, she underwent sea trials for almost a year. In 1922, she was assigned to a colonial tour in French Indochina that lasted for three years. She left France on 19 June 1922 and arrived in the colony on 7 September. On arrival, she replaced the armored cruiser as the flagship of the Division Navale de l'Extreme Orient (Naval Division of the Far East). She was in Vladivostok, Russia in 1923 when the Great Kant≈ç earthquake hit Japan, so she steamed to Yokohama to assist in the relief effort. Several other cruisers joined her during her deployment, including the armored cruisers , , and . In September 1924, Colmar and Jules Ferry contributed to a multi-national landing party of around 1,800 men drawn together due to violence in Shanghai. Colmar was recalled to France in November, and she arrived back in France on 11 February 1925. She remained in French service for only a few months, being deemed unfit for further service in November, when she was decommissioned. Over the course of 1926 and 1927, she was cannibalized for parts for the other ex-German cruisers in French service, and she was stricken on 21 July 1927. Ultimately, she was broken up for scrap two years later in Brest, France.

The line, which connects De Doorns in the Hex River valley with Touws River in the Great Karoo, is part of the main rail route between Cape Town and Johannesburg. Of the of track, are underground. Construction of the line eliminated the bottleneck of the Hex River rail pass.South African Construction World, July 1990, pp. 60‚Äì61 The Hex River rail pass Sir John Charles Molteno The enormous Cape Fold Belt effectively separated Cape Town on the coast from the hinterland of Southern Africa, and had obstructed previous attempts to expand the Cape Colony's railway infrastructure inland. In 1872 the Cape Government, under Prime Minister John Molteno, ordered that a railway line must be constructed across this barrier in the vicinity of the Hex River Mountains. The Cape Government Railways (CGR) was formed and railway engineer William George Brounger was appointed to oversee the task.The Royal Commonwealth Society, 1898, \\"Proceedings of the Royal Colonial Institute\\". The Institute, Northumberland Avenue, London, W.C. p. 26.SABC, 14 August 1954, John Bond. \\"John Molteno: Founder of the South African Railways\\", p. 3. =Route= The Hex River Mountain was a major obstacle to be overcome during the construction of the railway between Cape Town and the diamond fields at Kimberley in the Northern Cape. In 1874 surveyor Wells Hood, under the instruction of Brounger, found a potential route up the climb from De Doorns in the Hex River valley to the top of the Karoo plateau east of the Valley, that would require gradients of no more than 1 in 40 uncompensated, very steep by railway standards, and tight curves with a minimum radius of . He also proposed that a short tunnel would be required.Jose Burman (1984). Early Railways at the Cape. Cape Town: Human & Rousseau, By 1876, the Molteno Government had selected Thomas Brounger's proposed route through the Hex River valley, with the line to follow the route from Worcester through De Doorns, then along Hood's proposed pass across the mountain via Osplaas to the summit at Matroosberg, and then via Kleinstraat to Touws River. =Cape Gauge= Dual gauge track on the old Strand street crossing outside Cape Town station, c. 1880 The original line between Cape Town and Wellington was laid to standard gauge, but this gauge could not be accommodated economically on the tight curves required by the proposed Hex River rail pass. This led to a decision by the CGR to use a narrower gauge of across the pass. After initially making use of dual gauge, it was decided in 1873 to convert all existing trackage of the CGR to this narrower gauge that was eventually to become known throughout Africa as Cape gauge. Credit for the fact that most of the present day railway lines in Africa are Cape gauge can therefore be directly attributed to the Hex River rail pass. =First Tunnel= The original tunnel, Southern Africa's first railway tunnel, is situated at from De Doorns on the original line to Matroosberg. The tunnel is straight and the portals are of dressed stone masonry, but the inside is unlined. On the route ascending the mountain, Osplaas provided the only level stretch that was long enough for a conventional passing loop. Progress of the building of the line: Reached Worcester, June 16, 1876, and by the end of 1977 had reached Montagu Road, now known as Touws River - thus past the tunnel.Railways of Southern Africa, John R Day, 1963, Leagrave Press, p23 =Second Tunnel= Eastern portals, 1876 tunnel at left, 1929 tunnel at right This first tunnel served the railways for 53 years, until the track was re-laid in 1929 to diminish a curve to accommodate larger locomotives. In the process a new concrete lined curved tunnel was sunk alongside the original. Since another crossing place had also become necessary, a siding named Tunnel was fashioned just east of the tunnel by laying two level dead-end spur tracks that branched directly off on opposite sides of the main line. This allowed trains to wait in one or the other of these sidings to allow an opposing train to pass. This latter tunnel remained in use for sixty years, until the line across the pass was closed to rail traffic in 1989.Reader's Digest Atlas of Southern Africa, The Reader's Digest Association South Africa (Pty.) Limited, 1984, (Editor Christopher Walton), p76, Despite its quick and relatively cheap construction, the Hex River rail pass served the South African Railways (SAR) for more than a century. It was the starting point of the country's first railway line to the Witwatersrand and opened the way for Cecil Rhodes' colonisation thrust into central Southern Africa.Hexpas Ecotrek History Current route The railway line between Cape Town and Beaufort West has a ruling grade of 1 in 66 and a minimum curvature of , except for the pass where the steep gradient and sharp curves restricted train lengths and required additional locomotive power to bank trains on the ascent. In 1943 the gradients between De Doorns and Matroosberg stations were eased to 1 in 40 compensated, while the curves were eased to a minimum radius of , but despite this the Hex River rail pass still formed a bottleneck that would require more drastic measures to be eliminated. This eventually led to the decision to construct a tunnel system to eliminate the Hex River rail pass altogether. In 1945 Mr W.H. Evans, later to become Chief Civil Engineer of the SAR, proposed a new route for the section between De Doorns and Matroosberg that would result in a gradient of 1 in 66 compensated and a minimum curve radius of . The scheme would require four tunnels, two with a length of each and two more with lengths of and respectively. The benefits to the SAR would be significant. Operating costs would be decreased as a result of the elimination of sharp curves and steep gradients. The length of the section would be reduced by and it would also eliminate altogether 5,280 degrees of curvature and of false rise in level. Train running times could be reduced by 23 minutes in the ascending direction and 36 minutes in the descending direction. =Approval= Original eastern portal of tunnel no. 4, abandoned in 1948 The scheme was approved in 1946 and it was decided that full-face working would be employed in the long tunnel. With this method and working two faces simultaneously, it was expected that complete with lining could be achieved annually, with the whole tunnel completed in four years. Tunnelling on the subsidiary tunnels and external earthworks commenced immediately, but start of work on the long tunnel was delayed due to special equipment that had to be designed and ordered in 1946. While awaiting the special equipment, the western (Cape Town side) and eastern (Johannesburg side) portals were established by heading and benching, and short sections of tunnel were driven at both ends by 1948. The original eastern portal (coordinates ) was dug immediately adjacent to the N1 national road some west of Touws River and took the form of a cutting into a gradient to sufficient depth to commence tunnelling. =First postponement= In April 1950, however, work on the whole Hexton scheme was deferred for reasons of economy. Instead, the existing line through the pass was electrified by 1954 and operated with the Class 4E electric locomotives that had been ordered for use through the tunnels. At the time the project was halted, altogether of tunnel had been excavated and of concrete lining had been placed in the shorter tunnels. =Second and third postponements= Southwestern portal of tunnel no. 1, the twin tunnels, of which only one is in use The tunnel scheme was briefly resuscitated in 1965 but was deferred once again in 1966. Work was eventually resumed in 1974 and included the remodelling of the lower section of the deviation between De Doorns and Osplaas stations as well as the construction of tunnel no. 1, the twin tunnels. This was completed in 1976, at which point financial constraints resulted in yet another postponement. Authority to proceed was only given once again in late 1979. The twin tunnels bored through a hill that was skirted around the western and northern sides by the original alignment to Osplaas. When completed, the south-eastern of the twin tunnels became part of the new alignment of the De Doorns-Osplaas section. The north-western of the twin tunnels was initially used for construction trains working on the rest of the tunnel system and became part of the new route when the tunnel system opened. The south-eastern of the twin tunnels eventually fell into disuse along with the old Hex River Railpass. Hexton completion In most respects the scheme as eventually completed was the same as that envisaged in 1945. Before proceeding in 1979, however, a sophisticated evaluation of the capacity of the whole Hexton scheme had been carried out using train diagrams and computer-devised train running times. The conclusion was that, with only two passing loops between De Doorns and Kleinstraat compared to the three at Osplaas, Tunnel and Matroosberg on the existing line, the capacity would be 31 trains, but with an additional passing loop it would increase to 42 trains. It was therefore decided to place a third passing loop, called Hexton, inside the long tunnel in addition to the two loops between tunnels no. 1 and 2 at Almeria and between tunnels no. 3 and 4 at Salbar respectively.South African Construction World, May 1990, p. 55 (Diagram) =Construction= The passing siding inside the longest tunnel, looking west When tenders were invited, two routes had been selected for tunnel no. 4, the longest tunnel. One would be straight and more or less on the original location, but with the eastern portal relocated further away from the N1 national road. The other would be curved to pass through shale material, that would make the use of a tunnel boring machine an economical proposition. Tenderers were invited to quote for circular or horseshoe profiles and concrete or shotcrete linings for each of the two profiles and for each of the proposed routes. After the engineering, geological and economic factors had been analysed, the straight route with a horseshoe profile and concrete lining was finally selected. The tunnel was constructed by Compagnie Interafricaine De Travaux (Comiat), a division of Spie- Batignolles in Paris, France. The contract for tunnel no. 4 was awarded on 13 August 1980 at a tender price of R26,770,082 and with the completion date four years later on 12 August 1984. The contractual completion date was later extended to 25 February 1986. Construction commenced in September 1980, with tunnel excavation commencing in January 1981. As a result of unforeseen adverse sub-surface conditions that were encountered during the execution of the contract, however, the tunnel was only completed in November 1988.South African Construction World, October 1990, p. 59 Tunnels no. 2 and 3 are similar in construction to the long tunnel, but were completed under a separate contract at a cost of R9 million. Both of them had been partly excavated when work was suspended in 1949, the tunnel no. 2 to a distance of of which most was concrete lined, and the tunnel no. 3 to a distance of , but only lined in areas of poor ground. The contract called for both to be widened to new design standards to allow for overhead electrification and broader loading gauge clearances.The Civil Engineering Contractor, February 1986, p. 35 =Completion= The eastern portal of tunnel no. 4 The western portal (coordinates ) of tunnel no. 4, as established in 1948, enters directly into the mountain face, which is nearly vertical at that point. The eastern portal (coordinates ) was relocated a short distance to the southeast of the original 1948 portal and is in a long and deep cutting. The tunnel is long and has a maximum cover of . The gradient is mainly 1 in 66, except at the passing loop where it decreases to 1 in 200. Five ventilation shafts of diameter and with a combined length of were sunk. The cross-sectional area of the horseshoe profile single line tunnel is , but this increases to at the passing loop. Tunnel no. 4 also contains relay rooms for signalling equipment. The tunnel system became operational in April 1989, more than forty years after the first portals were sunk, and was officially opened on 27 November 1989. The completed four-tunnel system now boasts the longest railway tunnel system in Africa.South African Panorama, October 1989, p. 25 Tunnel 4 was the longest railway tunnel in Africa until 2009. The present longest single railway tunnel in Africa is long, on the Gautrain line between Johannesburg Park Station and Marlboro Portal, which was broken through in September 2009. Ecotourism Upon the opening of the new route, the line was effectively doubled since the original line across the pass was retained. As a result of already diminishing traffic volumes due to competition from road transport, however, the old Hex River rail pass line was closed to rail traffic and the electrification infrastructure was removed when the Hexton line was opened. A large part of the track between Matroosberg and Osplaas stations was left in place, however, and is now being utilised as a popular tourist destination known as the Hexpas Ecotrek.Hexpas Ecotrek ‚Äì Hexpas Express References External links * Category:Railway tunnels in South Africa Category:Tunnels in South Africa Category:Tunnels completed in 1989 Category:1989 in South Africa ","title":"Hex River Tunnels"},{"id":"23088969","text":"The 4756th Air Defense Wing was the designation of two different discontinued United States Air Force organizations..Cornett & Johnson refers to this as a reactivation, however under USAF organizational rules at the time, the wing was a MAJCON (4-digit) unit and the lineage of the first 4756th Air Defense Wing had been terminated and could not be revived. (An updated, but abbreviated, version of this work is available at A Guide to USAF Lineage and Honors ) Both wings were stationed at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida and fulfilled similar missions. The first was organized in 1957 when Air Defense Command (ADC) assumed responsibility for managing Tyndall from Air Training Command and focused on weapons testing and development and evaluating the readiness of ADC fighter units. The wing also controlled a ground control intercept radar squadron. This wing was discontinued in 1960 and its mission transferred to its parent 73d Air Division. The second wing was organized in 1962. It also conducted testing, but focused on crew training for interceptor aircraft. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, the wing also assumed an alert state at bases in Florida. This wing was discontinued in 1968 and its mission transferred to the Air Defense Weapons Center, which had replaced the 73d Air Division at Tyndall in 1966. History =First wing= Loading an AIR-2 Genie on an F-101 at Tyndall AFB during a William Tell weapons meet The first wing was organized in 1957, when Tyndall Air Force Base was transferred from Air Training Command to Air Defense Command (ADC). It assumed the mission, personnel and equipment of ATC's 3625th Combat Crew Training Wing, which was discontinued. The primary mission of the wing was to conduct air defense weapons employment and testing. It also provided combat crew training on the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter until ADC released all its F-104s to the ANG in 1960 because the F-104A fire control system was not sophisticated enough to make it an all weather interceptor.McMullen, Richard F. (1964) \\"The Fighter Interceptor Force 1962-1964\\" ADC Historical Study No. 27, Air Defense Command, Ent Air Force Base, CO (Confidential, declassified 22 Mar 2000), p. 6 From 1957 until 1959, the wing also controlled the 678th Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron, which performed the radar aircraft detection, warning, and control mission. In addition to the mission units listed below, the wing was assigned various support and maintenance units to carry out its mission as host unit for Tyndall,Mueller., p. 564 Between 1960 when the wing was discontinued and 1962, most of the wing's units were reassigned directly to the 73d Air Division (Weapons). A major responsibility of wing was to evaluate the readiness and effectiveness of Air Defense Command fighter-interceptor squadrons which were required to spend one month each year undergoing evaluation exercises at Tyndall. As part of this mission the 4756th also conducted the annual worldwide interceptor weapons meet called \\"William Tell.\\" The wing participated, along with Air Proving Ground Command, in developing the initial operational testing and development of tactics for the Convair F-102 Delta Dagger aircraft. =Second wing= TF-102A Delta Dagger 56-2317 at Tyndall AFB in 1968 The second wing provided interceptor combat crew training for McDonnell F-101 Voodoo and Convair F-106 Delta Dart aircrews, interceptor aircraft weapons training, and conducted operational testing and evaluation of manned interceptors, fire-control systems, and armament. The wing was ADC's only unit conducting live firing and operating target control systems after the 4750th Air Defense Wing at Vincent Air Force Base, Arizona was discontinued. Following the Cuban Revolution, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) developed a plan for reinforcing air defenses in southern Florida, named Operation Southern Tip. On 7 April 1961 the JCS tested Operation Southern Tip in which the 4756th wing deployed six F-102s to Homestead Air Force Base, where they stood five minute alert. The same month the Bay of Pigs Invasion occurred and the JCS decided not to terminate the exercise, but to retain the aircraft at Homestead. In July, the number of aircraft was reduced to four and the 482d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron assumed the alert mission from the wing.McMullen, pp. 3-4 During the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, elements of the wing assumed an air defense alert mission. Initially, a total of 60 F-101, F-102 and F-106 aircraft at Tyndall were placed on alert. On 19 November, however, these airplanes were released to resume training and testing except for eight F-102s and TF-102s that remained on strip alertNORAD/CONAD Participation in the Cuban Missile Crisis, Historical Reference Paper No. 8, Directorate of Command History Continental Air Defense Command, Ent AFB, CO , 1 Feb 63 (Top Secret NOFORN declassified 9 March 1996), p. 28 After the crisis, the wing established a Detachment at Key West Naval Air Station to perform the air defense alert mission.

Life Byron A. Vazakas was the son of Alfred Vazakas, a Greek-born linguist who emigrated sometime before 1900 and established a language school in Herald Square, and Margaret Keffer, a young woman who grew up in Reading, Pennsylvania,\\"Byron Vazakas.\\" Contemporary Authors Online Detroit: Gale, 2001. Literature Resources from Gale. Gale the daughter of a former Pennsylvania state legislator, Rep. Aaron T. C. Keffer, a descendant of Henry Clay. There were two younger Vazakas children, Alexander (1906) and Donald (1912). Byron had strong memories of New York City during the years he called his happy ‚ÄúEdwardian childhood.‚Äù Both Byron and Alexander (Alex) attended a progressive Montessori School. Tragedy struck during Christmas week 1912 when Alfred Vazakas died suddenly of pneumonia and the family was left destitute. Alfred Vazakas‚Äô brother Alexander, a professor at the University of Chicago, moved the family to an apartment in Chicago, but within a few weeks another disaster occurred. A fire completely destroyed the building and all their possessions. Margaret Vazakas then brought her family to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to be near members of her family. Donald went to live with relatives while Margaret Vazakas earned a living clerking in local department stores. Byron and Alex attended St. Mary‚Äôs Parochial School. Although he served as an altar boy, Byron rebelled against the school‚Äôs strict discipline and dropped out after the eighth grade. He never returned to a formal school. From an early age, however, Byron read avidly and showed an interest in writing. In 1922 Byron and his family moved to Reading, Pennsylvania, to live with his widowed grandmother. Byron continued to live with his mother at various locations near City Park until her death in December 1940. At first Byron worked in a clothing store and later collected rents for the Reading Company. After he left that job, out of boredom and frustration, his family never pressured him to seek employment, even during the Great Depression. From this time on, Vazakas concentrated on ‚Äúthe 3 R‚Äôs‚Äù that dominated his life‚Äî‚Äúreading, 'riting, and roaming.‚Äù He read widely and became well acquainted with classical music. A close friendship developed with William Baziotes, another young Reading man of Greek parentage who later achieved fame as an abstract expressionist painter. Vazakas introduced Baziotes to Baudelaire and the Symbolists; Baziotes cultivated Vazakas‚Äô tastes in art. The friendship endured for 15 years until the two drifted into different worlds. In later years, Vazakas credited Baziotes with being a formative influence on his artistic development. Vazakas established himself as a writer in Reading, but only a small number of people knew that he wrote poetry. These were the members of the Galleon Writers‚Äô Guild, a group that produced 6 issues of a local literary magazine called \\"The Galleon: A Journal of Literary Achievement.\\" Vazakas‚Äô first published poem, a 5-line piece entitled ‚ÄúGrief,‚Äù appeared in the first issue in November 1934, and five other poems, including one published anonymously and two under the pseudonym \\"Mernos,\\" and one short story appeared in other issues. In 1935 two other poems were published in a small literary magazine called \\"The Bard.\\" By this time Vazakas had written 1,500 poems. All but 22 of them were destroyed at his request when Vazakas said that he had found his true poetic voice. When discussing his career in later years, Vazakas never mentioned either \\"The Galleon\\" or \\"The Bard\\" or the large body of early work. From 1936 to 1942, Vazakas‚Äô prose writing appeared in the \\"Reading Times\\" and the \\"Historical Review of Berks County.\\" Although he never publicly claimed authorship, evidence is clear from a newspaper report that Vazakas wrote a 16-page pamphlet, \\"The Reading Public Museum and Art Gallery, Reading, Pennsylvania: Its History and Purpose,\\" ca. 1941. Statements in its text also establish Vazakas as the author of a more ambitious work, \\"The History of Reading Hospital,\\" published in 1942. As with his early poetry, Vazakas later omitted any reference to these extensively researched pieces of writing. More satisfying, apparently, was the acceptance of individual poems he submitted to periodicals such as \\"American Poetry Journal.\\" During these years Vazakas also reached out to seek the acquaintance of poets he admired. He wrote to, and received replies from, fellow Reading native Wallace Stevens, Marianne Moore, and William Carlos Williams. Williams became enthusiastic about a stanzaic technique in Vazakas‚Äô poetry that he considered innovative. He helped Vazakas find a publisher for his first book, Transfigured Night and wrote the introduction for the volume, which appeared in 1946. All 50 of the pieces had previously been published in 15 periodicals, including \\"New Mexico Quarterly Review\\" and \\"Poetry.\\" In 1947 Vazakas was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for the book. When the award went to Robert Lowell, Vazakas said, ‚ÄúHe deserved it. But I did, too.‚Äù In December 1945, a high point for Vazakas while awaiting publication of \\"Transfigured Night\\" was a joint reading with Tennessee Williams in the YMHA Poetry Center in New York. The following year Vazakas moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he lived for the next 16 years, although always maintaining close ties with Reading. He enjoyed an association with the literary group centered on Archibald MacLeish that included John Ciardi and Richard Wilbur. Vazakas continued writing poetry and having it published in an increasing number of periodicals including Poetry, Poetry Magazine, Crossing Section, Western Review, and some anthologies. He gave occasional lectures and readings at Harvard University and one at Brown University. On four occasions he received fellowships to summer colonies at Breadloaf, VT; Yaddo, NY; and McDowell, NH. His second volume, The Equal Tribunals, was published in 1962. The following year, on the recommendation of Archibald MacLeish, he won an Amy Lowell Traveling Scholarship for 1962-63, renewed for 1963-64, and went to England. He visited Paris and Majorca, but chiefly spent his time in southern England. Vazakas returned to spend the rest of his life quietly in Reading, PA. He lived frugally in the house provided by his brother Alex. His days were spent roaming the derelict parts of Reading and writing poetry at a table in the Reading Public Library. He saw the publication of two more volumes, The Marble Manifesto ( 1966) and Nostalgias For A House Of Cards (1970). Five additional typescript volumes, each containing 50 poems, as did his four published books, remained ready for a publisher that Vazakas never succeeded in finding. For many years he tried unsuccessfully to earn grants and fellowships and suffered frustration at the lack of recognition. He was, however, honored in Reading as its unofficial poet laureate. He gave numerous well-received readings, some as part of the Poetry in the Schools program given in high schools in Berks and surrounding counties. He was the subject of a number of local newspaper features. In May 1981 Albright College awarded him an honorary degree as Doctor of Humanities. Vazakas died in Reading Hospital on September 30, 1987, after a brief illness, a few days after his 82nd birthday. He is buried in Gethsemane Cemetery, Laureldale, PA. The tombstone, placed by Byron‚Äôs devoted brother Alex, reads ‚ÄúNight Transfigured.‚Äù Byron's two brothers, Alex and Donald passed away in 1996 and 2000. Donald's son, Tom currently resides in San Diego with his two children Ben and Saul Vazakas. Vazakas‚Äô papers were organized by his literary executor, Professor Manfred Zitzman, of Albright College. They were willed to Albright College, where they are held in the Special Collections, Gingrich Library. Besides the five volumes of poetry and other uncollected poetry, the papers yielded 22 plays, three novels, some short stories and articles, and numerous sketches. Vazakas also left packets of all the versions of many poems, the first one on the bottom and the final revision on the top. Following the death of Alex Vazakas, additional materials were discovered in a storage unit in the Highlands, Reading, PA, where Alex last resided.

Vazakas‚Äô formal education ended with the eighth grade. After that, he was free to read whatever he liked. He absorbed T. S. Eliot and the Imagists, but his inclinations led him to the Symbolist poetry of St√©phane Mallarm√©, Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud, and Paul Val√©ry. He was deeply affected by Charles Baudelaire and Rainer Maria Rilke. Along with reading, he listened to classical music and studied art, guided to a great extent by his Reading friend, William Baziotes, who later gained fame as an abstract expressionist. By 1935, Vazakas had written 1,500 poems imitating every style and rhyme scheme he had encountered. He regarded these as practice poems and asked his friend, Galleon editor Lloyd Arthur Eshbach, to destroy them, as he did, when Vazakas said he had found his true poetic voice. Only 22 early poems survive. Thus Byron Vazakas was able to emerge as a mature poet in his first volume, Transfigured Night. The literary friends that Vazakas cultivated gave him encouragement and support. Foremost of these was William Carlos Williams, who discovered Vazakas‚Äô poetry at a crucial time in his own career. He credited Vazakas with inventing a new stanzaic technique that he called ‚Äúthe toy cannon‚Äù and lavished him with praise. In the Introduction to Transfigured Night, he called him ‚Äúthat important phenomenon among writers, an inventor‚Äù because of his approach to the poetic line. Williams characterized Vazakas as ‚Äúgentle-vitriolic, kind-inhuman, forgiving-obdurate, a poet whose urbanity is inviolate.‚Äù He observed that ‚ÄúVazakas doesn‚Äôt select his material. . . . It is. Like the newspaper that takes things as it finds them,--mutilated and deformed, but drops what it finds as it was, unchanged in all its deformity and mutilation. . . .‚Äù Marianne Moore responded warmly to Vazakas‚Äô overtures and encouraged him from the start. In contrast, Wallace Stevens, in spite of the connection to Reading, his birthplace, was only coolly cordial, though later he was reported to have described Vazakas as a ‚Äúclever fellow.‚Äù At various times Vazakas enjoyed an association with other writers: Tennessee Williams, John Ciardi, James Merrill, Archibald MacLeish, Richard Wilbur, Theodore Roethke, W. H. Auden, and Edwin Honig. He developed a friendship with the young novelist Maritta Wolff that lasted almost all his life. Vazakas‚Äô Subject Matter The writers whom Vazakas admired convinced him to value his everyday experiences. These included the rich vein of material he mined from his ‚ÄúEdwardian childhood‚Äù in New York City and his boyhood in Lancaster, PA. He was a ‚Äúwalking poet‚Äù in the manner of Walt Whitman, and whatever he saw and reflected upon was grist for his poetic mill, whether it was in the Berks County countryside, the streets of Boston or London or Paris, or the run-down sections of Reading or Philadelphia. The persona Vazakas presented in his first published piece, the 5-line poem ‚ÄúGrief‚Äù in The Galleon, became an enduring one. :\\"I am known :To winds that moan :In grey clouds; :In crowds :I am alone\\" From the start, Vazakas identified himself with the image of an outsider, a young man painfully and ironically aware of a romantic isolation as he argues with the world. He wanders alone in rural or urban settings feeling variously fearful or angry, lonely or trapped. Then comes a surge of spirit and a fierce will to survive. He escapes in a number of ways: the pleasure of reliving the past, the love of a friend and the security of home, and the joy of music, art, and nature. A vacillation between the pessimistic and the optimistic approach creates an emotional counterpart in the poetry. Vazakas‚Äô own painful feelings as an outsider led him to empathize with others who experienced feelings of isolation or alienation. His subjects include writers and painters (Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Hart Crane, Walt Whitman); people who stepped outside the moral code (Oscar Wilde); political radicals (Rosa Luxemburg); people forced into violent situations against their will; and, eventually, the dregs of society. Vazakas observed people of the ‚Äúnether world‚Äù only from a distance, but he lauded the rare individuals who serve down-and-out people without trying to reform them. Vazakas was proud to be characterized as a poet who demonstrated a ‚Äúmoral fervor‚Äù in his approach to life. He was a humanist who emphasized the importance of free will in the search for truth and goodness. To him, morality was ‚Äúthe ethical treatment of others.‚Äù He abhorred the deliberate loss of life, whether from the death penalty or from military initiatives that forced young men to be candidates for an early death or to ‚Äúkill without anger.‚Äù He approved of suicide if that was the only honorable course of action that enabled an individual to take control of his life. The Mode of the Poetry In 1944 Vazakas described his poetry as ‚Äúa kind of cadenced prose with the poetry in the content . . . rather than in the practice.‚Äù He abhorred the strictures imposed by rhyme, meter, and traditional ‚Äúforms‚Äù like the sonnet. Instead, he emphasized the value of ‚Äúthe words themselves‚Äù in conveying ‚Äúan attitude or aspect personally experienced and felt.‚Äù Three decades later Vazakas revised that first description. He said, ‚ÄúIt may sound like merely cadenced poetry, but most is pure iambic.‚Äù He explained that the iambic mode might be obscured by the lack of rhyme and the use of enjambment. Vazakas called his poetry ‚Äúlyric, but essentially dramatic,‚Äù whether the format is a one- or two-page poem employing the short stanza that William Carlos Williams called ‚Äúthe toy cannon‚Äù or a paragraph-length prose poem or a poem with longer, looser lines. The drama is evident, he said, in the frequent occurrence of ‚Äúscenes, settings, and characters.‚Äù Vazakas enhances the dramatic presentation by writing customarily in present tense, thus inviting the reader into the state of mind the poem presents. He employs past tense in descriptions of action extending over a period of time or in reminiscences about his childhood. Other Characteristics The power of description is one of the immediately appealing features of the poetry. The early poems are full of condensed, fused images, a legacy from T. S. Eliot and the Imagists. The later poems rely less heavily on succinct clusters of images, but the quality of the images is consistently high. Allusions to music and art abound in the poetry, in reflection of Vazakas‚Äô devotion to the arts. Everywhere he went, he said, he took with him the remembered sounds of music, and, apparently, the remembered images of art. Not surprisingly for a writer who called himself an expressionist, he preferred the romantics in music and the impressionists in art. Understatement occurs frequently. This element establishes an air of studied, ironic nonchalance. The irony is often gentle, except when the subject matter concerns injustice or inhumanity. Then it becomes open and accusatory. Unadorned conversational statements help to create the ‚Äúcasualness‚Äù Vazakas said he aimed to achieve. The poet often seems just to be talking, making ordinary comments. Playing against this idiom, however, are flashes of wit, sometimes in the form of colloquial wording or slang at unexpected moments. Vazakas‚Äô titles often add an extra dimension apart from the effect of the lines. The language is customarily succinct. The word choice is sometimes ‚Äúerudite, recondite, scholarly‚Äù; at other times ‚Äúdown to earth.‚Äù Vazakas said he was ‚Äúconstantly torn between the two‚Äù kinds of words. The more ordinary choices become dominant in the later poetry. Summary Vazakas characterized his poetry by placing himself ‚Äúmidway between the pure literary, intellectual, cerebral and a man like Sandburg, particularly.‚Äù In contrast to Wallace Stevens, Vazakas called his own poetry ‚Äúpsychologic, graphic.‚Äù In a poem of his, he said, ‚ÄúJoe, the hatter,‚Äù would be an actual person, not a symbolic presence, and the subject of the poem would be ‚Äúthe suffering or hardships of Joe.‚Äù In Joe and all his counterparts, down to society‚Äôs seamiest outcasts, Vazakas expressed ‚Äúthe personal experience of everyman, in an appropriate form. In that respect,‚Äù he said, his poems ‚Äúhave something to say.‚Äù (Sources are identified in the work of Patricia H. Hummel listed in the bibliography.)

The dissatisfaction was a result of the international Vice Presidents announcing that they were taking over the United Labor Association bargaining session. They established a new union, the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Mill Workers, in 1964. Litigation followed, a NLRB election was conducted in October 1964, and the Western organization was certified as the Uniform Labor Agreement bargaining agent.  Culture and symbolism  The AWPPW places a premium on democracy and independence. This is not surprising, given the conditions under which it was founded. For instance, its newsletter, in publication since 1964 is called The Rebel. Its seal is a gavel surrounded by the slogan \\"Guard Well the Democratic Rights of Your Members.\\" The seal and slogan were created by Bill and Lucille Riggs, inspired by Bill's study of Robert's Rules of Order. Bill \\"saw the chairman's gavel as a tangible symbol of a member's rights.\\" \\"Bill, Lucille Riggs Gave AWPPW Its Seal, Slogan.\\" (September 23, 1974). The Rebel, Special Edition AWPPW Tenth Anniversary, p.17.  Governance  The AWPPW was born out of the perceived dictatorial practices of the International Brotherhood of Pulp, Sulphite and Paper Mill Workers and the United Papermakers and Paperworkers unions. Consequently, it proclaims itself to be \\"the most democratic union in the world.\\" AWPPW - Bringing Justice To Your Workplace The structure of union governance according to the 2006 AWPPW constitution is as follows: *President *Vice-president *Secretary Treasurer *Union Organizer *Area Reps **Northern Washington **Southern Washington **Oregon, Idaho, Utah **California *Relief Area Reps **Northern Washington **Southern Washington **Oregon, Idaho, Utah **California *Trustees **Northern Washington **Southern Washington **Oregon, Idaho, Utah **California *Lobbyists **Washington **Oregon, Idaho, Utah *Staff - Accounting *Staff - Member Services  Elections and conventions  The Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers use a directly democratic process for election of their officers. Nominations for association officers are done at the convention by seated delegates. Once nominations are accepted, voting for officers is done on a local level by each member in good standing. Every member in good standing is eligible to vote and run for all offices. Conventions happen every five years, the length of the officers' terms. Special conventions can be called by a 40% call from members in good standing. The members of the executive board (president, vice president, secretary-treasurer, and four elected trustees) do not have power to overrule votes by delegates at convention. Local contracts are bargained by local officers. Strike votes and contract ratification votes are of a simple majority by the local members in good standing. The number of delegates from each local is based on the number of members of that local. Delegates, along with all other local officials, are elected locally by members in good standing at that local. Provisions exist in the constitution for recall of all elected officials.  The split  On April 23, 1964, a majority of 21,000 workers from forty-nine paper mills, owned by eighteen companies, rebelled against the two oldest established unions that had been representing them. The International Brotherhood of Pulp, Sulphite, and Paper Mill Workers (IBPS&PMW;) and the United Papermakers and Paperworkers (UPP), along with affiliate Pacific Coast Pulp and Paper Mill Employees Association (PCPPMEA), bargained collectively with twenty-nine manufacturers. The PCPPMEA had always negotiated with a certain amount of autonomy. Various issues had arisen over the years that created dissension. Significantly, it was the matter of secrecy and lack of democratic rule that was most chafing. The International unions elected their VPs by a majority of votes cast at the convention. Even 100% of the PCPPMEA delegates were not enough to choose their own representation. Rank and file members of the PCPPMEA didn't believe the Internationals were giving sufficient effort to settle their grievances. During pre-wage negotiations the Internationals were seen to have thrown out thirty years of negotiating practice when they replaced PCPPMEA delegates with International VPs. It was this act that prompted Bill Perrin, acknowledged leader of the PCPPMEA, to walk out. He said he just planned \\"to go do a little fishing.\\" He was astonished to find that he had been followed by seventy-three of the 138 delegates. The two International unions appointed replacement delegates and continued to negotiate without the PCPPMEA. Pacific Coast delegates were denied admittance when they attempted to return. Legal action before the Oregon Circuit Court sought to reinstate Pacific Coast delegates. The court ruled against the PCPPMEA and a peace committee was proposed but not well received by any of the parties. An attorney for the International unions argued before the court that NLRB action, rather than a court hearing, was the appropriate venue to decide the issue. It was this statement that sparked the idea to establish a new union. On May 9, 1964, several leaders of the rebellion met in Olympia, Washington to form the AWPPW. Bargaining between the International unions and the companies had concluded on May 5. They had received an offer of about $0.16¬æ an hour. This represented the best offer labor had ever received. The fledgling union was faced with two tasks simultaneously: it had to convince the membership to reject this offer and get enough cards signed to demand NLRB recognition. 9,500 northwest pulp and paper workers, well above the 30% necessary, signed cards requesting representation by the AWPPW. The contract was rejected and nearly 15,000 members had refused to vote. These vote totals represented a serious embarrassment and threat to the International unions. The International unions moved quickly to issue a second referendum offering members an opportunity to reconsider the offer. They asked Pacific Coast mill owners to implement the contract. The employers refused, citing the pending NLRB ruling on the representation petition by the AWPPW. On July 12 the NLRB's Regional Director granted the AWPPW request for a bargaining rights election. The election was held during the week of September 14 and forty-nine mills gave the AWPPW a victory over the Internationals 10,653 to 8,130. The AWPPW was certified as the exclusive bargaining agent for Pacific Coast pulp and paper workers on October 1, 1964.  The first contract  The first order of business for the new union was to negotiate a contract with the manufacturers' association. The untested, inexperienced AWPPW faced an array of forces. They were unsure how vigorously their membership would back them. Taking the membership out on a strike would not be the most auspicious beginning. President William Burnell of the IBPS&PMW; and President Paul L. Phillips of the UPP issued a joint statement declaring the intention of their unions to fight to regain bargaining rights for all the mills they had lost. George Meany of the AFL-CIO denounced the AWPPW and gave his support to the Internationals. However, the new union had support as well. The national AFL-CIO may not have supported them but the Oregon State AFL-CIO named Bill Perrin, President of the AWPPW, Oregon Labor Leader of the Year. The AWPPW received support and pledges of financial assistance from the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, the Teamsters, the International Woodworkers of America, and the Lumber and Sawmill Workers. On October 25, 1964 the AWPPW engaged in its first pre-wage conference. They elected a bargaining board, established procedures, and drafted the demands they would present at the joint wage conference. Present were 140 delegates from fifty- eight locals in Washington, Oregon and California. It was important to bring back a contract competitive with those signed by the International unions. The AWPPW felt it was important to settle a contract quickly. Negotiations began on October 28, 1964. They followed procedures that had been established in the past. The first critical issue to be negotiated was language stipulating that all employees would be represented by the AWPPW. The manufacturers' association resisted this demand. The bargain reached an impasse on the very first issue. On November 3, the management called for the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS). On November 11 the AWPPW called for the first strike pacific coast mills had seen in thirty years. Some employees who remained loyal to the old International unions crossed the picket lines. Employers claimed that thirty-three of the mills continued to operate. Emotions ran high and there was some violence. Contempt of court proceedings were started. Restraining orders were issued and charges of unfair labor practices were lodged. The FMCS in Washington D.C. monitored continued negotiations. With their aid, an agreement was reached on November 23 and the strike came to an end.  The Constitution  February, 1965 saw the first constitutional convention of the AWPPW. The primary constitutional consideration was democratic rule. History of democracy in unions made it clear that a certain amount of authority needed to be vested in the AWPPW to make decisions in the best interest of the membership. The balance fashioned into the Constitution presented concerns to both rank and file and officers of the AWPPW. The balance that was struck provided that all representatives and officers had to stand for election. Officers would be permitted to attend and give voice at committee meetings but only the elected regional representatives were allowed to vote. Addressing the issue of equal voice for small locals, it was decided that locals would be provided elected representation that balanced all locals. Thus, smaller unions would be granted more delegates to be given equal voice. Bill Perrin, who had led the original rebellion, became the first constitutionally elected president of the AWPPW. Regional representatives had to be re-elected by the membership of their region. The Constitution provided for recall of any elected official. Each region elected a trustee plus one trustee at large whose job it was to monitor the Secretary-Treasurers reports and to make certain that the elected officials were fulfilling their obligations. A ten-person executive board, consisting of the trustees, the president, two vice presidents and the secretary-treasurer, was formed. Rank- and-file members comprised a majority of the board, so they were able to control board action. They acted as a trial and appeals board. They oversaw charges brought against members under rules of the constitution. Therefore, a member charged with an infraction could appeal to a board that was made of by a majority of rank and file members. This was a distinctly democratic feature of the AWPPW. A member had one more step beyond this board. The decision of the executive board could be appealed to a three-member board called the Public Review Board. It was composed of people not associated with the AWPPW. The Public Review Board had the power to reverse, modify or uphold executive board decisions. The AWPPW created another distinctly unique, democratic constitutional regulation concerning dues. A modest $2 a month per capita was charged to each local to maintain the management of the union and pay legal bills incurred by the union. If the local, for any reason lost its charter, even by voluntary resignation, all funds and properties would remain with the local. This represented a significant difference from the 'reverter' clauses by which the international unions punished locals if they considered withdrawing. The AWPPW viewed these reverter clauses as blackmail. Numerous problems faced the new union. The authors of The Pulp and Paper Rebellion: A New Pacific Coast Union offer the opinion that there is little doubt that the AWPPW will continue to operate in a democratic manner. The major concern facing the AWPPW is that it might be too democratic.Kleinsorge, Paul; Kerby, William. The Pulp and Paper Rebellion: A New Pacific Coast Union. Institute of Industrial Relations, University of California, 1966.  Women in the AWPPW  The 1968 agreement between the AWPPW and west coast pulp and paper mills was historic according to Clifford Alexander, Jr., Chairman of the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission(EEOC). The union had been pressing since 1966 for equal pay for women performing the same jobs as men. This language represented the first time equal pay language was included in a major contract in the paper industry. Locals 183 and 644 had won this concession in a thirty- six-day strike of the Scott Paper mills in Everett, Washington. It brought women's pay up by 7% and set the standard for the equal pay demand throughout the industry. The membership approved this one issue resolution with a vote of 5,568 to 1,150. It represented an increase in the base rate of $0.13¬Ω per hour for 2,000 women. Manufacturers would say it represented a wage increase over $500,000 per year. This marked the beginning but certainly not the end of the crusade by AWPPW women for redress and reform of various discriminations against women. In 1969 Nancy Weber of Local 672 began an action against Kimberly-Clark that went on as a class action suit all the way to Federal District Court. The court ruling levied $66,800 plus legal fees against Kimberly-Clark. That was the largest Title VII settlement to date but, more importantly, Kimberly was forced to amend its policy. A group of AWPPW women banded together into a group called Women Inc. to fight the pulp and paper industry on many Title VII issues. They filed thirty to thirty-five cases of discrimination with the EEOC. The manufacturers defended themselves by citing antiquated laws that permitted their discriminatory behavior. In 1969 Women, Inc., with the aid of other women's groups, struck the San Francisco fiberboard plants. They forced the management of these plants to go beyond the strict, legal language to examine all company policies in light of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The burden of proof fell upon the state. This historic legal victory by AWPPW women changed not only the shape of pulp and paper manufacturers' behavior, but set the standard for industrial adherence to Title VII of the EEOC across the country.  The AWPPW and politics  The AWPPW has two primary political interests: preserving jobs, and protecting both current and retired workers.\\"O'Sullivan Urges Members to Vote.\\" (September 26, 2008). The Rebel. p. 5. Key issues recently have been environmental measures, international trade agreements, and the Employee Free Choice Act. In the 2008 presidential election, the union wholeheartedly endorsed Barack Obama for his stance on labor issues ranging from minimum wage to the Central American Trade Agreement.John Rhodes, \\"A Few Words from Your Officers.\\" (September 26, 2008). The Rebel. p. 2.

The Rebel, Special Edition AWPPW Tenth Anniversary, p. 24.  Organizing  The constitution mandates that the executive board of the association must create an organizing plan to \\"maintain the strength of this organization\\". The president of the association has the ability to hire one or more organizer. The local area representatives can also be utilized to do organizing work.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this is due both to \\"the many skilled workers in both production and maintenance occupations\\" and to an unusually high union density: at the time of the 1982 survey, 96% of pulp and paper production workers were employed by union mills.David Larson. \\"Wages in the paper industries among highest in manufacturing.\\" Monthly Labor Review (March 1984). p. 52.

She played for the University of Michigan from 1979‚Äì1982 and is the school's second all-time scoring leader with 2,076 points. She also set the Big Ten Conference single- game scoring record with 45 points in 1982. In 1996, Dietz became the first women's basketball player inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor. And in 2009, she was inducted into the Academic All-America Hall of Fame. Basketball player Diane Dietz began her basketball career at Farmington Hills Mercy High School. With teammates Katie McNamara and Lynn Yadach, Dietz led the Mercy Marlins to four straight state finals including an undefeated season and 1977 Class A Michigan state championship. While attending Mercy, Dietz earned a 3.6 grade point average and won varsity letters in basketball, volleyball and softball all four years. As a senior, she earned all-state honors in all three sports. Dietz later recalled, \\"I had a lot of diverse interests in high school. Everybody remembers basketball, but I enjoyed tennis and golf. I loved music, the choir and the theater. I really remember liking school.\\" After graduating from Mercy, Dietz enrolled at the University of Michigan where she played basketball from 1979 to 1982 and became the school's all-time leading scorer with 2,076 career points. No other women's basketball player at Michigan surpassed the 2,000 point mark in career points until Katelynn Flaherty finished with 2,2776 career points in 2018. On February 27, 1982, Dietz set a Big Ten Conference single-game scoring record with 45 points against the University of Illinois. That record stood for 22 years until Penn State guard Kelly Mazzante scored 49 points in a game in 2004. As a senior, Dietz was among the first women athletes to receive the Big Ten Medal of Honor, awarded to student athletes for outstanding academic and athletic achievement. Business career After graduating from Michigan, Dietz received a juris doctorate degree from Thomas M. Cooley Law School in Lansing, Michigan. She began her professional career as a lawyer working for law firms Paskin, Nagi & Baxter P.C. in Troy, Michigan, and Howard & Howard Attorneys, P.C., in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. After leaving the private practice of law, Dietz worked for many years in the cable television industry. She began in the business as Vice President of Corporate and Legal Affairs for Continental Cablevision's Midwest Region. She joined Comcast Corporation in 1996. At Comcast, she served as the Vice President of Corporate Affairs for the Midwest Division. In 2005, Dietz relocated to Philadelphia upon being promoted to a position as Comcast's Senior Director of Public Affairs and Vice President of The Comcast Foundation. Dietz has also served as a board member for the Detroit Metro Convention and Visitors Bureau, United Way of Southeast Pennsylvania, Michigan Cable & Telecommunications Association, and the University of Michigan Alumni Association. In October 2008, Dietz was named chief marketing officer for Cranbrook Educational Community, a collection of private schools and educational instiutitions in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. In her position at Cranbrook, Dietz oversees marketing and communication efforts, community outreach and government relations. In March 2010, she was hired as the Big Ten Conference Chief Communications Officer. Honors and awards In 1995, Dietz was the recipient of the University of Michigan's Gerald R. Ford Scholar-Athlete Award. She was the fifth person to receive the awarded, granted to former Michigan athletes who have made extraordinary contributions in their post-collegiate careers. In 1996, she was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor. She was the first women's basketball player inducted into the Hall, joining the ranks of Fielding H. Yost, Tom Harmon, Cazzie Russell, Rudy Tomjanovich and Gerald R. Ford. While at the University of Michigan, Dietz was a three-time recipient of CoSIDA Academic All-America honors in 1980 (second team),1981 (first team) and 1982 (first team). In May 2009, Dietz was one of five former NCAA student athletes inducted into the Academic All-America Hall of Fame as part of the 2009 induction class.

Its last assignment was with the Air Defense Weapons Center at Perrin Air Force Base, Texas, where it was discontinued in 1971. The wing was organized in 1962 when Air Defense Command (ADC) assumed the interceptor pilot training mission from Air Training Command (ATC). The 4780th assumed the personnel, equipment, and mission of ATC's 3555th Flying Training Wing, which was simultaneously discontinued. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, the wing maintained aircraft on alert in Texas and Florida.

Most interceptor pilots trained at Perrin, however, were later assigned to ADC. In March 1962, ADC decided it wanted to merge Perrin Air Force Base's interceptor school with other air defense resources. ADC acquired Perrin from ATC on 1 July 1962 and with it the 3555th Wing and its three Flying Training Squadrons.Cornett & Johnson, p. 64Cornett & Johnson, p. 175 On that date, ADC discontinued the 3555th Wing and formed the 4780th Air Defense Wing (Training) with the 3555th's personnel and equipment.Cornett & Johnson, p. 68 In addition to its operational squadrons, the wing was assigned a number of support and maintenance organizations to fulfill its role as USAF host organization for Perrin. The 4780th trained qualified pilots to operate the Convair F-102 Delta Dagger and Convair F-106 Delta Dart interceptor aircraft as combat weapons. In addition, it conducted lead-in training with the F-102 for F-106 Delta Dart and Convair B-58 Hustler. From 1962 to 1971 Perrin had the largest fleet of F-102 Delta Daggers in the US Air Force. Perrin was the only F-102 training base within ADC.

Iowa State has graduated 6,400 veterinarians and is one of the largest veterinary research facilities in the nation.  History  Officially formed in 1879, Iowa State College of Veterinary Medicine can trace its history back to the school's founding in 1858, when state legislator's specified that veterinary studies would be included in the subjects of instruction. Seniors of ISU's first graduating class in 1872, received instruction in veterinary science, but it was not until 1879 that degrees were offered in that subject. The ISU veterinary school was the first state veterinary college in the United States. Other private veterinary colleges all closed by the 1920s, leaving ISU as the oldest veterinary college still in operation in the United States. Originally, the degree programs offered were only two-year programs, but with expanded coursework, the program was extended to three years in 1887 and to four years by 1903 (making Iowa State the nation‚Äôs first four-year veterinary school). In 1885, veterinary classes were held in the \\"Sanitary Building,\\" which was located where the current ISU Memorial Union now stands. In 1893 the veterinary department was moved to the \\"Old Agricultural Hall\\" or \\"Botany Hall\\", today known as Catt Hall. By 1912, overcrowding became an issue, with state appropriation, the \\"Vet Quadrangle\\" (currently known as Lagomarcino Hall) was built on the north side of campus. The Quadrangle consisted of four buildings connected by corridors arranged around the central courtyard. A fifth building was than constructed further north and the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory was completed in 1956. As the college continued to grow, the faculty became dissatisfied with the old name for the college, the \\"Division of Veterinary Medicine\\". In a 1933 report, the Dean of Veterinary Medicine, Charles Henry Stange commented: > \\"the advisability of changing the Division of Veterinary Medicine to > \\"College of Veterinary Medicine\\" has been discussed for years.... Apparently > we have a \\"College of Veterinary Medicine\\" at Iowa State in fact but not in > name...It is our earnest hope that this correction be made at an early > date.\\" To rename the college, it required making the other divisions within Iowa State college into separate colleges also. On July 4, 1959, the change was finally made and since the \\"Division of Veterinary Medicine\\" is now called the \\"College of Veterinary Medicine.\\" The Quadrangle was the veterinary school's primarily buildings for 64 years until overcrowding once again became an issue. Plans were developed for a new facility on a tract of land adjacent to the Veterinary Medical Research Institute just north of Highway 30. The new facility was completed in 1976 at a cost of just over $25 million. Dedication ceremonies were held in the fall in which President Gerald Ford, among other state and national dignitaries, attended.  Facilities  Built in 1976, VET MED is the largest academic building at Iowa State University, with over 347,000 square-feet. A new veterinary medical center (completed 2008), built onto the south-east side of the building, adds another onto a massive veterinary medical center & teaching facility. Although it only has two floors, ISU VET MED building has more square-footage than the second tallest building in the state, the 35 floor Ruan Center in Des Moines.

He is associated with Tonalism and the American Barbizon school. Although most of his career was spent in California, he started out in New York, made two extended study trips to Europe, and had a studio in Boston in 1871-72 and one in New York in 1880. Early life Keith was born in Oldmeldrum, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, where he was raised at first by his grandparents, his father having died months before he was born. William claimed to have been a direct descendant of the noble Clan Keith. He emigrated with his mother and sisters to the United States in 1850. They settled in New York City, where he attended school for several years and became an apprentice wood engraver in 1856. He was hired to do illustrations for Harper's Magazine. In 1858 he visited Scotland and England and briefly worked for the London Daily News. He was then offered an opportunity in San Francisco and sailed there in May 1859.Alfred C Harrison, Jr., \\"The Art of William Keith,\\" in William Keith: The Saint Mary's College Collection (1988, OCLC 36726133), reprinted in The Comprehensive Keith (2011, ). California and Europe Upon Keith's arrival in San Francisco the job he had hoped for did not materialize, so he set up his own engraving business. He formed a partnership with Harrison Eastman in 1862 and with Durbin Van Vleck in 1864. He first studied painting with Samuel Marsden Brookes in 1863, and may have taken watercolor instruction from Elizabeth Emerson, whom he married in 1864.Taos and Santa Fe Painters: William Keith . Retrieved 9 September 2010. He first exhibited his watercolors in 1866, and they were praised by critics. His subject matter already included views of Yosemite and other High Sierra locations. By 1868 he had begun painting in oils. That year Keith was able to end his engraving career and pursue painting full-time when he received a commission from the Oregon Navigation and Railroad Company to paint scenes of the Pacific Northwest. The Keiths went to D√ºsseldorf, Germany, in 1869-71, following in the footsteps of American artists such as Albert Bierstadt and Worthington Whittredge. While there, Keith studied under Albert Flamm, but also wrote enthusiastically in letters about the free, \\"suggestive\\" brushwork of Andreas Achenbach. He also spent time in Paris, where he admired both the old masters and the Barbizon school painters. Upon his return to the United States, he shared a studio in Boston with William Hahn from 1871 to 1872. Friendship with John Muir Keith then returned to California, and traveled to Yosemite Valley with a letter of introduction to John Muir. The two men became deep friends for the next 38 years. Both had been born in Scotland the same year, and they shared a love for the mountains of California. James Mitchell Clarke described their friendship as one \\"in which deep affection and admiration were expressed through a kind of verbal boxing, counter-jibe answering jibe, counter-insult responding to insult.\\" \\"Epic\\" paintings of the High Sierra, 1870s During the 1870s Keith painted a number of six- by ten-foot panoramas, including Kings River Canyon (Oakland Museum, originally owned by Gov. Leland Stanford) and \\"California Alps\\" (Mission Inn, Riverside). These competed with paintings of similar size and subject matter by Albert Bierstadt and Thomas Hill. The 1880s Keith's wife Elizabeth died in 1882. He turned for comfort to a friend, the Swedenborgian minister Joseph Worcester, who ultimately had a strong influence on Keith's approach to landscape painting. In 1883 Keith married Mary McHenry, who was the first female graduate of Hastings Law School and a leading suffragette. For their honeymoon, they went on a painting tour of the old California missions. A few months later they traveled to the East Coast and then to Munich, where Keith was determined to learn figure and portrait painting. He primarily worked on his own, occasionally receiving criticism from artists including Carl von Marr and J. Frank Currier. They returned to San Francisco in mid 1885. Through Joseph Worcester, Keith met the architect Daniel Burnham in Chicago while en route to Europe. Burnham became an important patron and agent, showing and selling Keith paintings to collectors in the Chicago area. In 1886 the Keiths moved into a custom-built house in Berkeley, from where he would commute to his studio in San Francisco each day. That year Keith also cruised Alaska's Inland Passage and sketched some of its glaciers. Keith painted some portraits on commission and also supplemented his income by giving painting lessons, mostly to women.Adams, Elaine. \\"William Keith (1838-1911): Seeking the Unseen Spiritual Sense in Nature.\\" California Art Club Newsletter, Winter 2011, 1-10. Accessed January 24, 2013. Among his pupils was the miniaturist Rosa Hooper. In 1888 Keith traveled north with Muir, visiting Mount Shasta and Mount Rainier to create illustrations for Muir's Picturesque California. Muir encouraged Keith to depict mountain scenery realistically, but as Keith's artistic sense had matured, he felt free to depart from geologic reality, placing an imagined glacier or a river in a scene to enhance the beauty of the painting. The two friends argued frequently about such artistic issues. It was said that Muir said, \\"You never saw a sunrise like that, Keith. Why in the deuce don't you imitate nature?' William would goad Muir by responding, 'Look here now, John, if you'll go out early tomorrow morning and look toward the East you'll see nature imitating my sunrise.\\". Keith was part of a group of friends of John Muir who met in San Francisco starting in 1889 to support the establishment of Yosemite National Park. This group went on to encourage Muir to establish an association to protect the Sierra Nevada. In 1892, this plan was realized when the Sierra Club was founded.  Later years  Bust of Keith in 1904 by Gertrude Boyle From the late 1880s on, Keith painted primarily in a subjective vein in which his emotional and spiritual reactions to the landscape were more important than topographical facts. He painted many woodland views that resembled those of Th√©odore Rousseau and other Barbizon painters, as well as the American painter George Inness. Inness came to visit the San Francisco Bay Area in 1891. He and Keith painted together, and Keith felt he was learning a lot and regaining an enthusiasm for painting that he had begun to lose. Inness's fame and enthusiasm for Keith's work gave a substantial boost to sales of Keith's paintings. Keith's San Francisco studio was destroyed as a result of the fires following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which resulted in the loss of many paintings, with some accounts placing the number at several thousand. Keith, who was working primarily from his Berkeley studio-home, promised to replace all of the lost paintings despite his declining health. He remained a revered but reclusive figure in the large Berkeley art colony and refused to participate in the founding of the Berkeley Art Association in 1907. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website (http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/10aa/10aa557.htm). He consistently contributed paintings to the colony's exhibitions between 1906 and 1911. In the summer of 1906 he briefly appeared in public to support Harry W. Seawell, a drawing instructor at the University of California, in what became an embarrassing scandal. When the University forbade Seawell from using nude models in his life classes, Keith published a blunt declaration of support in the local press, proclaiming that the nude model is \\"essential to real art.\\" Keith did not entirely abandon realistic depictions of mountain scenery. In October 1907, accompanied by Muir, Keith visited and painted the Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park, soon to be dammed to create a reservoir to provide water and power for San Francisco. Linnie Marsh Wolfe wrote that Keith \\"left behind all his synthetics of the last twenty-five years and humbly, reverently portrayed what he saw, as objectively as in the seventies when Muir first infused into him his own spirit and vision.\\" Keith expressed great annoyance with the many high-quality forgeries of his work on the San Francisco market. Death Keith died in his home at 2207 Atherton Street in Berkeley, California in 1911. He is buried in plot 14b at Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland.

He founded one of the first Yiddish communities in America and the first Chassidus synagogue in Williamsburg, New York.Jonah Landau, \\"The First Yiddish Communities in America\\", Der Yid, November 9, 1979, p.15 His children, later, utilized the synagogue in order to save other Jews in Europe from the Holocaust by providing them with a means of immigration to the US by hiring them as a rabbi and firing them soon afterwards.Alan Dershowitz, _Chutzpah_ , 1992, Chapter 1  Biography  As was the custom with many new immigrants at that time, Zecharia left Europe in 1888, arriving in Castle Garden (now a museum at the foot of Battery Park in Manhattan). This gave him an opportunity to establish himself in the ‚Äúnew land.‚Äù In 1891, when he felt that he could support his family, he sent for his wife, Lea, n√©e Bander, (1860-1942) and their four children, Leib (Louis), Samuel, Solie, and Scheindel. The family considered itself Ropshitz Hasidim. The earliest confirmed family history is the marriage of Yechezkiel Derschowitz to Chana Rivka, some time before 1840, in the district of Tarnow (Galicia). Their oldest child was Zecharja. After arrival in the United States, three more children were born to Zecharja and Lea: Gussie, Hymie and Rosie. Of Zecharja‚Äôs six known siblings, at least five immigrated to the United States. Four of them established families in the New York area, and the children of the fifth (Gussie Korn) settled in the Philadelphia area. At the time of the 1900 census, the family of \\"Solomon\\" Dershowitz ((misspelled on the census papers) should be \\"Zecharja\\"; some of the ages are also incorrect) and wife Lena (Lea), aged 50, is listed as living at 127 Goerck Street, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, with their seven children: Louis, age 18; Solomon, 14; Samuel, 13; Sadie, 12; Hyman, 8; Gussie, 6; and Rosie, 4. On August 4, 1902, after they moved from Goerck Street nearby to 61 Lewis Street, Zecharja was granted American citizenship. His occupation was listed as tailor, which meant he worked in a sweatshop in the garment district. One of his employers was the Triangle Shirt Factory, scene of the notorious Triangle Fire. His life was spared because, as a Sabbath observer he had not come to work on that fateful day. Zecharja became President of the 100 Cannon Street Burial Society. Under his jurisdiction, burial grounds were purchased in Mt. Hebron Cemetery in Queens. Zecharja and his four sons: Leibish (louis), Shmeil, Shulem, and Yechezkel have their names engraved on the right door post of the Synagogue cemetery plot. These Manhattan streets don‚Äôt exist anymore, having been overtaken by the needs of the subsequently built Williamsburg Bridge in 1903, and other neighborhood projects. Many East Side families including that of Zecharja, subsequently moved to Williamsburg. There, he established the family synagogue on Roebling Street (named after the builder of the Williamsburg Bridge). Eventually, the synagogue moved to its permanent address at 94 South 10th Street. The deed to the building stated that one side of the property was the border between the City of Brooklyn and the Town of Williamsburg. He and two of his sons, Louis and Sam were very active in the Board of Directors of Yeshivah Torah Vodaath, which Louis had established with Binyomin Wilhelm in 1918. Zecharja converted the basement apartment into the family synagogue.To make sure that the family could support itself without working on the Sabbath, the synagogue was also used as a workshop. He opened his own factory by purchasing a sewing machine and a machine that put clamps on change-purses. These were set up in an unused fireplace in the corner of the Ladies‚Äô Section of the synagogue. All three of his daughters eventually lived with their families in the three-family home. After Zecharja passed away, Lea continued to live there with the Fendel family above the shul. Zecharja had opened a hole in the floor of his apartment, which was right above the reading table of the synagogue, and covered it with a grate and a carpet. The grate was right under the dining room table. When the ladies of the family wanted to pray with the men, they had the choice of going down to the Ladies‚Äô Section, or remaining in the Fendel dining room and uncovering the grate in the floor. In an advertisement in the Yiddish press, placed by Yeshivah Torah Vodaath when Zecharja died, he was called a Hassid, businessman and one who studied and taught Torah all his life. They also stated that he had raised large sums of money for charity. He was known as the ‚Äútzaddik of Williamsburg.‚Äù The saga of Lea and Zecharja , reflected and influenced the next hundred years in the history of the American Jewish Community. Prof. Alan Dershowitz, of Harvard University fame, is a son of Harry, grandson of Louis, and great grandson of Zecharja.Prof. Zecharia Dor- Shav, son of Louis His son Louis Dershowitz, along with his son's friend Binyomin Wilhelm, were the two founders of the second Yeshiva in Brooklyn, Yeshiva Torah VodaathStory of a Century (the first Yeshiva being Tifereth Bachurim, which became Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin in 1912, but did not change its name legally until January 1919).

History The Alva National Bank was established in 1899. Officers of Alva National Bank in 1907 were George A. Harbaugh president, and J.H. Schaefer, vice president. During the years between 1907 and 1913, the Alva Security Bank purchased Alva National Bank with Harbaugh as bank president. In August 1913, G.A. Harbaugh, E. Anderson, T.F. Fennessey and H.E. Noble, owners of Alva Security, organized a new banking institution under the name Central State Bank. The newly named bank continued to operate at the location of the former Alva Security Bank. Central State Bank was considered a \\"state bank,\\" the deposits were insured by the Depositors Guaranty of the State of Oklahoma. On October 31, 1917, Central State Bank absorbed the Woods County Union Bank. Harbaugh and George Meade had controlling stocks of the Union Bank at that time. In 1919, W.D. Myers purchased a large interest in the bank, becoming the President, a role he held until his death in 1951. In 1951, Gertrude Myers became chairman of the board and CEO of the bank, and her brother, W.D. Myers, Jr., became President. W.D. served as President until his death in 1987. William R. Buckles was elected President of the bank, and was named CEO following Gertrude's death. At the time of Gertrude's death, L.W. became Chairman of the Board and served until his death.

The group was first activated at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia, but moved to Tyndall when ADC assumed the interceptor aircraft crew training mission from Air Training Command. In 1963, its mission was absorbed directly to its parent wing, which was also located at Tyndall. History The 4756th Air Defense Group was organized at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia in February 1955 as a tenant of Air Training Command's 3550th Air Base Group, an element of the 3550th Combat Crew Training Wing, which trained interceptor pilots, in order to improve Air Defense Command's (ADC) rocketry proficiency program.Mueller, pp. 423, 425Cornett & Johnson, p.90 The group was assigned two squadrons, the 4756th Air Defense Squadron (Weapons), which was already stationed at Moody and assigned directly to the 4750th Air Defense Wing,Cornett & Johnson, p.106 and the 4757th Air Defense Squadron (Interceptor Weapons School), which was organized at Tyndall Air Force Base in 1957. At Moody, the group trained aircrew and aircraft controllers and evaluated ADC tactical units. The group and the 4756th squadron moved to Tyndall when ADC assumed the crew training mission for ADC's interceptor crews from Air Training Command and Moody became a pilot training base.Mueller, p. 425Mueller, p. 564 In April 1961, the group participated in Operation Southern Tip, deploying six Convair F-102 Delta Dagger aircraft to Homestead AFB, Florida in a two-week test of a contingency plan to augment air defense forces in Southern Florida in face of the potential threat from an unfriendly Cuba. Two of the F-102s were maintained on armed five-minute alert status. However, on 17 April the Bay of Pigs Invasion occurred, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff directed that Southern Tip continue indefinitely. However, the group's contribution to this mission was reduced to three aircraft in mid May because of the impact of the extended deployment on its training and testing mission. The 482d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron then assumed the mission from the group.McMullen, pp. 3‚Äì4 On 15 November 1962, the 4756th Air Defense Squadron was redesignated the 4756th Combat Crew Training Squadron.
