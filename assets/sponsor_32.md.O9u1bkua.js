Mobiyina Oshoffa is the first son of the Pastor Founder (Late Reverend Prophet Samuel Bilewou Joseph Oshoffa) and he is the pastor of the major faction of Celestial Church of Christ, worldwide. Oshoffa was born in 1948 at Kpave, French Dahomey (now Benin), and he has been part of the choir at Port Novo church before his migration to France. As instructed by his father, only him and First Shadrach hospital management knew about the whereabouts of the founder of the church for over twenty-four hours following the accident of September 1985. He was therefore in position to give some account of the prophet's final moments.

The use of du (cognate with English thou, French tu, and German du) replaced an intricate former system where people chiefly addressed each other in third person, with or without a preceding Mr./Mrs./Ms. (herr, fru or fr√∂ken) before the title, often omitting both surname and given name. Less respectfully, people could be addressed with Mr./Mrs./Ms. plus surname, or in a family setting, alternatively even less respectfully, with the plain name or third person pronoun han (\\"he\\") or hon (she). Before du-reformen, it was considered impolite to address most people without an appropriate title, although a subordinate could be addressed by name, or less respectfully as Ni or han/hon. The informal du had been used for addressing children, siblings, close friends and possibly for cousins, but hardly for elder relatives. Members of Free churches, Good Templars and the like considered each other as siblings, and may well have used Du in that setting. With exceptions in dialectal usage, the second-person plural pronoun Ni had long been considered degrading when used to address a single person. However, the usage varied between different parts of the country, and as well by social context, both before and after the reform. Finland Swedish has undergone a similar development, but slower and slightly less due to influence of the somewhat more conservative usage in Finnish. In particular, the use of second-person plural (Ni) to address an unknown person is considered respectful or neutral rather than degrading. History In the Swedish of Sweden, the polite ni was known from earlier epochs, but had come to be considered careless, bullying or rude; instead, an intricate system had evolved in order to prudently step around pronouns almost altogether. *Addressing in third person singular adding title and surname was considered proper and respectful in most cases. But with persons of higher standing, say a doctor, count or managing director, there arose the question when to use that title only and when to precede it with a herr ('mister' or, in this context, 'sir'); not doubling such titles could be very rude unless you were on somewhat informal terms. A woman, married to a husband with a specific title in a male-dominated profession, was addressed using the feminine form of her husband's title as a matter of course. This created its own set of problems as more and more women acquired professional titles of their own, who in general are addressed with the male form (such as kapten (captain)), as the feminine form (kaptenskan) questions their competence. Female-dominated professions however use feminine forms for women, such as sjuksk√∂terska (nurse) or l√§rarinnan (teacher). *If two persons were somewhat acquainted and not too far apart in rank and age, they could then drop the name and use the title only. *Surname without title was considered proper between friends not too close and for a superior to his subordinate or someone of similar rank. That was also customary in male brotherhoods like between students. *Below that on the social scale, both among peers and from above, was the third person singular pronoun only (han 'he', hon 'she'). That was more usual in the countryside; considered rustic by \\"educated\\" people, but fitting towards e.g. an old fisher- or woodman. *Simple folks of venerable age could be properly addressed father/mother/aunt plus Christian name (far/mor/moster), both by their own, by other villagers and by superiors. A farmwife could be addressed as mor even if young; otherwise, one had to make do with the nearest-fitting other way of addressing. *A master could address his servant, and a farmer his farmhand, by Christian name in the third person; that was more common between females, as the female world was generally more confined, but more restricted between the sexes. A subordinate, in each case, answered by using the superior's title or, in private, the informal term for his rank (e.g. herrn, patron). *The proper kinship term plus Christian name, still never alternating with pronoun, was proper in private to nearer relatives. The second person singular du was used only to and between children, within a married couple, between lovers or to a more or less voluntary mistress of lower standing, and between friends who had toasted for brotherhood with each other ('toasted for thou' in a \\"du-sk√•l\\" as it was known)‚Äîof course initiated by the elder or higher-ranked party. Again, the custom could be slightly more relaxed among women‚Äîat least the toast itself was usually dispensed with. Otherwise, du could be used to insult a tramp or the like. Parts of this system began to erode around the Second World War or so, but the essentials held up into the late 1960s. In the province of Dalarna, however, and in a some other remote places with few upper-class people, the du/ni distinction had remained one of number only; although children addressed their parents with Father/Mother (Far/Mor) rather than a grammatically logical du. In other remote places, the Ni survived in its older form I (cognate with 'ye') as both the second person plural pronoun and the polite address to singular elders, including one's parents, unless classified with \\"better people\\". In standard Swedish, that form had become archaic and solemn well before the 20th century. (I is capitalized to avoid confusion with a common homograph, the preposition i ('in'), rather than of respect.) As the twentieth century progressed, this circumlocutive system of addressing, with its innumerable ambiguities and opportunities for unintentional offence, was increasingly felt as a nuisance. An early way out was to carry the circumlocutions one degree further‚Äîfinding impersonal ways of saying what was needful, avoiding both personal pronoun and title (F√•r det lov att vara en kopp kaffe?, approximately 'Might it be a cup of coffee?'; S√• det √§r till att resa?, approximately 'So, it is about travelling?'), often using the passive voice. However, that soon proved of little avail. For one thing, you still had to address the person you talked with directly from time to time in the conversation, otherwise you would really have sounded impolite‚Äîand over time, it became de rigueur to do so more and more often, until it was a system with both longish titles used instead of personal pronouns and impersonal circumlocutions; and for another, the impersonal constructions soon acquired their own gradations, to be observant upon‚Äîe.g., that in the second example above being perceived as more and more rustic, ending up rude. Reform The beginning of du-reformen is associated with Bror Rexed, the then head of the National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen), who in his welcome speech to the staff in 1967 announced that he would address everyone as du, increasing the effects of the reform and bringing it to a more frequent use. The actual reform had started earlier, including the amended language in the major newspaper Dagens Nyheter. It was seen as a reform in a democratic and egalitarian direction. First, authorities and influential circles had tried rehabilitating the Ni in a so-called \\"ni-reform\\". But most people could not bring themselves to feel civil using that. Then, in a process dubbed the \\"du reform\\", the system rapidly broke down and the informal du became the accepted way of addressing any one person except royalty. The language used for addressing members of the Swedish Royal Family also changed, but third person addressing still dominates in official settings. The universal ers majest√§t ('Your Majesty'), etc. became rare, possibly used on formal occasions, and is replaced by konungen or kungen (\\"the King\\"), kronprinsessan (\\"the Crown Princess\\"), etc. In parallel with du-reformen, the use of titles was further reduced. In many other countries, professional titles rather than names are used to attract someone‚Äôs attention, while this is not usually the case in Sweden. Only slightly less accepted is the use of Christian name also when addressing an acquaintance or colleague (Daniel, Pia, etc.). Since about 1990, it has become somewhat more common for retail and restaurant staff to address customers as ni (second-person plural), although this was not formerly considered formal language.Nationalencyklopedin . In the Riksdag, where debate is conducted via the Speaker, titles are frequently used, even though politicians are most often addressed as du in other contexts. In order to \\"alleviate the intrusion\\" in writing, e.g. in letters or in advertisement, the Du can be capitalized. That usage was most widespread in the early days of universal du address; it has become slightly more common again simultaneously with the partial Ni revival.

The first letter did not change from \\"P\\" to \\"B\\", which was common in the late Middle Ages. The word \\"Perg\\" or later \\"Berg\\" means mountain, so the name describes someone, who lived on a mountain. Mostly that persons were related to the government, or they were the governor of their region one millennium ago. Someone in this position was the lord of the mountain. In old German language that would be the \\"Herr vom Perg\\" or the \\"Pergherr\\", which is the origin of \\"Perger\\". The name comes quite likely from the German-speaking part of the Alps, which is Austria (with its languages Burgenland Croatian, Slovene, Hungarian, Czech, Slovak, and Romani), Germany (Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg), South Tyrol in Italy (with its languages German, Italian, and Ladin), and Switzerland (with its languages German, French, Italian, and Romansh), but it could be originated everywhere in the German language area, where a hill or a mountain was populated. In comparison to the name \\"Berger\\" it is rather rare. A similar even rarer name with the same meaning is \\"Pergher\\" or \\"Bergher\\", still displaying the \\"h\\". The reason for the varying spellings is the development of the German language in different regions of the German language area and its regions of language transitions in the last thousand years. *Andreas Paolo Perger (born 1970), Austrian/ German/ Italian contemporary guitarist, improviser, and composer *Denis Perger (born 1993), Slovenian footballer ","title":"Perger"},{"id":"32060591","text":"Disztl is a Hungarian surname.

The task is named for two notable experiments published in the 1950s in which it was first documented, the first by John Brown and the second by husband and wife team Lloyd and Margaret Peterson. The task aims to test the quantity of objects that can be held in working memory while preventing participants from using mnemonics or other memory techniques separate from the working memory to increase recall capacity. In the experiment, participants view a sequence of three-letter constructs called trigrams, and are asked to perform simple algebraic computations such as counting backwards by 3s from 999 between each trigram. A trigram consists of 3 non-morphemic letters, the importance of which is that each letter represents a different independent object to be stored in working memory; therefore, trigrams avoid letter combinations that depict words or common acronyms. The algebraic computations are administered between trigrams to assure the participant isn't using mnemonic strategies to chunk the letters into a single object. Variants of the Brown‚ÄìPeterson task are still used today, all with the same fundamental concept of administering items for the participant to remember whilst preventing the usage of additional cognitive resources to augment working memory.  Procedure  The Brown‚ÄìPeterson task refers to two studies published in the late 1950s that used similar procedures, one in 1958 by John Brown and a second in 1959 by Lloyd and Margaret Peterson. The first experiment involved 24 psychology students at Indiana University at the time. The examiner proceeded by spelling a random three-letter nonsense syllable and then enunciating immediately afterwards a random three-digit number. The subject would then count backwards by some assigned number, either three or four, from the enunciated number. After a set interval, a light signal was flashed to prompt the subject to cease verbally counting and to recall the random, three-letter nonsense syllable. The time interval between the enunciation by the examiner of the nonsense syllable (exposure to the syllable) and the signal prompt to the participant was known as the recall interval; the time interval between the signal prompt and the enunciation of the third letter by the participant was known as a latency. In order to maintain reproducibility of results, each participant was tested eight times using each recall interval, which were 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 seconds. In addition, each nonsense syllable appeared an equal number of times; the trials were split evenly in terms of counting by either three or four. No successive items contained the same letters, and the time between signal for recall and the next trial was always 15 seconds. In addition, the examiner and participant were instructed to enunciate in rhythm with a 120 BPM metronome, such that two letters or numbers were spoken per second. The second experiment involved 48 psychology students from Indiana University. The exact procedure from the first experiment was followed for 24 of the students, but the other 24 were asked to repeat the stimulus (i.e., the nonsense syllable) aloud until the examiner stated the three-digit number. Therefore, the only difference between the two experiments was that there was a variable gap between the examiner's enunciation of the stimulus and the number, during which maintenance rehearsal took place. The inspiration behind this experiment was Brown's disbelief that repetition would strengthen the 'memory trace'. The purpose of the second experiment was basically to prove or disprove this notion. However, the analysis of the study concluded that forgetting was found to progress at differential rates dependent upon the amount of rehearsal that took place'.  Interference  There are two types of interference: Retroactive interference: This type of interference occurs when new information disrupts the recall of old information. Proactive interference: This type of interference occurs when old information disrupts the recall of new information. Proactive interference affects participant performance in the Brown‚ÄìPeterson task. The first time the students participate in the task, they show little loss of information. However, after multiple trials, the task becomes increasingly challenging when letters from the early trials are confused with letters in the current trial. Fortunately, proactive interference can be hindered if the information to be remembered is changed to a different type of information. For example, in the Brown‚ÄìPeterson task there appeared to be little proactive interference when the participants switched from recalling letters to recalling numbers.  Rehearsal  A key aspect of the Brown‚ÄìPeterson task is the fact that it blocks rehearsal, which is used to better recall items in short-term memory. Rehearsal is the concept of directing attention to material that was just learned. This way, it can lengthen the duration of one's short-term memory capacity. In order to accurately calculate the duration of short-term memory using the Brown‚ÄìPeterson task, such a method must be blocked so as not to falsely increase an unaltered duration. There are two different types of rehearsal: Maintenance rehearsal: This method of rehearsal uses repetition of the items in memory. It is essentially \\"saying something repeatedly in order to keep it in mind\\". An example could be attempting to memorize a shopping list while out shopping for groceries. Instead of remembering to take the list out to the store, the shopper could leave it at home and proceed to repeat each word. As useful as this type of rehearsal may seem, it does not guarantee the ability to recall what was memorized after it is no longer rehearsed Elaborative rehearsal: This type of rehearsal is also known as creative rehearsal. Elaborative rehearsal uses creativity to increase capacity of short-term memory and accurately recall items. Creating associations and connections between something significant to the person memorizing and the item(s) to be memorized is one example of elaborative rehearsal. Another example is the use of mnemonic devices, which are a creative way to mentally arrange the items to be memorized. Three key words in rehearsal are Association, Location, and Imagination. Association is an important factor in rehearsal, as it is the part of elaborative rehearsal where people make connections with the items and things significant to them. This helps increase capacity of short-term memory as they are recalling items with the help of something meaningful to them. Location is another factor, as incorporating location into what they are trying to memorize may be another association to a significant location in particular, thus making the item much easier to recall. Finally, imagination is essentially the creativity of elaborative rehearsal. It combines creativity with the items to recall in such a way that makes them easiest to recall.

The Swedish Reformation meant the break with the Roman Catholic Church, and the foundation of the Swedish Church. It is considered to be the ending point of the Swedish Middle Ages. The Reformation made Sweden a Protestant country. The Swedish Reformation also included Finland, which formed an integral part of Sweden at the time. History The reformation was initiated for a number of reasons. Among these were an impractical organisation, a perceived stagnation within the Catholic Church, a will toward independence from Rome, the financial needs of the state, as well as new ideas. =1526‚Äì1536= Dispute between Olaus Petri and Peder Galle In 1523, King Gustav I of Sweden met the reformer Laurentius Andreae and was influenced by Protestantism, and the following year, the king broke official contacts with Rome. Laurentius Andreae introduced the king to the reformer priest Olaus Petri, who was made preacher in Storkyrkan in Stockholm. In 1525, the royal priest Olaus Petri married, effectively demonstrating the king's consent to the abolition of the celibacy of the priesthood, and providing a breach with the Catholic church's ban of marriage of priests.Carlquist, Gunnar, red (1937). Svensk uppslagsbok. Bd 20. Malm√∂: Svensk Uppslagsbok AB. sid. 669 In 1526, the New Testament was published in the Swedish language. In the winter of 1526, the king offered to arrange a colloquy between Olaus Petri and Catholic professor Peder Galle. Galle refused, stating church matters were not open to discussion. At the Riksdag of V√§ster√•s in 1527, referred to as the \\"Reformation Riksdag\\", the Estates agreed to a number of demands toward reformation: 1) to give the king mandate to confiscate clerical assets: 2) that all church offices were henceforth to be illegal without royal consent, in effect placing the church under royal control: 3) that the clergy were to be subjected to secular law, and finally: 4) that only the words of the Bible were to be taught in sermons in churches and schools (in effect removing all Catholic church doctrines). The Riksdag of V√§ster√•s was followed by the Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden, in which the economic demand of the monarch was met: the assets of the Catholic church was confiscated, eradicating church economic independence of the crown, thus making the clergy economically dependent of the crown.Reduktion, hist., 6. Gustaf Vasas reduktion fr√•n kyrkan i Nordisk familjebok (andra upplagan, 1915) In parallel with a ban from accepting new novices, and a ban for the convents to prevent their existing members from leaving, this act indirectly resulted in the Suppression of Monasteries, which lost their economic foundations.Reduktion, hist., 6. Gustaf Vasas reduktion fr√•n kyrkan i Nordisk familjebok (andra upplagan, 1915) The economic reform was followed by the fulfilling of the theological demands through the √ñrebro Synod of 1529, in which Catholic rituals such as the veneration of saints and pilgrimages was discouraged (though not outright banned) and described as no longer a part of religious practice by the church, and the sermons of priests and monks where subjected to control of the crown (rather than the Papal church) to ensure that they were founded only on the words of the Bible (rather than doctrines of the Catholic church), and a process toward reform in religious practice was thereby initiated.Carl Alfred Cornelius: Svenska kyrkans historia efter reformationen, f√∂rra delen (1520-1693), 1886-87 The same year, a handbook in the Swedish language was published describing the correct way of performing baptism, weddings, funerals and other religious rituals. In 1530, the king opened a rift with Rome when he appointed Laurentius Petri Archbishop of Uppsala without Papal consent or confirmation. The religious tensions resulted in the Westrogothian rebellion of the nobility and the Dalecarlian rebellions of the peasantry during the 1520s and 1530s, the latter attempting to depose the king in favor of the purported son of Christina Gyllenstierna. =1536‚Äì1560= The army of Gustav Vasa on its way to defeat Nils Dacke during the Dacke War, caused partially in opposition to the Reformation. Until 1536, the Swedish Reformation was in essence characterized as Reform Catholicism. The final break between Sweden and Rome occurred with the abolition of the Canon law in Sweden in 1536, following the Synod of Uppsala. The entire Swedish Church was now declared independent from Rome. Between 1539‚Äì1543, the king was influenced by Conrad von Pyhy, and the Swedish Reformation was performed under a German pattern. In 1541, the Bible was translated to Swedish, and in 1543, the New Testament also to Finnish, which is considered a great contribution to the development of each language. During the 1540s, the religious tensions resulted in the Dacke War. During the \\"Succession Parliament\\" in V√§ster√•s of 1544, radical theological reforms was introduced. The Estates agreed to a number of reformation principles and altered some aspects of ritual practice, including the elimination of holy water, incense, and the adoration of saints. They also eliminated requiem masses and many holy days.Montgomery, 1995, p. 144 =1560‚Äì1568= Consolidation of the Reformation continued under Eric XIV of Sweden, who came to the throne in 1560 and at first imposed not rigid doctrinal uniformity, but, rather, uniform recognition of his authority over the Church while admitting substantial numbers of Huguenot Calvinists to his kingdom.Montgomery, 1995, p. 145. The Swedish church, however, refused Calvinism in the Synod of Stockholm 1565. =1568‚Äì1592= Memorial coins. King John III of Sweden and queen Catherine Jagiellon attempted to introduce a counter-reformation. The reign of John III of Sweden in 1568‚Äì1592 signified certain leanings toward a counter-reformation in Sweden inspired by the king's Catholic wife, queen Catherine Jagiellon, who acted as a mediator in the king's negotiations with the Pope in Rome for the conditions in which Sweden would be willing to return to Catholicism.Katarina Jagellonica, urn:sbl:12406, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Birgitta Lager-Kromnow), h√§mtad 2017-12-25. John III leaned toward Reform Catholicism, and suggested to Rome that Sweden, in the event of a counter-reformation, should be allowed to keep marriage for clergy, use the Swedish language during church service, Sub utraque, and a theology based upon the church fathers rather than upon the doctrines of the Council of Trent. In parallel, the Swedish church introduced the Swedish Church Ordinance 1571 (accepted the following year), establishing a Swedish church doctrine. The new Protestant church ordinance was, however, given Catholic-inclined additions by the king: the Nova Ordinantia of 1575, and his own church doctrine, the R√∂da boken ('Red Book') of 1576, two additions which introduced a middle stance between Catholicism and Protestantism, and reintroduced many Catholic customs. The king's additions to the church ordinance was not followed in all Sweden, particularly not in the Duchy belonging to his Calvinistic brother Charles, and there where opposition toward it among the clergy. These conflicting doctrines resulted in the long going Liturgical Struggle between Catholic and Protestant sympathizers, and a split between the king and the church. John III and his queen also performed several other controversial Catholic-leaning acts which demonstrated their intention: in 1575, the king returned the unrestricted right to receive novices to Vadstena Abbey, which was reformed in accordance of the Council of Trent by the Jesuit Papal Legate Antonio Possevino, during which its abbess Katarina Gylta swore the Tridentine Oath, and the first Catholic Solemn Mass since the Reformation was held in the abbey. In the capital, a Catholic seminary Collegium regium Stockholmense was established by Laurentius Nicolai. The Counter-reformatory efforts contributed to tension in connection to the imprisoned Erik XIV, who came to be a symbol of protestantism in prison. During the imprisonment of Eric, three major conspiraces were made to depose John III: the 1569 Plot, the Mornay Plot and the 1576 Plot, among whom at least the last one was heavily influenced by religious considerations. Mauritz Rasmusson, urn:sbl:9197, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Lars Ericson), h√§mtad 2020-08-03. The negotiations between the royal couple and Rome where ultimately not successful. Rome was not willing to accept the Reformed Catholicism in exchange for counter-reformation, and the counter-reformation in Sweden diminished after death of queen Catherine, and the king's remarriage to the Protestant Gunilla Bielke. =1592‚Äì1600= The Personal Union with Catholic Poland under the Catholic Sigismund III Wasa in 1592‚Äì1598 resulted in a final clash between Catholicism and Protestantism in Sweden. The tensions finally resulted in the Uppsala Synod of 1593, where Protestantism in accordance with the Augsburg Confession was adopted a state religion. Catholicism was to be abandoned, the Swedish church was to return to the doctrines of the Swedish Church Ordinance 1571, and the Nova Ordinantia of 1575 and the R√∂da boken ('Red Book') of 1576 was to be removed from it. The suppression of the monasteries was finally completed with the closure of Vadstena Abbey in 1595. The Protestants united under the king's Protestant uncle Duke Charles against the Catholic Sigismund and thereby the Polish- Swedish union and Catholicism, which resulted in the War against Sigismund in 1598. The war ended with the defeat of Sigismund and thereby Catholicism in Sweden, and the execution of his followers in the Link√∂ping Bloodbath in 1600.

Early years Maforikan was born on 19 September 1930 in Ajase, Benin, where his father had moved from Badagry, Nigeria. He was a member of Christ Apostolic Church before joining the Celestial Church Of Christ in 1948 shortly after its foundation. He followed the Pastor Founder S.B.J. Oschoffa to Nigeria. He was Oyo State Evangelist for 10 years before being appointed a Deputy Pastor in December 2002. He was proclaimed Pastor of the Celestial Church Of Christ Worldwide within two days of the death Gilbert Jesse. His appointment was made by the council of superiors of CCC Worldwide. He took up this position at a time when the CCC had split into four factions. The others were led by Rev pastor st Agbaosi of Porto Novo in Benin, and in Lagos by Superior Evangelist Josiah Kayode Owudunni of Ijeshatedo Parish and by Pastor Emmanuel Oschoffa who was chosen by members of the Board of Trustees. Leadership disputes In an attempt to resolve the dispute over church leadership, in March 2005 Pastors Moforikan and Oshoffa met with other church leaders in Porto-Novo, Benin home of the founder of the church. They agreed to hold a further meeting two weeks later with eleven delegates from each side to take every possible measure to resolve the issue. In November 2005 Iepe Asebiomo, leader of the Unification and Renaissance Mission of the Celestial Church of Christ, noted the growing number of factions with heads claiming to be CCC pastor. These included Daniel B. Agbaosi of Benin, and in Lagos, Nigeria Paul Maforikan in Tejuosho, Emmanuel Oshoffa in Ketu, Josiah Owodunni in Ijeshatedo and Edward Oladokun in Ikorodu. US-based Bolanle Shonekan was also a claimant. Yet others had formed separate churches. In November 2006 pastor Jacob Edi√©mou Blin laid a complaint with the prosecutor in C√¥te d'Ivoire against Moforikan for usurpation of title. Later that month church officials expressed shock when Blin said at Port-Bouet that the CCC was all his private property. This brought the number of factions of the church up to five. Maforikan paid a long visit to South Africa in 2008, arriving on 11 June 2008 and visiting all the parishes over the three-month period. In an April 2009 interview in Abidjan, C√¥te d'Ivoire Maforikan said the founder \\"Papa\\" Oshoffa had prophesied in 1961 that Maforikan would be his successor. He described the disunity in the church as the work of the devil. In April 2010 a group of leaders called the Celestial Church of Christ Unification and Reform Group petitioned the Inspector-General of Police to arrest those claiming to be pastors of the church. They said that such claims were contrary to a Supreme Court ruling that there would be no pastor in the church until it had rewritten its constitution. The claimants were Josiah Owodunni, Paul Maforikan, Steven Orovboni, Godwin Shonekan, Emmanuel Oschoffa and Edward Oladesu. They were invited by the Lagos state police to give information to a fact finding investigation, but only Orovboni and Maforikan responded in person. The group's secretary, Dele Ojogbede, said the self-styled pastors had been told that they would be held for contempt of court unless they dropped their claims and worked towards unity.

The series was first proposed and edited by Fred W. Friendly, later of CBS News. Broadcast history Who Said That? began in 1947 as an NBC Radio program with John Cameron Swayze as the emcee. It moved to television in December 1948, with Swayze as a regular panelist and the CBS news correspondent Robert Trout as the emcee until February 18, 1951, when the series ended for 14 months.

The programs comprise undergraduate and graduate instruction in 11 languages during six-, seven-, or eight-week summer sessions. The Schools enroll approximately 1,500 students every summer. The pedagogical approach of the programs relies on immersion-based instruction and acquisition. All students in the Language Schools must sign and abide by Middlebury College's \\"Language Pledge\\", a pledge to use their target language exclusively during the duration of their time at the School. Undergraduate instruction is offered in Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. Additionally, graduate- level instruction is offered in Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Russian, and Spanish. The Language Schools also offer a Doctor of Modern Languages (D.M.L.) degree, currently unique to Middlebury. Middlebury announced that it will launch a pilot School of Abenaki in 2020. Founding and expansion In 1915, the School of German was founded as the first of Middlebury Language Schools. The most recent School, the Middlebury School of Korean, was established in the summer of 2015. Middlebury Language Schools have historically all been conducted at the College's campus in Middlebury, Vermont. In the summer of 2009 the College opened a satellite campus at Mills College in Oakland, California, to accommodate growth in the enrollments in several of the schools. In the summer of 2020, Middlebury will no longer operate on Mills College but will instead operate at Bennington College in Bennington, Vermont. Language instruction All of the eleven Middlebury Language Schools use an immersion-based approach to language instruction and acquisition. The Schools also stress cultural instruction in addition to pure language instruction. Students in all of the Language Schools are required to sign the \\"Language Pledge.\\" The Pledge, which has been in continuous use since the 1920s and is a registered trademark of Middlebury College, reads: > In signing this Language Pledge, I agree to use ______________ as my only > language of communication while attending the Middlebury Language Schools. I > understand that failure to comply with this Pledge may result in my > expulsion from the School without credit or refund.

Graduate study Eight of Middlebury's summer schools ‚Äî Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Russian, and Spanish ‚Äî offer graduate programs in addition to the undergraduate component. These are completed during six-week summer sessions, with an option of combining the sessions with overseas study. The graduate degree most often conferred is the Master of Arts. The MA in French, German, Italian, and Spanish require one summer on the Middlebury campus. A second summer is required for the MA in Arabic, Chinese, and Russian. =Doctor of Modern Languages (D.M.L.)= Middlebury offers a Doctor of Modern Languages (D.M.L.) degree.

Brevirostres are crocodilians with short snouts, and are distinguished from the long, slender-snouted gharials. It is defined phylogenetically as the last common ancestor of Alligator mississippiensis (the American alligator) and Crocodylus niloticus (the Nile crocodile) and all of its descendants. Below is a cladogram showing the phylogenetic relations of Brevirostres from Brochu (1997): Brevirostres was first named by Karl Alfred von Zittel in 1890. Von Zittel considered Gavialis, the gharial, to be closely related to Tomistoma, the false gharial, and excluded them from the group. Tomistoma, as its name implies, is traditionally not considered closely related to Gavialis, but instead classified as a crocodylid. Under this classification, all members of Brevirostres are brevirostrine, or short- snouted. Recent molecular analyses support von Zittel's classification in placing Tomistoma as a close relative of Gavialis.

Dozens of times he delivers Rav's teachings in the Talmud - many of which he heard indirectly from his teacher Hiyya bar Joseph,Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 7a; Yebamoth, 90b; Avodah Zarah 50a and in rare occasions he also delivers the work of R. Ze'iri.i.e. Babylonian Talmud, Menahoth 21b After the death of Rav, Rav Giddel went to study under Rav Huna. It is told that Rav Huna gave lengthy lectures, and many of his students, among them Rav Giddel, restrained themselves from relieving themselves during the lessons, and became infertile as a result.Babylonian Talmud, Yebamot 64b Later on he moved to live in the Land of Israel, in the beit midrash of Yochanan bar Nafcha in Tiberias. Once, when Rav Giddel was in the process of buying a field, R. Abba came and purchased it first. The case came to the attention of R. Isaac Nappaha, who asked R. Abba: \\"If a poor man is examining a cake and another comes and takes it away from him, what then?\\", and R. Abba replied: \\"He is called a wicked man\\". R. Abba explained to R. Isaac Nappaha that he did not know that Rav Giddel was already eying the field, and now knowing this, he was ready to gift the field to Rav Giddel but not to sell it to him, since selling one's first field is a bad omen. Rav Giddel refused to accept it as a gift, in accordance with the verse: \\"he that hates gifts shall live\\",Book of Proverbs, 15:27 and R. Abba likewise refused to use the field. The field, abandoned by both parties, became known as \\"The Rabbis‚Äô field\\"Babylonian Talmud, Kiddushin 59a Rav Giddel was accustomed to go and sit at the gates of the bathing-place (were women would immerse), in order to teach the laws of tevilah.

History The triptych was commissioned for the church of San Procolo of Florence, where Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari saw it, but attributed it to Giotto. It was recognized as a work by Lorenzo Monaco by Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle in 1864. It has been variously dated from 1408 to 1418. The work had originally different cusps (perhaps with heads of prophets) and a predella, which is now lost. Description The painting includes compartments divided into two panels surmounted by cusps, each sharing a golden background. The central painting depicts the Virgin, on a throne barely under her dress visible, on the right, and a hovering Angel of the Annunciation on the left. Behind her are parts of a house, including a double mullioned window, while next to her head is the Holy Ghost dove. The drapes feature intricate arabesques, perhaps influenced by the International Gothic style introduced by Gherardo Starnina and Lorenzo Ghiberti.

Flowing southwest through a steep and narrow glacial canyon, it comes out of the mountains about north of Cora, briefly widening into the New Fork Lakes. From there it swings south then southeast, past Cora and on to Pinedale, receiving Willow, Pine and Pole Creeks from the left. At Boulder it receives Boulder Creek and turns south again. The East Fork River joins a few miles south of there. From the confluence, the New Fork meanders generally southwest between low bluffs, and joins the Green River about east of Big Piney.

Biography His father died when the son was a mere boy, but a nobleman, Gotthilf August Francke, sent him to the orphan house in Halle, and afterward to the University of Halle, where he received a thorough education in the classics and theology. He was ordained to the ministry at Wernigerode in 1769, and in the same year went to the United States in response to an urgent call from Lutheran congregations in Pennsylvania. On his arrival in the U.S. in 1769, he was at once elected pastor of the congregation at Lancaster, Pennsylvania, for 10 years. In 1779 he moved to Philadelphia in answer to a unanimous call from St. Michael's, the first Lutheran congregation in the city. Here he spent the remainder of his life, serving as pastor until 1820. He was a member of the American Philosophical Society. The University of Pennsylvania conferred upon him the honorary degree of A.M. in 1780, and that of D.D. in 1785. In the same institution, he was professor of German and Oriental languages for 18 years, and was regarded as one of the best linguistic scholars of his time. In 1785, with his colleague and intimate friend John Frederick Schmidt, he established a private seminary at Philadelphia, for the education of young men for the ministry, which continued for twenty years, until age and pressure of other labors prevented them from attending properly to the work. In this private institution, many of the early Lutheran pastors received their theological training. Helmuth was frequently elected to ecclesiastical offices of honor and trust, and was identified with many of the public institutions of Philadelphia. Though he was partial to the German language, and opposed the use of the English language in Lutheran church services, this did not prevent him from taking an interest in the various activities, educational and religious, of his adopted country. Literary efforts His published works include Taufe und heilige Schrift (Baptism and holy scripture, 1793), Unterhaltungen mit Gott (Conversations with God), books for children, and a volume of German hymns. For several years he edited the Evangelical Magazine, a German periodical of Philadelphia which he had founded, and the first Lutheran Church newspaper in the United States. Family He married Maria Barbara Keppele in 1770. They had five children.

An MSNBC critic favored the Nook Simple Touch over the Kindle Touch, citing the Nook's superior user interface and an \\"over two months\\" battery life versus the Kindle's \\"up to two months\\". Engadget initially expressed confusion over the device's name and dubbed the device the \\"Nook Wi-Fi\\" in its review. Use of additional Android applications As an Android device, the Nook Simple Touch can be modified to run Android applications (including those obtained via Google Play) through a process called rooting, which grants users root access to the Nook Simple Touch's file system. Doing so voids the device's warranty in some jurisdictions, although it can often be restored to (non-rooted) factory defaults for warranty claims. = Other modifications = The Nook Simple Touch is somewhat limited due to the slow processor and the E ink screen. These issues have been overcome via a custom kernel, which overclocks the processor and enables multitouch. The slow refresh rate and flashing screen were overcome by an app called NoRefresh (or Fastmode), which increases refresh rate by reverting to 1-bit depth (black and white, no greyscale). Another limitation has been the lack of audio. The Nook Simple Touch has no external speakers or headphone ports. Recently, this has been overcome with more kernel modifications. Various custom operating systems (or ROMs) have also been developed, such as the 1337 ROM. These ROMs are similar to the stock OS, but have been modified with several of the tweaks listed above.

Smith is linked to the black social protest novel tradition of the 1940s and the 1950s, a movement that became synonymous with writers such as Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Willard Motley, and Ann Petry. Smith's third book, South Street (1954), is considered to be one of the first black militant protest novels. His last published novel, The Stone Face (1963), in its account of the Paris massacre of 1961, \\"stand[s] as one of the few representations of the event available all the way up until the early 1990s\\". Smith was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, of African-American descent. After 1951, he maintained an expatriate status in France. However, due to his various journalistic and editorial assignments, he also lived for extended periods of time in Ghana, West Africa. In the final decade of his life, he would travel to the United States to visit family and friends and write about the racial and social upheaval that was occurring there. Some of Smith's journalism and reportage from this period was published in various media outlets in France and Europe. Some of it was revised, re-adapted, and published in Return To Black America in 1970. Smith, who spoke fluent French, was a frequent contributor and guest on radio and television programs in France, where he was considered an expert on the political struggle, civil unrest, and racial tension occurring in the United States during the turbulent decade of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Smith was diagnosed with cancer in October 1973 and died just over a year later in Thiais, a commune in the southern suburbs of Paris, France. Life and work Smith was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Edith Smith. In 1934 his mother married Douglass Stanley Earle. According to the Dictionary of Literary Biography (DLB): In Smith's senior year, his high-school principal helped him secure a part-time position with the Pittsburgh Courier. Smith graduated from Benjamin Franklin High School with honors in January 1944 at the age of 16, the second highest student in his class. After graduation Smith began working full-time as a reporter for the Pittsburgh Courier, but in January 1946 he was drafted into the Army. He was sent to Europe, where he was assigned as a clerk-typist in occupied Berlin, Germany. It was this experience that inspired his first novel, Last of the Conquerors, published in 1948 when Smith was only 21. Discharged from active duty in 1948, Smith attended Temple University and continued working as a journalist with the Pittsburgh Courier. During this time he married his high-school sweetheart and had begun working on his second published novel, Anger at Innocence (1950). After a short stay at the Yaddo Foundation in Saratoga Springs, the recently married couple left the United States for France in late 1951. There they became part of a large African- American community of artists and writers living in Paris including, most prominently, Richard Wright, James Baldwin, and Chester Himes among others. Smith and his wife believed that a move to Europe might help their troubled marriage, but that was not to be. Increased financial burdens, his wife's difficulty learning a foreign language, and their struggles as artists in the displaced milieu of a community far from family and home, led to the couple's divorce. Despite these serious financial and spiritual difficulties, Smith continued to write while leading a bohemian existence in the Latin Quarter. In 1954, Smith's situation improved with the release of his third novel, South Street (inspired by his childhood in the black neighborhoods and ghettoes of Philadelphia), and his hiring by the Agence France-Presse (AFP). In the following years, he served as a foreign service editor and correspondent. He also was a director of AFP in Ghana until the fall of Nkrumah in 1966, after which Smith continued as an editor and special correspondent of AFP in various countries. His next book The Stone Face, published in 1963, would be his last published novel. Smith had begun work on it in 1961 when the war in Algeria proved to be an explosive situation that had exacerbated passions in France. This novel evokes the anti-Arab racism that Smith was witness to both in his daily journalistic work and in the streets of Paris. Kristin Ross, in her book May '68 And Its Afterlives, points out that The Stone Face is one of the earliest published eyewitness accounts (albeit in a fictionalized format) of what occurred in Paris on October 17, 1961. [See also: Paris massacre of 1961] Smith's status as a foreigner and expatriate (doubly) marked him as both the insider and outsider in two cultures, the United States and Europe. By the early 1960s, as a black American working in a foreign land and witness to injustice on two continents, the stakes were raised for Smith in the composition of this novel. It pushed his capacities as an artist, writer, and journalist to their limits. In this novel and his subsequent journalistic writing and reportage, Smith would testify to the social, political, and cultural happenings of his adopted country as a way to explore and address everyday racism in the United States. In France, Smith was considered an expert on the racial situation in the United States, especially after he published a report in 1967 on the revolts within American black ghettos.\\"Porte ouverte: William Gardner Smith\\" (video interview in French), INA, September 5, 1967. Smith remarried on October 31, 1961 to Solange Royez. Their daughter, Michelle, was born in 1963, and a son was born in Accra, Ghana, in 1965. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1969. In 1971, Smith married Ira Reuben, a native of India. Their daughter Rachel was born in 1971.

He first appeared in the series thirteen episode \\"Blue Valentine\\", broadcast on 15 February 2011. Dan is a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, who works in the general surgery ward, Keller. He was created in 2010 and Astill successfully auditioned for the role three months prior to beginning filming in November. Dan has been characterised through his boyish and impulsive nature. He portrayed as a wannabe \\"ladies' man\\". New to his role as a consultant, Dan plays up to the stereotype associated with public schooled orthopaedic surgeons. His storylines have developed through a relationship with ward sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley) and a rivalry with registrar Antoine Malick (Jimmy Akingbola), whom he later kisses. The latter has attracted a mixed reaction from critics of the series, who felt it was a repetition of gay story-lines featuring in other serial dramas. In May 2012, it was announced that Astill had decided to leave the series. Storylines Dan is introduced a few days into his new role as a consultant and is an old friend of registrar Greg Douglas (Edward MacLiam). He starts mentoring ward sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley), during her nurse consultant training. He has a hard time teaching her the importance of delegation in a consultant role. They become close and later start dating. Chrissie becomes stressed with the pressure of work, so Dan organises a trip abroad. He later realises she wants to relax, so he cancels and his relationship with Chrissie strengthens. The father of Chrissie's child, registrar Sacha Levy (Bob Barret) finds it hard to accept that Chrissie has moved on. The situation worsens when they have conflicting views on medicine. Dan decides to put his surgeon skills to the test when consultant Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) challenges him to complete his list of operations first. Feeling competitive, Dan rushes through an operation and makes an error. He gets Ric to step in to save the patient, with Ric taking the blame. Dan starts to feel like his relationship with Chrissie isn't going anywhere fast, so he invites her around to consummate their relationship. Chrissie is annoyed by Dan pressuring her, he tries to make things right again. Registrar Antoine Malick (Jimmy Akingbola) begins a rivalry with Dan after he undermines him over the treatment of a patient. Tensions build when he learns that Malick is gay. He secretly treats his injured rugby team mate Sean Foster (Sam Callis) with steroids. Malick and Chrissie criticise his actions and Malick threatens to report him. Sean develops necrotizing fasciitis as a result and Dan is forced to operate, ruining Sean's career. A fight ensues between the two and Dan kisses Malick. He then runs to Chrissie and confesses his love for her. Dan asks Malick to forget the kiss and attempts to avoid him. They are forced to operate together. Dan undermines him in theatre, the pair fight once more. After more competitiveness, Dan ignores Malick's medical advice dangering a patient. Malick is angered by his attitude and punches Dan, injuring his face in the process. Development =Creation= Dan was one of several characters introduced during Holby City thirteenth series, during a period of time that the programme had many established characters written out. Characters such as Dan, Malick and cardiothoracic surgeon Sahira Shah (Laila Rouass) were introduced to fill the gap left by the departures. Series producer Myar Craig-Brown hoped the new characters would become \\"equally iconic\\" as their predecessors. Dan was created as a series regular in the occupation of consultant orthopaedic surgeon. Executive producer Belinda Campbell said she was certain Dan would \\"bring a spark to Holby General in more ways than one.\\" She described his backstory as allowing him an \\"easy passage through life\\", but said he would become troubled as his duration progressed. His backstory includes having to repeat his F2 three times, considering a career in Cardiology and a number of failed romances with females. He was also given links to existing character Greg Douglas, as an old friend. Actor Adam Astill auditioned for the role in August 2010. He was called back for a second audition to meet with the producers. In October he was offered the role and began filming in November. Astill had wanted a role in the show for some time prior to his casting, because he was impressed with the standard of material the programme produces. His schedule was light at first as they eased his character into the series. In early 2011 his workload increased as Dan's storylines developed. Whilst Campbell expressed her delight that Astill was playing the character. Dan's first episode was broadcast on 15 February 2011, which also featured fellow new character Sahira. Astill is currently contracted with the series until November 2011. =Characterisation= BBC Online described Dan's qualities as being his energetic and enthusiastic nature. However he is flawed by his \\"boyish and impulsive\\" manner. Prior to his arrival Astill described him a \\"charming\\" man who has the ability \\"to put his foot in his mouth.\\" However this trait does not stop him finding romance on the ward. Dan has an interest in the sport rugby and captains a team. Dan was first described to Astill as a \\"sporty, rugby-playing ladies' man\\", who likes to be perceived as confident, but in reality is not. As a \\"outwardly and very bullish\\" male, he tries to play up to the stereotype associated with orthopaedic surgeons. He often emphasises on his sporty public schooled persona. However, Astill opined that Dan has a \\"heart of gold\\" ‚Äì who will often say the wrong thing because he has trouble expressing himself emotionally. Dan takes a stern approach to medicine. He spent six years at medical school to become a \\"high-flying consultant\\". Billed as a \\"brilliant surgeon\\", he isn't good at patient management. In his field of orthopaedic surgery, Dan has a tendency to treat the problem rather than attend to the patient's emotional needs. Astill said he is likely to \\"fix the bone and then just move on to the next piece of surgery.\\" He also opined that Dan should work on his patient skills to better himself. Dan has also proven his worth as a mentor during Chrissie's consultant training and gives his full concentration to the task in hand. Dan's \\"ladies' man\\" status became apparent from his first episode. Prior to working at Holby General, he had a number of failed engagements to woman who he felt \\"were not quite right.\\" During an interview with Digital Spy, Astill said he believed that Dan is the type of man who would stay faithful in a relationship. He concluded that in general he is not malicious, but \\"there's a lot of bluster about him and when he's out with the lads he'll perhaps josh and exaggerate about his prowess with the ladies.\\" He does not have a dark past, but his future is set hold many revelations as his storyline takes many twists and turns. =Sexuality= Dan's first romance begins when Chrissie succumbs to his charm. Astill describes him as being instantly attracted to Chrissie. Dan tries to assert his power over her and ill-advises her on how to run the ward. During their subsequent mentorship, Astill said that Dan tries everything he can \\"to stay in Chrissie's good books\\". Chrissie had previously been pursuing a possible romance with Sacha, so his arrival \\"put a spanner in the works\\". Astill predicted that Holby City fans would take a disliking to Dan, after he ruins any chance of reconciliation between Chrissie and Sacha. Astill said their working relationship brings them closer together and readies them for a romance. Dan and Malick's rivalry builds when Dan's conduct is questioned. When he learns that Malick is homosexual, the tension increases between the pair. Upon discovering Dan's negligence with a patient's treatment, Malick is critical of him. Jimmy Akingbola who plays Malick said \\"Dan is in the wrong and Malick won't let him forget that.\\" At this point the pair are embroiled in a \\"showdown\\" and Dan impulsively kisses Malick. Akingbola said \\"Malick sees a side to Dan that completely throws him. It's a real shock.\\" Astill had previously stated that his character would not intentionally hurt Chrissie because he was aware that she had been \\"burnt once or twice before.\\" The BBC said the storyline had a \\"subtle build-up\\" and that Malick's sexuality \\"wrong- footed\\" Dan. They said that after the revelation, the pair endured a \\"love/hate relationship\\". To that point, the storyline had been portrayed with \\"sensitivity and integrity\\". They concluded that the future of the story would stay true to following Dan's struggle to come to terms with his sexuality. Series producer Craig-Brown revealed the \\"biggest challenge\\" was to distinguish the storyline from other sexuality plots featured in other dramas. She concluded that it was about Dan's struggle with \\"trying to deal with what he wants, which is a very conventional life.\\" She also confirmed it would be a long-running story arc for the character. Astill also shared her sentiment stating it was a \\"new direction\\" for the programme. He said it would be easy for Dan to \\"come out\\" if he knew what he wanted. Hobley later revealed Dan is \\"moving things too fast\\", which has a negative effect on her training. He is annoyed with Chrissie when Malick offers her theatre slots. She added \\"Dan doesn't respect what she is trying to do [...] Dan's reaction makes her see red\\". Hobley revealed that Dan's affair begins to come between them ‚Äì \\"so when she finds out what Dan has been up to under her nose all hell is going to break loose.\\" Dan gave Chrissie the impression he was homophobic. Astill said that his actions to a certain extent, were homophobic. He covered up his feelings because he did not like them. Astill and Akingbola filmed \\"technical\\" fight scenes which followed, which resulted in Dan having noticeable injuries to his face. At this point Holby City played out the first possible reveal moment. Chrissie tried to find out why they had fought, with Malick nearly telling the truth. Hobley said that you think, \\"Oh my God, he‚Äôs going to tell her!\\" Malick blackmailed him to keep quiet or he would tell Chrissie the truth. They both prevented director of surgery Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry), from finding out the truth. As the first time they began to cooperate, Astill said they gave him a \\"pathetic excuse\\" and formed a \\"united front\\". Dan disrespected Chrissie's career aspirations once again and she became \\"slightly suspicious\\" of him. Hobley said there is no future for the two of them. Though Astill wasn't so sure but said he hoped Dan would transform into a \\"bisexual predator ‚Äî and no man or woman is safe from him.\\" In July 2011, Astill began to worry about public opinion of Dan. He hoped viewers would realise that Dan was not \\"a bad person\\" but rather \\"a tortured soul.\\" At this point Dan and Malick were a long way off romance. Any feelings he had were \\"buried so deep he refused to believe they exist.\\" =Departure= In early May 2012, Astill told Joanne Lowles from TVTimes that he was leaving the series. He said that he was pleased with Dan's exit storyline because he \\"becomes the happiest we've ever seen him, he's comfortable in his own skin and relaxed.\\" He later told Digital Spy's Kilkelly that he had \\"loved\\" working on the show but wanted to pursue new projects. Although he did not rule out a return in the future. While a BBC representative explained that the dynamic between Dan and Simon Marshall (Paul Nicholls) would develop and result in \\"Dan having to decide once and for all which path he follows\\". They added that Astill is a \\"brilliant actor\\" and had contributed much to Dan's storylines during his tenure. Reception Prior to Dan's first kiss with Malick, Jane Simon of The Mirror stated that there was \\"a rather massive surprise in store and even if you've seen it coming a mile off, it's got OMG stamped all over it.\\" Inside Soap Katy Moon similarly wrote there was \\"one hell of a shock\\" coming up, which was \\"certainly worth waiting for\\". In reference to Dan's clash with Malick, Simon opined, \\"You can practically hear their antlers locking, as the tension between them is unbearable.\\" Simon's Mirror colleague Jim Shelley described the kiss as \\"Not exactly Oliver Reed & Alan Bates\\", in reference to a homoerotic fight scene in the film Women in Love. Though What's on TV recommended the episode, the accompanying review criticised the \\"seriously irritating banter between the pair,\\" and ensuing \\"macho posturing between the orthopaedic surgeon and mouthy Malick.\\" Some viewers complained about the kiss to the BBC discussion programme Points of View, dismayed that Holby City was \\"following the trend\\" of depicting gay relationships. Though the number of complaints were not publicised ‚Äì The BBC defended the storyline explaining that, \\"Holby City aims to reflect real life in the setting of a medical drama and this means telling stories about characters from many different backgrounds, faiths, religions and sexualities. We approach our portrayal of same-sex relationships in the same way as we do heterosexual relationships and aim to ensure depictions of affection or sexuality between couples are suitable for pre-watershed viewing.\\" Frances Ryan of The Guardian responded, \\"Whether said complainers thought that the onscreen depiction of straight people or indeed the interaction of humans generally was similarly a compliance to fantastical trends remains unseen\\". Anthony D. Langford of gay media website AfterElton.com was left undecided in his view, by the storyline's beginning. He opined that Astill and Akingbola had chemistry, that the characters' scenes were \\"intense and combustible,\\" and that the fight and following kiss were terrifically acting, due to the amount of \\"passion and heat and rage\\". However, he expressed concern that the same type of storyline had been attempted in soap operas on multiple occasions. He predicted that Dan would be in denial for week and cause fights with Malick. Langford concluded: \\"I suspect that Malick and Dan will eventually embark on a secret affair, Chrissie will find out, there will be more denials and fighting and at some point Dan will accept who he is. Still, despite the tired storyline, the characters are complex and appealing and the writing is solid enough to make me overlook that.\\" Langford later said \\"Dan isn‚Äôt a very likable character\\" and is a \\"complete jerk\\" because of his sexuality issues. He also questioned Dan's medical skills, bemoaning it unrealistic that his \\"unethical behavior\\" has not been noticed within the hospital. He also admitted his confusion to why a \\"self-assured guy like Malick\\" would get involved with Dan. Though he praised Dan's revelation of his backstory. D Langford later said Dan's behaviour needed to be addressed because there was a danger the story would \\"lose its integrity.\\" References External links * Dan Hamilton at BBC Online Category:Holby City characters Category:Fictional surgeons Category:Male characters in television Category:Television characters introduced in 2011 ","title":"Dan Hamilton"},{"id":"32061131","text":"Gidel is a town in the Nuba Mountains of Sudan.

The area of the district is . Its administrative center is the town of Nyandoma. Population: The population of Nyandoma accounts for 73.9% of the district's total population. History The area was originally populated by the Finno-Ugric peoples and then colonized by the Novgorod Republic. It was always a remote part of Kargopol lands with sparse population. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known from 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, it was transferred to the newly established Novgorod Governorate. After a number of administrative reforms, Kargopolsky Uyezd became one of the four uyezds of the newly established Olonets Governorate. In 1894, the decision was taken on the railroad construction from Vologda to Arkhangelsk. It was decided that the railroad would take the shortest route, which means it bypasses Kargopol and traverses the current territory of Nyandomsky District. In 1896, Nyandoma was founded as a railway station. On July 15, 1929, the uyezds were abolished, the governorates merged into Northern Krai, and Nyandomsky District was established among others. It became a part of Nyandoma Okrug, one of the five in Northern Krai. In 1930, the okrug was abolished, and the district was subordinated to the central administration of Northern Krai. For a short period in the 1930s, the district absorbed some of the areas of abolished Konoshsky District, but in 1935 Konoshsky District was reestablished, and the areas were ceded to it. In 1936, the krai itself was transformed into Northern Oblast. In 1937, Northern Oblast was split into Arkhangelsk Oblast and Vologda Oblast. Nyandomsky District remained in Arkhangelsk Oblast ever since. Geography A major part of the district belongs to the basin of the Onega River. The Mosha River, a right tributary of the Onega, has its source in Lake Bolshoye Moshenskoye in the southeast of the district and flows northwest dividing the district into two roughly equal parts. The areas in the west of the district are in the basin of the Voloshka River, also a right tributary of the Onega. Minor areas in the east of the district belong to the basins of the left tributaries of the Vaga River‚Äîthe Vel, the Padenga, and the Led. An area in the north of the district belongs to the basin of the Mekhrenga River, a right tributary of the Yemtsa. There are many lakes in the district, the biggest one being Lake Nimengskoye, which belongs to the basin of the Voloshka River. A major part of the district is covered by coniferous forests (taiga). There are many swamps in the area. Divisions =Administrative divisions= As an administrative division, the district is divided into eight selsoviets and one town of district significance (Nyandoma). One locality which previously had urban-type settlement status (Shalakusha), was downgraded to a rural locality in 2005. The following selsoviets have been established (the administrative centers are given in parentheses): *Andreyevsky (Andreyevskaya); *Burachikhinsky (Burachikhinskaya); *Lepshinsky (Stupinskaya); *Limsky (Navolok); *Moshinsky (Makarovskaya); *Shalakushsky (Shalakusha); *Shozhemsky (Shestiozersky); *Voyezersky (Gridino). =Municipal divisions= As a municipal division, the district is divided into one urban settlement and two rural settlements (the administrative centers are given in parentheses): *Nyandomskoye Urban Settlement (Nyandoma); *Moshinskoye Rural Settlement (Makarovskaya); *Shalakushskoye Rural Settlement (Shalakusha). Economy =Industry= The most important industry in the district is timber industry. Food industry is also present =Agriculture= Agriculture in the region is limited mostly to milk and meat production. =Transportation= Nyandoma railway station Nyandoma is on the paved road connecting Dolmatovo, which is on one of the principal highways in Russia, M8 connecting Moscow and Arkhangelsk, with Kargopol. Another paved road, in the southern direction, connects Nyandoma with Konosha. Nyandoma is located on the railway line between Moscow and Arkhangelsk (built in the south-north direction), and as a matter of fact was founded in 1896 as a railway station and was only granted town status in 1939. Culture and recreation The district contains thirty-one objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local importance. Most of these are chapels and wooden rural houses built prior to 1917. The only state museum in the district is the House of Nyan, in Nyandoma.

H.J.A. Hofland, as he is also commonly known, is often referred to as the √©minence grise of Dutch journalism. In 1999 he was named Dutch \\"Journalist of the century\\" in a nationwide poll among his peers.Journalist Hofland wins top literary prize, Radio Netherlands Worldwide, 14 December 2010 He once described himself as belonging to the \\"anarcho-liberal community\\", though his political orientation is that of the secular center of society. 'Groot kanon' inspireert niet iedereen, NRC Handelsblad, 17 December 1999 Hofland: meester van hoofdzaken en bagatellen, Trouw, 16 December 2010 Early life and career Hofland was born in Rotterdam. As a twelve-year-old boy he witnessed the bombing of the city on 14 May 1940, during the German invasion of the Netherlands, in which the centre of Rotterdam was almost completely destroyed, killing 900 civilians and leaving 80,000 homeless. It was an episode that marked his life: \\"On 15 May I woke up in a completely different world. It is an experience that stays with you your entire life. The bosses were not bosses anymore, the city was on fire, and the villains had the upper hand.\\" 'Malaparte trekt voortdurend een lange neus' , NRC Handelsblad, 5 July 2002 In 1946 he started to study at Nyenrode Business University, where he met Willem Oltmans. He never finished his studies. Biografie H.J.A. Hofland , VPRO Marathoninterview (accessed 10 June 2011) In 1950 he moved to Amsterdam, and in 1953 started his journalistic career at the Algemeen Handelsblad's foreign desk. At the Handelsblad, Anton Constandse instructed Hofland to the practice of journalism; he worked with Hans van Mierlo and Jan Blokker, who became lifelong friends, just like author Harry Mulisch. In October 1956 Hofland went to Budapest, where the revolution against Soviet occupation had been going on for several days. On the night of 3 November he heard the Russian tanks arrive in the capital and witnessed the surrender of the resistance. Hofland later declared ‚ÄúI knew that freedom had lost and that the West wouldn't help.‚ÄùHungary 1956-2006, Lectures and discussion: The Netherlands-Hungary Interactions, 31 October 2006 Editor in chief In 1960, as the paper‚Äôs junior foreign editor, he went to the United States in the US State Department‚Äôs Jointly Sponsored Journalists project, that organised placement of foreign journalists with American provincial newspapers. He followed a course in journalism at the Pennsylvania State University and worked with the Johnstown Tribune-Democrat.

In 1972, two years after the Handelsblad had merged with the Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant (NRC), becoming NRC Handelsblad, he resigned his post after a bitter conflict with the publisher about the disconnect between the liberal editorial staff of the newspaper and the more conservative readership.

In 1972 he published a book, Tegels Lichten (Lifting Tiles), containing essays on postwar Dutch domestic politics and various high profile ‚Äòaffairs‚Äô, such as the decolonization of Indonesia, the Dutch-Indonesian dispute about New Guinea and in particular the \\"anguish of Dutch authorities.\\" He wrote the book out of anger and frustration about the Dutch cover-up culture in politics and business. Henk Hofland in 2009 Operating along the lines of the American New Journalism he made the television documentary Vastberaden, maar soepel en met mate (Determined, but flexible and cautious), with television journalists Hans Keller and Hans Verhagen in 1974 for the VPRO. They provided the rich tradition of the Dutch documentary with an effective narrative style, and especially a new social engagement.Schuyt & Taverne, Dutch Culture in a European Perspective: 1950, prosperity and welfare, p. 398 Vastberaden, maar soepel en met mate, Beeld en Geluid Under the alias Samuel Montag, a pseudonym he took from a British banking house, he writes ruminations on everyday aspects of life. A frequent New York resident, he often voices exasperation at modern phenomena such as advertising, linguistic deterioration, free market ideology and growing car ownership. From 2002 he also writes a column for the weekly De Groene Amsterdammer. Legacy and death He died at the age of 88 in June 2016. Journalist Henk Hofland (88) overleden, NRC Handelsblad, 21 June 2016 His columns and essays have been collected in some 30 books. He also published several novels and short stories. One of his favourite authors was the journalist Curzio Malaparte. Awards Hofland received among others the following awards: * 1961 - Anne Frank Prize * 1996 - Gouden Ganzenveer * 1999 - ‚ÄòDutch journalist of the century‚Äô in a nationwide poll among his peers. * 2011 - P. C. Hooft Award, the nation's highest literary award. The jury praised Hofland for his effortless style, unflagging ethos and balanced views. \\"No one in this country has over the past sixty years sounded its social developments with so much vigilance and impartiality, with so much sprezzatura as well as persistence and continuity, evidence of an iron discipline\\".

He practised a wide variety of genres, including portraits, genre painting, still life and landscape painting. Peter Snijers at the Netherlands Institute for Art History His masterpiece is a series of 12 paintings, each representing a different month of the year.Peter Snijers, Leeuw at the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp Life Pieter Snyers was born in Antwerp as the son of well-off merchant Peter and his wife Anna de Decker.Peter Snijers in: Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, p. 1207-1208 He studied under Alexander van Bredael in 1694. He was registered as a master of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1707. The bird's nest He is reported to have resided in London in the period from 1720 to 1726, where he painted portraits of various members of the nobility and clergymen. The artist who principally painted portraits of priests or monks, led such a calm and pious lifestyle that he was given the nickname De Heilige or The Holy One. He married Maria Catharina van der Boven, the daughter of a lawyer, in 1726. This marriage produced no issue. He was successful as an artist, and able to buy a house on the prestigious Meir in Antwerp and assemble a large collection of Flemish and Dutch masters there. He entered on 17 August 1741 into an agreement with five other artists to provide free tuition at the directors of the Antwerp Academy. The Academy would eventually replace the Guild of Saint Luke.Pieter Snijers on the site of the National Gallery Snyers died in Antwerp. His estate included a large collection of art works of major artists of the preceding century showing that he was well-off.The Collector's Cabinet: Flemish Paintings from New England Private Collections, Univ of Massachusetts Press, 1983, p. 112. His nephew and pupil Pieter Jan Snyers was heir to his considerable fortune.Snyers (Peeter) in: Christiaan Kramm, De levens en werken der Hollandsche en Vlaamsche kunstschilders, beeldhouwers, graveurs en bouwmeesters, van den vroegsten tot op onzen tijd.

He painted both on large canvases and small copper plates. He was said never to have painted a composition twice. Aquarius or the month of January Snyers painted a series of 12 paintings, each representing a different month of the year. This series is regarded as the masterpiece of the artist and never left his studio during his lifetime. The paintings were dispersed in 1763 when they were auctioned off. Two of the paintings (January and July) are now in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp and two (April and May) in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels. Another two, those for March and December, were auctioned by Christie's (New York, 29 January 1998, lot 3).Peter Snijers, Market scene at Sotheby's There is a reduced copy of the month of March in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. The paintings in the series are genre paintings which include a representation of each month by its astrological sign. The painting of the month of January in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp depicts three Epiphany singers with a big star and a few women and children with special cakes, particular to the winter season, together with a man pouring water who symbolises Aquarius, the astrological sign of January. The painting series may, directly or indirectly, have inspired Pieter Casteels III and Jacob van Huysum to produce a series of paintings of the 12 months.Sam Segal, Mari√´l Ellens, Joris Dik, Stedelijk Museum \\"Het Prinsenhof.\\", Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, The temptations of Flora: Jan van Huysum, 1682-1749, Waanders, 2007, p. 321.

As a leader of a band of robbers, he was active between 1817 and 1819 in the border regions of the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg, the Grand Duchy of Baden and the Principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen.  Background  The period towards the end of and immediately after the Napoleonic Wars resulted in the uprooting of a large number of people, mostly peasants.R. Pr√∂ve, Lebenswelten, p. 133 Combined with the reorganisation of Southern Germany's political map, the mediatisation of smaller formerly independent territories, which in some cases changed hands several times before being incorporated into larger entities (the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg, the Grand Duchy of Baden, the Kingdom of Bavaria, the Principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen and the Principality of Hohenzollern-Hechingen), led to a period of unstable administration of these territories. Furthermore, the year without a summer in 1816 caused famine and an increase in unrest, vagrancy, begging, robbery and the first wave of large scale German emigration to the United States.M. Hubert, Deutschland im Wandel, p. 84  Early life  Franz Xaver Hohenleiter was born to impoverished herders in Rommelsried, now part of the municipality of Kutzenhausen in the district of Augsburg, Bavaria. His father had been a soldier and became a herder after getting married. The family had a bad reputation and had been convicted of theft. As a child Franz Xaver Hohenleiter worked as a shepherd boy but managed to get one winter of schooling where he learnt to read printed texts, although with difficulties, and write his own name. In 1813, he signed up with the Bavarian Army in Augsburg only to desert after eight days, when he moved into territory controlled by the Austrian Empire, knowing that Austria would not extradite deserters. During the following years he led a restless life. He wandered about in Austria, Switzerland, Bavaria, Baden, Sigmaringen and W√ºrttemberg, begging or finding casual work as a farm hand.M. Planck, Die letzten R√§uberbanden in Oberschwaben, p. 54f  Appearance  Xaver Hohenleiter is reported to have been over six foot tall. His body was muscular, and his posture and gait revealed the former soldier. His face was sun-tanned and he had very white teeth. His face was engulfed by thick sideburns and a goatee. His hair was pitch black, dangling down in braids, hence his nickname Schwaaz Vere (Black Xaver). He also wore finely engraved earrings.M. Planck, Die letzten R√§uberbanden in Oberschwaben, p. 55f  The gang  Schwaaz Vere and his robber band by Johann Baptist Pflug Xaver Hohenleiter was the leader of a gang of outlaws whose number fluctuated over time. Its core, however, consisted of a number of persons, both male and female: Maria Josepha Tochtermann, called Die G√ºnzburger Sephe (G√ºnzburg Sephe), born at Eppishofen, now part of the municipality of Altenm√ºnster, was the common-law wife of Xaver Hohenleiter. Together they had a son.M. Planck, Die letzten R√§uberbanden in Oberschwaben, p. 56f Xaver Hohenleiter's brother Ulrich, called Der Urle, 17 years old at the time of his arrest, had previously been a member of the Rosenberg-Gang, also active in Upper Swabia during the same period, and was partner to Agatha Gebhard, whose nickname was Schwarze Agath (Black Agatha).M. Planck, Die letzten R√§uberbanden in Oberschwaben, p. 62f She was part of a trio of women called Dreckete Partie (Dirty Party). Michael Friedrich Ludwig Klump, Der sch√∂ne Fritz (Handsome Fritz), was born in 1790 in Besenfeld and was associated with Theresia Jeppler,J. B. Pflug, Aus der R√§uber- und Franzosenzeit Schwaben, p. 187f born in the Austrian coastal city of Trieste in 1788. Joseph Anton Jung, called Der Condeer (The Pedlar),M. Planck, Die letzten R√§uberbanden in Oberschwaben, p. 40 due to his parents having been travelling merchants from what was to become the Rhine Province, and Creszentia Tochtermann, called Die G√ºnzburger Creszenz (G√ºnzburg Creszenz), sister of Maria Josepha Tochtermann,M. Planck, Die letzten R√§uberbanden in Oberschwaben, p. 58 formed another couple within the gang. She was also part of the Dreckete Partie (Dirty Party) as was Crescentia Gebhard, nicknamed Dreckete Crescens (Dirty Crescentia) and Agnes Gebhard, called Dreckete Agnes (Dirty Agnes), the first girl-friend of Ulrich Hohenleiter, as well as Katharina Gebhard, called Die dreckete Mutter (The Dirty Mother), mother of Agatha, Agnes and Crescentia Gebhard.M.

Various other vagrants were part of the gang, each for a short period of time before relocating, getting arrested or joining other criminal gangs.  Crimes  Hohenleiter and his gang by Johann Baptist Pflug The crimes perpetrated by Hohenleiter and his gang were mostly arson, burglary, robbery, extortion and theft. They predominantly targeted isolated farms, smallholdings, hamlets and mills, their loot mostly consisting of food, animals, money and clothes. After committing crimes, Hohenleiter and his companions retreated into the dense woods where they had a base near Ostrach, occasionally resurfacing at disreputable country inns. The first reported incidents attributed to Hohenleiter and his gang, was the torching of a mill close to the village of Betzenweiler on 18 December 1817. The same night they also attempted to burgle the mayor of Neufra's house. However, they were disturbed and left without any loot. During 1818 they committed several burglaries in the hamlets of Unterweiler and Waldbeuren, both in the vicinity of Ostrach, as well as in Bellamont, robbing the meat of a whole pig, clothes to the value of 10 guldens, more than 10 litres of brandy, 70 pounds of lard and bread worth 39 guldens. In 1818 the gang also stole a pig, weighing three hundredweight, from an isolated farmstead near Offingen. During this robbery firearms were used to scare off the farmer who wanted to intervene and prevent the loss of his pig.M. Planck, Die letzten R√§uberbanden in Oberschwaben, p. 65ff A few days later the gang raided an isolated farm, Argenhardter Hof, in the vicinity of Tettnang in order to steal money from an old widow who was rumoured to be in the possession of 500 guldens. They threatened the woman to shoot her if she would not surrender the money. This having no effect they began to torture the victim by cutting first her clothes with a knife and then beating her up whereupon the woman fainted. The gang then proceeded to clear the house of all moveable and easily to carry items, mostly food, brandy, beddings and linen, worth more than 400 guldens. Of actual money they only found three Reichsthaler and two guldens. The victim was then bound and shoved through a trapdoor into the cellar. On hearing that the robbers were departing the woman managed to escape only to be caught by two members of the gang who had stayed behind to guard the retreat of the others, and was once more assaulted, bound and locked up in the cellar. Even though the victim freed herself again and managed to alert neighbours of the robbery, the ordeal seemed to have been too much for her so that she died three months later.M. Planck, Die letzten R√§uberbanden in Oberschwaben, p. 85ff In the autumn of 1818 the gang perpetrated a robbery which was later called the \\"Theft of the Ox in Boots\\". A farmer had harnessed an ox and a horse to his cart and left them at the edge of a forest whilst trying to retrieve wood from the forest. Hohenleiter and Merkle, noticing the unguarded team, untied the ox and, after having led it away some distance, pulled boots over the hooves of the animal not to leave any traces behind.M. Planck, Die letzten R√§uberbanden in Oberschwaben, p. 68 In 1819 the gang committed several more burglaries at H√ºttenreute, where the booty was 4 hundredweights of meat worth 53 guldens, and at Wendenreute, where they managed to steal goods to the value of 140 guldens: five hundredweights of meat, flour, lard and a tin plate. During a burglary in Illwangen the gang's booty was 15 pounds of cheese, bread, brandy, a tablecloth and a pair of boots.M. Planck, Die letzten R√§uberbanden in Oberschwaben, p. 78 This summary is not exhaustive and only exemplary of the criminal acts perpetrated by Schwaaz Vere and his partners in crime. Arrest and death Commemorative pole near Ostrach at the place where Hohenleiter and his gang were arrested Tower of the Ehingen Gate in Biberach; place where Hohenleiter was held captive White Tower in Biberach Xaver Hohenleiter in custody In the early months of 1819, the Laubbach M√ºhle, a mill near Ostrach, had been plagued six times by Hohenleiter and his gang. Each time they were trying a break-in in order to get provisioned with food. After unsuccessfully trying to prevent burglaries by patrolling the area, foresters from K√∂nigseggwald changed tactics and laid an ambush at the mill in order to catch Hohenleiter and his gang. On 16 April 1819, Veri and his gang attempted another robbery at the mill during which they were caught in the act by the foresters. The criminals first escaped into the woods but were pursued by the foresters. Later on, the foresters surprised the gang, who were having a meal in the forest, and, after some shots were fired, arrested most of them whilst some managed to flee, only to be arrested by a Baden patrol three days later who incarcerated the lot of them.M. Planck, Die letzten R√§uberbanden in Oberschwaben, p. 101ff Only Joseph Anton Jung (The Pedlar) managed to escape and joined the \\"Rosenberger-Gang\\".J. B. Pflug, Aus der R√§uber- und Franzosenzeit Schwaben, p. 188f The arrested persons were taken to Biberach and imprisoned at various locations within the city. Some were held at the White Tower, whereas others were taken to the so-called Seelhaus ( an old building, originally owned by Beguines, then in the possession of the city), which had iron-barred windows on the ground floor. Xaver Hohenleiter, however, was incarcerated in the Ehingen Tower (Ehinger Turm), together with some of the women of his gang. Hohenleiter was locked up in a cell with a suspect from another band of robbers. Both were bound up in heavy chains. The chains led through a hole in the wall to a chimney upon which they were securely fastened.J. B. Pflug, Aus der R√§uber- und Franzosenzeit Schwaben, p. 189 Four of Hohenleiter's companions managed to escape from captivity only to be caught after four weeks on the run near Ki√ülegg in the Allg√§u. Franz Merkle remained a fugitive from the law for some considerable time and was only arrested in 1823 in Baden. Investigations by the authorities commenced in May 1819 and lasted until 1821. Xaver Hohenleiter, however, never stood trial. On the evening of 20 July 1819 a huge thunderstorm moved over Biberach. Lightning struck the Ehingen Tower and when the doors of the prison were opened, thick smoke billowed out of the cell where Hohenleiter was held and Xaver Hohenleiter was found lying dead on his pallet, having been struck by lightning. When his body was carried outside, his clothes caught fire. Any attempts to revive him proved futile as his injuries were too severe. The right side of his chest down to his loins was entirely burnt. The inner side of his right upper arm was torn up and the skin from his elbow down to his hand had completely disappeared. An investigation, consequently carried out to determine the cause of death of the arrestant, concluded that lightning first struck the weathervane, smashed the roof trusses, toppled the chimney and went down the chimney chase, shattering the fireplaces on the top and third floor without harming any of the inmates imprisoned there. However, it struck Hohenleiter with full force, the iron chain functioning as a conductor. The body of Xaver Hohenleiter was buried in the cemetery of the poorhouse on 21 July 1819.M. Planck, Die letzten R√§uberbanden in Oberschwaben, p. 233ff The grave has since been levelled.  Fate of other members of the gang  Xaver Hohenleiter's brother Ulrich (Der Urle) died of tuberculosis in custody in 1820, being 19 years of age. Fidele Gindele (The Red Butcher) also died of tuberculosis on 8 May 1821, whilst awaiting trial. He had been transferred to Gotteszell jail, formerly a nunnery, due to his illness. The remaining accused were sentenced in March 1824. Joseph Anton Jung (The Pedlar) and Fidelis Sohm (One-eyed Fidele) both received a life-sentence. Joseph Anton Jung received a royal pardon in 1842 and died in Ellwangen (now part of Rot an der Rot) in 1878. Michael Friedrich Ludwig Klump (Handsome Fritz) was sent to jail for 18 years. He died in prison in 1827. Sebastian Kellerman (Baste) was also sentenced to 18 years. Christian Maucher (the Bu√ümannshausen Tailor) went down for four years. Ottilia Hunsinger (Vetters Ottl) was sentenced to six months imprisonment, whereas the other women of the gang received jail sentences between two and three and a half years. Franz Merkle (Weaver Franz) was not apprehended until 1823 and in 1825 he was sentenced to three and a half years imprisonment, which he was to spend in a workhouse. After his release, he seemed to have been unable to stay out of trouble since court records from Constance show that the court there asked for the assistance of the W√ºrttemberg court in Ulm on the matter of an investigation against Merkle who stood accused of criminal acts at the court in Constance.M. Planck, Die letzten R√§uberbanden in Oberschwaben, p. 239ff , 248  Legacy  Xaver Hohenleiter and his gang were the last representatives of banditry in Upper Swabia, so widespread and common during the Ancient Regime.A. Blauert, Sackgreifer und Beutelschneider, p. 92 = Literature = In his volume \\"Poems\\" (Gedichte), published in 1828, Swabian poet Gustav Schwab wrote a poem titled Psalm 104,4 (Angeklopft das Wetter unter Sturm, zu Biberach am S√ºnderturm) about the death of Hohenleiter. A children's book titled Der schwarze Veri. Eine wahre R√§ubergeschichte aus napoleonischer Zeit (\\"The Black Xaver. A True Robber's Story from Napoleonic Times\\") was published in 1995 by Elke Knittel. The book retells the legends surrounding the robber, utilising the original files of the investigation as well as surviving court records. = Music = Ravensburg band Gs√§lzb√§r released a song in which the life of the Schwarze Vere is portrayed. Grachmusikoff, a band from Bad Schussenried, dedicated a song to Schwaaz Vere on their 1994 CD Quasi lebt. = Other = Soon after his death legends about Schwaaz Veri began to evolve. These legends were akin to other legends about notorious criminals by using similar topoi,H. Siebenmorgen, Schurke oder Held?, p. 120 and as late as the beginning of the twentieth century the figure of Schwaaz Vere was still used as a bogeyman figure in Upper Swabian folklore.M. Barczyk, Die Spitzbubenchronik, p. 8 In 1970 a carnival association in Ravensburg decided to name itself after the famous robber: Ravensburger Schwarze Veri Zunft.

She was the eldest daughter of Duke Albert IV of Bavaria-Munich and his wife Kunigunde of Austria. She died later as a bride of the Elector Palatine Louis V.  Life  Sidonie was born on 1 May 1488 in Munich. Her father, Albert had been Duke of Bavaria-Munich since 1465. Her mother, Kunigunde was a daughter of Emperor Frederick III. When she was 14 months old,Marth: Dynastic politics, p. 126 suggested that Albecrt wanted to ensure through this early engagement of his first child with a Wittelsbach that the House of Wittelsbach could retain Bayern-Munich, even if he himself were to die without sons she was promised to Louis of the Palatinate, the oldest son of Count Palatine Philip. A dowry of and a dower of were agreed upon, and her Wittum was to consist of castle and town of Neuenstadt am Kocher near Heilbronn.A copy of this agreement can be found in the Bavarian Main State Archives in the Secret House Archive, document 825 Because of the close relationship of the couple ‚Äî both descended from the Upper Bavarian Duke Louis II and Louis's mother, Margaret, was a sister of Duke George of Bavaria- Landshut ‚Äî a papal dispensation was required for this marriage. It was approved in 1491. Pope Innocent VIII had in February 1490 delegated the investigation necessary for this dispensation to bishop Sixtus of Freising and two clergymen from Munich.Ernest Gleis has published the reports of these clergymen in his Zwei bisher ungedruckte Urkunden, betreffend die beabsichtigte Verm√§hlung der Prinzessin Sidonia, Tochter Herzog Albert‚Äôs IV. mit dem Pfalzgrafen Ludwig, in: Oberbayerisches Archiv, vol. 6, 1844, p. 422‚Äì426 In view of the age of the bride, a marriage would not be possible before the year 1500. During this long engagement, the Palatine branch of the Wittelsbachs investigated other options for Louis, such as he French princess Suzanne of Bourbon-Beaujeu and Mary, the daughter of Duke William IV of J√ºlich and Berg. In 1501 Emperor Maximilian I, who was Kunigunde's brother, suggested that his cousin Sidonie could marry Duke Charles of Guelders. None of these options materialized. The engagement between Sidonie and Louis lasted until her death in late March 1505. It was not broken off when, after the death of Duke George of Bavaria-Landshut in 1503, Bavaria-Munich and the Palatinate found themselves on opposite sides in the Landshut War of Succession. After a rapprochement between the two branches of the House of Wittelsbach, Louis married in 1511 Sidonie's younger sister Sibylle.For Sibylle, see Marth: Dynastische Politik, p. 154‚Äì171 Sidonie was buried in the Frauenkirche in Munich.

It is based in Kumasi in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. BRRI is a research institute. History The institute was established in 1952 and was known as the West African Building Research Institute in Accra. It was made up of building engineers from Ghana and Nigeria. The institute had a name change in 1960 when the institute's members from Nigeria left to form the Nigerian Building and Road Research Institute. This was because Nigeria had gained independence from Britain. It became known as the Building Research Institute of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences. The institute relocated to the campus of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Kumasi in 1963. This was to allow the institute's members to lecture at the university due to university under-staffing. Professional bodies of the institute The institute is made up of various professional groupings. They include architects, engineers, planners, quantity surveyors. Mandate and name change In 1964 the government of Ghana expanded the functions of the institution to include road research. The name of the institution was changed to include the new function to the Building and Road Research Institute. Relocation In 1995, the institute moved from the KNUST campus to it present site at Fumesua in Kumasi. The new site which is about 20 kilometres from the institute's former location is called the Kumasi Science City. It houses research institutions in Kumasi. The other institutions include the Forestry Research Institute of Ghana (FORIG) and the Crops Research Institute (CRI). Aim of the institute The institute was established as a research and development organisation in the construction industry with the purposes of offering research and development products and services to the building and road sectors for the development of Ghana. Vision A centre of excellence that offers a one stop service in the conduct of research, training and technology transfer in the construction and transportation sectors. Mission statement To promote the conduct of demand-driven and problem based research, provide training and technology transfer that links effectively to the socio-economic development of the country particularly the building, road and transport industry. Objectives *To undertake Research and Development of local building materials for shelter construction. *To tailor research and development activities to national needs. *To generate 30% of the institute's budgetary needs. *To undertake public good research. *To embark on profitable contract research with industries. *To improve safety on roads in Ghana. *To undertake research into all aspects of building and road design and construction with the view to ensuring efficiency, safety and economy. *To develop construction materials from local source Researches The institute works on developing alternative building materials that last longer and cost cheaper for the Ghanaian building industry. =Pozzolana Cement= The institute in the 1990s begun researching into Pozzolana cement, an alternative cement to the Portland cement for building. Pozzolana cement cost less than Portland cement. In May, 2007, BRRI and PMC Global Incorporated of America signed a contract for the commercial production of Pozzolana. The agreement included PMC offering 150,000 dollars to BRRI for expansion of the pilot plant for the production of the pozzolana at the institute and land acquisition for the building of a plant by PMC for the production process. Collaborations BRRI has research collaboration with other state and foreign agencies. In 2007, BRRI and the Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL) of the United Kingdom worked together on a program of national studies in Ghana for two years. The purpose of the collaboration was to research into developing building materials that would benefit both bodies. In 2009, the institutes and its Nigerian counterpart (NBRRI) signed a memorandum of understanding to research into building and road construction materials.

In 1674 the hall was sold to Henry Marsden, MP for Clitheroe. It descended to Henry Marsden, who lived at the hall with his younger brother John, known as \\"Silly Marsden\\", and their aunt. Henry died in 1780 from alcoholism and John was induced by his guardian aunt and her ambitious husband to sell the hall and buy Hornby Castle, Lancashire. Wennington was bought in 1788 by the Rev Anthony Lister, who took the surname Marsden. The hall was later sold to Richard Saunders in 1841. The present building on the site, designed by Lancaster architect Edward Graham Paley, was constructed in 1855‚Äì56 for Richard's son William Allen Francis Saunders, High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1862. After him it passed to Charles Morley Saunders and later William Morley Saunders. During the Second World War it housed the Wennington School, who moved to Ingmanthorpe Hall in Yorkshire at the end of the war. It is now a Lancashire Authority boarding school, Wennington Hall School, which was founded in 1954 for boys with learning or behavioural difficulties.

It replaced the company's celebrated Type 163 which itself had done much to revive the company's fortunes in the difficult years directly following the First World War. Many of the car's technical features were highly innovative at the time. The 173's newly developed inline four-cylinder four-stroke 1,525 cc engine was the first Peugeot unit to feature overhead valve gear. Its position was ahead of the driver and it powered the rear wheels via a four-speed gear box at a time when competitor manufacturers reserved four-speed gear boxes for far larger and more expensive models. A maximum power output of 29 hp at 1,900 rpm was claimed. The modern engine/gear-box combination allowed for relatively brisk acceleration and a claimed maximum speed of 75 km/h (47 mph). The braking system on the Type 173 was correspondingly modern, with drum brakes fitted on both axles while Peugeot's rivals were content to fit brakes only on the rear axle. There was only one version, designated the 173 S. The car was more generously proportioned than others in the class, which permitted it to offer an unusually spacious interior. A 2670 mm wheelbase supported an overall vehicle length of 4000 mm. The ‚Äútorpedo‚Äù, and a ‚Äútorpedo sport‚Äù bodies were both configured to accommodate four large people. The Peugeot Type 173 was listed by Peugeot for more than three years, but from 1923 the company was already producing and, from 1924, selling the car's successor, and only 1,002 Type 173s were produced. It was replaced by the Peugeot Type 177 which inherited the 173's engine along with several of its other innovative l features, and which would itself be a mainstay of the Peugeot range virtually till the end of the decade.

Payne, who are the only two judges based out of the Marshall division of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, also have the most patent cases filed before them out of the predominant share of the nation's patent cases that are filed in the Eastern District of Texas. From 2014 to 2015, Judge Gilstrap was ranked first amongst all federal judges (either United States District Judge or United States Magistrate Judge) with the most patent cases filed before him.Michael Chibib, Partner, Austin, TX, Matt Stephens, Associate, San Diego, CA, Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, Part 2: Section 101, Alice & Mayo ‚Äì Litigation Trends for Invalidity Challenges Under Section 101, March 8, 2016, Slide 45/46, http://www.pillsburylaw.com/siteFiles/Events/AliceMayoPresentation.pdf According to Docket Navigator, in 2015 Judge Gilstrap was also ranked first as to the single federal judge having to preside over the highest number of filed cases, the highest number of litigants, and the highest number of accusations.Docket Navigator, 2015 Year In Review: Patent Litigation, Page 23, http://www.sughrue.com/files/Uploads/Documents/Docket%20Navigator%20Year%20in%20Review%202015.pdf Also according to Docket Navigator, Judge Gilstrap is the top ranked (#1) most active federal judge (either District or Magistrate judge) by number of parties, number of orders and by number of cases from the years of 2014 to 2008 (even though he came on the bench in 2011) for patent litigation.Gibbons IP Law Alert, Patent Litigation Statistics, http://www.iplawalert.com/wp- content/uploads/sites/242/2014/03/Patent-Litigation-Research.pdf =Notable decisions= In 2013, Judge Gilstrap presided over the case of TQP Development v. Newegg where the jury ordered Newegg to pay $2.3 million for infringing four asserted claims in a patent involving modem technologies and Internet security systems such as SSL or TLS together with the RC4 Cipher. However in 2015, Judge Gilstrap ruled that Newegg did not infringe TQP Development's patent, effectively overturning the verdict. In 2015, Judge Gilstrap ruled that a $533 Million jury verdict (the largest ever for a Patent assertion entity, Smartflash) in Smartflash, Inc. v. Apple be thrown out due to a faulty jury instruction, and ordered a new trial just on the issue of damages. Also in 2015, Judge Gilstrap denied a request by ZTE Corporation for a new trial after a jury found that it infringed two patents owned by DataQuill covering data entry technology and awarded DataQuill $31.5 Million. In 2015, Judge Gilstrap ordered 35 U.S.C. 285 \\"exceptional case\\" fees to be levied against a notorious Non practicing entity (the worst of them known as Patent trolls), eDekka LLC. He ruled that the case was \\"objectively unreasonable\\" after previously invalidating eDekka's patent under the U.S. Supreme Court case of Alice v. CLS Bank International. In 2016, Judge Gilstrap enhanced damages based on a jury verdict that LG willfully infringed two Standard essential patents (SEPs) owned by Core Wireless covering cellular standards. He previously denied LG's motion for summary judgement that the SEPs were not willfully infringed, letting that issue go to the jury. In 2017, Judge Gilstrap levied sanctions against Patent assertion entity Iris Connex, which had a patent covering phone technology used to take \\"selfies\\". In his Order, Judge Gilstrap mentioned that due to the misconduct of the parties, this was \\"the clearest example of an exceptional case to yet come before\\" him. In June 2017, Judge Gilstrap provided a four-part test in determining venue after the U.S. Supreme Court case of TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC in the case of Raytheon v. Cray, but in September 2017 was overturned by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in response to a petition for writ of mandamus by Cray.In re Cray, Inc., no. 2017-129 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 21, 2017). In September 2019, Judge Gilstrap presided over the first trial on patent- eligible subject matter in the history of the United States. https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2019/09/27/first-jury-verdict-section-101-inquiry- post-berkheimer-finds-asserted-claims-routine-conventional/id=113993/ Judge Gilstrap previously denied a motion for summary judgment that the asserted patents‚Äîbanking patents directed to the electronic transmission of check images‚Äîwere invalid under 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 101. PPS Data, LLC v. Jack Henry & Assocs., Inc., 404 F. Supp. 3d 1021 (E.D. Tex. 2019). In denying the defendant's motion for summary judgment, Judge Gilstrap set forth a novel burden-shifting framework for determining claim representativeness in the context of invalidity defenses. Because each claim is presumed independently valid, Judge Gilstrap held that the defendant must demonstrate \\"that there are no legally relevant distinctions between the claim identified as representative and the remaining asserted claims.\\" Id. at 1030‚Äì31 (citing Solutran, Inc. v. Elavon, Inc., 931 F.3d 1161, 1168 (Fed. Cir. 2019)). Judge Gilstrap's representativeness framework was received positively by commentators, and has been adopted by other judges in the Eastern District of Texas as well as judges in the District of Delaware. See NICE Ltd. v. CallMiner, Inc., Case No. 1:18-cv-02024-RGA-SFA (D. Del. Feb. 3, 2020). Following the denial of the motion for summary judgment and a week-long trial, the jury found by clear and convincing evidence that the asserted patent was invalid for being directed to patent-ineligible subject matter. https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/texas-verdict-may-pave-path-to-more- juries-judging-patents In February 2020, Judge Gilstrap determined that tobacco manufacturer R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company must continue making its full portion of an $8 billion dollar annual payment to the State of Texas pursuant to a 1998 Settlement Agreement.https://news.bloomberglaw.com/product- liability-and-toxics-law/reynolds-owes-for-former-brands-under-1998-tobacco- deal-judge In 1996, Texas brought historic litigation against all major tobacco manufacturers, including Reynolds, asserting that their products injured both Texas citizens and Texas itself, which had to expend money on healthcare for citizens who suffer from tobacco-related illnesses.https://www.law360.com/articles/1247412/rj-reynolds-must-keep- paying-texas-for-98-settlement On the eve of trial in 1998, in exchange for a perpetual release of liability for all claims, Reynolds promised to make an annual payment in perpetuity to compensate Texas for its healthcare costs. However, in 2015, Reynolds sold off several major brands which were subject to the 1998 Settlement Agreement and argued that its sale of the brands extinguished its liability under the settlement. The purchaser of the brands, Imperial Tobacco Group LLC, also denied that it was liable for payments on the brands. Texas argued that a party cannot unilaterally extinguish its contract obligations via an assignment of the contract's subject matter‚Äîotherwise, reimbursement for the billions of cigarettes sold every year under the brands would \\"go up in smoke,\\" to the detriment of the Texas citizenry. Judge Gilstrap agreed with Texas, and held that Reynolds remained liable for its full portion of the $8 billion dollar annual payment to Texas. \\"Reynolds accepted a perpetual release in return for agreeing to make perpetual payments. Nothing that has intervened since then has lessened that obligation. Reynolds remains as liable today as it was when it entered into the Texas Settlement in 1998.\\" Texas v.

Works by Branch are included in the collections of Tate Britain, the Legion of Honor De Young Museum in San Francisco, California, and the St Louis Museum of Art in Missouri. Branch was the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1978, the British Prix de Rome, a DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) Fellowship to Berlin, a sponsorship to Belize from the Organization of American States, and was Artist in Residence at Fisk University in Tennessee. He has been a professor of fine arts and has taught at several art institutions in London and in the US. He has also worked as a theatrical set designer with various theatre groups. As described by art critic Carlos Diaz Sosa, Branch paints \\"abstract canvases in cool, cloudy colours that have a quality which allow the viewer to explore the depths of the mind. Branch uses paint like a symbol, a purely aesthetic language, an illustration of spirit.\\" Sunrise on Bodega Bay by Winston Branch Sunrise on Bodega Bay  Early years and education  Born in Castries, Saint Lucia, Branch attended a Catholic school there, before being sent to London at the age of 12 in the 1960s.Work Talk, BBC Radio 4, November 1992.

He explains: \\"My parents saw I had an aptitude for art and wanted to give me the best opportunity.\\" He studied at the Slade School of Fine Art, University College London, where his talent was recognized early, and after graduating in 1970 he won the prestigious British Prix de Rome, enabling him at the age of 24 to attend the British School at Rome for a year (1971‚Äì72). Critic Amon Saba Saakana notes: \\"Branch had a first hand experience of the Renaissance masters and subsequent developments of art movements in Europe. And though he ingested these European masters, he was searching for a form that incorporated and reflected his beginnings in the Caribbean. Though first working in the figurative tradition, he moved to abstracts as he apprehended the world of colour reflected in the cosmos, lightning, volcanoes, tropical storms, and earthquakes.\\"Saakana, Amon, \\"Winston Branch: A painter at the crossroads\\", Kensington, Chelsea & Westminster Today, 12 October 2015.

He was educated at St Mary Hall, Oxford.Foster, Joseph, ed., Alumni Oxonienses 1500‚Äì1714, (1891), matriculated Oct. 1584 aged 18. In 1599 he travelled to Edinburgh to meet James VI of Scotland. The resident English diplomat organised his kidnap and rendition apparently in the belief that Ashfield was an agent of James VI and working to further his succession to the English throne. In 1606, Ashfield was involved in the rebuilding of Ashridge Priory for Sir Thomas Egerton.Lipscomb, George, The History and Antiquities of the County of Buckingham, vol. 3 (London, 1847), p. 443. In 1612, the author Henry Peacham dedicated his Graphice, or the Auncient Arte of Drawing and Limning to Ashfield, by then Deputy-Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire.Hazlitt, William Carew, Handbook to the Popular Literature of Great Britain (London, 1867), p. 448. An aunt or cousin Cecily Ashfield was married to the Lord Chancellor Sir John Fortescue of Salden.Lodge, Edmund, Illustrations of British History, vol. 2 (John Chidley, London, 1838), p.543, see also VCH Buckinghamshire. Edmund's uncle Thomas Ashfield was a bailiff for the Earl of Oxford in 1571, and Edmund was Thomas's heir in 1609.Page, William, ed., Victoria County History: Buckingham, vol. 3 (1925), Parish of Chesham. Mission to Scotland Edmund Ashfield wrote to James VI offering the advice that he ought to publish books setting forth his claim to the succession to Elizabeth I of England, and showing how he could gain support and rule. This approach was in response to the Jesuit position on the succession, set out in the pseudonymous succession tract by \\"R. Doleman\\". In 1599 he obtained a pass to enter Scotland from Peregrine Bertie, Baron Willoughby, Governor of Berwick upon Tweed and was helped in Scotland by Robert Ker of Cessford.Bain, Joseph, ed., The Border Papers, vol. 2 (London, 1894) p. 610 no.1073 (3) & see also pp. 607‚Äì611, 612, 614, 616‚Äì618. Ashfield spoke to James VI twice, in Edinburgh and during the King's hunting at Colinton.Mackie, J. D., ed., Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 13 part 2 (Edinburgh, 1969), nos.499, 1128. An agent of the Earl of Essex, Thomas Weyman, later wrote that Ashfield had discussed the possibility of James becoming King of England over dinner with some noblemen. The Earl of Cassilis joked: \\"Truly the Englishmen are good husbandmen, and have so well manured their grounds that we shall find a goodly and pleasant dwelling there when we come.\\" Weyman thought that Ashfield's activities would turn James against the Earl of Essex.HMC Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield House, part 9 (London, 1902), p. 308 =On the beach= Seafield near Leith, where Edmund Ashfield was abducted in 1599 When the English ambassador in Scotland William Bowes and Willoughby discovered Ashfield's plans they organised a kidnap. John Guevara, the Deputy Warden of the East Marches and Willoughby's cousin, and three assistants were sent to Edinburgh.Tytler, Patrick Fraser, History of Scotland (1879), bk. 4 chpt 10, p. 273. Willoughby later attributed the plan to his servant Waterhouse.HMC Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield House, part 9 (London, 1902), p. 422. They met Ashfield on the sands at Leith where he was riding with his Scottish friends and, it was alleged, gave him drugged wine, described as if \\"some opium had been given him with his sugar in his wine, which so bedulled his senses as he wist not what he did for the time.\\"Bertie, Georgina, & Bertie, Richard, Five Generations of a Loyal House, part 1,(1845) pp. 347‚Äì348, quoting William Bowes to Robert Cecil, 18 June 1599. Then he was driven away to Berwick in the English ambassador's coach while thinking he was getting a lift back to Edinburgh. Guevara's team were armed only with the rapiers and daggers that they normally carried. Willoughby had also organised a ship to lie off Prestonpans to give support if necessary. Ashfield's papers too were seized in Edinburgh and taken to Berwick. Willoughby wrote to Robert Cecil explaining his actions on 13 June 1599, and refused to return Ashfield to Scotland. =Diplomats expelled= James VI was unsurprisingly indignant at this activity and wrote to Willoughby on 14 June 1599 demanding Ashfield's return or an explanation for \\"the taking away violentlie out of the hart of our country and in sight of our chief palais and eyes of our counsale, ane Inglis gentilman.\\"Bertie, Georgina, Five Generations of a Loyal House, part 1 (1845), pp. 338‚Äì49. However, Willoughby reported that the Protestant clergy of Edinburgh were pleased with the taking of an enemy of religion.Bain, Joseph, ed., The Border Papers, vol. 2 (London, 1894), p. 608 no. 1073, Willoughby to Cecil, 15 June 1599. William Bowes, was forced into virtual house-arrest, and reportedly imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle.Bain, Joseph, ed., The Border Papers, vol. 2 (London, 1894), p. 610 no. 1074. He was recalled and left Scotland shortly afterwards.Mackie, J. D., ed., Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 13 part 1 (Edinburgh, 1969), pp. xx‚Äìxxi. Another English diplomat, George Nicolson, was not involved but felt he was endangered.HMC 'Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield House, part 9 (London, 1902), p. 431. Ashfield meanwhile was kept prisoner at the Tower of London with two Yeomen of the Guard as his warders.Dasent, John Roche, ed., Acts of the Privy Council 1599‚Äì1600, vol. 30 (London, 1905), p. 40. Jonas Waterhouse petitioned for a reward for capturing Ashfield in Scotland.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 14 (London, 1923), p. 113.

CSIR-CRI evolved from the Specialists' branch of the Gold Coast Department of Agriculture. In 1959, the Specialists' branch and the Soil and Land Use Survey Department were merged to form the Scientific Services Division of the then Ministry of Agriculture (MOFA). The Scientific Services Division was transferred to the National Research Council in 1962 and then to the Ghana Academy of Sciences in 1963 and renamed the Agriculture Research Institute (ARI). In October 1963, the Ghana Academy of Sciences reorganized the ARI into two units - Crops Research Unit (CRU) and Soil Research Unit. In 1964, the CRU became a full-fledged Institute and was named the Crops Research Institute (CRI). When the Academy of Sciences was reorganized in 1968 into the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), CRI became one of its Institutes. It was renamed CSIR-Crops Research Institute (CSIR-CRI) in 2006. Vision To become a Centre of Excellence for Agricultural Research, Innovation and Capacity Building for Development. Mission Develop and disseminate environmentally sound technologies and build capacity for sustainable food and industrial crop productivity to enhance livelihoods. Mandate CSIR-CRI is Mandated to research covering the following food and industrial crops: * Cereals (Maize and Rice) * Legumes and Oil seeds (Cowpea, Soybean, Groundnut, and Bambara Groundnut) * Roots and Tubers (Cassava, Yam, Sweetpotato, Cocoyam, and Taro) * Horticultural Crops: ** Plantain and Banana ** Tropical Fruits (Citrus, Mango, Avocado Pear, Pineapple, Cashew, and Pawpaw) ** Vegetables (Pepper, Garden Eggs, Tomato, Onion, and Leafy Vegetables) * Industrial Crops (Rubber, Sugar Cane, Bast Fibres, and Tobacco) Research Programmes Current research programmes seek to improve on the yields of the mandate food crops as well as their resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, make them adaptable to climate change and suitable for various end-user needs. Other areas of research focus are Resource and Crop Management, Seed Technology, Plant Health (comprising Plant Pathology, Virology, Nematology, Entomology, Biological Control and Weed Science) and Post-harvest. The objectives are to develop improved crop varieties, high quality planting materials and sustainable, environmentally-friendly and good production practices, that can be easily adopted by farmers to increase their productivity and also to reduce post-harvest losses. Socio-economic research is also conducted to assess the circumstances of farmers and processors, measure the adoption rates of the Institute's technologies, by the various clients as well as the impact of these technologies and make recommendations. These core programmes are supported by Biometrics, Information Communication Technologies and Technology Transfer activities. Research Facilities CSIR- CRI has its head office at Fumesua (near Kumasi). Facilities available for research activities include: # Outstations in the various agro-ecological zones where research findings / new technologies are tested before they are recommended to farmers. These outstations are located in: Pokuase, Ohawu (coastal savannah), Akumadan, Assin Fosu, Aiyinase (forest Zone) Ejura and Kpeve (Forest-Savannah). # Irrigation facilities for all year round field work # Modern biotechnology laboratory (where students and researchers do their analyses) # Modern automatic HOBO 30 weather equipment to collect climatic data # Seed processing centre to help seed producers to produce high quality seeds # Conference room and Training facilities where training programmes in improved agricultural practices are organized for farmers, extension and research workers # New Infrared Reflectance Spectrometry (NIRS) equipment.

Made in support of Buenos Aires, which had already ousted the viceroy and established a local government during the May Revolution, it is considered the beginning of the Oriental revolution. History =Antecedents= Montevideo and Buenos Aires were part of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata, a Spanish colony in South America. The Peninsular War in Spain generated a political crisis at the Spanish colonies, as the king Ferdinand VII of Spain was captured by the Napoleonic forces. Buenos Aires, the capital of the viceroyalty, ousted the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros in 1810 during the May Revolution, and established a local government, the Primera Junta. Montevideo did not accept the authority of the new Junta, and acknowledged the Cortes of C√°diz as the legitimate Spanish authority. As a result of Buenos Aires's rebellion, Montevideo was appointed the new capital of the Viceroyalty, and governor Francisco Javier de El√≠o was promoted to viceroy. The villages near Montevideo supported El√≠o, while the villages linked to Buenos Aires supported the Junta. El√≠o declared war to Buenos Aires on February 12, 1811. He arranged many new taxes to support the war effort, which harmed the local economy, already weakened by the Peninsular War. =The conflict= Many criollo military enlisted in the Spanish forces defected from them and joined the resistance against Montevideo. This is the case of Jos√© Gervasio Artigas, who defected from Colonia del Sacramento on February 15, asking Buenos Aires support for their rebellion. The rebellion took place on February 28, and it was headed by Venancio Benav√≠dez and Pedro Viera, following instructions from Artigas.Grito de Asencio Nearly a hundred men met next to the Asencio stream, and rejected the authority of El√≠o. the villages of San Carlos, Minas, Maldonado, Durazno, Canelones and Pantanoso soon joined the pronouncing against the Spanish rule.Abad de Santill√°n, p. 475 They captured the village of Mercedes in the morning, and Viera captured Santo Domingo de Soriano in the afternoon, the same day.El grito de Asencio: El inicio de la Revoluci√≥n Artigas joined the fight shortly afterwards. Rosario and San Jos√© de Mayo would be captured in April, followed by the first victory in an open military conflict against the Royalists in the battle of San Jos√©. Legacy The Cry of Asencio is considered the initial step of the Uruguayan theater of the Spanish American wars of independence.

Her father was an officer in the Spanish Army. The benefits of being the daughter of a military officer was that she could afford to obtain an education and to buy books. She was one of the few women in the island who learned to read because at the time, the only people who had access to libraries and who could afford books were either appointed Spanish government officials or wealthy landowners. The poor depended on oral story telling, in what are traditionally known in Puerto Rico as Coplas and D√©cimas. Well educated, Barbudo became interested in politics and social activism. Political activist As a young woman, Barbudo founded a sewing goods store in San Juan, specialising in the sale of buttons, threads and clothes. She eventually became successful as a personal loan provider.

She also received magazines and newspapers from Venezuela which upheld the ideals of Bol√≠var. Held without bail or trial San Juan National Historic Site \\"Castillo (Fort) de San Crist√≥bal\\" The Spanish authorities in Puerto Rico under Governor Miguel de la Torre were suspicious of the correspondence between Barbudo and the Venezuelan rebel factions. Secret agents of the Spanish Government intercepted some of her mail, delivering it to Governor de la Torre. He ordered an investigation and had her mail confiscated. The Government believed that the correspondence served as propaganda of the Bol√≠varian ideals and that it would also serve to motivate Puerto Ricans to seek their independence. Governor Miguel de la Torre ordered her arrest on the charge that she planned to overthrow the Spanish Government in Puerto Rico. Barbudo was held without bail at the Castillo (Fort) de San Crist√≥bal, since the island did not have a prison for women. Among the evidence which the Spanish authorities presented against her was a letter dated October 1, 1824, from Rojas in which he told her that the Venezuelan rebels had lost their principal contact with the Puerto Rican independence movement in the Danish island of Saint Thomas and therefore the secret communication which existed between the Venezuelan rebels and the leaders of the Puerto Rican independence movement was in danger of being discovered.Mar√≠a de las Mercedes Barbudo; Primera mujer independentista de Puerto Rico; CLARIDAD; December 1994; page 19 (Spanish) .

The Government presented as evidence against her various letters which included five letters from Rojas, two issues of the newspaper El Observador Caraque√±o; two copies of the newspaper El Cometa, and one copy each of the newspapers El Constitucional Caraque√±o and El Colombiano, which were sympathetic to Bol√≠var's ideals. When asked if she recognized the correspondence, she answered in the affirmative and refused to answer any more questions. The government also presented as evidence various anti-monarchy propaganda pamphlets to be distributed throughout the island. Barbudo was found guilty. Exile and escape to Venezuela Governor de la Torre consulted with the prosecutor Francisco Marcos Santaella as to what should be done with Barbudo. Santaella suggested that she be exiled from Puerto Rico and sent to Cuba. On October 23, 1824, de la Torre ordered that Barbudo be held under house arrest at the Castillo de San Crist√≥bal under the custody of Captain Pedro de Loyzaga. The following day Barbudo wrote to the governor, asking to be able to arrange her financial and her personal obligations before being exiled to Cuba. The Governor denied her request and on October 28 she was placed aboard the ship El Marinero. In Cuba, she was held in an institution in which women accused of various crimes were housed. With the help of revolutionary factions, Barbudo escaped and went to Saint Thomas Island. She eventually arrived at La Guaira in Venezuela where her friend Jos√© Mar√≠a Rojas met her. They went to Caracas where she met Bol√≠var. Barbudo established a close relationship with the members of Bol√≠var's cabinet which included Jos√© Mar√≠a Vargas. He later was elected as the fourth president of Venezuela. She worked closely with the cabinet. Legacy and honors Barbudo never married nor had any children and did not return to Puerto Rico. She died on February 17, 1849. She was buried in the Cathedral of Caracas next to Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. Interment in the Cathedral was an honor usually reserved only for the church hierarchy and the very rich. In 1996, a documentary was made about her titled Camino sin retorno, el destierro de Mar√≠a de las Mercedes Barbudo (Road of no return, the exile of Mar√≠a de las Mercedes Barbudo).

It is responsible for water treatment and delivery systems in the city of Pittsburgh, as well as the city's sewer system. In a 2010 report, the authority reported 80,557 drinking water service connections and 107,151 sewage connections. The authority claims to serve approximately 83,000 customers. It is estimated that there are 930 miles of water lines and 7,300 Fire Hydrants served by PWSA.  History  The PWSA was created in 1984 to oversee a $200 million capital improvement program focused on Pittsburgh's water treatment and distribution system. This capital improvement program was primarily designed to ensure that the water system would meet various new requirements mandated by federal and state laws pertaining to safe drinking water. The largest project undertaken in the initial years of the PWSA was to cover all open water reservoirs, replace them with closed tanks, or else enact another acceptable solution, such as the installation of a membrane filtration plant at the open Highland Reservoir No. 1, which is the focal point of Highland Park. The City of Pittsburgh Water Department was absorbed by the PWSA in 1995, and in 1999, the PWSA also assumed the responsibility of operating and maintaining Pittsburgh's sewer system.

These lines had been built with lead because it was a readily available material and was easy to work with. However, exposure to lead is directly connected with multiple health problems, particularly in children. No lead is present in water that has been treated by PWSA; lead only enters water through older service lines as it travels to buildings. PWSA has been working in conjunction with local home and business owners to replace these pipes. A more comprehensive and frequently-updated list of current projects may be found on PWSA's main website (https://pgh2o.com/projects- maintenance). Projects conducted by the PWSA typically involve updating older plumbing systems, building new lines, and creating greener solutions to stormwater issues such as parks.

The school is one of several that were evacuated from cities in England at the outbreak of World War II to escape the risk of German bombs. It was known for a progressive, liberal approach to discipline. The school at Huyton Huyton Hill was established in September 1926 with four pupils at Victoria Road in Huyton near Liverpool, England. It is listed in the Liverpool Schools directoryLiverpool Schools D-K with its first headmaster, Hubert D. Butler.Liverpool Schools Teachers The school motto was \\"I will with a good will\\", which set the tone for the ethos of the school and its administration. Huyton Hill was the first school in the country to host its own aircraft landing strip as reported in _Flight Magazine_.Flight Magazine July 8th 1932 Before becoming headmaster, Hubert Butler served in the Flying Corps in World War I as 2nd Lieutenant Flying Officer. Butler became a member of the Incorporated Association of Preparatory Schools (IAPS) in November 1929, as listed in \\"Preparatory Schools Review\\", No. 104, Vol. X.\\"Preparatory Schools Review\\", No. 104, Vol. X. Butler's name also appears in the \\"List of Members and Articles of Association\\", IAPS, January 1930, p. 5.\\"List of Members and Articles of Association\\", IAPS, January 1930, p.5. In the IAPS List of Members and Articles of Association, May 1951, p. 7.,IAPS \\"List of Members and Articles of Association\\", May 1951, p.7. the names of both Butler brothers are listed. Gerald V Butler became a member in 1950. The school in the Lake District In September 1939 at the outbreak of World War II, the school moved to the Lake District where Pull Wood House, at the northwest corner of Windermere just south of Pull Wyke, was rented to accommodate the school. After the war headmaster Butler purchased the house and grounds. Butler's brother Gerard joined him as joint headmaster in 1950, after leaving the army, and the two brothers ran the school until 1969. The number of pupils averaged 60 in the post-war period. The largest class, in 1965, was made up of 74 pupils, but the Pull Wood House couldn't accommodate a larger class so fewer attended in the next few years, with 61 attending in 1967. They were split into two houses, Alfred and Arthur. Brigadier Gordon H. Osmaston joined the school as the mathematics teacher in 1948 after serving in the army in Iraq during World War II. Osmaston was most known for his three years (1936‚Äì1938) surveying and mapping the Himalayas with sherpa Tenzing Norgay.Himalayan Journal 48, 1990‚Äì91, \\"Gordon Osmaston and Tenzing\\" Progressive disciplinary policy The school discipline policy was very progressive for its time, using a system of points that triggered rewards or loss of privileges instead of traditional methods. By the mid 1960s, corporal punishment had been abolished in the school. The points system evolved over time. During the 1950s daily points were given or taken away depending upon behaviour. The boys could earn extra points during holidays by asking their parents to vouch that they had taken a cold bath every morning of the holidays (one point per day) or by pulling willow weeds along the school drive (one point for a hundred willows). A published Conduct List displayed the ranking of boys according to their point score (affectionately known as the 'Spite and Favour' list). In the 1960s every pupil was awarded 10 points a day, making a perfect score for the week 70. Minor infringements could lead to the loss of one or two points, and up to 10 points could be lost for major misbehaviour. Scores were announced at the end of the week, with good conduct badges for those who lost no points and loss of privileges for those who lost too many points. Finishing the week with a negative score led to extra detention. Dormitories The dormitories in the new school facility were named after local mountains in the Lake District as follows: First floor (junior): Dollywaggon, Catbells, Langdale, Helvellyn, Latterbarrow*.

It is located in Wakeham and overlooks Church Ope Cove. The castle is Grade II Listed, as is the adjacent gatehouse and lodges, which are now in separate ownership. After becoming a hotel in 1950, the castle reverted to being a private residence in the 1990s. It is now hired out for functions and events, and is Portland's most expensive residential property. The castle, built of Portland stone, was originally a rectangular block until it was extended in the 20th-century. It also has projecting corner turrets, embattled parapets and a circular tower. History The castle was built in 1797-1800 to designs by the architect James Wyatt for John Penn, Governor of Portland and grandson of William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania. Penn discovered the area on one of his trips with King George III, and subsequently chose it for a marine mansion. King George III's daughter Princess Elizabeth officially opened the mansion in 1800. A few years later, Penn had a bath built below the gardens of the castle, during a time when sea bathing was popular. However, when it was completed, Portland's Court Leet demanded rent for its use as it was built on common land. Penn refused to pay and the bath was abandoned. The castle later appeared as \\"Sylvania Castle\\" in Hardy's 1892 novel The Well- Beloved. During World War II, Winston Churchill, General Eisenhower and General de Gaulle visited the castle, where they met to finalise their plans for the Normandy landings. In 1950, the private residence was turned into a hotel, known as \\"The Pennsylvania Castle Hotel\\", which continued to operate into the 1990s. The mansion then reverted to a private house and was sold again in 2011 for ¬£4 million to a buyer from Australia. The castle was then made available as a holiday home, also catering for weddings, private and corporate functions and other events.

Her original handmade creations have been in museum gift shops or at museum events, including the African American Museum in Hempstead, New York (1992-1993), Brooklyn Museum (1997), Polk Museum of Art (November 2010) and Polk Museum of Art Gift Shop (2011). Some of her crocheted wall hangings with afrocentric, nature, or other themes and other creations have appeared in publications (1986, 1992, 1993), at events, stores or expos (1970's to present on and off), and on a public access television show in New York (1993). To showcase African history and culture, Ms. Chamblin created unique crocheted wall hangings, including a rendition of King Tut in a mixture of brown yarns and gold metallic yarn, a door size hanging of Queen Nefertiti's bust, the Egyptian Pyramids at Giza, African adinkra symbols and other African centered items including beaded wooden jewelry and crocheted pendants. These afrocentric creations were featured in a monthlong exhibit in the main showcase windows at the Wyandanch Public Library, Long Island, New York in 1992. Ms. Chamblin's first published works (swan and robin crocheted wall hangings) appeared in Family Circle Fashions and Crafts magazine in 1986. Delores Chamblin, a mother of three, is a graduate of the famous Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and a graduate of Tufts University. She is an award winning designer and poet, a crochet business owner (AfriCreations), a member of The Crochet Guild of America and a former member of 100 Black Women of Long Island (1993-1994).

He is a specialist in medicine and allied sciences in the history of East-West cultural exchange. In 1984 he was granted tenure as the first foreigner in a Japanese national universityFirst Tenure for Foreigner in Kyushu University - Associate Professor Michel. Important Step towards Internationalization. Mainichi News, 16 March 1984, p. 18 (in Japanese)..  Research topics  * Western medicine and allied sciences in early modern Japan. * History of \\"Dutch Learning\\" (Rangaku) and \\"Western Studies\\" (y√¥gaku) in early modern Japan * Acupuncture and moxibustion in Europe (16‚Äì19th century) * Eclecticism and indigenous knowledge in early modern Japanese medicine By combining Japanese and Western manuscript sources, Michel shed new light on Western medicine and allied sciences in early modern Japan and the interdependence of Western studies on Eastern medicine and Japanese studies on Western medicine. His research clarified the mechanism of early medical interactions between Japan and Europe and induced a revision of the concept of ‚ÄòDutch Studies‚Äô (rangaku) in Edo period Japan. The beginning of Western medicine in Japan is shown as a result of structural conditions, political strategies, individual ambitions and occasional events. At the same time, the introduction of Western treatment methods strongly influenced Japanese research in related fields such as botany and pharmaceutical production techniques while stimulating language studies and the import of Western books. In contrast to previous research on these matters, Michel demonstrates that this change was supported by the Tokugawa shogunate and began soon after the ‚Äòclosure‚Äô of Japan (Sakoku) in mid-17th century.Josef Kreiner, Buchbesprechung I, OAG Notizen, No.11, 1999, pp.25-30 The names of some of the Europeans who introduced Western medicine to Japan can also be found in publications on the history of traditional Chinese medicine in Europe. Michel demonstrated that considerable parts of their reports are actually reflecting genuine Japanese innovations that were not known in China. According to Michel, early modern traditional Japanese medicine (TJM) is clearly distinguished from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and deserves its own place in Far Eastern medical traditions.Michel- Zaitsu (2017) Furthermore, Michel brought to light the biographical background and historical influence of numerous personalities involved in early modern exchange between Japan and the West. Especially his writings on Caspar Schamberger, father of the first Japanese school of Western-style surgery, and Engelbert Kaempfer, author of the famous ‚ÄúHistory of Japan‚Äù, are regarded as pioneering contributions. Michel‚Äôs critical edition of Kaempfer‚Äôs unpublished manuscripts provided a more solid foundation for studies on the history of Western observations on Edo-period Japan and the perception of Japan during the Age of Enlightenment.Uta Lindgren: Engelbert Kaempfer, Werke.

It adheres to a conventional Catholic Trinitarian theology, professes the Nicene Creed, and considers Jesus to be the Son of God and redeemer of humanity, uniting Christians through Baptism and the Eucharist. Its liturgy is also similar to that of the Roman Catholic Church, but it is independent and not under the jurisdiction of the Vatican or the Roman Catholic hierarchy; it is thus considered to be one of the Independent Catholic Churches. It is also considered an offshoot of the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church.Edward Jarvis, God, Land & Freedom: the true story of ICAB, Apocryphile Press, Berkeley CA, pp 169-170 While the ECC shares core Christian beliefs with the Roman Catholic Church and many Protestant and Orthodox denominations, it is much more liberal on many social issues., www.ecumenicalcatholicchurch.org History The Ecumenical Catholic Church was founded in Santa Ana, California in 1987, The first edition of its canon law being completed and ratified on January 11, 1987.Shirilau, Mark, History and Overview of the Ecumenical Catholic Church: The First Ten Years, (1995.

Its lineage of bishops sits within the vast dynasty of Castillo Mendez.\\"Edward Jarvis, God, Land & Freedom: the true story of ICAB, Apocryphile Press, Berkeley CA, p 170 On the Feast of Pentecost, May 19, 1991, Father Mark Steven Shirilau was consecrated bishop by Donald Lawrence Jolly (an Independent Catholic bishop) at the bishop's home chapel in San Bernardino, California., www.tboyle.net, an online directory of independent Catholic bishops. At the same service, Deacon Jeffery Shirilau, a non-ordained deacon of the Metropolitan Community Church, was ordained to the diaconate by Bishop Donald. Bruce David LeBlanc, a community college professor, became the first priest ordained by Bishop Shirilau. He was ordained on July 27, 1991, in Pocatello, Idaho(p. 35). LeBlanc was later consecrated bishop and served Holy Spirit Ecumenical Catholic Church in Davenport, Iowa before becoming the founding bishop of the Transformational Catholic Church. 100px Growth The ECC grew rapidly across the United States in the early 1990s. In 1994 regional deans were appointed, and on July 8, 1995, the four deans were consecrated as bishops by Bishop Mark Shirilau at an ordination liturgy held at the First Congregational United Church of Christ in Santa Rosa, California. The four new bishops were Robert Wayne Martin of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Michael Robert Frost of Plattsburgh, New York, Denis Armand Martel of New Orleans, Louisiana, and Richard John Cardarelli of Hartford, Connecticut. At the same liturgy the new bishops presented and vested Bishop Mark with a pallium and proclaimed him archbishop; the pallium was a personal gift to Archbishop Mark from Bishop Daniel James Dahl of the Inclusive Orthodox Church in Honolulu, Hawaii. Archbishop and Primate Mark Shirilau unexpectedly died January 12, 2014, while on an episcopal visit in Sicily. Following his sudden death, the Council of Bishops named Bishop David John Kalke to succeed him as Archbishop and Primate and the ECC's headquarters relocated to Guadalajara, Mexico.

It has been called 'a poem in clockwork'. The watch is thought to have been commissioned in 1783 by Count Hans Axel von Fersen, an admirer and alleged lover of the French Queen, Marie Antoinette. Work on the watch was begun in 1782 and completed by Breguet's son in 1827, four years after Breguet's death. The watch is a central plot point in the novel The Grand Complication by Allen Kurzweil. History The watch is thought to have been commissioned in 1783 by Count Hans Axel von Fersen, an admirer and alleged lover of the French Queen, Marie Antoinette. It took forty four years to complete. Marie Antoinette did not live to see the watch, as it was completed 34 years after she was executed. Work stopped for around seven years (1789‚Äì1795) during the period of Breguet's exile. The \\"Marie Antoinette\\" remained in the possession of the Breguet company until it was sold to Sir Spencer Brunton in 1887, eventually finding its way into the collection of Breguet expert Sir David Lionel Salomons in the 1920s. On his death in 1925, Salomons bequeathed 57 of his best Breguet pieces (including the \\"Marie Antoinette\\") to the L.A. Mayer Institute for Islamic Art in Jerusalem. It was stolen from the museum in 1983 by master-thief Na'aman Diller but was recovered in 2007. In 2013, the watch was valued at $30 million. Construction Breguet No.160, Marie-Antoinette pocket watchThe watch was to contain every watch function known at that time, including the following: * Clock * Perpetual calendar * Minute repeater * Thermometer *Chronograph * Power reserve * Pare-Chute (shock protection system, Breguet's own invention) * Chime * Independent seconds hand Even by the standards of the day it was an astronomically expensive piece. The most valuable materials (including gold, platinum, rubies and sapphires) were used with no limit placed on time or cost. The watch is encased in gold, with a clear face that shows the complicated movement of the gears inside. Breguet used sapphires in the mechanism to decrease friction. Breguet company records indicate that the factory costs eventually came to the colossal sum of 30,000 francs. This is more than six times the cost of Breguet's other major work, No. 92, which was sold to the Duc De Preslin for 4800 francs. Replica Watchmakers from Breguet, supported by Swatch chairman Nicolas Hayek, were commissioned to make a copy of the watch in 2005. The watch was finished after three years and presented to the public in an oak case, made from Marie-Antoinette's favourite tree in France.

It is located east of the FDR Drive just north of East 34th Street in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. The facility, owned by the city, received Federal Highway Administration funding for improvements for docking facilities and upgrading the adjacent East River Greenway in 2008. A new terminal building was built and opened in 2016. Service is provided by private operators SeaStreak and NYC Ferry, which also operates a free transfer bus loop in Midtown East. There is a M34 Select Bus Service bus stop adjacent to the ferry landing; the M15 local, M15 Select Bus Service and the M34A Select Bus Service have stops in the immediate vicinity at the intersection of First Avenue and East 34th Street. The East 34th Street Heliport is also on the waterfront south of the ferry landing. History A ferry crossing between Hunter's Point and 34th Street was established circa 1858 and later came under the control of Long Island Rail Road (LIRR). In 1905, the LIRR expanded the terminal between 33rd and 34th Streets which had five slips and was able to accommodate automobiles, and is now the site of the heliport. Service was discontinued in 1925 after numerous tunnel and bridge crossings had been built. Connecting mass transit service was provided by the 34th Street Ferry elevated station which was located east of First Avenue and operated from 1880 to 1930. In the 1990s several proposals and various attempts were made to restore service to landings in the vicinity of 34th Street, among them an Upper East Side ‚Äì Wall Street commuter service, a short-lived shuttle to La Guardia Airport and a fast ferry to Staten Island. Restoration of the traditional Hunters Point crossing was initiated and soon abandoned by NY Waterway. By the mid-2000s New York Water Taxi was regularly serving East 34th Street landings on the Hunters Point crossing and other routes. After a request for bids, the New York City Economic Development Corporation in 2011 awarded NY Waterway a three-year contract and a $3 million annual subsidy to operate ferry service on the East River including 34th Street. In the aftermath of infrastructure damage and service disruptions to the New York City Subway system in Queens and Brooklyn caused by Hurricane Sandy on October 29, 2012, SeaStreak began running weekday ferry service between East 34th Street and Rockaway Park, Queens, with additional stops at Pier 11 and Brooklyn Army Terminal. Although the service proved popular, it was ultimately discontinued on October 31, 2014 when the city government declined to continue subsidizing it. Service =SeaStreak= Seastreak Wall Street docked at the East 34th Street Ferry Landing. SeaStreak catamarans operate daily to the Raritan Bayshore in Monmouth County, New Jersey. After calling at Pier 11/Wall Street boats continue through The Narrows to terminals at Atlantic Highlands or Highlands. Seasonal excursions includes service to Sandy Hook, West Point, NY, Cold Spring, NY, and Martha's Vineyard. =New York Water Taxi= New York Water Taxi operates a shuttle service for NYU Langone Hospital between 34th Street and the Brooklyn Army Terminal. This service is primarily for hospital employees only. =NYC Ferry= NYC Ferry's East River Ferry (formerly operated by NY Waterway) operates in both directions to Pier 11 at Wall Street, stopping at Hunters Point South in Long Island City, Queens and multiple ferry landings in northern Brooklyn, with year-round service Additionally, the Astoria Ferry runs in both directions to Pier 11 or Astoria, Queens, with year-round service.

The nuncios were accredited to the Archbishop-Electorates of Cologne, Mainz and Trier. It was a diplomatic post of the Holy See, whose representative was called the Apostolic Nuncio at Cologne, one of the states of the Holy Roman Empire. The office of the nunciature was located in Cologne until 1795, when France occupied the city. The last nuncio, officiating until 1804, resided in Augsburg, while the Archbishop-Electorate had been dissolved in 1803. Two nuncios and one apostolic delegate at Cologne later became popes, to wit Pope Urban VII, Pope Alexander VII and Pope Leo XII. History An apostolic nuncio at Cologne was appointed in 1584 on the instigation of Emperor Rudolph II of the Holy Roman Empire. Following the Council of Trient, apostolic delegates had already been appointed at Cologne in order to contain the spreading of Protestantism in the Empire. The Archbishop-Electorate of Cologne was chosen for being a stronghold of Catholicism in the northwest of the Empire in vicinity to areas where Calvinism (Bremen, Dutch Republic, East Frisia, Lippe) and Lutheranism (elsewhere in Northern Germany) were gaining more and more support. The Rhenish Archbishop-Electorates were further important as providing already three of the then-seven votes within the election body for the imperial successors. The political role of the apostolic nuncio at Cologne was essential for participating in some events of political life of the Empire such as the imperial diets (in 1594 and 1622) and the imperial elections in Frankfurt upon Main (in 1612 and 1658). The nuncio also participated in the negotiations of the Peace of Westphalia (1644-1648) in M√ºnster and Osnabr√ºck, ending the Thirty Years' War, the Treaty of Aix-la- Chapelle (1668), Cologne's abandon in the Franco‚ÄìDutch War (1673-1674), and the Peace of Utrecht (1713). Besides Cologne, Mainz, and Trier, the nuncios could wield their jurisdiction undisputedly for the prince-bishoprics of Hildesheim, Li√®ge, Osnabr√ºck, Paderborn, and W√ºrzburg. In 1596, the Low Countries (Netherlands) were detached from the nunciature of Cologne, receiving their own nuncio in Brussels. On the instigation of Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria, another nunciature was established by Pope Pius VI in Munich. This caused a conflict between the nunciature at Cologne and the Apostolic Nunciature to Bavaria as to their competences. The appointment of Giulio Cesare Zoglio as Bavarian nuncio angered the archbishop-electors of Cologne, Mainz, and Trier, who considered the nuncio to Cologne to be competent for all the Empire. Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, sided with the electors, and declared he would recognise nuncios in their \\"political character\\" only. The nunciature at Cologne ceased to exist in 1804. After the Congress of Vienna, the nunciature was not reestablished, while the Bavarian nunciature, also interrupted in 1800 during the Napoleonic Wars, resurged in 1818 and persisted until 1934. Germany as a whole concluded diplomatic ties with the Holy See on 1 May 1920, establishing the Apostolic Nunciature to Germany.

He was also a Broadway stage, network television, cabaret and International Ice Capades choreographer. Fletcher is identified as a ‚ÄúPilates Elder‚Äù ‚Äì a ‚Äúfirst-generation teacher‚Äù who studied directly under Joseph and Clara Pilates. Originally referred to Joseph Pilates by fellow dancer, Allegra Kent, for treatment of a chronic knee injury, Fletcher was schooled in the principles of Body Contrology (the name Pilates gave to his fitness and conditioning method) by Joseph and Clara Pilates with whom he studied - in their New York City studio at 939 8th Avenue \\\\- on and off from 1948 until one year after Joseph Pilates‚Äô death in 1967.  Career  Following his turn with the Martha Graham Company, Fletcher was cast by Japanese choreographer Yeichi Nimura, alongside Yul Brynner and Mary Martin, in the role of Imperial Attendant (142 performances) in Nimura‚Äôs 1946 Broadway and London productions of The Lute Song. Following his professional dance career, Fletcher‚Äôs principal avocation, and that for which he became widely known in the entertainment industry, was choreography. Fletcher worked from the late 1940s until 1971 as a theater, network television, nightclub stage, film and International Ice Capades choreographer. He set dance numbers in New York City for Broadway musicals including 1951‚Äôs long-running ‚ÄúTop Banana‚Äù (350 performances) as well as for Radio City Music Hall, Roxy Theatre, Latin Quarter and Copacabana stage dance/musical productions. In television‚Äôs early days in New York City he worked as both dancer and choreographer for the prime-time television studio production of the ‚ÄúNBC All Star Revue‚Äù where his featured dance partner was Tallulah Bankhead. Between 1954 and 1967 Fletcher choreographed shows in Chicago at Chez Paris; in San Francisco at Le Club; and in New Orleans at the Beverly Club. He was also lead choreographer in Paris at the Le Lido for four years where, among other things, he and long-time collaborator, Donn Arden, created ‚ÄúGala‚Äù a show which included skaters on a tank of ice on stage. During that period, Fletcher also choreographed the large-scale Italian production of the 1965 musical ‚ÄúIl Diplomatico‚Äù at Teatro Milano as well as the 1954 film version of ‚ÄúTop Banana‚Äù and 1961‚Äôs comedy ‚ÄúSnow White and the Three Stooges.‚Äù The use of ice skaters in a dance number drew on Fletcher‚Äôs experience, continuous from 1954 to 1967, as lead choreographer for the International Ice Capades. During his tenure, featured performers included US figure skating champion Donna Atwood, and world skating champion, Alena Vrzanova, better known as Aja Zanova, who claimed, it was Ron Fletcher who ‚Äúmade me a star.‚Äù Each year, after setting choreography for the Ice Capades‚Äô season, Fletcher regularly choreographed shows in Las Vegas at the Desert Inn, Moulin Rouge, Latin Quarter, The Dunes and The Flamingo hotels for the likes of Pearl Bailey, Vic Damone, Shirley Jones, Paula Kelly, Tallulah Bankhead and Jane Kean (with whom he also partnered on stage).  The Ron Fletcher Studio, Beverly Hills, CA  Though Fletcher achieved significant notice in the entertainment industry for his choreography, he is best known in the 21st century for having introduced the Pilates conditioning method, from its home base in New York City, to the American west coast via his Ron Fletcher Studio for Body Contrology, which he opened May 1, 1972 on Rodeo Drive at Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California. Fletcher‚Äôs approach to the Pilates method ‚Äì originally referred to as ‚ÄúThe Ron Fletcher Work‚Äù or ‚ÄúFletcher Work‚Äù, (today, simply Fletcher Pilates¬Æ) ‚Äì incorporated Graham-based elements of movement and dance into the equipment-centric structure of Joseph Pilates‚Äô original creation. Fletcher was the first to ‚Äútake the Pilates work vertical.‚Äù Fletcher‚Äôs new studio attracted well-known film personalities such as Ali MacGraw, Barbra Streisand, Candice Bergen and Katharine Ross, as well as studio executives, celebrities, dancers and many prominent and influential members of Hollywood society including Betsy Bloomingdale and Nancy Reagan. Fletcher‚Äôs development of his now-trademarked Floorwork and Towelwork - machine-less applications of the Pilates principles that could be performed in a studio, home or workshop setting - was crucial to the spread of the Pilates method. Writing for The Guardian in June, 2008 (‚ÄòPilates is an Art‚Äô), investigative reporter Alice Wignal concluded, ‚Äúif Fletcher hadn't come up with a way for people to practise the method without needing the equipment, you probably wouldn't have heard of Pilates at all.‚Äù By the late 1970s, as the original Pilates studio was ‚Äúwithering away in New York,‚Äù Fletcher‚Äôs high- profile name, and his celebrated Hollywood clientele, led to a renaissance of the work that is largely credited with keeping the Pilates name alive and in front of the public. Publicity Beginning with features in The Los Angeles Times and Vogue Magazine in 1971, the decade that followed found Fletcher‚Äôs studio and his take on the Pilates method featured in Good Housekeeping, Cosmopolitan, Town & Country, Ladies Home Journal, Women‚Äôs Wear Daily, Self and Beverly Hills Times Magazine, among others. Ron Fletcher#Archival References  The Ron Fletcher Program of Study  A comprehensive formal education curriculum called The Ron Fletcher Program of Study was established in 2003 for the purpose of training and qualifying new Fletcher Pilates teachers as well as for the accurate preservation of Fletcher‚Äôs approach to the Pilates method. Headquartered in Tucson, Arizona, it is based on the apprenticeship-learning model Fletcher experienced as a student and disciple of Joseph and Clara Pilates. In July 2005, The Ron Fletcher Program of Study was licensed, according to the criteria for post-secondary education, as a school by the State of Arizona. The comprehensive Fletcher Pilates education program and continuing education courses are now being conducted on five campuses in the United States as well as in Canada, Mexico, Colombia, Australia, Singapore,Italy, London, Tokyo and Madrid. On December 23, 2008, the US Patent and Trademark Office registered to Ron Fletcher exclusive-use rights to, and trademark protection of, the term ‚ÄúFletcher Pilates.‚Äù Fletcher died of congestive heart failure in Stonewall, Texas in 2011.

The ride was first installed at Warner Bros. Movie World on the Gold Coast, Australia in 1992, before being installed at Warner Bros. Movie World in Bottrop, Germany and Parque Warner Madrid in Madrid, Spain in 1996 and 2002, respectively. The installations in Germany, Australia and Spain later closed in 2004, 2011 and 2014, respectively. History On 23 December 1992, Warner Bros. Movie World in Australia opened the US$9 million Batman Adventure ‚Äì The Ride motion simulator ride. The ride was based upon Tim Burton's Batman films, the second of which was released earlier that year. In 1996, Batman Abenteuer (Batman Adventure) opened with Warner Bros. Movie World in Germany. The ride was identical to the version that opened in Australia many years prior. In 2001, Warner Bros. Movie World in Australia revamped their ride and renamed it Batman Adventure ‚Äì The Ride 2. As part of this process the original live-action film was scrapped in favour of computer-generated high-definition film developed by Blur Studio. The new film featured elements from four of the Batman films as well as the animated series franchise released before Batman Begins. On 6 April 2002, a third installation of the ride opened at Warner Bros. Movie World Madrid (now Parque Warner Madrid) in their DC Super Heroes World section. The new animated film was utilised along with 3D technology. The ride operates under the name Batman: La Sombra del Murci√©lago (Batman: Shadow of the Bat). On 3 April 2004, Warner Bros. Movie World in Germany was acquired by StarParks. This acquisition resulted in various Warner Bros.-licensed properties being removed from the park including DC Comics and Looney Tunes. The following year, Movie Park Germany opened with Batman Adventure ‚Äì The Ride being rethemed to Time Riders. In September 2011, Warner Bros. Movie World in Australia announced that Batman Adventure ‚Äì The Ride 2 would be closed on 15 October 2011 to make way for a new attraction. Its replacement, Justice League: Alien Invasion 3D, opened on 22 September 2012. As of December 2012, the ride is still operating in Parque Warner Madrid. Ride experiences The exterior fa√ßade of Batman Adventure ‚Äì The Ride at Warner Bros. Movie World in Australia =Batman Adventure ‚Äì The Ride (a.k.a. Batman Abenteuer)= Guests were admitted into Wayne Manor as Gotham City on a tour of the library before entering the Batcave. Guests would be given an overview of the storyline in these two pre-show rooms. The live-action film revolved around Batman's quest to save kidnapped children in Gotham City. Riders would experience the adventure from Batman's point of view (in the tracking module vehicle). The ride is strongly based on the Batman Returns movie, featuring appearances from the Penguin, Catwoman and the Red Triangle Circus gang. =Batman Adventure ‚Äì The Ride 2 (a.k.a. Batman: La Sombra del Murci√©lago)= Guests were admitted into Wayne Manor as Gotham City Police Cadets on a tour of the library. Guests were shown a short video detailing WayneTech's latest developments such as the Gotham City Security Network and the new reconnaissance fleet of aircraft, similarly styled to the Batwing in the 1989 film. This clip was introduced by the chief of the Wayne Foundation, Lucius Fox. Just as Mr. Fox started explaining the new network, they were interrupted by an alert directly from Arkham Asylum, Gotham City's maximum security facility for the city's worst felons. He remarked that it's \\"probably a false alarm but it doesn't pay to take chances\\". Batgirl linked to the computer from the Batcave to find that all of Gotham's forces are converging on Arkham Asylum. The television screen would go blank. A guide would then open the secret bookcase revealing the Batcave entrance as you walk through the Batcave tunnel through to the grouping queues you may hear dripping water and murmurs of bats flying. As guests reach the end of the queue lines the guide announces \\"I now present to you the Gotham City security network\\". At this moment several doors would open to reveal the network. It included 14 minor video monitors and one huge projection screen in the middle as well as Batman's controls in front of the screen. There was an animatronic Batman who talks in the Batcave sitting at the desk with his back facing the audience. Guests were seated in the audience and witness a second pre-show video introducing the mission to retrieve the Whitney diamond, stolen earlier from the Gotham Museum of Art. This was stolen earlier by Catwoman and is used to power a freeze cannon operated by Mr. Freeze. Guests were then split up into groups of 20 and admitted into separate simulators where the ride would take place. Once the ride began, guests were taken on a chase through the streets of Gotham City in the pursuit of the Joker, Catwoman and Mr. Freeze. As the ride featured sudden movements, it was not suitable for those who suffer from motion sickness. For this reason, Movie World operated the ride without the motion at least once a day. When guests exited the ride they were greeted with the set of the tracking module crashing in to the Penguin's Arctic World Lair. Ride system The ride system used for Batman Adventure ‚Äì The Ride was developed by California-based McFadden Systems, Inc. who specialised in motion platforms for military-style flight simulators. Batman Adventure ‚Äì The Ride was the company's first amusement ride. Guests were admitted into one of six vehicles which each seat 20 riders. Each of these vehicles were mounted on motion bases which allow six degrees of freedom. Reception Following the opening of Batman Adventure ‚Äì The Ride in Australia, Warner Bros. Movie World saw a record spike in attendance. Approximately 12,000 guests visited the park on 30 December 1992. This spike was attributed to the opening of the ride. By 1998, an average of 10,500 tours were being run by Warner Bros. Movie World every year. This number eventually peaked at 20,000 tours per year. In 2003, Warner Bros. Movie World in Australia saw a drop in park-wide attendance numbers. This was attributed to the SARS outbreak and the Iraq War. The reduced attendance saw Warner Bros. Movie World begin alternating ride operations with Batman Adventure ‚Äì The Ride 2 operating from 10am until 11:15am, and from 3pm to 5pm. The popularity of the ride in Australia decreased in the late 2000s. Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider identified that the ride felt outdated and was in need of a major overhaul. On 15 October 2011, Warner Bros. Movie World closed the ride permanately.

It was a diplomatic post of the Holy See, whose representative was called the Apostolic Nuncio to Bavaria, a state ‚Äì consecutively during the nunciature's existence ‚Äì of the Holy Roman Empire, of its own sovereignty, and then of Imperial, Weimar and finally Nazi Germany. The office of the nunciature was located in Munich from 1785 to 1936. Prior to this, there was one nunciature in the Holy Roman Empire, which was the nunciature in Cologne, accredited to the Archbishop-Electorates of Cologne, Mainz and Trier. History A new nunciature was established by Pope Pius VI in Munich in 1785, requested by Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria. The appointment of Giulio Cesare Zoglio as nuncio angered the archbishop-electors of Cologne, Mainz, and Trier, who considered the Nuncio to Cologne to be competent for all the Empire. Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor sided with the electors, and declared he would recognise nuncios in their \\"political character\\" only. Thus, there were two nuncios: one in Cologne, and one in Munich, the division of whose jurisdictions was a matter of contention. With the Archbishop-Electorates of Cologne, Mainz, and Trier occupied by France and dissolved in 1795 and 1803, respectively, the last nuncio to Cologne, Annibale della Genga, had to reside in Augsburg, which was annexed to Bavaria in 1803. With the dissolution of the Empire in 1806 Bavaria gained full sovereignty, and the tradition of the nuncio to Cologne was continued by the nuncio to Austria in Vienna, competent for the Empire of Austria only. In the years 1800‚Äì1818 the nunciature was suppressed due to Napol√©on's pressure on the Vatican. However, after the Bavarian Concordat (1817) the ties were revitalised in 1818. Thus Austria and the Kingdom of Bavaria maintained their separate relations to the Pope, also after both had joined the German Confederation in 1815, which was no state, but a mere confederacy. Whereas the prevailingly Lutheran or Calvinist German states within the confederacy, disestablished in 1866, had no diplomatic ties with the Holy See. None of the states of the North German Confederation, a confederacy without Austria and Southern Germany, had ties to the Vatican. When most German states, but not Austria, merged with the North German Confederation in order to form the federal united German Empire in 1871, Bavaria was the only member state with a nunciature. Eugenio Pacelli (future Pope Pius XII), the penultimate nuncio to Bavaria. When the Bavarian monarchy became the Free State of Bavaria after the abdication of the king, like all German monarchies and the Empire became republics, the diplomatic ties continued as German states are generally allowed to have foreign relationships. In 1920 Germany concluded formal diplomatic ties with the Vatican, so that Eugenio Pacelli, Nuncio to Bavaria, was appointed the first nuncio to Germany in personal union. However, the nunciature to Germany remained seated in Munich, since Berlin, simultaneously the capital of Germany and Prussia, was located in the latter, not holding official ties with the Holy See. Pacelli concluded the new Bavarian Concordat (1924) with the Free State. In 1925 the Free State of Prussia, the biggest German state, concluded diplomatic relations with the Vatican, so that Pacelli resigned as Nuncio to Bavaria in order to become the first nuncio to Prussia in personal union with nuncio to Germany, opening a nunciature in Berlin. He then negotiated the Prussian Concordat (1930), before he was appointed Cardinal Secretary of State negotiating the Reichskonkordat, finally concluded with Nazi Germany in 1933. When the streamlining Nazi Gleichschaltung did formally away with statehood of the German states and established a centralised dictatorship in 1934, Bavaria was not to hold diplomatic ties of its own any more. While Pacelli managed to continue the nunciature to Bavaria as a kind of outpost of the nunciature to Germany, the Nazi government prompted the expulsion of the last nuncio to Bavaria in 1936.

The deportation of Germans from Romania after World War II, conducted on Soviet order early in 1945, uprooted 60,000 to 75,000 of Romania's Germans to the USSR; at least 3,000 of the deportees died before release. The deportation was part of the Soviet plan for German war reparations in the form of forced labor, according to the 1944 secret Soviet Order 7161. Most of the survivors returned to Romania between late 1945 and 1952, with a smaller part settling in different parts of Germany. Germans in Romania German-speaking populations arrived on the territory of present-day Romania in different waves or stages of settlement, initially as early as the High Middle Ages, firstly to southern and northeastern Transylvania then subsequently during the Modern Age in other Habsburg-ruled lands such as Banat or Bukovina.  Various plans for the transfer of the German population  Plans for transfer of the German population from Romania to Germany existed at least since 1939, but were abandoned during World War II. The idea re-emerged, at the proposal of the German government, after Romania left the Axis and joined the Allies. The proposal was received favourably by the Romanian foreign minister Grigore Niculescu-Buze»ôti and the SƒÉnƒÉtescu government, the only opposition coming from the representatives of the Communist Party. The proposal was put forward to the Soviets for approval during the armistice negotiations in Moscow, but was bluntly rejected, as the Soviets feared such a transfer would only serve to strengthen the Wehrmacht. The Romanian authorities however continued to study the possibility of a mass expulsion, and prepared a bill that would have left a large number of Germans without Romanian citizenship. Soviet deportation order On January 6, 1945. Romania's Soviet occupiers issued an order providing for the mobilisation of all the German inhabitants of Romania, with a view toward deporting many of them to the Soviet Union. The deportation order applied to all men between the ages of 17 and 45 and women between 18 and 30. Only pregnant women, women with children less than a year old and persons unable to work were excluded. This was done to put into effect top secret Order 7161 about mobilisation and internment of able-bodied Germans for reparation works in the USSR; and which also applied to other countries which were under the control of the Red Army, such as Hungary and Yugoslavia.  Official position of the RƒÉdescu government  Despite their own previous planning for a mass expulsion, the last non-communist government of Romania, headed by Prime Minister Nicolae RƒÉdescu, declared itself \\"completely surprised\\" by the order On January 13, 1945, when arrests had already begun in Bucharest and Bra»ôov, the RƒÉdescu government sent a protest note to the (Soviet) Vice-President of the Allied Control Commission for Romania, General Vladislav Petrovich Vinogradov. This note explained that the armistice treaty (signed on September 12, 1944) did not envision expulsions and that Romanian industry would suffer following the deportation of so much of its workforce, and especially of a high percentage of its skilled workforce, to be found among its German population. In closing, RƒÉdescu raised humanitarian concerns regarding the fate of women and children left behind. The expulsion has been characterised as being one of the first manifestations of the Cold War, as it showed the impossibility of joint control between East and West, even before the end of World War II.  Statistics  Statistics regarding the expulsion of Transylvanian Saxons indicate that up to 30,336 individuals were deported to the Soviet Union -- some 15% of Transylvania's German population (according to 1941 data). 12% of expellees were outside the age limits provided for in the deportation order; a 13-year-old girl was deported, as were people aged 55. 90% of expellees ended up in the Ukrainian SSR (the areas of Dnipropetrovsk, Stalino and Voroshilovgrad), the rest in the Urals. (see Forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union for more background.) The expellees were received in 85 camps. A third worked in mines, a quarter in construction, the rest in industry, agriculture or camp administration. Very few were given the jobs they had done in Romania. The first expellees unsuited for work were returned to Transylvania at the end of 1945. Between 1946 and 1947, about 5,100 Saxons were brought, by special transports for the sick, to Frankfurt an der Oder, a city then in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany. 3,076 of the deportees died while in the USSR, three quarters of them being male. When they were freed, a quarter of deportees were sent to Germany, of whom just a seventh returned to Transylvania. The highest number of deaths occurred in 1947. Starting in 1948, the situation improved, with a dramatic drop in the number of sick and dead expellees. In 1948, those able to work also began to be freed from the camps (49% of them), so that in October 1949 the camps were shut down. The last third of the expellees returned to Transylvania. Of those brought to the Soviet occupation zone, around half received permission to return home. The rest moved elsewhere (mostly to West Germany), but a few remained in East Germany. 202 expellees were allowed to return home only in 1950-52. According to Soviet documents, 7 expellees chose to remain in the USSR. Further turmoil came for Romania's ethnic Germans (this time mainly Banat Swabians) during the BƒÉrƒÉgan deportations of the 1950s.  1995 revelations  An article in the newspaper Allgemeine Deutsche Zeitung f√ºr Rum√§nien, published on January 13, 1995, revealed that the Romanian government was not in fact \\"completely surprised\\" by the deportation order. In fact, even before receiving the order, the government had ordered that lists of men and women capable of performing hard labour be drawn up. Weeks in advance, the state railway, CƒÉile Ferate Rom√¢ne, had begun to prepare cattle wagons to transport the deportees. Documents uncovered after 1989 show that the deportations were planned in detail: as early as December 19, 1944, the prime minister's office transmitted orders by telephone to police inspectors for the purpose of registering the work-capable German population, to comply with the Soviet Order 7161 issued 3 days earlier. All Red Army groups had orders to bring a certain number of work-capable ethnic Germans to camps, and then to deport them to the Soviet Union - this mission was accomplished with the Romanian authorities' assistance, as well as by Red Army units and GRU agents.

This station is unrelated to Los Angeles radio station KMGM (now KYSR) launched by Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer in 1948. Programming The station launched in October 1982 with a full service radio format that mixed middle of the road, oldies, and Top 40 music with 20 hours per week of farm and agricultural programming. However, by 1985 the station would drop the farm programs and move to a mix of Top 40 and adult contemporary music.

He has been called one of the most influential and creative contemporary Cuban musician of his generation. His compositions carry a heavy dose of poetry mixed with complex guitar melodies influenced by a tremendous array of musical styles, from classical music to rock, jazz, ethnic rhythms and new age. He was also the co-founder and musical director of the Cuban progressive-rock band \\"S√≠ntesis\\". Biography Mike Porcel was born under the name Michael Charles Porcel Henriques in Havana, Cuba on April 13, 1950. He began his musical education at the Fernandez Vila Conservatory under some of the most recognized Cuban figures of those days such as Alberto Bernal, Leopoldina Nu√±ez, Harold Gramatges, Alfredo Diez Nieto, Vicente Gonzalez Rubiera \\"Guyun\\" and Angel Vasquez Millares to mention a few. From them he learned classical guitar and harmony applied to the instrument, traditional harmony, counterpoint, composition, orchestration and music appreciation. Mike as he would later be known in the music scene began his professional career in 1968 at the age of 18 when he joins the rock group \\"Los Dada\\", one of the most controversial and avant-garde Cuban bands of the sixties. There along with Pedro Luis Ferrer he shared singing duties as well as playing the guitar. He also started developing what would be his most notorious quality as a musician (song writing). Some of his compositions from those days are. \\"No quiero ser distinto\\", \\"Recuerdo de dos vivos\\" and \\"No me importa\\".http://www.cubaencuentro.com/cultura/articulos/despues-de-tanto- azote-y-diezmo-263037 Two years later he would leave the band to start his solo career. The early 70s found Mike performing as a singer-songwriter in some of the best and well known theaters of Havana such as \\"Teatro Bellas Artes\\", \\"Sala Teatro Hubert de Blanck\\", \\"Teatro Amadeo Rold√°n\\", \\"Teatro Mella\\" and \\"Teatro Karl Marx\\". He also composed music for several theater plays for the group \\"Teatro Estudio\\" such as \\"La hija de las flores\\" and \\"Se hace camino al andar\\". At the same time he worked with Vicente Revuelta as a musical director for the Bertolt Brecht plays \\"Madre coraje y sus hijos\\" and \\"Galileo\\". In 1974 he created along with actor Carlos Ruiz de la Tejera the show \\"Que hablen los poetas\\" (a combination of music, acting and poetry). The simplicity of the concept allowed them to reach many different types of audiences and tour within Cuba. At this time Mike also started taking his first steps in orchestration and arrangement so his first orchestration job could be found in Amaury Perez's first LP \\"Acuardate de Abril\\" (1976). \\"Versos de Jos√© Mart√≠\\" (1978) another of Amaury's LP was orchestrated by Porcel, also composing the music for two of the tracks in this album. Mike a great admirer of Jose Marti's poetry will also set music to some of his very well known poems such as \\"Mi caballero\\", \\"Mucho se√±ora dar√≠a\\", \\"Ismaelillo\\", \\"A bordo\\" and \\"Abril\\". He has also set to music poems of other international poets such as Rabindranath Tagore, Walt Whitman, Joseph Brodsky and Alberto Baeza Flores among others. Other singers began to include in their repertoire some of Mike Porcel's songs, like the famous Argentinian singer and actress Nacha Guevara that recorded \\"Ay del amor\\", \\"Diario\\", \\"Don Carlos\\" and \\"En busca de una nueva flor\\" in her LP title \\"Para cuando me vaya\\" (1978). That same year Argelia Fragoso recorded \\"En busca de una nueva flor\\" and this song would win that year's first prize amongst other 262 presented in the World Festival of Youth and Students that took place in Havana, Cuba. Also in 1978 Mike co-founded the progressive rock band \\"S√≠ntesis\\" until this day something never done before in Cuba and as the musical director of the group it is very evident Porcel's influence in the first LP of the band titled \\"En busca de una nueva flor\\" where Mike collaborates with three of his songs, the self-titled \\"En busca de una nueva flor\\", \\"Nueve ejemplares no tan raros\\" and \\"Variaciones sobre el zapateo\\". Porcel wanted to incorporate elements of theater to the band's shows and this created conflicts with other members so in 1979 he left the group saying \\"Some of the members of the band felt as if we were giving the music a secondary role, but I thought of it as adding another element to it\\". In 1980 due to political discrepancies with the totalitarian communist government of Cuba Mike was banned and erased from the music scene. He was denied the right to work on any cultural activities as well as banned from the radio and TV shows, and at the same time denied the permit to leave Cuba. The Nueva Trova movement then sent him a written letter of repudiation followed by violent acts against him and his family. He was also persecuted, humiliated and harassed by the government officials for about nine years. Ironically though year's later Nueva Trova artists such as Pablo Milan√©s and Santiago Feliu would perform and or record Mike's songs. In spite of all this he continued composing and writing songs and playing the organ at local churches in total solitude. He was separated from his family, wife and son whom he would not see again for many years until 1994. It wasn't until 1989 thanks to the \\"Committee of Human Rights\\" of the United Nations that he was able to leave Cuba and immigrate to Spain. In Spain he embarks himself in different projects such as: \\"Mis momentos felices\\" (a CD by Cuban/Spanish singer Elsa Baeza) as a composer, arranger and musical director. He also created \\"Que hablen los poetas\\" (Version II) and starts performing with Miss Baeza and The Spaniard actor Francisco Rojas throughout different cities of Spain and Belgium and composing music for TV shows. In 1994 he finally reunites with his family in the United States of America where he lives today. Mike has been active in the music scene although he continues to be somewhat of an underground figure. He has participated as a composer, performer or musical director in many shows and theatre plays such as: \\"Homenaje a Alberto Baeza Flores\\" (play), \\"Despues de tanta vida\\" (concert), \\"Un ramo de flores y una bandera\\" (recital), \\"Recordando a Mart√≠\\" (recital), \\"Seis mujeres recuerdan a Lecuona\\" (composer) to mention a few. He has also created music for TV shows \\"Buenos d√≠as\\" and \\"M√°s all√°\\" for TVE (Spanish Public TV) and cartoon animated series such as \\"Little Carlota\\" and \\"Mimi and Mr. Bobo\\";http://www.catalanfilmsdb.cat/en/productions/animation-series/mimi-mr- bobo/1753/ documentaries \\"Make a little difference\\", \\"A global view\\" and \\"Mind awareness campaign\\" for UNCHR, \\"Un siglo en Madrid\\" & \\"Corpus Christi\\" for Telson Video.

Life  Dorothea was the eldest child of Elector Frederick II of Brandenburg (1413‚Äì1471) from his marriage to Catherine (1421‚Äì1476), daughter of Elector Frederick I of Saxony. She married on 12 February 1464 in L√ºneburg Duke John V of Saxe-Lauenburg (1439‚Äì1507). As she was oldest daughter of the Elector Frederick, who had no surviving sons, the marriage agreement was important. In addition to a florins dowry, Frederick promised his son-in-law everything that he could legally leave to his daughter. Later, however, Frederick abdicated in favour of his younger brother Albert Achilles, so as to keep his possessions in the family. Frederick also failed to pay the dowry to his son-in-law. This led Dorothea's uncle John the Alchemist to compare himself with the Elector Frederick in 1482.Adolph Friedrich Riedel: Codex diplomaticus Brandenburgensis: Sammlung der Urkunden, Chroniken und sonstigen Quellenschriften f√ºr die Geschichte der Mark Brandenburg und ihrer Regenten, vol. 6, F.

He was responsible for founding new towns, building schools, and reforming the silver mine at Hualgayoc. He is most remarkable for his efforts to educate Trujillo's Indians and for his research into local plants, animals, archaeological ruins, music, and native cultures.  Background and education  Mart√≠nez Compa√±√≥n was born in Cabredo, Navarre (Spain) and studied Religious Law at the Universities of Huesca and Zaragosa in Arag√≥n before earning his bachelor's degree at the University of O√±ate in Guipuzcoa in 1759, and his doctorate at O√±ate in 1763. He was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1761. In 1766, he served as an advisor to the Holy Office of the Inquisition in Madrid.  Early career in America  In 1767, King Charles III of Spain named Mart√≠nez Compa√±√≥n choirmaster of the Metropolitan Cathedral of Lima, Peru. In 1772 and 1773, he served as Secretary to the Sixth Provincial Church Council of Peru, held in Lima. From 1770 to 1778, he served as rector of the Saint Toribio seminary, also in Lima.  Bishop of Trujillo  King Charles III named Mart√≠nez Compa√±√≥n Bishop of Trujillo, Peru, on February 25, 1778. While there, he explored his bishopric in a visitation that lasted two years, eight months, and eight days. During this time he gathered the information that would become the basis of his projects to found new towns and schools. He planned to create special schools for Indian boys and girls where they would learn trade and craft skills as well as basic literacy. He also imagined an elaborate plan to create a utopian mining town at the Hualgayoc silver mine, outside Cajamarca.  Archbishop of Bogot√°  After arriving in Bogot√° on March 12, 1791, Mart√≠nez Compa√±√≥n repaired local churches, founded five primary schools throughout the city, and established a seminary. He also became friends with noted botanist Jos√© Celestino Mutis.  Death  Mart√≠nez Compa√±√≥n died of old age on August 17, 1797. Local legend holds that a smell of flowers emanated from his corpse and for three days the sun did not shine.  Legacy  When Mart√≠nez Compa√±√≥n died, he left behind a natural history collection of animals, plants, artifacts and manufactures. These comprised a total of 24 boxes. Today part of the collection is held at the Museo de Am√©rica in Madrid, although the majority of it has been lost. He also sent to Spain a nine volume set of watercolor images depicting the people, plants, and animals of Trujillo, the Codex Mart√≠nez Compa√±√≥n. Drawn by local artisans, these 1,372 images are a unique example of vernacular natural history produced in the colonial context. The originals survive today in the library of the Royal Palace in Madrid.  References  * Emily Berquist, The Bishop's Utopia: Imagining Improvement in Colonial Peru.

Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he has lived and worked in San Francisco since 1984.ARTNET His work came to fruition in the late 1980s out of cultural activism that addressed the AIDS epidemic and gay identity politics and was curated into early exhibitions that acknowledged those formative issues.Blake, Nayland \\"Curating in a Different Light\\" These exhibitions included Situation: Perspectives on Work by Lesbian and Gay Artists at New Langton Arts in San Francisco, The Anti-Masculine at the Kim Light Gallery in Los Angeles, Beyond Loss at the Washington Project for the Arts in Washington, D.C,\\"Beyond Loss: Art in the Era of AIDS,\\" Exhibit Pamphlet, Washington project for the Arts, Washington DC, 1993 and In A Different Light: Visual Culture, Sexual Identity, Queer Practice at the Berkeley Art Museum, Berkeley, California. However, after legislation passed in 1989 that restricted federal funding for art dealing with homosexuality and AIDS, artists like Reichman approached their themes subtly. His And the Spell Was Broken Somewhere Over the Rainbow is embellished with colors of the rainbow and presents three clocks. It references Oz while actually indirectly addressing the new reality that San Francisco could no longer be viewed as a land of enchantment due to the AIDS crisis.  Style and theme  Reichman's inquiry into the politics of gay culture critiques political correctness and cultural assimilation, but the approach to realism is never simply reproductive. He separates the concept of Realism from Naturalism within a discourse that views popular culture as anxious, obsessed with artificiality and unnatural beauty. His pictures take lubricious fantasy to the point of ridicule, without losing completely a quotient of psychological truth.Baker, Kenneth \\"Reichman and Sherwood at Anglim\\", San Francisco Chronicle, September 11, 2011, page E3 Often, his works include what he collects: mid-century modern furniture and dinnerware. The aesthetics of these mid-century items are often present in his representations of non-normative contemporary gay domestic space. An example of Reichman's own mid-century design object he has incorporated into his artwork is the Gildcraft Italia Mondrian Vase, which he uses as the title for his painting. The works in his show at CB1 Gallery, Better Living Through Design, are titled after his mid-century furniture and set pieces. Reichman being gay in the age of AIDS drew him to expose social perceptions and prejudices which also allowed him to express his own sense of self. The AIDS era drew his consciousness to loss‚Äîthe loss of life as well as of innocence and the sense of freedom that once prevailed in the gay community. In Reichman's early works, he uses children's toys such as rubber lambs and pixies to provide a source of imagined innocence. He also plays around with childhood fables that make viewers perceive cheerful expectations or enthusiasms. Yet, his decisive details with this theme suggest that some things are not always what they seem. His early works focused on being about a certain loss of cultural innocence. Reichman's 1998 show, It's Hard to Be Happy, at the Orange County Museum of Art, reveals his fascination with duality and misleading appearances. In his work Threefold, Reichman depicts three elves, with the look of worry on one elf's face, in contrast to the others' obliviousness, suggesting the awareness and threat of AIDS.  Technique  Oil paintings address the history of fabric and folds in painting while situating this rich history within a contemporary discourse of exaggeration, camp, and queer politic. Reichman has evidently noticed how frequently in pre-modern European painting the coursing of posh clothing and other drapery can communicate the unutterable and unpicturable - the very scandal of embodiment itself - to the suggestible mind. Works on paper are accomplished in watercolor and gouache through the process of layered crosshatching.Eclectix: Traditional, NewBrow, Pop Art The crosshatch ironically builds up the image while simultaneously negating it. This opposition refers to the contradictions within the imagery itself: representative of satisfaction and dissatisfaction, fulfillment and insatiability, humor and disgust. The crosshatch creates an image stroke by stroke, further implicating the subtexts of obsessiveness, eroticism, and the hard-fought, hard won achievements exemplified through personal and political struggle.  Exhibitions  Reichman has been the subject of numerous solo exhibitions at Gallery Paule Anglim in San Francisco,Paule Anglim Gallery the PPOW Gallery in New York, Feature Inc., New York,Feature, Inc the Rena Bransten Gallery in San Francisco, and the Orange County Museum of Art. His work was recently included in I Am Not Monogamous, I Heart Poetry, at Feature, Inc.

Reichman's work is in many public collections, including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Berkeley Art Museum, the Portland Art Museum, and the Orange County Museum. His work is featured in the publications Art‚ÄîA Sex Book by John Waters and Bruce Hainley, Untitled Publication (Red Square), by Feature Inc, Pacific Light: A Survey of California Watercolor 1908-2008, the Nordiska Akvarellmuseet and In A Different Light: Visual Culture, Sexual Identity, Queer Practice, Art, AIDS, America, among others.

It is an artificial lake formed by a dam on the course of R√≠o Negro. It was built in 1945 and has a surface of about . The dam was overtopping during the 1959 floods, and the hydroelectric facilities damaged. The riverine tug Don Pancho was assigned to the transport of building materials and supplies from Salto during the construction of the dam, between 1937 and 1946. She was later used to evacuate local residents in the course of the 1959 floods. The vessel was eventually converted into a patrol boat. Don Pancho sank in the waters of the lake in January 2016 though she was raised a few days later. Images The hydroelectric generator of Rinc√≥n del Bonete.

Greg Stanton, a former city councilman, was elected over Wes Gullett, and took office on January 3, 2012, succeeding Phil Gordon, who held the office of Mayor of Phoenix from 2004 to 2012. The election coincided with the Phoenix City Council elections to the four odd-numbered districts (1, 3, 5, 7). Background Due to the City of Phoenix's limit of two four-year terms, current Mayor Phil Gordon was ineligible to run for mayor again. As all municipal elections in the City of Phoenix are nonpartisan, the political affiliations of the respective candidates were not present on the ballot paper. In addition, the race was widely regarded as very competitive compared to previous elections, as the last three incumbent mayors ran with little to no opposition.Phoenix mayoral election Candidates All candidates had to at least 1500 signatures to appear on the August 30 ballot. The city clerk reviewed the signatures and candidates with enough valid signatures appeared on the ballot; the City Clerk had until June 11 at the latest to review all candidates' signatures. Thane Eichenauer failed to collect enough signatures to formally appear on the ballot, but said that he would run a write-in campaign. Alexander Malkoon also fell just short of the 1,500 signatures needed, complimented the slate of remaining candidates and announced he would not run as a write in candidate.

He is reported to have been born at Cotlliure in Catalonia in around 1300, and to have died in Barcelona, probably before 1361.Mauro Zonta, Review of Bos et al. (2005), Aestimatio, 3, 114‚Äì118 In the past some scholars, including the nineteenth century scholar Moritz Steinschneider, have identified ben Yom Tov with the Portuguese Jewish scholar David ben Yom Tov ibn Bilia; this is now considered unlikely.Bongoron, Jewish Encyclopedia, 1906. Langermann in Bos et al. (2005), p.15  Life  Sobrequ√©s estimates that David ben Yom Tov was born at Cotlliure in about 1300.Chabas i Bergon et al. (1992) p.40, citing Sobrequ√©s (1975), p.163 He was also called David Bonjorn, Bonjorn being a literal Catalan translation of the Hebrew Yom Tov, i.e. \\"good day\\". His father was Bonjorn del Barri, a wealthy merchant of the province of Roussillon just north of the Pyrenees, which at that time was part of the Catalan Kingdom of Majorca. In 1323 del Barri is recorded as having been granted permission by King Sancho of Majorca to join the council of the Jewish community of Perpignan; and to travel and trade freely throughout the country, without having to wear a yellow badge or any other symbol to mark him out as a Jew. However by 1327 del Barri was dead, and David Bonjorn appears successfully petitioning James II of Aragon to relax various provisions of his father's will, including requirements on him to move from Cotlliure and reside in Perpignan for two years; to lend no money to the new king of Majorca or his courtiers until the king's twentieth birthday; nor to provide guarantees for anyone, apart from his own sisters; nor to take a lease on any royal incomes. Bonjorn appears to have been the only male heir; but his sisters mentioned in the document include one called Venges, who went on to become the wife of the celebrated Jewish author Joseph Caspi.Chabas i Bergon et al. (1992), pp.39‚Äì40 Ben Yom Tov himself had first married a Jewish woman from the town of Arles, in Provence. The marriage was dissolved without being consummated, because the wife was declared mad.Chabas i Bergon et al. (1992), p.40 In 1332 Alfonso IV of Aragon granted permission for a new marriage to Esther, the daughter of Astruc Caravita, a wealthy merchant of Girona. The marriage was turbulent however, and by 1337 Esther was demanding divorce, and the return of her dowry to her family. David refused to consider it, until Esther had all his books and instruments removed from his study and hidden. \\"So dear were they to my eyes, that she could hardly have forced me and obligated me with any other kind of coercion better than my interest, desire and longing for them,\\" David complained. He duly presented the required statement of renunciation before the Jewish Beth Din at Perpignan; but then sought to cancel various clauses of the court's decision, presumably those relating to the dowry. David called in legal experts from the king of Majorca to try to sway the court; in response the authorities of Esther's home town, Girona, weighed in on her side. A long and noisy debate ensued, as rabbis from both sides of the Pyrenees came forward to have their say. Several documented reviews of the case survive; but eventually the original decision was upheld.Chabas i Bergon et al. (1992), pp.40‚Äì41; Outstanding figures in the history of Judaism in Girona (s.v \\"Ester\\"), Nahmanides Institute for Jewish Studies, Girona. Accessed 21 June 2011; Bongoron, Jewish Encyclopedia, 1906. Documents place David as still living in Perpignan in 1340; and again in 1352, when the king of Aragon, Peter IV, sent him a terse message to chase up some \\"astrolabe tables\\", complaining about their late delivery.Chabas i Bergon et al. (1992), p.41. \\"We greatly wonder whether you have finished and sent the astrolabe tables we required made. We expressly require that you finish and send us the said tables without delay. And do not fail to know that if you delay in this there will be serious consequences.\\" The Jewish scholar and traveller Judah Mosconi reports meeting two wise men, \\"David Bonjorn and his father\\" in Perpignan, at a date which has been estimated as 1362. He describes David Bonjorn as one of the greatest astronomers of that time.Bongoron, Jewish Encyclopedia, 1906, citing Judah Mosconi, supercommentary on Ibn Ezra. It has been conjectured that this account represents a slip of the pen, and should read \\"David Bonjorn and his son\\".Chabas i Bergon et al. (1992), p.41 David Bonjorn's son Jacob ben David Poel ben Yom Tov was indeed also a noted astronomer, who prepared a much copied set of astronomical tables at Perpignan in 1361 that were translated and re-translated. The conjecture is not certain however: Jacob himself had a son David, that Mosconi might have been referring to; although if the date of 1362 is correct he would have been at most only a boy, not a famous astronomer. The suggestion has also been made that since it was Jacob, rather than David, whose name was attached to the tables in 1361, then this could be a sign that David was already dead.Chabas i Bergon et al. (1992), p.44  Astrology and medicine  One work of David ben Yom Tov that survives is the Kelal Qatan (\\"Concise summary\\", or in Latin Compendio breve), a short summary of the application of astrology to medicine, based primarily on the astrological position of the moon, running to eleven pages in a modern English translation. Five surviving manuscripts are known: four in Hebrew from the fifteenth century, and one in Latin translation written in Catalonia before 1446.Langermann, in Bos et al. (2005), p. 16 According to the author, the book was composed at the request of a \\"distinguished friend\\", \\"one of the medical experts of our time\\", to be a \\"concise summary of astrology which a physician needs every day for the administration of purgatives, potions, and vomitives\\" (¬ß8).Bos et al. (2005), p.84 A knowledge of astrology, he writes, is part of what a complete doctor should know, so he can allow for the effects of the heavenly bodies in diagnosis and prognosis; while a knowledge of medicine is part of what a complete astrologer should know, so he can best prepare his subject for the influence of external forces, or best repel them. But, the writer adds, in the words of Hippocrates, that art is long, but life is short; it is \\"better for every human being to be the master of one science, than to know a little bit of this and a little bit of that\\", so thus the request from his friend the distinguished practitioner for a brief summary. He had not wanted to turn his friend down, and damage his own reputation, so compiled the summary to the best of his ability, \\"from the books composed on the subject\\", without adding anything of his own (¬ß¬ß 2‚Äì10).Bos et al. (2005), pp.83‚Äì84 The author then goes on to give a brief glossary of astrological and astronomical terms, before outlining various rules for good and bad times for particular medical interventions, such as blood-lettings, purgatives and emetics; astrological indications for \\"critical days\\" in the course of an illness; and even an astrological indication that the patient would best benefit by choosing another physician. But such indications can only be general, he concludes; the patient is also subject to influences such as their birth horoscopes, and of course ultimately to the will of God.Bos et al. (2005), pp.85‚Äì93; Langermann in Bos et al. (2005), p.18 Of the unnamed \\"books on the subject\\" claimed by David ben Yom Tov for his sources, the recent academic editors of Kelal Qatan identify several passages that show a clear debt to the Centiloquium then ascribed to Ptolemy, whom the author acknowledges by name, and the commentary on it by Ahmad ibn Yusuf al-Misri (d. 912); and also the Sefer ha-Me'orot (1148), a work specifically on medical astrology by the celebrated Jewish scholar Abraham ibn Ezra, whom the author also acknowledges at one point.Langermann in Bos et al. (2005), pp.12‚Äì15 The overall theoretical framework described by ben Yom Tov is very much in line with these two sources. The composition itself appears to be novel however, and most of the specific rules that he adduces appear to follow no direct extant known antecedent; though the majority may, as he appears to suggest at ¬ß17, merely be worked-through consequences of associations implicit in the summary tables of standard astrological properties that he says can be found at the back of astronomical almanacs. A copy of such a set of tables of astrological properties, that ben Yom Tov says (¬ß18) he will provide with the work, survive in the back of the Latin manuscript from Barcelona, and do indeed parallel tables of astrological properties that have been found appended to a later copy of astronomical tables by Abraham bar Hiyya (d. 1145), the table of astrological properties closely corresponding to a summary of information from Ibn Ezra's general introduction to practical astrology, Reshit Hokhmah (\\"The Beginning of Wisdom\\").Bos et al. (2005), pp. 74‚Äì81; Burnett in Bos et al. (2005), p. 63; Langermann in Bos et al. (2005), pp.17‚Äì18 According to the editors, astrology at most only ever had a marginal role in Jewish medical practice at the time; but they see David ben Yom Tob's Kelal Qatan as part of an uptick of interest in the subject in Catalonia and Southern France in the 14th century, which can be detected also in Hebrew works by Shem Tov ben Isaac of Tartosa and Pinchas of Narbonne, and Latin works by Bartholomew of Bruges, Bernard de Gordon and Arnau of Villanova.Langermann in Bos et al.

Aguilar. Aguilar completed the manuscript on September 25, 1906. The novel was published by Manila Filateco in Manila, Philippines in 1907. The novel was written during the American period in Philippine history (1898-1946). Description According to Soledad Reyes, Faustino's Pinaglahuan was a pioneer novel in Philippine literature that tackled social realism in the Philippines, meaning it was one of the first books to focus on the realistic state of Philippine society. Faustino wrote the novel after being influenced by the socialist teaching of 19th century European thinkers. Pinaglahuan was Faustino's response against imperialism and colonialism. Characters Among the characters of the novel were Luis Gatbuhay, Don Nicanor, Danding, and Rojalde. Luis Gatbuhay was a labor leader. Danding is Gatbuhay's girlfriend and daughter of Don Nicanor. Rojalde was a wealthy mestizo to whom Don Nicanor wanted to betroth Danding, instead of Gatbuhay. Gatbuhay was the representation of the masses or the common Filipino people. Plot Set during the early 20th century in the Philippines, Pinaglahuan narrates the story of the life of Luis Gatbuhay, the labor leader whose life was ruined by the mestizo class, represented by Rojalde. The first scene in Pinaglahuan depicted a meeting inside the Teatro Zorilla (Zorilla Theatre). The purpose of the gathering was about the call to free the Philippines from the American occupiers. Another scene depicted the confrontation between Gatbuhay and Don Nicanor while inside a carriage. Don Nicanor wanted to marry off Danding to Rojalde because the purpose of paying off his gambling debt. Luis lost his job because of Rojalde's power and influence. In addition, Rojalde implicated Gatbuhay to a crime and was imprisoned for four years. Rojalde and Danding became husband and wife, but Danding gave birth to Gatbuhay's child. At the ending scene of the novel, Gatbuhay was killed by a bomb explosion inside the prison. See also *'GAP√î *Satanas sa Lupa References External links *Pinaglahuan by Faustino S.

Metal usage and striking errors referred to widely as ‚Äúplanchet errors‚Äù, die errors, and mint striking errors. This does not include the varieties that the US Mint has issued over the years. Since the inception of coin collecting there has been much controversy over what constitutes a true mint error. An organization of coin collectors named the Combined Organizations of Numismatic Error Collectors of America (CONECA) was created that specifically deals with mint errors.  Planchet Errors  A planchet is produced by punching blanks in sheet metal stock specially made for the types of mint blanks required. After the blanks are punched they are rolled on the edge placing an upset needed for the minting process. The blanks are then washed and annealed making them ready for the minting process There are several types of planchet errors that include: improper alloy, wrong stock, imperfect blank, and lamination. A planchet error may be caused by an improper alloy mixture. Improper alloy mixtures occur when the sheet stock contains uneven layers of the metals intended for the type of coin that is produced. A result of improper layers of metals is a coin produced without an intended surface layer of nickel. A dime or quarter without the nickel layer will contain only the copper alloy mixture. A planchet error can be caused by using a blank intended for a different denomination or wrong stock. The result of using a blank intended for another denomination is the minting of the intended obverse and reverse on the wrong stock. A planchet error also refers to many types of issues where an imperfect blank has been used. Pieces of the blank might be missing causing a half moon to be missing from the coin. Collectors denote missing parts of the planchet as \\"clipped planchets.\\" A dirty or oily blank may cause the details of the coin to become dull or even missing. A piece of debris may find its way into the dies causing a series of lines to be minted on the surface of the coin. A planchet may be in a state that causes peeling on the surface of the coin. The peeling of any part of the surface of a coin is known as a lamination error. Below is a lamination error on a Jefferson nickel. Jefferson nickel with minor planchet error  Die Errors  Die errors are caused by the mint dies wearing down over time or dies that have not been prepared identical to others that have been replaced. The result of preparing a set of new dies improperly from the original hub results in coin errors such as doubling, extra details, or missing details on the surface of the coin. A die break is caused when the mint die suffers a crack and this crack feature is transposed onto the coins in the minting process. Coins minted with a die break have a thin line or lines that are raised running across the surface of the coin. Below is a photograph of a 1954-S Jefferson nickel with a die crack along the top of the portrait of Jefferson. A die break can create coins that have deep impressions in a coin that is filled in with metal. The coin shows a raised patch of metal were the brake occurred. This type of error is commonly known as a \\"cud\\" error. Gouges in coins caused by flaws in dies, and die polishing mistakes resulting in coins minted with surface indentations, or polishing lines. Dies that are damaged and used in the minting process also create errors resulting in coins having die chips embedded in the surface of the coin. A die clash occurs when a planchet is not fed into the collar that holds the coin in place for the minting process. The two dies meet and each carries away part of the design embedded on the die. Coins minted using these dies cause coins to be minted with parts of the reverse design on the obverse or parts of the obverse on the reverse of the coin. Die rotations cause coins to be minted with the reverse or obverse of the coin partially or fully rotated. A die rotation occurs when the dies become loose and they then turn. When a mint worker polishes a die to remove a die clash or some other defect there may be instances where a part of the design is removed. The 3-legged Buffalo nickel was the direct result of die polishing and the removal of a leg. The 1970 Lincoln cent with the raised 7 is also the result of die polishing. Jefferson nickel with a die crack Before 1990, all US coin dies were subject to mint mark errors resulting from the preparation of the dies. The mint mark was hammered into the die manually sometimes causing a die to have a doubling. In the minting process this would create a series of coins with a distinct of slight doubling of the mint mark. Millions of these errors can be located on the internet for sale and are referred to as RPM‚Äôs  Double Dies  Double die coins are mainly created by a defective hub which is used to create many dies for the minting process. Collectors classify double dies as DDO (Double die obverse coins), DDR (Double die reverse) and OMM (Over mint mark). The over mint mark is created when a one date and mint mark is punched over another date, part of a date, or mint mark. These coins are generally restricted to the early minting process of coins dating before the turn of the century. The DDO and DDR errors are related to any part of the coin that shows a distinct doubling. Pictured below is a 1969-S double die Lincoln cent. 1969-S Double Die Cent  Mint Striking Errors  Collectors and organizations dedicated to collecting coins regard mint striking errors as those that have been created by the minting process. Mint striking errors are caused by the collar moving, cracking, or not being present in the minting process. The collar is a third die that actually holds the coin in place in the minting process. It is the collar that imprints the lettering on a coin, such as the lettering on the Presidential dollars. Striking a coin with debris causes an indentation on the coin or the actual debris stamped into the coin. In order to mint any US coin a retaining collar is used to keep the coin in place while it is pressed between the dies. If the retaining collar breaks or is missing, the coin is struck so that the metal of the planchet is actually expanded outward producing a larger version of the coin with most of the details present. This error is known as a broad struck error. A coin that has been struck out of the collar and has double details such as two partial portraits, one normal and one that is overlapping and extending outside the normal circumference of the coin is denoted as a double striking error. A brockage results when a coin is stuck in the collar and another planchet enters the collar and is pressed against the coin already minted. The details of the coins produced have the appearance of mirror images of the obverse and reverse. A die cap is a coin that has been stamped a number of times and has the appearance of a soda cap. Metal flows around the side of the coin and the portrait appears deep in the coin. Lincoln cent off center  Variations  Variations are not mint errors in the technical sense. Variations in coins are caused by creating hubs and dies that are not exactly the same resulting in dates that can be compared as large to small, wide to thin etc. These die variations resulted in the 1960 large- and small-dated Lincoln cent, and the 1982 large- and small-dated series both in copper and copper-zinc cents minted. Below are photographs of two Brilliant Uncirculated Jefferson nickels. Note that these are variations of dies used to mint the 1970-D Jefferson nickels. The die variation is clearly evident with the placement of the D in two different locations, one closest to the 1970 and the other closest to the rim of the coin.The author discovered the low and high D minted Jefferson nickels in uncirculated rolls. There are some variations created by the mint site using different die sets. The best case of the mint using different die sets is the variation of the letters AM on the Lincoln cent. The AM letters are either touching or are distinctly apart in some Lincoln cents minted in 1998, 1999, 2000, and perhaps others to be discovered. Normally, the wide AM design is reserved for the Lincoln proof designs. Below is a photograph of a wide AM Lincoln cent. 1970-D Jefferson nickel High D1970-D Jefferson nickel Low D Lincoln Cent Wide AM design Unclassified Error Coins Unclassified error coins are those that are difficult to categorize. Below are two unclassified error, one with the date flattened in a 1998 Jefferson nickel and another Jefferson nickel with a recessed S. The coins shown in the photographs were located by the author in rolls of nickels. 1998-P Jefferson nickel with flat date 1970-S Jefferson nickel with a recessed S Counter Stamped Coins Counter stamped coins have a long history in the early days of minted coins. Many companies used counter stamping as a method to advertise their company. There are thousands of counter stamped coins some of which carry little value while others command values in the thousands. In any case, these coins were changed after leaving the mint, and are not true error coins. Initials were sometime cut into coins. Some of these coins have been classified as \\"love tokens\\" having the initials of the person who counter stamped the coin. Below is a counter stamped Lincoln cent with a number 2 in a bar shape outline. This coin was found with some others with personal initials in a 5,000 piece coin bag purchased from a coin show.A bag of 5,000 Lincoln was purchased by the author in 2004 containing counter stamped coins Lincoln Cent with Counter Stamped 2  References   External links  *American Numismatic Association *The Combined Organizations Of Numismatic Error Collectors Of America Category:Coins of the United States Category:Mint-made errors ","title":"US Error Coins"},{"id":"32063755","title":"List of massacres in Bangladesh"},{"id":"32063857","text":"Carolyn Goodman (n√©e Goldmark; born March 25, 1939) is an American politician who has served as mayor of Las Vegas, Nevada since 2011. She is the second female mayor of Las Vegas and is the wife of former mayor and attorney Oscar Goodman. She is the founder, president and trustee emeritus of The Meadows School.

She and Oscar Goodman moved to Las Vegas from Philadelphia in 1964.Profile , lasvegasnevada.gov; accessed May 22, 2015. She graduated from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in 1973 with a master's degree in counseling.University of Nevada alumni, education.unlv.edu; accessed May 22, 2015. Career  Goodman is the founder, president and trustee emeritus of The Meadows School. She and her husband moved to Las Vegas in 1964 and soon became active in the local Jewish federation. Eventually, she became the leader of the local Jewish federation's women's division, a position she held for several years. She received the 2009 Commitment to Education award from the United Way of Southern Nevada. On June 7, 2011, Goodman was elected mayor of Las Vegas with 60% of the vote in a runoff; she took office on July 6, 2011. She was reelected in 2015, and in April 2019 was reelected again to a third (and, due to term limits, final) term, with 83.5% of the vote. On October 24, 2011, Goodman greeted President Barack Obama at McCarran International Airport. In regard to negative remarks Obama had made about Las Vegas two years earlier that had angered her husband, the previous mayor, she told Obama that \\"the slate is brand new and clean\\", and gave him one of her lucky mayor chips as a gift. On July 15, 2015, Goodman endorsed Ruben Kihuen for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2016. Kihuen defeated incumbent U.S. Representative Cresent Hardy. Days later, she endorsed Joe Heck for the U.S. Senate in 2016. On August 3, 2016, Goodman declined to endorse Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. She identifies as an independent. During her tenure as mayor, Goodman tried to promote Las Vegas as a home for professional sports teams. The Vegas Golden Knights began playing professional hockey in the 2017‚Äì18 season and the Oakland Raiders announced their relocation to Las Vegas beginning in 2020, although neither team is within Las Vegas's city limits: both are in Paradise, Nevada, outside the mayor's jurisdiction. Goodman attempted to lure a soccer team to Las Vegas several times, including bids for a Major League Soccer expansion team, and ultimately got a second- division team, the Las Vegas Lights FC of the United Soccer League, which began playing in 2018. Goodman is no longer eligible to run for reelection due to term limits. In 2019, her final term was extended a year due to a state law that shifted all municipal elections held in off-years to even-numbered years, meaning her term will end in 2024. On April 22 and 23, 2020, in interviews with MSNBC's Katy Tur and CNN's Anderson Cooper during the COVID-19 pandemic, Goodman said she wanted to reopen Las Vegas's casinos and hotels. When pressed about procedures necessary to ensure patrons' safety, she said that wasn't her responsibility and was up to the businesses. During the interview with Cooper, Goodman questioned the impact of social distancing, saying, \\"We [Las Vegas] offered to be a control group...\\" to test what would happen if casinos reopened, but was advised against it \\"...because people from all parts of southern Nevada come in to work in the city.\\" She also suggested that social distancing be subjected to a placebo test, adding, \\"We would love to be that placebo...\\" When Cooper asked if she would be willing to go to one of the casinos if they were soon opened up, she replied: ‚ÄúFirst of all, I have a family. I don't gamble.\\" U.S. Representative Dina Titus, from Nevada's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Las Vegas Strip, disagreed with Goodman, saying it was necessary to heed scientists' advice to shelter at home whenever possible to enable the successful recovery of Las Vegas's businesses. Titus also said, \\"The mayor does not represent the Las Vegas Strip, literally or figuratively.\\" That evening, Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak said, \\"I will not allow the citizens of Nevada, our Nevadans, to be used as a control group, as a placebo, whatever she wants to call it\\", and that he would not \\"allow our workers to be put in position that they have to decide between their job and their paycheck and their life. That's not a fair position to put them in.\\" Personal life Goodman's husband is Oscar Goodman. They have four children and six grandchildren.Carolyn Goodman biodata , lasvegasnevada.gov; accessed May 22, 2015. Oscar Jr. is a doctor with the Comprehensive Cancer Centers of Nevada, Ross is a criminal defense attorney, Eric is a Las Vegas justice of the peace, and Cara is a marriage and family therapist who also works with burn victims at University Medical Center.

Miller & Andreas Schulz: Gauleiter: The Regional Leaders of the Nazi Party and Their Deputies, 1925-1945, Volume II (Georg Joel - Dr. Bernhard Rust), R. James Bender Publishing, 2017, p. 402, . Nazi career Already before the Nazi seizure of power, Carl R√∂ver had been active in politics. He joined the Oldenburg Stadtsrat (Municipal Council) in 1924. He was an Ortsgruppenleiter for the party in April 1925 and a Bezirksleiter (District Leader) in Oldenburg and East Friesland in July 1927. On 20 May 1928 he became a member of the Oldenburg Landtag. Finally, Adolf Hitler appointed him Gauleiter when the Gau Weser-Ems was established on 1 October 1928. In September 1930 he was elected to the Reichstag from electoral constituency 14, Weser-Ems. On 16 June 1932, he became Minister-president of Oldenburg, thus uniting under his control the highest party and governmental offices in his jurisdiction. When in September 1932 the Oldenburg superior church council, the executive board of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Oldenburg, decided to give permission to use the St. Lambert's Church in Oldenburg city for the sermon of the African Pastor Robert Kwami. R√∂ver reacted immediately, directing racist tirades against Kwami, the Norddeutsche Mission and the superior church council demanding to postpone the sermon. The Nazi-party called upon the State Ministry of Oldenburg, the Nazi-dominated state government, to stop the sermon.Georg Joel und Jens M√ºller an das Oldenburger Staatsministerium.

Evangelische Kirchlichkeit und nationalsozialistischer Alltag in einer l√§ndlichen Region, Bd. 39, Teil 5, p. 52. Despite the public threats by the local Nazis that were later become known as the so-called Kwami Affair, the sermon was carried out as planned September 20, 1932. On 5 May 1933, R√∂ver was appointed to the post of Reichsstatthalter for the states of both Oldenburg and Bremen after the Nazi regime effectively took centralized control of the state governments in Germany.Peter D. Stachura, The Shaping of the Nazi State, Taylor & Francis, 1978, p. 216 In this post he played a role in the perpetration of the Holocaust as he personally signed the order for every Jew deported from Bremen during his life.David Cesarani, Holocaust: The \\"final solution\\", Routledge, 2004, p. 83 However, in this role R√∂ver also clashed with Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring, who as Minister President of Prussia, made no secret of his desire to incorporate Bremen into Prussia. R√∂ver, however, opposed the move consistently and managed to convince Hitler to decline G√∂ring's requests.Maiken Umbach, German federalism: past, present, future, Palgrave Macmillan, 2002, p. 131 He was something of a favourite of Martin Bormann, a fact that helped to ensure that when an Arbeitsbereich (\\"working sphere\\" - an external unit of the Nazi Party) was set up in the neighbouring occupied Netherlands most of its staff were drawn from Weser-Ems.Dietrich Orlow, The History of the Nazi Party 1933-1945 Volume 2, David & Charles, 1973, p. 306, Death R√∂ver supposedly suffered a stroke in May 1942 and died in Berlin soon afterwards, Paul Wegener succeeding him as Gauleiter.Orlow, The History of the Nazi Party , p. 352 His official cause of death is listed in some sources as pneumonia and in others as heart failure. His state funeral at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin proved a lavish event, with Adolf Hitler himself in attendance and Alfred Rosenberg delivering the eulogy.Orlow, The History of the Nazi Party , p. 358 R√∂ver's cause of death is disputed by David Irving, who claims in his book Hitler's War that R√∂ver was killed by Nazi agents who had been sent specifically by Martin Bormann.David Irving, Hitler's War, p. 392 This is also the conclusion of Bormann's biographer Jochen Von Lang, who states that R√∂ver's increasingly erratic behaviour was caused by progressive dementia brought on by late stage syphilis, supposedly contracted before the First World War: ‚ÄúBormann ordered that the nature of the disease be kept secret. From Munich he dispatched two agents to Oldenburg who, on May 15, were able to report to him that R√∂ver had died, officially from heart failure.‚Äù References External links * Category:1889 births Category:1942 deaths Category:People from Wesermarsch Category:People from the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg Category:Gauleiters Category:Members of the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic Category:Members of the Reichstag of Nazi Germany Category:Sturmabteilung officers Category:Holocaust perpetrators in Germany Category:German military personnel of World War I Category:People from the Free State of Oldenburg Category:History of Bremen (state) Category:Nazis who served in World War I ","title":"Carl R√∂ver"},{"id":"32064215","text":"200px Ethope himachala, the dusky diadem, is a species of butterfly in the Satyr subfamily.

Zanzibar leopard(Panthera pardus adersi), believed to be an extinct subspecies ‚Äì a mounted specimen in the Zanzibar Museum. A dolphin in the India Ocean near Zanzibar. The wildlife of Zanzibar consists of terrestrial and marine flora and fauna in the archipelago of Zanzibar, an autonomous region of Tanzania. Its floral vegetation is categorized among the coastal forests of eastern Africa as the Southern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic and the Northern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic. Its faunal species are mostly small animals, birds, and butterflies. The main island of Zanzibar, Unguja, has fauna which reflects its connection to the African mainland during the last ice age. The Zanzibar leopard, an endemic subspecies of the island that may now be extinct, is conjectured to have evolved after the island became separated from the mainland at Tanzania consequent to a rise of the sea level at the end of the ice age. The laws applicable to the wildlife of Tanzania under the Tanzanian Wildlife Act also govern the flora and fauna of Zanzibar. Wild areas are protected in many reserves and Jozani Chwaka Bay National Park. The Zanzibar Forestry Development Project and Zanzibar Integrated Land Development Project are two important projects which address wildlife surveys and monitoring. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and IUCN are involved in many wildlife project related activities on the islands. Geography Map of Zanzibar. The World Wildlife Fund divides the coastal forests into two ecoregions: the Northern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic, which extends from southern Somalia through coastal Kenya to southern Tanzania, and includes the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba, and the Southern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic, which extends from southern Tanzania along the Mozambique coast to the mouth of the Limpopo. Natural habitats in this ecoregion have been largely replaced by areas under cultivation for food production and spices (cloves, cardamom, nutmeg, pepper, ginger and cardamom, grown mostly in Zanzibar and Pemba Island) for export. The remaining natural forest habitat is now located in the Jozani Chwaka bay region (southwest) and the Kiwenga forest in the northeast and the coral rag thicket. The wildlife in the Zanzibar Archipelago is spread over Zanzibar's land area and also along the coastline. Some species are threatened or have become extinct due to indiscriminate hunting over the years. In Zanzibar, the only national park is Jozani Chwaka Bay National Park; there are also forest reserves, namely Ngezi Forest Reserve, Kiwengwa/Pongwe Forest Reserve, Kidike Root Site and Zala Park. Zanzibar's marine fauna reflects the rich marine diversity of East Africa. The parks devoted to the protection of Zanzibar's marine resources are Chumbe Marine Park, Mnemba Marine Park, Misali Marine Park, Menai Marine Park, Tumbatu Island, Chapwani Island and Changuu Island. ;Climate Temperatures recorded at Zanzibar town show a maximum of recorded in March and minimum of from July to September. Annual rainfall is ; it peaks in April and May at , respectively, drops to in July and August, and recovers to in November and December. Protected areas =National park= Jozani (centre-south) within Zanzibar. Jozani Chwaka Bay National Park (JCBNP) is the only national park in Zanzibar, covering an area of , occupying the largest near-natural forest area on Zanzibar.\\" It is in the island of Unguja. Habitats within the park and associated protected lands include groundwater forest, coastal forest, and grassland, with mangrove forest and salt marsh on the coast. The fa species found here are the Zanzibar red colobus (Piliocolobus kirkii), an endangered species (in the IUCN List) endemic monkey and the Aders's duiker; groups of the colobus monkeys are seen close to the park. Wading birds are recorded in the marshy areas along with seaweed. The coral rag in the park is the earliest settlement, which was exploited for agricultural development due to population pressure. However, with help from the Government of Australia and CARE Tanzania, Government of Zanzibar established the Jozani Chwaka Bay Conservation Project, in 1995. Zanzibar‚Äôs first national park‚Äôs maintenance is partly met from the revenue generated from entry fee charged on visitors to the park. This fee is also shared with the Jozani Conservation Society used to construct and operate schools and health clinics for local villages. The park has created many trails through the forest to watch birds and also an elevated board-walk to see the mangrove forest. =Wildlife reserves= ;Ngezi forest reserve Ngezi Forest Reserve covers an area of and is in the northwestern tip of Pemba Island. It was declared a reserve in 1950 after most of the area had been denuded for cultivation of cloves. It still has high closed forest known as Ngezi forest extending right up to the beach at Vumawimbi. The forest types reported consist of coral bushes and thickets, thick grasses and bushes in the sandy-loam soils and Mtifutifu soils; dominant plant species are: Odyendea zimmermanni (Mjoho), riverine forest of Barringtonia racemosa (Mtomondo), Milicia spp (Mvule), Alexandrian laurel (Mtondoo), Erythropholem spp (Mwavi), Antiarus spp (Mgulele), Chrisalidocarpus pembanus (Mpapindi) and Terminalia catapa (Mkungu), and mangrove forest. Avifauna recorded consists of 27 bird species in the forest, out of which the endemic species are hadada, the African goshawk, the palm-nut vulture, scops owl, the malachite kingfisher and the Pemba white-eye. Other faunal species consist of Pemba flying fox (large fruit-eating bat), the Pemba vervet monkey, the Zanzibar red colobus monkey, hyrax, Pemba blue duiker (an antelope about the size of a hare), feral pigs (introduced by the Portuguese), the Javan civet cat (introduced by southeast Asian traders for the production of musk) and marsh mongoose (an endemic carnivore). ;Kiwengwa/Pongwe Forest Reserve Fischer‚Äôs turaco Kiwengwa/Pongwe Forest Reserve is located on the northeast coast of Unguja, from the Zanzibar Town. The reserve is an important biodiversity spot in the coral rag zone. The forest reserve is rich both in faunal and floral species. The faunal species reported from the reserve are: Endemic species of red colobus monkey, Aders' duiker, sykes, blue monkeys, suni antelope and several species of snakes. The avifauna species consist of 47 bird species, which includes Fischer's turaco, Zanzibar sombre greenbul, crowned hornbill and white-browed coucal. There are 100 plant species which includes many medicinal species. There are also coral caves within the reserve where stalactites and stalagmite formations can be seen. There is also a spice plantation near the reserve. Coral rag forest, a sensitive ecosystem, is under threat due to timber extraction, since the 1970s. Conservation measures have been undertaken to preserve the rich biodiversity of the reserve. ;Kidike Root Site Kidike Root Site is in the central part of Pemba Island. It has the endangered Pemba flying fox, considered the largest bat species in the world. Other animals in the island are the vervet monkeys, Mozambique cobras, tortoises, bush crabs, red eyed doves and mangrove king fishers. It is located close to Chake. ;Zala Park Zanzibar Land Animals and the Park (ZALA) is a small reserve located about from the Jozani National Park. It is where many animals could be seen in captivity. The park was developed by Mohammad, the Park's Ranger with the objective of educating local children about preserving endangered species and the need for their preservation. The animal species are big pythons. chameleons, geckos, tortoises, crabs, dik-dik (mini gazelle-like animals), striped lizards, monitor lizards and hyrax (looks like a rabbit without ears and is one of the closest living relatives of the elephant). The reserve is set amidst rich vegetation of trees such as orange, lime, grapefruit, nutmeg, banana, ginger, chillies, black pepper and cinnamon. =Marine parks= Zanzibar has many marine parks, which are protected for their biodiversity. These are Chumbe Marine Park, Mnemba Marine Park, Misali Marine Park, Menai Marine Park, Tumbatu Island, Chapwani Island, and Changuu Island. ;Chumbe Marine Park Chumbe island coastal forest and beach. Chumbe Marine Park, recognized officially as Chumbe Reef Sanctuary since 1994, is privately managed and is successful as an ecotourism project. The objective of this sanctuary is to preserve and develop the rich biodiversity of the coral reef. Set up after a controversial debate over a period of three years between the private developer of the park, the government and the local fishermen, the sanctuary has received funds from the European Union, Gesellschaft f√ºr Technische Zusammenarbeit (the German aid agency) and many other donors, including the initial developer. The sanctuary offers a terrestrial nature trail and an ‚ÄúEco-lodge‚Äù for accommodation as well as an education centre. In particular, among the many awards it has received, the important ones are the \\"UNEP Global 500 Award for Environmental Achievement\\" and the British Airways Tourism for Tomorrow Southern Regional and Global Awards. ;Mnemba Marine Park Mnemba Marine Park is located from Stone Town and forms part of the northeastern Unguja Island. A marine reserve and atoll, its shallow stretch of coral reef is in the shape of an oval. It is located between Matemwe and Nungwi, which is an important ecological and economic asset. The area, which was earlier accessible to local fishermen, is now under 33-year renewable lease hold with \\"CC Africa\\" who have made it an exclusive island for \\"high-end tourism\\". However, part of the park has been declared recently as a \\"no touch\\" zone called the \\"House Reef\\" to ensure recovery of corals to good shape. The park has many aquatic and plant species. Green turtles, which are on the endangered list, nestle here in large numbers. ;Misali Marine Park Misali Marine Park is part of the Pemba Channel Conservation Area, which covers , including a ring of coral that surrounds Misali Island. The Misali Island area represents a reef ecosystem with high biodiversity and socio-economic value. The island‚Äôs fringing reef has 42 hard coral genera and over 400 fish species, including the endangered Humphead. The reef is also a source for larvae due to its closeness to the Pemba Channel that separates the islands from the mainland Tanzania. It provides for fishing as livelihood for the twenty Pemba communities who fish in these waters. There is a profusion of sea urchins indicative of finfish fisheries that provides economic avenue to 7,000 Pemba people. Its history has many events of interest namely, as a pirate hideaway in the 17th century and for the hidden treasures of Captain Kidd. ;Menai Marine Park Menai Marine Park with marine and coastal area is located on the southwest of Unguja Island. It has abundant tropical fish species, sea grasses and coral reefs. Mangrove forests are seen in many small islets. The aquatic species reported are moray eels, scorpion fish, lion fish, large groupers, octopuses, lobsters, rays, manta rays, whale sharks,Swim with whale sharks in Zanzibar sea turtles,Hoyt E.. 2012.

A marine reserve management plan has been developed with participation of the local communities. ;Tumbatu Island Baobab tree in Tumbatu Island. Tumbatu Island is part of the northwest coast of Zanzibar. This tiny island was once the capital of Zanzibar during the reign of the Sultan of Shiraz. The proud people of the island trace their ancestry to the Shiraz rulers of Persia who came to the island in the 10th century. The island is shaped like a long, thin dagger. Vegetation on the island consists of very large baobab trees. The island‚Äôs coast line is reef-fringed with coral reefs studded with multicoloured fish. The island has a large number of the Zanzibar suni (Nesotragus moschatus) called 'pa', on the coral rag on the east coast, duiker (Cepholophus adersi) locally called the 'paanunga' and Newmans tree coney (dendrohyrax neumanni). An important bird species is Guinea fowl. Jongowe village on the island has a population concentration as well as a large number of mosque remnants and a group of 40 stone houses, within an area of all traced to the 14th century. Mosque ruins and some stone houses built in the 12th century by the Shiraz people are also still seen here. It is popular for sightseeing, sports fishing and scuba diving. ;Chapwani Island Chapwani Island, in size, is under private ownership, and has white sand beaches on one side, surrounded by lush vegetation and many coral inlets with swimming pools on the other side. The island boasts more of history than wildlife. Fauna seen is mostly dik dik antelopes. It is north of Stone Town. It was formerly known as the French Island. It is also called as the Grave Island, named after the small naval cemetery and the tombs of colonial-era British seamen at its southern end, dated to 1879. The cemetery was specially built in 1879 by Sultan Barghash for the burial of English people of the Royal and Merchant Navies. British sailors killed during the battle between HMS Pegasus and the German cruiser Koningsberg in 1914 are buried here. It is about north of Zanzibar Town. Potable water is supplied from Zanzibar. As it is privately owned, stay on the island is allowed by booking rooms on the only lodge on the island or on a day visit only by buying a meal ticket. ;Changuu Island Prison Island or Changuu Island. Aldabra giant tortoises on Changuu Island. Changuu Island (or Prison Island), to the northwest of Stone Town, has coral rag forest. It is home to the giant tortoises called changuu in Kishwahili language, from which the island gets its name.Finke (2002), p. 648 The island is approachable by boat from Forodhani, the main port of Zanzibar. In the past, Arab slave traders used this island to keep troublesome slaves of the African mainland for auctioning in Zanzibar‚Äôs slave market. Even though it is called a Prison Island, in fact there was no prison at any time but only a yellow fever quarantine camp or slave transit camp existed here. A trail behind this camp, which is seen only in ruins, leads to a small forest area where a herd of suni antelopes is reported. Tortoises are also housed in a sanctuary here behind a restaurant. The tortoises were imported from Aldabra Atoll in the Seychelles in the late 19th century; they weigh about on an average, and some of them are as old as 100 years. There is good bird life; the most prominently sighted are weavers whose nests can be seen hanging from branches of trees. Flora Natural habitats have been largely replaced by cultivated areas for food production and spices (cloves, nutmeg, pepper, ginger and cardamom grown mostly in Zanzibar and Pemba Islands) for exports, consequent to population expansion of over 2000 years of anthropological expansion. The remaining natural habitats can be found in Jozani Chwaka bay region (southwest) and the Kiwenga forest in the northeast and the coral rag thicket. Other reasons for wildlife being threatened or extinct are also attributed to indiscriminate hunting over the years. Coconut palms are amongst the most important trees. Fauna The faunal species, both terrestrial and marine species, are found in the islands of Zanzibar; marine fauna found are mostly dolphins and whales. The details are: =Mammals= The 54 terrestrial mammals found in Zanzibar include 23 species of bats (popo in Swahili). Other species are: bush tailed mongoose (local name chongwe), which is found in the coral rag forest of the southeastern coast of Unguja and in the deep soil region on the western part of Pemba Island; the small blue duiker; suni (mammalian) or dwarf antelope (just tall); African and small Indian civet. The Zanzibar red colobus has been known to consume charcoal, possibly a learned behaviour, after eating the leaves of the Indian almond tree and Mangifera indica mango. Along with small animals, Zanzibar is known for several oversized species, such as the giant rat (Cricetomys gambianus cosensi) which can be up to a metre (3 ft) long with the tail. Dugong, internationally endangered species still occur in the region.The Wiomsa magazine ‚Äì People and Environment =Birds= Egretta ardesiaca, black heron and Ardea alba, great egret in Zanzibar Ploceus subaureus (eastern golden weaver) Birds found in Zanzibar including Pemba Island and Mafia Island (not governed by the semi- autonomous region of Zanzibar), are about 240 species of which: globally threatened species are four, introduced species is one and Endemics are species are eight. The genera of the birds and some of the details of extirpated, introduced, vulnerable and threatened spices are given below. Family of two of Numididae; three Phasianidae including one extirpated species of crested francolin (Francolinus sephaena); four of Anatidae; one Podicipedidae; one Phoenicopteridae; two of Ciconiidae; two of Threskiornithidae; 13 of Ardeidae; one Sulidae; one Phalacrocoracidae; one Falconidae; eight Accipitridae; five Rallidae; one Turnicidae; one Burhinidae; one Dromadidae; four Charadriidae; one Rostratulidae; one Jacanidae; six Scolopacidae; five Laridae; ten Columbidae includes two introduced species of laughing dove (Spilopelia senegalensis) and Namaqua dove (Oena capensis), and one Pemba green pigeon (Treron pembaensis), an endemic and vulnerable species; three of family Psittacidae includes two introduced species of rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri) and grey-headed lovebird (Agapornis canus); one Musophagidae with a near-threatened species of Fischer's turaco (Tauraco fischeri); three of family Cuculidae; one of Tytonidae; three of Strigidae; one of Tytonidae; three of Strigidae including one vulnerable species of Pemba scops owl (Otus pembaensis); one Caprimulgidae; five Apodidae; one Coliidae of the extirpated species of speckled mousebird (Colius striatus); one Trogonidae; two Coraciidae; six of Alcedinidae; one of Meropidae; two of Phoeniculidae; two of Picidae; three of Malaconotidae; one of Campephagidae; one of Oriolidae; one of Dicruridae; two of Monarchidae; two of family Corvidae including one introduced species of house crow (Corvus splendens); four of Hirundinidae; three of Cisticolidae; three of Pycnonotidae; one of genera incertae sedis; two of Sylviidae; one of Timaliidae; one of Zosteropidae, Pemba white-eye (Zosterops vaughani); three of Sturnidae; one of Turdidae; five of Muscicapidae; seven of Nectariniidae; two of Passeridae; seven of Ploceidae; ten of Estrildidae including one introduced species of blue-breasted cordon-bleu (Uraeginthus angolensis) and vulnerable and introduced species of Java sparrow (Lonchura oryzivora); two Viduidae; one Motacillidae; and one Fringillidae. Some of the prominent bird species are tropical finches on Unguja Island's east coast, endemic sun birds on Pemba Island, the Pemba scops owl that lives on clove trees. =Invertebrates= Papilio demodocus in Zanzibar, Nungwi. Widespread species of the Danaid eggfly (hypolimnas misippus), Nymphalid butterfly in Nungwi. The islands of Zanzibar have a large number of butterflies. Pete village, has the Zanzibar Butterfly Centre (ZBC), which was established in 2008. At this centre, local butter fly species are farmed for which training on the knowledge of their botanical and natural habitats are provided to a large number of farmers. This enables farmers to have additional avenues for income generation. The farmers have also established a \\"Farmers Council\\" to interact and disseminate the knowledge acquired, to other farmers. The farming involves creating a small netted enclosure with food plants placed in it to attract butterflies. Out of the butterflies caught in the netted enclosure, the female species are segregated into another breeding cage where they lay eggs, which are then kept in a pest free box to hatch caterpillars or larva. The hatching process takes about two weeks. Following the hatching, they are allowed to pupate on the underside of selected leaves, which again takes about two weeks. The pupae are then sold by the farmers, after retaining some stock for further regeneration in the cages. This project has been assisted by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund. The ZBC works in close association with Jozani Chwaka Bay National Park, Jozani Environmental Conservation Association (JECA) and Pete Development Association (PDA). The butterfly known as the \\"flying handkerchief\\" can be seen in this village. However, bigger and larger butterflies are seen in the wild. The coconut crab, a crustacean which climbs up palm trees and break the shells with its huge claws (called locally as tuu) is found mostly in Pemba Island. This endangered species inhabits the reserved areas of coral rag forest. Giant millipedes are seen all over the forest land, and a giant land snail (Achatina reticulata) measures more than in length. Conservation A Community Based Forest Management and Socioeconomic Development Project was undertaken, from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2007, around the only national park in Zanzibar for the conservation of its unique flora and fauna. The project was a joint effort of the Zanzibar Department of Commercial Crops, Fruits and Forestry (DCCFF), Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), CARE International in Tanzania, the Jozani Environmental Conservation Association (JECA), the Jozani Community Development Organization (JOCDO), Zanzibar Beekeeping Association (ZABA) and the Menai Bay Conservation Project (WWF funded project) under the CEPF grant. This was a follow up project of the earlier conservation project which was undertaken between 1995 and 2003 in nine core villages of the same park. The objectives of this second project, based on lessons learned from the first project, aimed \\"at enhancing forest and wildlife conservation through resource governance practices, livelihood improvement, accurate data of wildlife and building capacity of community organizations and the Department of Commercial Crops, Fruits and Forestry.\\" The Tanzanian Department of Commercial Crops and Forestry has the task of forest conservation while marine parks are under the control of the Department of Fisheries and Marine Resources. A protected area network has also been established recently which is in the process of expansion. Conservation efforts are on to preserve red colobus and the Aders' duiker (presently unprotected in farmlands).

The institute is headed by a director-general, as of date in person of Bukar Bukarambe. Early history The Nigerian Institute of International Affairs was established in 1961 but inaugurated in May 1963, with the support of the then prime minister of the Federation of Nigeria, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. The primary financial support for the Institute came from grants from the federal and regional governments of Nigeria with assistance from certain foreign governments and from the Ford Foundation of the United States and membership fees from both individuals and corporate members. The institute was housed from 1963‚Äì1966 in a modest colonial-type house at Onikan, Lagos, but its permanent home moved to Kofo Abayomi Street in Victoria Island. It has a modern complex of buildings, which includes a 75-seat conference hall, equipped with simultaneous translating facilities, an auditorium accommodating 400, and a library wing for 100,000 volumes of books and journals, with an area for a press and pamphlet collection. A central four-floor headquarters building and a three-floor extension accommodates the administrative offices, research and conference rooms. Olasupo Ojedokun, the second director-general, was credited with initiating a programme for the Institute of interdisciplinary research, symposia, and lectures, and the publication of monographs and surveys, with emphasis on African affairs.The Journal of Modern African Studies / Volume 4 / Issue 3, pp. 366‚Äì367, Published online: 11 November 2008.

For the painting by Juan Luna, see Una Mestiza. Ang Mestisa (The Mestiza) is a well-known Tagalog-language novel written by Filipino novelist Engracio L. Valmonte in 1920. Published in two parts, the novel was divided into two books entitled Ang Mestisa Unang Bahagi (The Mestiza Part One) and Ang Mestisa Ikalawang Bahagi (The Mestiza Part Two). The novel was published in Manila, Philippines by the Imprenta Ilagan y Compa√±ia in 1921. It was printed by the Imprenta Nacional during the American period in Philippine history. Later on, the novel was adapted as a zarzuela. Description The setting of the novel was the way of life in the high-levels of Philippine society. The main characters of the story are Elsa (the mestiza), Tirso Silveira (a poet and lawyer), and Teang (the female college student). The main focus of the novel is Elsa, who being a mestiza of Spanish descent, was the representation of arrogance, selfishness, and contemptuousness of the Filipino lower-class. Elsa fell in love with Tirso Silveira but Silveira fell in love with Teang, the representation of coyness or diffidence, kindness, and warmth. Elsa and Teang are opposites of one another. The love triangle, despite of Elsa's plans to win Silveira‚Äôs heart, resulted in the union of Silveira and Teang. Elsa, as a consequence of her failure, succumbs to insanity.

Background  Sabha is a city of around 210,000 people located by an oasis in the Libyan Desert and is home to an important military base. Much of its population are migrants from Chad, Niger, and Sudan. These migrants had been brought to Libya by Gaddafi in the 1980s and given employment and stipends by the regime to ensure their support. In addition, the city is home to a large number of members of the Qadhadhfa tribe, to which Gaddafi belongs. As a result, the city was regarded as a stronghold of pro- Gaddafi sentiment as the anti-regime protests that began across Libya in February 2011 turned into civil war. As the conflict progressed, however, many of the migrants went north to fight against the rebels, draining Gaddafi's major base of support in the city. Those who remained behind were mostly armed young locals and members of the Awlad Suleiman tribe. The Awlad Suleiman bear strong resentment against the regime. Shortly after Gaddafi seized power, members of the tribe were accused of plotting to overthrow him. Many tribesmen were executed and imprisoned as a result.  June clashes  After remaining relatively quiet for much of the conflict, anti-government protests broke out in the city in early June. On 8 June, government troops fired into the air to disperse a crowd of protesters, igniting a violent clash between the groups. Anti-Gaddafi Awlad Suleiman tribesmen \\"liberated several streets\\" in the city by 11 June, according to the rebel National Transitional Council. Rebels set up checkpoints in the main residential district of Souk al-Namla. Reports indicated that these rebels were armed, partially by weapons from rebels in the north. By 12 June, the city's residents stated that they feared pro- Gaddafi forces and mercenaries from the north were readying to return to Sabha to subdue the opposition elements.

Madden's paintings are allegories whose subjects are the people of the African diaspora. Biography Madden was born in St. Andrew, Jamaica. She moved to America from Jamaica permanently when she was an adolescent. She studied at several universities including the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee. In 1997 Madden became ill with IgA nephropathy. While ill, Madden rediscovered art. Art helped her to heal emotionally, so she decided that it was important to pursue it further. She received a kidney transplant from her brother in 2001, and participated in her first art exhibition that same year. Her first solo exhibition was in 2004, and it garnered her an interview with the late James Auer of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. After her solo exhibition in 2004, Madden relocated near Atlanta, Georgia. She met her mentors Charly \\"Carlos\\" Palmer and WAK (Kevin A Williams) while living in Atlanta. In 2007, Madden debuted a series entitled, \\"Kings & Queens\\", which focused on heightening the everyday person. Her work continued to focus on recognizing nobility, honor and respect in those often overlooked by society. Her subjects can be perceived as wealthy and powerful, but for the artist the imagery often represents a power that exudes from within. Madden created images based on her memories of the people of her native Jamaica, placing them in high status fabrics (raw silks, colorful satins, etc.), that mimicked those worn by royalty. Birds were a common theme in many of Madden's paintings, chosen as a personal symbol of her freedom from illness. Madden's influences were varied, and included Gustav Klimt, Milwaukee artist Ras Ammar Nsoroma, African royalty, Egypt, Asia and the clothing worn by native African and Indian women. She chose to paint imagery that represented the people of the African diaspora. The Black Queen (2010) by Tamara Natalie Madden \\"Similar to the works of Gustav Klimt, Madden clothes the goddess in a boldly patterned dress with clear ties to the arts and crafts movement and its populist underpinnings of advocating for art made by the people for the people. The unique quilting of the dress distinguishes the wearer while harkening to feelings of home and of natural, honest labor. Additionally, Madden's use of decadent colors and gold gives her subjects a life of indulgence that they never had.\\" Several of her pieces are in the collection of different departments at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee and also in the permanent collection of Alverno College in Milwaukee and the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History in Detroit. Her exhibition at Syracuse University in New York yielded a positive review from the Syracuse newspaper, The Post Standard. Madden's paintings have been featured in the New York Times, The Morning News, Upscale Magazine published by Bronner Bros., the Gleaner Company,Gordon, Sharon(Feb.25‚Äì3 March 2010),\\"Gallery offers new outlet to artists\\", Extra North America, A Gleaner Company Publication, Vol.2 Issue 8. Retrieved 13 June 2011 The Huffington Post, and On-Verge  Alternative Art Criticism. In 2014, Madden was named as one of 40 black artists to watch by MSNBC's The Grio. Madden's solo exhibition at the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust garnered positive feedback from local art critics and observers. Her exhibition entitled, Out of Many, One (the Jamaican motto) sought to expand the visual repertoire of viewers and their perceptions of Jamaica and its people. \\"Ms. Madden's recasting of the poor and neglected may remind an observer of Kehinde Wiley's regal portraits of inner-city black men, currently on exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum. What distinguishes Ms. Madden's work, however, is the specific focus on Jamaica.\\" Madden's work was featured at Art Basel Miami with Mocada Museum and International Visions Gallery. In an interview with Okay Africa, Madden, and several other artists talked about the inspirations for their works. Madden resided and worked in the Atlanta area and was a fine art professor at Spelman College. Two weeks after being diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, Madden died. She had one daughter.

Conservation encompasses all the actions taken toward the long-term preservation of cultural heritage. Activities include examination, documentation, treatment, and preventive care, which is supported by research and education. Object conservation is specifically the actions taken to preserve and restore cultural objects. The objects span a wide range of materials from a variety of cultures, time periods, and functions. Object conservation can be applied to both art objects and artifacts. Conservation practice aims to prevent damage from occurring. This is called ‚Äòpreventive conservation‚Äô. The purpose of preventive conservation is to maintain, and where possible enhance, the condition of an object, as well as managing deterioration risks, such as handling and environmental conditions. Historically, object conservation was focused on the category of fine arts but now many different types of objects are conserved. Each type of object material, typically denoted by organic or inorganic then the specific medium, requires a specialized professional conservator and often requires collaborative work between museum staff, scientists, and conservators. Object conservation involves the Conservation-restoration and preservation of a physical object. This type of conservator is differentiated from other specialists because they treat a broad range of objects and material types. This classification of material includes archaeological, ethnographic, historical, sculpture, decorative arts, and contemporary art.  History of the field  Object conservation has been around ever since people have been amassing and assembling collections for others to enjoy. Conservation in its early history was conducted by skilled craftsman and tradesman who could repair and return the objects back into a useful working or exhibition condition. Over time, object conservation as a profession has developed to the point where specialization for objects and the materials out of which they are made have become the standard of modern conservation. Conservation skills are now being taught at institutions such as the Master's Degree Program in Art Conservation at the Winterthur/University of Delaware located in Newark, Delaware. This three-year program is intensive as the \\"faculty and students use twenty-six well-equipped conservation studios, laboratories, examination rooms and workshops in the Louise du Pont Crowninshield Research Building at Winterthur.\\"https://www.artcons.udel.edu/masters/about-the-masters-programto conduct their learning and studies. A summary of important developments in the field of conservation and restoration from the 1500s until the modern day is available in Wikipedia at: List of dates in the history of art conservation  Preventive conservation of objects  In order to preserve objects for the future, museums, libraries, and other collecting institutions utilize collections care practices also known as preventive conservation. Prof. Ziad al-Saad, Professor of Cultural Heritage Conservation and Management at the Faculty of Archaeology and Anthropology Yarmouk University, Jordan defines Preventive Conservation as \\"the mitigation of deterioration and damage to cultural property through the formulation and implementation of policies and procedures for the following: appropriate environmental conditions; handling and maintenance procedures for storage, exhibition, packing, transport, and use; integrated pest management; emergency preparedness and response; and reformatting/duplication. Preventive conservation is an ongoing process that continues throughout the life of cultural property, and does not end with interventive treatment.\\" The practice of preventive conservation intends to provide the greatest amount of conservation for the largest number of objects in a collection. Jeffrey Levin, Communications Editor, Information and Communications, at the Getty Conservation Institute states that \\"In the long term, it, (preventive conservation,) is the most efficient form of conservation, not only for museums, but particularly for libraries and collections of ethnographic, natural history, and geologic materials. With comprehensive preventive conservation, the need for individual treatments can, over time, be reduced to more manageable levels, putting personnel and financial resources to more effective use.\\" In other words, preventive conservation allows institutions with collections to better manage their available resources when it comes to caring for their collections.  Ethics of object conservation  Museums, libraries, and collecting institutions have the duty and responsibility to take care of and preserve their collections for the future. In order carry out this duty, these organizations strive to maintain the highest standards of professionalism and ethical practice when caring for their collections. In order to direct and guide their actions organizations follow ethical codes of conduct such as the one created by the American Institute for Conservation(AIC). Such codes of ethics are intended to provide guidance and are not intended to be taken as absolute practice as institutions are varied in their size, scope, and nature. It is up to each institution to adapt, adopt, and implement ethical guidelines which are necessary to meet that institution's conservation requirements for objects in their collection. Some institutions, such as the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A;), have developed and implemented their own form of ethical protocols, procedures, and guidelines in order to ensure that the V&A; takes into account all points of views before any object undergoes conservation intervention or treatment. The V&A;'s ethics protocol is implemented through the use of the \\"Victoria & Albert Museum Conservation Department Ethics Checklist\\" https://www.vam.ac.uk/vamembed/media/uploads/files/vam_ethics_checklist.pdf which was \\"drafted initially for our (V&A;) own use, it was first introduced to the profession by Jonathan Ashley-Smith at a conference at The British Museum in 1994\\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation- journal/issue-50/the-ethics-checklist-ten-years-on/. Victoria & Albert Museum Conservation Department Ethics Checklist 2nd Edition December 2004 A.Why is action needed? B.Have I consulted records? C.Have I consulted stakeholders, peers, other specialists? D.Have I considered and weighted the factors contributing to the identity and significance of the object(s)? E.What are my options for action which will produce an appropriate result with minimum intervention? Above is a sample of the Victoria and Albert's Ethics Checklist. It is question driven instead of directive driven. Regardless of the ethics protocol followed, ethics plays an important role in object conservation.  Causes of deterioration  Water causes damage and results from natural occurrences, technological hazards, or mechanical failures. Many cases of water damage can be traced to accidents or neglect. \\"A great many of the materials that museum objects are made of are highly susceptible to contact with water and can be severely damaged by even brief contact, while others may be exposed to water for longer periods without harm. This situation is complicated by the combination and range of materials that may comprise each object. In addition, the vulnerability of individual objects to water can be affected (i.e. increased) significantly by the state of the degradation of the materials.\\" Water damage causes a variety of preservation concerns, including but not limited to: discoloration, cracking, softening, matting, distortion, mold growth, delamination, and swelling. Fire is a risk to both objects and their collections, both humans and inanimate objects. Museums and other institutions are vulnerable to fire from a number of internal and external sources. Most museum fires begin as a result of human neglect and carelessness, or are intentionally set. Damage to objects can be irreparable or can be mitigated due to storage choices (like being in a glass case), the object's material(organic materials are more prone to damage), or safety precautions that the museum has invested in. Fires also create soot deposits which can cause discoloration, dull surface textures, and permanently alter objects. Light fades materials. Colors that fade can disappear within as little as a few hours of direct sunshine, or just a few years at low museum lighting. But some types of objects are more fade resistant due to their specific materials. Ultraviolet light causes yellowing, chalking, weakening, and/or disintegration of materials. Infrared light heats the surface of objects, which is a form of incorrect temperature. Different deterioration phenomena often occur simultaneously. Incorrect Temperature is another source of deterioration. There are several ways that temperature can cause object degradation. One being that the temperature is too high: this excess heat can cause chemical, physical, and biological phenomena. The most important phenomena for museums and archives is chemical: normal room temperatures are much too high for the long-term preservation of unstable human made materials, especially those carrying images, sound, and text. Another problem arise when temperature is too low. Overall, low temperature is beneficial to collections, but polymeric materials, such as paints, become more brittle and fragile. Some objects contain materials that will deform and weaken, or even melt, above a certain temperature. Incorrect Relative Humidity effects a wide range of object materials and storage solutions. Relative humidity is the quality of the air that ranges between damp and dry, which causes damage to objects. Damp is when the relative humidity is over 75%. Damp causes several types of deterioration: mold, rapid corrosion, and extreme forms of mechanical damage. Mold damages any form of organic material. Physical Forces are the results of both direct and indirect actions that impact both objects and their surroundings. \\"Physical force can damage objects directly by causing rotation, deformation, stress, and pressure. It may also damage objects indirectly by causing collision between objects or object parts. Damage from physical force ranges from imperceptible hairline fissures and minute losses, to large-scale effects such as crushing objects, collapsing floors, and, in extreme cases, destroying buildings. Five important force-related effects are: impact; shock; vibration; pressure; and abrasion.\\" Dissociation is an immaterial form of damage, rather than something physically done to an object. Damage can occur as: rare and catastrophic single events resulting in extensive loss of data, objects, or object values; sporadic and severe events occurring every few years or decades resulting in loss of data, objects, or object values; and continual events or processes resulting in loss of data, objects, or object values. Object conservation depends on objects remaining in well cared for environments with up to date records and locations. Dissociation can happen both as a direct consequence of actions, like removing a label tag or making errors in records, as well failing to perform actions, like not applying object numbers with permanent materials or not meeting legal requirements to prove ownership of an object. Pollutants are present in most environments, even in enclosed areas. \\"Pollutants are grouped into a range of compounds that can have chemical reactions with any component of an object. Pollutants can be gases, aerosols, liquids or solids of either anthropogenic or natural origin, and they are substances that are known to have adverse effects (negative consequences) on objects. Deposits of solid particles are considered pollutants, and while they may not necessarily cause damage, they are recognized as altering the aesthetic aspects of the objects. In some cases, fine particles deposited on an object's surface can be strongly bonded.\\" Thieves and vandals can completely remove an object from the control of an institution while either destroying it or damaging it in a wide variety of ways. Like dissociation, this cause of deterioration is much harder to control due to the institution's ability to address vulnerabilities in their facilities, security measures, or visitors. There are many systems of control that help to prevent theft and vandalism from ever occurring. Pests are defined by the \\"National Park Service (NPS) Management Policies(2006) section 4.4.5.1 defines a pest as ‚Äúan organism that interferes with the management objective of the site.‚Äù For museums, a pest is defined as any organism that jeopardizes museum resources.\\"https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAP5.pdf Pests can include but are not limited to rodents, insects, and birds. An effective Museum integrated pest management program plays an integral and necessary part of every museum's collection care policy. Routine collections inspections can detect and reveal the presence of pests within the museum's buildings and storage areas. Common ways of reducing risks posed by pests are to reduce or eliminate food and water opportunities which provide an attractive lure for pests.  Object materials and types  Object materials vary from organic, inorganic, and composite objects. Depending on the material being handled with for storage or needing conservation treatment, the conservator specializing in the specific type or range of objects is considered prior to treatment. Conservators are to only proceed treatment with care and complete understanding of the material, and this is according to the Code of Ethics.AIC, \\"Code of Ethics\\", American Institute for Conservation, 1994 Organic objects can involve, ‚Äúmodern plastics, leather, feathers, bone, horn, ivory, hair, wood, and other plant and animal materials, including natural history specimens‚Äù, and inorganic materials consists of ‚Äúmetals, glass, and ceramic materials, as well as outdoor sculpture, and stone‚Äù. n.d., \\"Objects Laboratory\\", The University of Delaware, 2018 Composite objects are a mix of mediums that involve both inorganic and organic materials. = Organic objects = Leather is a type of organic object that is prone to deterioration when exposed to ‚Äúmicroorganisms, atmospheric gases, strong light, and extremes and fluctuations of humidity‚Äù.Philip Ward, \\"The Nature of Conservation: A Race against Time\\", Getty Conservation Institution, 1986 Because of their vulnerability, these types of objects require persistent attention. Special treatment is needed for objects of leather if restoration of their original state is desired. For example, when leather is exposed to mold, the object should be treated with a vacuum and or alcohol if it has been tested that there is no discoloration or transferring of color.n.d., \\"Removing Mould from Leather ‚Äì Canadian Conservation Institute\\", Government of Canada, 1993 Wood is another type of material that is identified as organic. Wood is a very absorbing material based on its environment. Thus, depending on the amount of water that is exposed in the air, the wood can expand and contract easily, changing the physical condition of the object.n.d., \\"Wood\\", American Institute of Conservation Wiki, 2016 This is the reason why wood material needs to be kept in a high controlled and consistent temperature and humidity levels. A too high relative humidity can cause wood to swell, and a too low relative humidity can cause the wood to become brittle. Extreme fluctuations of both can speed the deterioration process of the wooden object. With high relative humidity, wood is also prone to pests. An example of treatment would be to freeze the objects to kill any pests that may have been existing within.n.d., \\"Wood\\", American Institute of Conservation Wiki, 2016 = Inorganic objects = Ceramics is a type of an inorganic object. Treatment for such objects can vary depending on the purpose of the use or its‚Äô stability. When ceramics are broken and need restoration either because it is needed to be displayed on exhibition or for the stability of the object when used for examination or study, some type of techniques can include but may not be limited to gap fills, inpainting, restructuring, and polishing can be used for treatments. Kari Dodson, Emily Hamilton, Julie Unruh, \\"Ceramics\\", American Institute of Conservation Wiki, 2012 Types of Metals include ‚Äúgold, silver, copper, iron, lead, tin, nickel, zinc, aluminum, chromium, titanium, and their alloys‚Äù.Christopher Watters, Jeneva Wright, \\"Metals\\", American Institute of Conservation Wiki, 2011 Metal sculptures are prone to corrosion from air pollution and moisture in the air.Christopher Watters, Jeneva Wright, \\"Metals\\", American Institute of Conservation Wiki, 2011 Interventive treatments for metals is an irreversible procedure that need consideration prior to work. Such types of treatment include cleaning involving chemicals or tools such as Nd:YAG laser that can effectively remove layers of built-up ‚Äúcalcareous and siliceous encrustation‚ÄùAntonio Sansonetti, Mario Colella, Paola Letardi, Barbara Salvadori & Jana Striova, \\"Laser cleaning of a nineteenth-century bronze sculpture: In situ multi-analytical evaluation\\", Studies in Conservation, 2015 = Composite objects = Composite objects are made up of individual materials referred to as constituent materials. There are two main categories of constituent materials: matrix (binder) and reinforcement. At least one portion of each type is required. When combined, composite objects may take on properties and characteristics which differ from the properties of the original materials. Testing material from composite objects is a vital tool to help reduce or prevent further deterioration from Inherent vice (library and archival science). Not all objects will be treated because of the purpose of the object, or the intention of the artist. Consideration of the history of the object and the artist's intentions are heavily weighed prior to any treatment or testing of materials. Some example of materials which produce chemical reactions, causing physical changes to the object are silver and wood. This is because wood is known to emit acetic acid (ethanoic acid) that becomes a pollutant to the silver, causing it to tarnish at a faster rate.D. Thickett and R.L. Lee, \\"Selection of Materials for the Storage or Display of Museum Objects\\", ‚ÄúThe British Museum‚Äù, 2004 If corrosion of metals are considered for testing, the Oddy test is ‚Äúan accelerated corrosion test for effects on metals‚Äù Green and Thickett, \\"Selection of Materials for the Storage or Display of Museum Objects\\", ‚ÄúThe British Museum‚Äù, 1995 Certain cases such as the Necklace from Somalia, the British Museum had run tests for the yellow beads and the silver alloy that link the components into a necklace. The test was in fact able to conclude that the yellow beads were exposing nitric acid to the silver only allowing corrosion to the metal over time.D. Thickett and R.L. Lee, \\"Selection of Materials for the Storage or Display of Museum Objects\\", ‚ÄúThe British Museum‚Äù, 2004 Thus, the necklace had to be removed from the different components and stored detached in order to reduce rapid decaying of the object.D.

In 1897 he helped organize a chapter of the Union Reform League, a socialist movement. =Direct Democracy League= John Randolph Haynes, encouraged by success in Los Angeles, organized the Direct Legislation League of California in 1902 to launch the campaign for inclusion of the initiative and referendum in the state's constitution. In 1902 and later in 1904, the league sent questionnaires to prospective candidates to the state legislature to obtain their stance on direct legislation and to make those positions public. Haynes, paying most of the expenses himself, and the league flooded the state with letters seeking new members, money, and endorsements from organizations like the State Federation of Labor. They presented a petition signed by 22,000 voters to the state legislation in 1903. The league also mailed 2,000 blank forms to the members of over 300 labor unions, requesting them to petition state representatives and senators from their districts. The Direct Legislation League of California continued to ask for assistance in their campaign including Haynes making a direct appeal to the National American Woman's Suffrage Association asking for support and consideration of the relevance of direct legislation to their cause. Despite the various efforts and attempts, the 1903, 1905, and 1907 legislatures refused to approve the league's proposed amendments.

II (Pacific Theater of Operations), released as in Japan, is a Koei strategy video game that depicts the conflict between the USA and Japan during World War II. The video game is a sequel to P.T.O. It was originally released in 1993 for the NEC PC-9801 and had been ported to various platforms since, such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The NEC PC-9801 version came with an enhancement pack. A version was released exclusive in Japan for the MS-DOS operating system; it also works on Windows operating systems from 3.1 through Windows ME. Gameplay The Japanese fighter planes are fighting against a fleet of U.S. Air Force planes that outnumber them slightly. P.T.O. II is a turn-based game, with each turn consisting of a move phase and a plan phase. During the move phase, the player maneuvers their ships along a non- grid-based map. Japanese players may now invade all sides of North America through the Panama Canal; bringing a transport of troops to invade Washington, D.C. Restrictions apply in this game as the Japanese players are unable to replenish their troops in a non-Japanese harbor like Bangkok, for example. Due to limitations, there is no way to recover damage for the Air Force. Players cannot shift the older model airplanes with the newer ones. If the number of aircraft of Air Corps base units and aircraft carriers have been significantly reduced in battle, the troops can only be reorganized into different patterns. Taking control of the naval forces of both nations, each side tries to outsmart each other. Naval forces can be equipped with new technology when it becomes available. They can handle anti-aircraft weapons, radar, aiming devices, decryption units, incendiary weapons, flamethrowers, and missile weapons. Whenever the Americans are about to win the game or they score some victories, the game may have Adolf Hitler say some nasty words about the Allied Forces. Battles between aircraft, ships, and infantrymen are shown as the battle for a certain region is resolved. Ships can intercept each other on the world map and engage in an impromptu combat session. However, with the perpetual victories at the conference along with the fighting power of the units, national power for the Japanese has been enhanced. A lot of units and a dedicated infrastructure could exceed the national power of the United States a few years after starting a war against them, causing a collapse in the game balance. The final mission in the game has an extreme level of difficulty for the player controlling the Japanese side. During the course of the scenario, the Japanese forces become increasingly suicidal and reliant on the famous Japanese battleship Yamato in a desperate attempt to turn the tide against the Anglo-American forces. When playing the entire campaign from 1940 to the bitter end of World War II in Asia, the average player can complete the game in approximately 40 hours.

The earthquake produced severe shaking, registering at VIII on the Mercalli scale in and around Christchurch. It destroyed several structures and caused additional damage to many others which had been affected by previous earthquakes. The damaged tower of the historic Lyttelton Timeball Station collapsed before dismantling work could be completed. The earthquake downed phone lines and cut off power to 54,000 households. Restoration costs in Christchurch following the February earthquake were estimated to increase by NZ$6 billion (US$4.8 billion) because of the additional damage from this event. Forty-six people suffered injuries, two of which critical, and one elderly man died after being knocked unconscious. Background New Zealand lies along the boundary between the Australian and Pacific Plates. In the South Island most of the relative displacement between these plates is taken up along a single dextral (right lateral) strike-slip fault with a major reverse component, the Alpine Fault. In the North Island the displacement is mainly taken up along the Kermadec subduction zone, although the remaining dextral strike-slip component of the relative plate motion is accommodated by the North Island Fault System (NIFS).Mouslopoulou, V., Nicol, A., Little, T.A. & Walsh, J.J. (2007). \\"Terminations of large strike-slip faults: an alternative model from New Zealand\\". In: Cunningham, W.D. & Mann, P (eds). Tectonics of Strike-Slip Restraining and Releasing Bends. Geological Society of London, Special Publication, 290; p. 387‚Äì415. A group of dextral strike-slip structures, known as the Marlborough Fault System, transfer displacement between the mainly transform and convergent type plate boundaries in a complex zone at the northern end of the South Island.Van Dissen, R. & Yeats, R.S. (1991). \\"Hope Fault, Jordan Thrust, and uplift of the Seaward Kaikoura Range, New Zealand\\". Geology, 19, 393‚Äì396. This zone of deformation is now known to be expanding south and east into the Canterbury region. Beneath the northern and eastern Canterbury Plains, a series of active SW-NE trending thrust faults have been recognised, linked by W-E trending strike-slip faults that at least in part reactivate Cretaceous age extensional faults. New Zealand has a history of earthquakes. Since the European settlement, the largest on record was a magnitude 8.2 ML major earthquake that occurred on 23 January 1855 near the Wairarapa plains of the North Island. Another destructive magnitude 7.8 ML earthquake struck the region near Hawke's Bay on 3 February 1931; it is the deadliest earthquake recorded on the island to date, greatly affecting much of Napier and Hastings. In comparison, the South Island has experienced fewer large earthquakes. The magnitude 7.1 Mw event of 4 September 2010 produced by far the strongest ground motions ever recorded in the Canterbury region, triggering a large number of aftershocks. Although similar aftershock sequences have historically occurred around the world, such occurrences were extremely unusual in the region, which had shown low levels of seismic activity for thousands of years. The event has led to the discovery of previously dormant geological faults across central-eastern South Island, in particular beneath regional plains and the adjacent seabed. Earthquake USGS shake map The magnitude 6.0 earthquake occurred inland on 13 June 2011 at 14:20 NZST, (02:20 UTC) at a shallow depth of 7 km (4 mi), about 5 km (3 mi) to the south-east of Christchurch, New Zealand. Owing to the interaction of the major Pacific and Australia Plates, much of the regional plate boundary along central South Island is characterised by land deformation. The earthquake was a direct result of strike-slip faulting at the eastern end of the rupture zone of a strong magnitude 6.2 MW earthquake, which occurred on 22 February 2011 along the Port Hills Fault. The June earthquake was preceded by a magnitude 5.9 ML tremor with a similar focal mechanism that struck 1 hour and 20 minutes earlier. Experts believe the quakes were triggered by a previously undiscovered fault in the region, located several kilometres south of the Port Hills Fault. The United States Geological Survey reported a magnitude of 6.0 Mw and a focal depth of 9 km (5.6 mi) for the earthquake, while the precursor tremor was assigned a magnitude of 5.2 Mw at a similar depth. Seismologists reported that the earthquakes were part of a prolonged aftershock sequence associated with the major magnitude 7.1 earthquake of September 2010, which includes the February 2011 event. They were succeeded by multiple lighter aftershocks; the strongest, a moderate magnitude 5.1 ML struck a minute after the event. Another tremor 5.0 ML struck the region two days later. Despite significant energy release, the earthquakes were believed to have increased the risk of an additional aftershock of similar magnitude; calculations from GNS Science indicated a 23 percent probability of a magnitude 6.0‚Äì6.9 ML earthquake occurring in the Canterbury aftershock zone within the 12 months following the event. Weeks later, a magnitude 5.4 ML tremor jolted Christchurch overnight on 22 June, causing additional damage and prompting evacuations. Focused only several kilometres below the surface, the earthquake resulted in significant shaking over a large portion of central- eastern South Island. Maximum ground motions registered at VIII (severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale in Christchurch, while strong shaking (MM VI) was felt in adjacent populated areas such as Rolleston and Lincoln. The landforms of Sumner recorded intensified shaking due to the effects of its topographic setting. Widespread lighter motions were observed throughout much of the remaining region, with slight property damage reported from as far afield as Dunedin. The earthquake was felt as far away as New Plymouth and Invercargill. Damage, casualties and effects Soil liquefaction caused by the earthquake The earthquake and the precursor tremor struck during the afternoon near a populated area, where most buildings had been left in precarious conditions by the February 2011 event. The June earthquake affected roughly 400,000 people, most of whom may have experienced strong (MM VI) shaking. It caused damage to buildings and infrastructure alike, collapsing or otherwise destroying several homes.http://i.stuff.co.nz/national/5136644/Powerful-earthquakes-rock- Christchurch There were at least 46 injuries: falling debris struck several people, and two others were hospitalised in critical condition. In the city centre, two workers were brought to hospital after being rescued from a collapsed church. The following morning, officials confirmed the death of an elderly man who had been knocked unconscious from a fall in his nursery home. In the wake of the earthquake, multiple phone lines were down, and scattered power outages affected about 54,000 households. The tremor had damaged 70 underground 11,000 volt cables, contributing to the outages, and ruptured water mains, resulting in widespread street flooding. Officials ordered the precautionary closure of bridges in the area, as one bridge had already succumbed to the strong shaking. Several days after the tremor, dislodged electrical wiring from the ongoing aftershocks sparked a small fire in a control panel at Christchurch Hospital. Strong ground motions caused many secondary effects, including gas leaks and widespread soil liquefaction. Consequently, sand boils emerged from asphalt roads, toppling a few cars and sinking another. Several houses in the hill suburbs of Sumner and Redcliffs were affected by falling boulders from hillsides. Many parts of Christchurch lost water pressure, and residents were urged to be conservative in their water use. In some parts of the Heathcote Valley, previously dormant or non- existent natural springs surfaced because of a sudden rise in the water table, flooding some properties. =Socioeconomic impact= The NZX 50 Index fell by 0.4 percent to its lowest level since 20 April. In addition, the New Zealand dollar declined in the wake of the disaster, dropping by nearly 0.01 US dollar, or about 1.3%. Following a dramatic decline in event numbers, Vbase, a venue management company, disemployed 151 of its full-time staff. Nationwide, building consents tumbled considerably, further dropping by 4.5% in the wake of the aftershock. The earthquake's impact extended beyond national grounds; in light of its occurrence, Insurance Australia Group reported a net claim loss of A$65 million (US$61.5 million). =Damage evaluation= Though the exact extent of the losses was unclear, the earthquake caused additional damage to many previously affected structures in Christchurch; around half of the buildings in the city centre had already damaged or destroyed by previous earthquakes. Preliminary assessments found that over 100 additional buildings had been rendered beyond repair. Despite its moderate magnitude, the preceding magnitude 5.6 ML tremor caused several two-story buildings at a road intersection to collapse. Multiple hospitals and residential care facilities in Christchurch were left without essential services, and some even reported considerable infrastructural damage. Despite earlier renovation attempts, authorities were considering the complete demolition of the 130-year-old Christchurch Cathedral. The building had become structurally compromised due to its collapsed western wall, and the strong vibrations had shattered its stained glass rose window. The Christchurch Arts Centre sustained similar damage, though it had been in a precarious state prior. A three-month reconstruction project was scheduled to start in October 2011, with an estimated total cost of NZ$30 million (US$24 million). The tower of the historic Lyttelton Timeball Station, which endured damage from the February 2011 earthquake, collapsed before dismantling work on the building could be completed. Lyttelton Port, a major harbour in the region, suffered additional damage from the tremors and underwent full engineering assessments. The multi- story HSBC Tower shook considerably during the quake, but damage was limited to cracks and broken roof tiles. Artifacts from the Canterbury Museum collection were thrown into disorder by the aftershocks, several days after reordering work following the February 2011 earthquake had been completed. In all, experts estimated the earthquake would increase reconstruction costs in Christchurch by about NZ$6 billion (US$4.83 billion). Response In light of the possibility of aftershocks, police evacuated shopping malls and office buildings around the city. Essential organisations in the area were evacuated as a safety precaution, including the police headquarters and offices of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority. At Christchurch International Airport, officials halted operations after the earthquake, but all flights resumed later that day. Months before the event, a severe magnitude 6.2 earthquake occurred in a similar area adjacent to Christchurch, causing widespread destruction and fatalities in the city. Concerns arose about the condition of previously damaged structures, and the 13 June earthquakes caused further distress among many victims. Dozens of dissatisfied residents were expected to move out of the city, and many others sought professional help for anxiety and depression-related issues. =Relief efforts= In the immediate aftermath of the earthquakes, the National Crisis Management Centre was activated through The Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management to manage public response to the disaster; hundreds of police officers were accordingly dispatched to patrol the city streets. Authorities proposed to set up an outdoors emergency operations centre, as well as a public welfare centre to provide shelter to victims overnight. The Student Volunteer Army ‚Äì which partook in silt shifting after the February 2011 quake ‚Äì again prepared the recruitment of participants to initiate street clearing actions. A total of NZ$285,000 (US$230,000) was allocated for donations to nine charities, including NZ$40,000 (US$32,000) to both the Red Cross Christchurch earthquake appeal and the Canterbury Earthquake Appeal Salvation Army funds. At Westpac Bank, a public donation account was opened in order to provide financial assistance for earthquake victims. Chief executives from the Commonwealth Bank sponsored an exclusive dinner in Sydney to raise money for rebuilding costs; an initial A$700,000 (US$660,000) was allocated prior to the event, with entry costs of A$10,000 (US$9,500) per ticket.

Apart from tackling the \\"ills and injustices\\" in Philippine society, Busabos ng Palad revolves around love, romance, tragedy, and prostitution. The 157-page novel was published in Manila by Manila Filatelica. Setting The novel was written by Aguilar during a time in the American occupation of the Philippines (1898‚Äì1946) when the \\"cabarets and dancing halls\\", and similar establishments became common in Manila. These businesses became institutions that catered to men and their pleasure. Plot The plot of the novel narrates the love story of the protagonists Celso and Rita. Celso left Rita and their province to study in Manila. Rita disappeared from her province. In the meantime, Celso became a writer and coincidentally saves a prostitute from her fate by paying off her debt. The prostitute was Rita, his girlfriend. For two years, Rita became a victim of prostitution. Despite Rita's fate and reputation, Celso remained Rita's lover. Celso and Rita decided to live together. Rita became ill. After Rita's death, Celso became insane and was committed to an asylum. Influence In writing the novel, Aguilar was influenced by Camille, also known as The Lady of the Camellias, the 1848 French-language novel written by Alexandre Dumas about a \\"prostitute with [a] golden heart\\". According to literary critic Soledad Reyes, Busabos ng Palad is one among several Tagalog- language novels that defended, with \\"compassion and sympathy\\", women who fell victim to white slavery. Busabos ng Palad is also one of the Filipino novels that condemned the institutions that created this type of \\"fallen women\\". Other Filipino writers who ventured into this theme include I√±igo Ed. Regalado, Juan Arsciwals, Ruperto Cristobal, and Antonio Sempio. See also *Pinaglahuan *Ang Mestisa References E.

Glass Co., was an American producer of stained glass windows based in Portland, Oregon. The studio was active from 1888 to 1928. As the largest and best known art glass company in Oregon, it produced windows for homes, churches, and commercial buildings throughout the West. When the firm was founded in 1888, it was the only creative window firm in Portland, then a city of 42,000 residents. Povey Brothers was known as the \\"Tiffany of the Northwest\\" and many of the company's windows still exist in historic buildings throughout the region, including those on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The windows were considered to have extraordinary quality and beauty, and the firm's work was virtually unequaled in the Pacific Northwest. The heyday of Povey Brothers coincided with the growing economic affluence of the region, and the brothers' work was much sought after by the new rich to decorate the large houses they were building. Of this sort of installation, art glass expert Michael McCary said, \\"People who put in that kind of glass were kind of showing off.\\" The Great Depression and changes in house styles eventually caused demand for the brothers' work to decline, however. Today Povey Brothers windows are a mark of pride in many landmark buildings in Portland. History John E. G. Povey House, Portland, Oregon, home of one of the Povey Brothers The company was founded by David Lincoln Povey, the son of English-born stained glass window maker Joseph Povey, who immigrated to the United States in 1848 and subsequently worked in stained glass in Philadelphia, New York City, and Newark, New Jersey. The family, who had been in the stained glass trade for generations, eventually settled in St. Louis, Missouri. David Povey was born in 1865. He studied art at Cooper Union in New York and traveled in Europe for further study before moving to Portland. David formed the glass company in 1888 with his brother John, shortly after working on a commission for First Presbyterian Church. The company incorporated in 1893. John was the main craftsman and did the glazing and leading, while David did the design and art work. Their brother George Povey later joined the company as its accountant and business manager, and two Povey sisters also worked for the company. All three of the brothers worked in various glass studios on the East Coast before establishing their Portland shop. At the height of their business, the brothers employed 25 workers, including several Povey family members. David died in 1924 and his sons David and Darrel took over the business. In 1925, they hired Albert Gerlach, formerly of Giannini & Hilgart in Chicago and trained at the Art Institute of Chicago, to assist in the business. The Povey Brothers sold the company to W. P. Fuller in 1930, and Gerlach remained at the company until 1950. John Povey died in 1917. His Queen Anne Victorian home in the Irvington neighborhood, the John E. G. Povey House, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. with David Povey's daughter, Portland architect Polly Povey Thompson, had planned to write a book on her father's works, but she died in 1994 before it could be completed. Production and style Povey Brothers window at Deepwood Estate, Salem, Oregon, showing their signature dogwood motif The brothers imported their glass from Europe, but designed and constructed their windows in Portland. They often used opalescent glass in their work, a style that John La Farge and Louis Tiffany had pioneered in the 1870s. Their church windows were done in a Classical style often based on famous religious paintings, such as those by Raphael, and had images or scenes painted on nonopalescent glass. They were also noted for their use of \\"jewels\\", small, thickly cut faceted pieces of glass in rich colors, and for several other types and textures of glass, including Kokomo, crackle, rippled, granite-textured, and machine- rolled. The studio's early residential work was colorful and ornate, often using Art Nouveau motifs, and later work was influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement. Popular motifs included grape clusters, roses, lilies, birds, and dogwood, which became a signature of the company. Another notable feature of the studio's work was the use of clear glass in the background to allow light to pass through the windows on the Northwest's typically overcast days. Besides windows, the company also designed other glass products, including light fixtures that had a horizontal Prairie School design influence. The studio was known for using the latest equipment and trade techniques, and for working with architects and homeowners to create unique designs that set the Poveys apart. David Povey, who developed a distinct style, designed virtually every window that left the studio. While the company's residential work was often small in scale, its church installations could be quite massive, with multiple panels. Most Povey windows are not signed, which led to imitators passing off their work as the Poveys'. It also makes the Poveys' work difficult to identify. In 1923, David Povey began signing the widows with \\"Povey Brothers Studio\\" and the year of completion. This may have first been done for the windows of the First Christian Church in Portland, and the last such signatures may have been on the windows of Atkinson Memorial Church in 1924, the year David died. Studios By 1889, the Povey Brothers Studio was located in the Phoenix Building at 124 SW Ash Street in Portland. The building is a contributing property in the Skidmore/Old Town Historic District. In 1905, the company relocated to the Povey Building at 408 NW 5th Avenue in Portland, designed for them by architect Emil Schacht. The company was still located there in 1926. The Povey Building is a contributing property to the Portland New Chinatown/Japantown Historic District.

He was a leader of the anti-conscription movement, and of protests against Australian involvement in the Vietnam War, in the 1960s. He went on to become a successful second-hand bookseller. Politics and activism Gould first came to public attention in 1966 as Convenor of the Vietnam Action Campaign, a group opposed to conscription and participation in the Vietnam War. Gould was already being described as a \\"habitual protester\\". By 1969 Gould was seen as having influence over Labor Clubs at the University of Sydney, the University of New South Wales and Macquarie University. Gould went on to fight for many other issues, including Irish civil rights, Indonesian atrocities in East Timor, and the war on Iraq. He was a prolific writer on the many causes in which he believed. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) held a file on Gould that ran to 8000 pages. He inspired organisations like the scandalously named but nobly aspirational SCREW (the Society for the Cultivation of Revolution Everywhere) and the more sober High School Students Against the Vietnam War. He was also a key supporter of the anti-conscription movement of this time. In 1966 Gould helped to chase and capture the attempted assassin of Labor leader Arthur Calwell. Bob Gould joined the Australian Labor Party at the age of 17, about 1954, and remained a member of that party throughout his life. He joined the party just as the Labor Party split of 1955 was brewing and quickly became embroiled in the struggle against the right-wing Groupers. Gould wrote about some of his experiences at that time in his essay, Bob Santamaria and Bob Gould. While he was involved in the struggle against the Groupers, Gould has written that he was also \\"in the orbit\\" of the Communist Party of Australia, but he broke with Communist Party influence in 1956, after Khruschev's Secret Speech and the USSR's invasion of Hungary. He obtained copies of Khruschev's speech detailing the crimes of Stalin, and distributed them to members of the Communist Party and left-wing members of the Labor Party. Gould then made contact with Australian Trotskyists, who had opposed Joseph Stalin and Stalinism from the beginning. This group included the ironworkers union activist Nick Origlass, who worked in the Balmain shipyards and had led an important strike there in 1945. Gould at this time was also in contact with Helen Palmer, who organised a leftist magazine, Outlook, which served as a focus for anti-Stalinist leftists who had left the Communist Party because of the 1956 events. Gould remained a self-described anti-Stalinist Marxist for the rest of his life. Bookseller A typical aisle at Gould's Book Arcade, Newtown As a bookseller, Gould was a Sydney 'character' who opened twelve bookshops and closed eleven since opening his first shop, the Third World Bookshop, in 1967. His bookshops were notable for being fertile hunting grounds of underground comics and posters as well as an eclectic range of books including leftist tracts. He also stocked (especially at his Leichhardt, New South Wales store), a large range of Betamax video cassettes for many years after the format was considered to be defunct. Gould's shops pushed the boundaries of Australia's strict censorship laws at the time, and he was often raided by the NSW police vice squad. In 1969, Gould, then 32 and proprietor of the Third World Bookshop at Woollahra, was charged (along with Ronald James, 20, of Little Lonsdale St, Melbourne) with publishing obscene articles -- posters of nineteenth century artist Aubrey Beardsley including Lysistrata and Cinesius Pursuing Myrhenia. The magistrate, Mr S.M. Lewer, characterised the illustrations as ‚Äúlewd‚Äù, although the defence argued that such stylised nudity as found in the illustrations would not offend the 'average man' of the times. Gould was found guilty and fined.\\"Two Sent for trial on Beardsely posters\\", Sydney Morning Herald, Nov 1969 He and his bookshop featured in the 1999 movie Erskineville Kings. An article on Gould's business appeared in The Sydney Morning Herald just two months before his death. Death Gould died on Sunday, 22 May 2011 from injuries sustained in a fall while sorting books at his store. He was 74. Over 500 people attended his funeral on 26 May 2011 at Macquarie Park, the service being extended by thirty minutes to provide for all of the eulogies.

L√©gitimus was one of the founders of the Parti Ouvrier, the socialist party of Guadaloupe. It was politically aligned with that of mainland France.Le Petit Fut√© - Guadeloupe 2010 Page 61 Jean-Paul Labourdette, Dominique Auzias \\"Dipl√¥m√© du lyc√©e Carnot, H√©g√©sippe Jean L√©gitimus (1863-1944) est l'un des fondateurs du parti socialiste, align√© id√©ologiquement sur celui de la m√©tropole. il devient rapidement le symbole d'une majorit√©, \\"Robert Stuart Marxism and national identity: socialism, nationalism, and National Socialism during the French Fin de Si√®cle. 2006 Page 100 \\"In the course of this mobilization, the charismatic (and black) leader of the Parti Ouvrier in Guadeloupe, Jean-H√©g√©sippe L√©gitimus, became both the founder of Antillean socialism and one of the first and greatest champions of the islands' long- oppressed blacks.\\" L√©gitimus, councillor and mayor of Pointe-√†-Pitre, founder of the socialist movement in Guadeloupe, Member of Parliament in Paris, made an indelible mark on French political life at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The price of sugar went through the roof during the US Civil War (1861-1865). But it began to fall again in 1870, creating a crisis that had the effect of rationalising capital, wealth and production on one hand against the abolition of slave labour, unreliable production and social upheaval and war on the other hand. The crisis, and consequent world-wide disruption, continued until 1914, whereupon many families had migrated from Guadeloupe to live in mainland France. Socialism rose up in the thoughts and actions of workers, including the black slaves and workers on the sugar plantations, and amongst the intelligentsia. In 1914, the war to end all world wars began. Socialist parties quickly grew in number, strength and influence throughout recognised world diaspora. H√©g√©sippe L√©gitimus was the founder and driving force of the Socialist Party in Guadeloupe. L√©gitimus also founded the Republican Youth Committee and the Workers Party of Guadeloupe. He established a newspaper called \\"The People\\" in 1891. The Workers Party was politically aligned to the socialist-left and quickly became popular amongst the Guadeloupeans. It became very popular because it was the first Party to defend workers' rights and give a united voice to the black population. L√©gitimus entered the House of Deputies as the member for Guadeloupe in 1898. He became President of the Council in 1899 and was elected Mayor of Pointe-√†-Pitre in 1904. The new order of politics, aligned with that of mainland France, exemplified by Legitimus's socialist credo, attacked the virtual monopoly held by mulattoes in Guadeloupean business and politics. Mulattoes were accused by many people of acting against the interests of the black population. But, L√©gitimus also earned his share of critics because he was accused of collaborating with \\"the big end of town\\" over bank start-up finances needed by small businesses and support capital needed by on-going, large projects. Economic necessities in the circumstances, as always, might have required a cautious, rather than radical, approach. For a quarter of a century L√©gitimus was considered the voice of the black movement. Some called him the black Jaur√®s. Jean Jaur√®s was the famous French socialist, pacifist and intellectual assassinated by a young fascist war-monger in Montmartre at the beginning of WW1. L√©gitimus helped open the doors of tertiary education to everyone. He supported the political careers of Gaston Monnerville, the grandson of a slave who had a brilliant legal and political career in France, and Felix Eboue, who was appointed governor of Guadeloupe in 1936. H√©g√©sippe Jean L√©gitimus was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1937.culture.gouv.fr : certificate of the legion of honour He was obliged to stay in France because of the declaration of war and died in Angles-sur-l'Anglin on 29 November 1944. Following a proposal by General de Gaulle, his remains were returned to Guadeloupe where he was given a state funeral. Several boulevards in Guadeloupe are named after H√©g√©sippe and the main one has his bust displayed, perpetuating the memory of this great black leader and politician. During the commemoration of the sesquicentennial of the abolition of slavery in May 1988 several plaques were unveiled in his memory in front of more than fifty of his descendants. The commemoration was chaired by G√©sip L√©gitimus, a grandson of this exceptional man. H√©g√©sippe's son, Victor-Etienne L√©gitimus, journalist and husband of the actress Darling L√©gitimus, created La Solidarite Antillaise (The Caribbean Solidarity) to defend the interests of his compatriots. He actively participated in the creation of The Movement Against Racism and For Friendship Amongst Peoples (MRAP) and The International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism (LICRA). L√©gitimus wrote in an article in \\"The People\\", 4 February 1894: \\"The free man is made for speaking, as is the bird for singing. Woe be he if, intelligent, able to be useful to his people, to humanity thanks to his moral and intellectual faculties, he satisfies himself with vegetating miserably between fear and lazy pleasures! We are made for the struggle And whichever way we choose to direct our faculties, It as an imperious law that impels us to implement them.(...) I want mankind happy and smiling, I want a proclaimed and recognized equality between all and by all.

The American Redoubt is a political migration movement first proposed in 2011 by survivalist novelist and blogger James Wesley Rawles which designates three states in the northwestern United States (Idaho, Montana, Wyoming), and adjoining portions of two other states (eastern Oregon, and eastern Washington) as a safe haven for conservative, libertarian-leaning Christians and Jews. Rawles chose this area due to its low population density and lack of natural hazards. It is difficult to measure how many people have been influenced by the proposal to move to these states; USA Today estimated that anywhere from \\"hundreds\\" to \\"a few thousand\\" people may have come, although some may have moved for reasons of general cultural affinity rather than being directly influenced by Rawles's proposal. Concept Kim Murphy, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times, summed up one motivation for the movement: \\"For a growing number of people, it's the designated point of retreat when the American economy hits the fan. When banks fail, the government declares martial law, the power grid goes down.\\" The same article identified Rawles as \\"the guru of the movement\\". Summarizing one of his reasons for formulating the relocation strategy, Rawles stated: \\"I'm often asked why I make such a 'big deal' about choosing conservative Christians, Messianic Jews, or Orthodox Jews for neighbors. The plain truth is that in a societal collapse there will be a veritable vacuum of law enforcement. In such times, with a few exceptions, it will only be the God-fearing that will continue to be law-abiding. Choose your neighborhood wisely.\\" The American Redoubt concept is based primarily around the Rawlesian Survivalist Philosophy including the precept \\"Racism Ignores Reason\\". Rawles is outspokenly anti- racist and pro-Israel. Rawles published a blog entry in 2010 titled \\"Lest Any Man Should Boast: A Christian Survivalist Perspective on Race, Religion, and Reason\\", in which he stated that he was opposed to racism due to his Christian faith. He covered at length his views that people are individuals and that there is no inherent superiority among races. He observed that certain races have different genetics, but those do not matter before God. The only thing that matters when he meets his maker, he contended, was whether he accepted Christ as his Lord and Savior. In an interview by G. Jeffrey MacDonald published by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Rawles was quoted as saying: \\"It's time to distance ourselves from the vile corruptness that we see inside the Washington, D.C., Beltway ... [The American Redoubt movement] is analogous to the Puritan exodus (from Europe). They couldn't fit in and said, 'We're going to move to completely virgin territory and start afresh.' ... In effect, we're becoming pistol-packing Amish.\\" Rawles advocates a gradual demographic consolidation through political migration to the American Redoubt, but predicts that the federal government will \\"hammer\\" any states that attempt to secede under the current political order. Rawles also stated: \\"People who recognize that they are of the [Christian] remnant, that they are God's elect, will in increasing numbers choose to vote with their feet.\\" Reception In 2011, the American Redoubt concept was endorsed by 2008 Constitution Party presidential candidate Chuck Baldwin, who had relocated his entire extended family to western Montana. It also soon inspired the launch of a weekly podcast by Christian Libertarian journalist John Jacob Schmidt, called Radio Free Redoubt, and a volunteer network of amateur radio operators called AmRRON (the American Redoubt Radio Operators Network) established in 2012. It also inspired the launch of the blog and weekly podcast by Alex Barron, called the Charles Carroll Society, Barron, a black Catholic Libertarian journalist, is the self-proclaimed \\"Bard of the American Redoubt\\" who speaks from a Traditional Catholic, Constitutional Conservative, American Patriot viewpoint. In 2013, he opined: In February 2012, The Seattle Times characterized the American Redoubt movement as appealing to \\"a growing number of people\\" but concluded that as of that time \\"not all that many so far\\" had actually moved to the area. In April 2012, the business/arts columnist for The Ferry County View, a weekly newspaper in Republic, Washington (located inside the Redoubt region) was critical of the Redoubt movement, characterizing it as driven by fear. By contrast, in October 2013, The 700 Club aired a news segment that favored the American Redoubt relocation concept. In an aside, the news story mentioned how the growth of the movement has even inspired the minting of silver coins. On October 14, 2013, Christian Broadcasting Network completed a featured television news segment and accompanying article on the American Redoubt titled Redoubt: Northwest a Haven for Dismayed Americans. In the article they noted \\"...Some conservative American Christians are so dismayed with direction of the country that they're looking for a safe place for their families. They call it the 'American Redoubt.'\\" Westbrook continued, \\"I think that people recognize that tough times are coming. And it's time to think about their situation, it's time to think about how they live now, and the security of their family, the stability of society and how they are going to relate to that ... But I'm finding something else, too.\\" he continued. \\"That is that more and more people are resonating with this idea of getting back to the land, of living a simple, more natural way.\\" It is unclear how many people have moved because of the American Redoubt concept. In an interview on the Charles Carroll Society podcast in 2014, James Rawles estimated the number > ...well into the thousands, but it is difficult to quantify, because the > vast majority of the people who are moving are preppers, who are by their > nature very circumspect. However look at admittedly anecdotal evidence such > as the growth of Pastor Chuck Baldwin's Liberty Fellowship church in > Kalispell, Montana where the growth has been phenomenal, and many of the > families are moving from far outside of the Redoubt states. Rawles does not provide figures for what he terms \\"phenomenal\\" growth of the church, which meets at a local Hilton Garden Inn, according to the Church's website, but at his website, Baldwin mentions that some recent meetings were attended by more than 1,000 people.  Evolution of the movement  By 2016, Chris Carlson, a retired Democratic Party organizer, was comparing advocates of the American Redoubt to survivalists, with the difference being that the Redoubters have \\"become the shock troops for the Tea Party and openly support certain candidates.\\" Carlson also claimed that the political migration to western states like Idaho, Montana and Wyoming has been driven by Redoubters seeking to be free from the federal government and that while they disavow racism, they have chosen a location where there are no minorities. An August 2016 article about the movement in The Economist magazine mentioned that \\"thousands of families\\" have now migrated to the American Redoubt and that the movement is \\"quietly gaining steam.\\" Indeed, the election of Donald Trump has spurred on the movement. In 2017 the Inlander said \\"But increasingly, they [Preppers] see more political violence in big cities, and more of a divide between rural and urban environments. The left's reaction to Donald Trump's presidency, they feel, has deepened the divide, making the day they've been preparing for seem ever more imminent.\\" In a Chicago Tribune article by Kevin Sullivan on August 27, 2016, noted > It is impossible to know exactly how many people have come over the past few > years, but newcomers, real estate agents, local officials and others said it > was in the hundreds, or perhaps even a few thousand, across all five states. > Here, they live in a pristine place of abundant water and fertile soil, far > from urban crime, free from most natural disasters and populated > predominantly by conservative, mostly Christian people with a live-and-let- > live ethos and local governments with a light regulatory touch and friendly > gun laws.  Political influence  , it has been asserted that Republican Party politics in Idaho's northernmost legislative district have been pulled farther to the right in recent years with the arrival of conservative Christian \\"preppers\\" fleeing more populated states. Betsy Russel wrote for the Spokesman-Review on May 16, 2016: \\"Two years ago, two ultraconservative state legislators were elected from the district: Reps. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, and Sage Dixon, R-Ponderay. In 2016, longtime Sen. Shawn Keough, R-Sandpoint ‚Äì an 8-time incumbent and a moderate Republican from one of the most conservative areas of Idaho ‚Äì faced a primary challenge from the right but went on to easily win reelection.  Voices of the movement  There are three primary outlets for the American Redoubt movement. James Rawles' blog SurvivalBlog.com regularly covers Redoubt news and focuses on preparedness \\"how to\\" guides. John Jacob Schmidt's blog Radio Free Redoubt and his radio show The John Jacob Schmidt Show carried on the American Christian Network (ACN) and KTW 630 AM out of Spokane, Washington, carries news and commentary often focused on the American Redoubt.

Capability SPEAR officers are specialised in multiple areas, which are essential to make prisons safe in an ever-changing security climate, such as: * Close-quarters riot control * Transportation of high risk inmates * Close protection * Less lethal weaponry * Dynamic entry * Physical training * Combat shooting * Use of specialised weapons * Tactical rappelling * Close-quarters battle Their core functions include responding to prison contingencies and exercises, performing high risk escort duties and training prison officers in various core tactical skills. Selection process The selection process for suitable candidates is one of the toughest and most grueling worldwide. Modeled after the elite special forces throughout the world, candidates must go through various physically and mentally demanding challenges. They must also clear a challenging and demanding obstacle course within a stipulated time. Candidates must display grit, resolve, extreme mental and physical fortitude and teamwork to pass the selection. The five-month long training program is called SPEAR Tactical Course (STC) and it equips officers with the tactical know-how in order to handle crucial situations such as hostage rescues and high-risk escorts. At the start of STC, officers undergo a conditioning phase to bring them to their best physical condition. A main feature of STC is the close- quarters riot control (CQRC), which sees officers learning an essential skill set that encompasses weapons training, close quarter combat (CQC) and other tactical capabilities. Upon achieving competency in those areas, they will proceed on to harness their ability to execute scenario-based missions. Before passing out as SPEAR officers, they will embark on a 24 km route march where officers will be tasked with overcoming obstacles along the way within a given time frame.

Schaum (January 27, 1905, Milwaukee, Wisconsin - July 18, 1988, Milwaukee) was an American pianist, composer, and educator. Education Schaum received a Bachelor of Music degree from Marquette University in 1931, a Bachelor of Music Education degree from University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and a Master of Music degree from Northwestern University in 1934. Career Schaum began his career as a piano teacher in the late 1920s. In 1933 he founded the Schaum Piano School in Milwaukee. About the same time he began to compose piano music for teaching purposes. He also founded the first company to produce award stickers specifically for music students. Always on the lookout for better materials for his students, Schaum eventually decided to create his own books, beginning in 1941 with Piano Fun for Boys and Girls, which he later revised as the first in a series of nine piano method books that became the Schaum Piano Course, completed in 1945. These books are still widely used today. Over the course of his career, Schaum wrote many more books and hundreds of pieces of sheet music. His arrangement of the Marines' Hymn, issued during World War II, sold more than a million copies. Though he received only a fixed fee of $15 for this work, its success attracted the attention of Belwin Publications, for whom he went on to produce more than a hundred sheet music arrangements.

He was Council President in 1966. Langone, unofficially dubbed the mayor of the North End, was known as a defender of the \\"common guy\\" and an opponent of gentrification, as well as a budget expert who was extremely knowledgeable about the workings of city government. He was also known for his colorful personality. Early life Langone was born in the North End of Boston to a prominent Massachusetts political family. His grandfather, Joseph A. Langone, was a state legislator; his father, Joseph A. Langone Jr., was a state senator; his brother, Joseph A. Langone III, was a state representative; and his mother, Clementina Langone (n√©e Poto), was a civic leader who served as vice chairman of the Democratic State Committee. The Langone family operated the funeral home that buried Sacco and Vanzetti in 1927. Frederick Langone attended Boston College High School, Boston University, and the Boston University School of Law. During World War II he served in the Southwest Pacific as an intelligence officer. Boston city council Langone ran unsuccessfully for the Boston City Council four times before he joined the council in 1961 to complete the term of the ailing Joseph White. He was elected in his own right in 1963 and remained in office until he was defeated for reelection in 1971. He returned to the council in 1973 after he replaced Joe Moakley, who was elected to the United States House of Representatives. Haymarket vendors in 1973. During his tenure on the council, he supported the Haymarket Pushcart Association, and helped save the open-air market in Haymarket Square when politicians wanted to shut it down. Early in his career, he had been a member of the committee that had tried and failed to stop the demolition of much of the West End; this experience informed his views a decade later, when as a city councilor he fought to preserve the North End waterfront. He succeeded in getting the city to build affordable senior citizen housing, introduced rent control, and blocked upscale development that would have displaced many longtime North End residents. Langone initiated hearings to investigate Mayor Kevin H. White's private use of the city-owned Parkman House. He also helped write the Boston Funding Loan Act of 1982, which was created to settle property tax abatement cases that came about as a result of a Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court finding that the city had overassessed commercial property. The city received surplus of about $3 million when the bonds were redeemed ahead of schedule. Langone, who spent eleven years as the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, was recognized for his knowledge of city finances. City budget director Dennis J. Morgan described Langone's fiscal prowess as, at times, putting Langone in the superior bargaining position. At a time when racism was commonplace in Boston politics, Langone was supportive of black leadership. As fellow councilman Bruce Bolling put it, \\"He'll help anybody, black or white.\\" =Style= Langone was also known for making long-winded speeches. His tirades against the Kevin White administration led to the passage of \\"Freddy's Rule\\", which limited Council speeches to 10 minutes. In addition to his speeches, Langone was also known for his malapropisms, which included demanding \\"I want to know who was there! W-O-H. Who?!\\" when asking about a party hosted by White at the Parkman House and stating, \\"You couldn't even get near the place when Olivia, Newton, and John were there\\" while arguing that the Concerts on the Common should have made more money. He was also known for smoking Garcia Y Vega cigars and for occasionally offering homemade wine and tomatoes, the latter of which he grew on the terrace near the City Council chambers, to help City Hall committee meetings run smoothly. Other races In 1976 he was a candidate for the United States Senate, but lost the Democratic nomination to incumbent Ted Kennedy. In 1982 he was a candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts. At the Democratic Convention, he failed to receive the 15% of delegates necessary to make the ballot. He sued the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to get his name on the ballot, but the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld the 15% rule. In 1983, he ran for Mayor of Boston, fishing in sixth place in the preliminary election with 1.36% of the vote. In 1985, he finished in fifth place in the general election for four at-large City Council seats. He was again a candidate for mayor in 1987, but dropped out of the race to run for City Council; he finished in sixth place in the general election for four at-large seats. Later life and death After leaving the council, Langone maintained a law practice and wrote for the North End Post-Gazette. In 1994 he published a memoir and local history titled The North End: Where It All Began. Langone died on June 25, 2001, at his home in the North End. He was 79 years old.

He served four terms in the Florida House of Representatives, representing parts of coastal Palm Beach County from 2010 to 2018. History Hager was born in Pipestone, Minnesota, and later moved to Iowa, where he attended the University of Northern Iowa, graduating with a bachelor's degree in mathematics. He then moved to Hawaii, where he worked as a middle school math teacher and attended the University of Hawaii, receiving his Master of Education in educational psychology in 1972. Hager then attended the University of Illinois College of Law, graduating with his Juris Doctor in 1974, and moved back to Iowa, where he worked as legal counsel to the Republican caucus in the Iowa House of Representatives in 1975. Hager then worked as an Assistant Attorney General and then as the state's Deputy Insurance Commissioner. He took a job working as chief of staff to United States Congressman Tom Tauke from 1979 to 1980, and then returned to his work in insurance, serving as the Insurance Commissioner of Iowa from 1986 to 1990. During his service as Insurance Commissioner, he was elected to the West Des Moines School Board. Hager then moved to the state of Florida in 1990, and was elected to the Boca Raton City Council in 2002 and served as the city's Deputy Mayor from 2004 to 2005. Florida House of Representatives When incumbent State Representative Adam Hasner was unable to seek re-election in 2010 due to term limits, Hager ran to succeed him in the 87th District, which stretched from Hypoluxo to Deerfield Beach in Broward County and Palm Beach County. He won the Republican primary uncontested and faced Hava Holzhauer, an assistant states attorney in the general election. The Palm Beach Post endorsed Hager over Holzhauer, calling him \\"the better candidate\\" despite his \\"near-obsessive focus on support for an Arizona-style immigration law in Florida\\" due to his other positions and Holzhauer's limited knowledge of the issues. In 2012, when the state's legislative districts were redrawn, Hager was moved into the 89th District, which included most of the territory that he had previously represented in the 87th District. He faced an unexpectedly strong challenge in Tom Gustafson, the Democratic nominee and a former State Representative who served as Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives from 1988 to 1990. Gustafson replaced Pamela Goodman, the previous nominee, after she withdrew due to her husband's deteriorating health, and he attacked Hager for being \\"a shill to the insurance industry\\" and a \\"puppet\\" for his party, noting, \\"Bill Hager hasn't had an original thought in his mind since he left Iowa.\\" The Sun- Sentinel praised both candidates as \\"highly qualified,\\" but, \\"in a tough decision,\\" endorsed Hager, praising him as \\"a knowledgeable, open and accessible lawmaker.\\" Ultimately, Hager narrowly defeated Gustafson to earn his second term in the legislature, receiving 53% of the vote to Gustafson's 47%.

The Service is governed by its term of reference which allow for it to hear matters within six years of the first knowledge of a financial loss and, since January 2015, for the Service to award remedies capped at 309,000. In 2015‚Äì6, the FOS received 34,095 disputes and closed 32,871 disputes; a seven per cent increase on the number of disputes received during the previous year and a five per cent decrease on the number of disputes closed. The FOS was led by the Chief Ombudsman, David Lockce. He is supported by lead ombudsmen for banking and finance, general insurance, and investment and advice; with ten other ombudsmen supporting various functional areas and disputes. The Financial Ombudsman Service was superseded in 2018 by the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA).  History  The FOS was established on 1 July 2008 following the merger of the Financial Industry Complaints Service (FICS) with the Banking and Financial Services Ombudsman (BFSO) and Insurance Ombudsman Service (IOS); all of which were industry self-regulatory bodies. Two additional schemes chose to merge with the FOS later in 2009, the Credit Union Dispute Resolution Centre and the Insurance Brokers Disputes Limited. On 1 November 2018, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority launched as the one ombudsman service for all financial complaints, replacing three predecessor schemes, the Financial Ombudsman Service, the Credit and Investments Ombudsman and the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.  Operations and processes  = Principles = The principles underpinning FOS's operations and processes are to resolve disputes between consumers and financial services providers in accordance with its Terms of Reference. Banks and financial services providers must be licensed to provide their services to consumers. It is a condition of such a licence that the bank or financial services provider be a member of an External Dispute Resolution (EDR) scheme that is approved by ASIC. FOS and the Credit and Investments Ombudsman (CIO) are the two schemes approved by ASIC under the Corporations Act and the National Consumer Credit Protection Act = Resolution process = The FOS only considers a complaint after the customer has first attempted and failed to resolve their complaint directly with their financial services provider. Most disputes with financial services providers in Australia are resolved between the customer and the relevant bank, credit provider, insurance company or other financial services provider. However, if a dispute is not able to be resolved directly, FOS can then consider it. The FOS can make an official recommendation or determination and require a financial services provider to; * pay a sum of money * waive, vary the terms or release security for a debt * repay, waive or vary a fee including interest rates on a loan * vary the terms of a credit contract in cases of financial hardship * honour an insurance policy claim. The complainant (but not the financial services provider) may accept or reject the determination within 30 days of receiving it. If the complainant accepts the determination, it is binding on both parties. Dispute resolution by the FOS is free of charge for consumers. = Governance = The FOS is governed by an board of consumer representatives and financial services industry representatives. The Chair of the Board, since 2015, is Professor the Hon. Michael Lavarch . A public company limited by guarantee, called the Financial Ombudsman Service Limited, is the owner of the FOS. This company is approved by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) in accordance with Regulatory Guide 139.Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) s 912A  Senate complaint  In 2015 a complaint was raised in Submission 134 to the Senate committee on the scrutiny of financial advice concerning six conversations between the Ombudsman and a consumer's representative, who had recorded the telephone conversation. Submission 134 made it clear that there were differences between the telephone recordings and the working notes of those conversations made by the Ombudsman. Thereafter the Ombudsman was reported by media as having confirmed \\"the decision to refer the matter to a court given the complexity of the dispute, the inability of the FOS to cross examine all relevant witnesses and compel the production of information from third parties, as well as the need to engage experts\\", even though in recordings of the conversations the same Ombudsman said the only reason to dismiss the complaint was lack of staff, that the complaint had merit and that if the FOS had staff they would have ruled the dispute inside jurisdiction. It was this decision that subsequently resulted in Supreme Court proceedings to challenge the jurisdictional decision of the FOS not to handle the particular complaint. The FOS did not respond in substance. ASIC did not respond to the questions and, since the filing, other senators called for the FOS to explain the circumstances. ASIC appeared before the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services on 16 March 2015, where it stated that the Court dealt ith the issue of the misleading file notes. On 19 June 2015, the Supreme Court of Victoria found in the FOS's favour but it did not address the discrepancies in materials. The Court stated in its judgment that it did not examine any issues beyond the actual decision of the FOS itself, thus it did not examine any materials (including the file notes and the recordings), nor did it dealt with any allegations of misconduct. The FOS released a media statement attempting to dismiss the allegations and rely on the ruling by the court. The statement did not address allegations in the submission about misleading file notes presented in the discovery phase of a trial. Following media coverage of this case there were calls by a number of Australian Senators, including Senator Nick Xenophon, for the FOS to be disbanded and replaced with a government funded body. Despite criticism of the FOS, consumer advocacy group CHOICE and the government regulator, ASIC, are generally supportive of the FOS. CHOICE has stated that \\"while there is room for improvement, the Financial Ombudsman Service is providing an essential service of a high standard.\\" Furthermore, ASIC have continued to support the FOS as an 'approved EDR scheme'. In November 2016, the FOS attempted to explain limitations to its capability to enforce its rulings when financial services providers would not or were unable to pay compensation in cases decided in a consumer's favour. In such cases, consumers may have to seek formal Court-based enforcement proceedings or assistance from the industry regulator. The FOS has proposed an industry funded 'compensation scheme of last resort' be established to help pay consumers their awarded compensation if left stranded by insolvent or belligerent providers.  Government review  In 2016 the government announced a review into Australia's EDR schemes for the financial system, including the FOS. In November 2016 a Lower House parliamentary committee, which has a majority of incumbent government MPs, recommended a banking tribunal be established to replace the FOS, the Credit and Investments Ombudsman and the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. The outcome of the EDR review is expected in March 2017. In December 2016 an Australian Treasury appointed panel agreed that the FOS needs an added accountability mechanism in the form of an independent auditor.

History  The school was established as a small private school in 1907, and was founded by Malai Perumal Pillay, a local merchant. In those days it was difficult to persuade parents in Batu Gajah to educate their children. Pillay achieved this by going from door to door in the township. Eventually, he gathered 30 children in the school together with three teachers from Taiping. The first class was held in his own home. K. Mudalir was the first Headmaster of the school. All the costs, including teachers' salaries, were met by Pillay. The school move to a nearby site in 1908 when the Batu Gajah Prison donated the building material for the school from the old prison building. The people of Batu Gajah cooperated in community spirit gotong royongs and built the school. During that year, M.C. Champion was appointed to replace K. Mudalir as Headmaster. Over the next two years, the number of students increased to 80. This forced Pillay to hand the school over, on 9 August 1910, to the government of British Malaya and it was renamed the Batu Gajah Government English School.

The area has long been known regionally for its mountain springs and is now protected by over of pristine, uncultivated forest made up of privately owned and conservation lands. The area was once the summer residence of many of the Wyoming Valley elite including the Kirbys, Welles, Hollenbacks, and Sterlings. The community is located in Fairview Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, east of the census-designated place of Mountain Top. Early settlers One of the first settlers of Glen Summit Springs was John Conety. In the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, Conety owned approximately that included present-day Indian Springs and Glen Summit Springs. Conety had a log cabin on the property and kept a roadhouse for passing travelers from the Wyoming Valley to New York City or Philadelphia. After his death the land passed to his son, Richard Conety, Sr. Conety sold the land and a house he had built on the property in 1880 to Mr. H. H. Derr of Wilkes-Barre. Derr purchased the property for fish and game. A few years later Derr sold the property to the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company. In 1882 the Lehigh Valley Railroad along with J.E. Patterson organized the Glen Summit Hotel and Land Company and bought some more adjoining land to their original purchase from Derr. Here they began work on a hotel. The land was covered in scrub oak at the time, which allowed fantastic views of the valley that stretched before the westward face of Nescopeck Mountain. Over time this view was blocked by tree growth, but the addition of trees helped to increase the beauty of the neighborhood. Founding and original Victorian cottages Joseph E. Patterson, founder of Glen Summit and Glen Summit Springs Water Company The founder of Glen Summit Hotel and Land Company and later the Glen Summit Springs Company was J.E. Patterson. Patterson was a successful Wilkes-Barre businessman who sought to purchase property in the area now known as Glen Summit to enjoy the mountain air and resolve his bothersome insomnia. He purchased approximately on which he built his home, knowing the grounds contained excellent springs. Mr. Patterson undertook discussions with the Lehigh Valley Railroad and proposed that a grand hotel should be built to provide rail travelers a distinguished place to rest and refresh. Mr. Patterson's idea was embraced and in 1882 construction was begun on a magnificent hotel with Mr. Patterson acting as the general contractor. In the transfer of land from Mr. Patterson to the Lehigh Valley Railroad, Patterson retained that held the finest springs and began bottling pure spring water in 1884. This would later become the Glen Summit Springs Company. The Glen Summit Hotel and the Victorian cottages that were subsequently built in the Glen Summit Village, were, in their heyday, a gathering place for the social elite from as far as New York and Philadelphia. From 1880 to 1915 a total of forty- three Victorian-style and Cottage-style houses were built by vacationers to the Glen Summit Hotel, starting with J.E. Patterson and ending with F.M. Kirby. Some of these homes were even given names, though some of them have been lost to time. Some of these names were \\"Stony Croft\\", \\"Breezy Top\\" and \\"Greystone Manor\\". Many of these first 43 homes remain to this day. Glen Summit Hotel A postcard for the Glen Summit Hotel Construction on the Glen Summit Hotel began in 1883. Opened February 21, 1884, the hotel was originally built as a clean place where passengers could enjoy their meals. A pamphlet published for the hotel describes it as the following. > \\"In this sanitarium of Nature's own building, where all the elements combine > to produce sanitary conditions, it is the Glen Summit Springs hotel, the > most famous mountain resort in the highlands of the Keystone State. Perched > like an eagle's eyrie high upon the mountain's crest, the hotel is of the > Alpine chateau style of architecture presenting a truly imposing > appearance.\\" The hotel was three stories high and could accommodate up to 250 people. The hotel held a number of amenities throughout the neighborhood, many of which still survive today. What is referred to by current residents as the \\"Casino\\" was originally an addition to the hotel. This building included a bowling alley and billiards and shuffleboard rooms. Further into the neighborhood were tennis courts, as well as a nearby lake used for fishing and boating, both of which are still in use. Shortly after the construction of the hotel the Pullman car was developed for rail travel, eliminating the need for the hotel as a place for meals. However, patronage continued due to the lovely setting and amenities that were offered. During the 1890s patrons would be delighted to see that the president of the Lehigh Valley Railroad or another official would consistently come up to enjoy a weekend at the hotel. Eventually patronage began to decline when the smaller engines used in the 1880s and 1890s gave way to larger and louder locomotives. During World War I the hotel was a successful meeting place for preparing Red Cross war supplies. It was also used as a meeting place for the people of Glen Summit and the surrounding neighborhood to hold teas, luncheons and dinners. In 1909 the owners of the nearby cottages formed a new company called the Glen Summit Company and purchased the hotel. In 1910 President Theodore Roosevelt visited the hotel. However, no one could stop the decline, and after a few years the building was torn down. right Glen Summit Chapel The Glen Summit Chapel as of August 2011 In 1888 the residents and frequent patrons of Glen Summit contributed the money for a chapel. A rustic building was erected, one that was suitable for the mountainous area. Parts such as the organ and chairs were donated by patrons. Originally there were twelve services held each summer, but in 1932 this number was reduced to nine and eventually one. The chapel is still used for a yearly service as well as weddings, for neighborhood residents and outsiders, with the neighboring casino serving as a reception hall.

His formal installation as Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Verapoly took place on 18 December 2016. Cardinal George Alencherry, Major Archbishop of the Syro-Malabar Church, and Cardinal Baselios Cleemis, Major Archbishop of Trivandrum were a part of the installation ceremony. Episcopal motto The motto of the Bishop's Coat of Arms is \\"Love is the greatest of all\\" (\\"Super Omnia Caritas\\") (I Cor. 13: 13). Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants On 22 February 2011, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Bishop Joseph Kalathiparambil the Secretary of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants. After serving as the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Calicut for almost 9 years, Bishop Joseph returned to Rome to take up his new appointment. He worked under Pope Benedict XVI for two years until Benedict's resignation as pope. He continued to serve under Benedict's successor, Pope Francis. He has served mass with Pope Francis. Visit to the Port of Tilbury, London On 28 September 2011, a day before World Maritime Day, Bishop Joseph Kalathiparambil visited the Port of Tilbury, the principal Port for London. The main purpose of this visit was to oversee the work of the Catholic Maritime Agency, Apostleship of the Sea. Bishop Joseph also attended the launch of the Maritime Piracy ‚Äì Humanitarian Response Programme in London. This was one of his first official overseas visits as Secretary of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants. Mass on cruise ships On 21 March 2015, Bishop Joseph Kalathiparambil celebrated mass on board the cruise ship Costa Fascinosa after five passengers from the vessel were killed in the Bardo National Museum attack.

Diauxic growth, meaning double growth, is caused by the presence of two sugars on a culture growth media, one of which is easier for the target bacterium to metabolize. The preferred sugar is consumed first, which leads to rapid growth, followed by a lag phase. During the lag phase the cellular machinery used to metabolize the second sugar is activated and subsequently the second sugar is metabolized. This can also occur when the bacterium in a closed batch culture consumes most of its nutrients and is entering the stationary phase when new nutrients are suddenly added to the growth media. The bacterium enters a lag phase where it tries to ingest the food. Once the food starts being utilized, it enters a new log phase showing a second peak on the growth curve. A diauxic growth curve refers to the growth curve generated by an organism which has two growth peaks. The theory behind the diauxic growth curve stems from Jacques Monod's Ph.D. research in 1940. A simple example involves the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli), the best understood bacterium. The bacterium is grown on a growth media containing two types of sugars, one of which is easier to metabolize than the other (for example glucose and lactose). First, the bacterium will metabolize all the glucose, and grow at a higher speed. Eventually, when all the glucose has been consumed, the bacterium will begin the process of expressing the genes to metabolize the lactose. This will only occur when all glucose in the media has been consumed. For these reasons, diauxic growth occurs in multiple phases. The first phase is the fast growth phase, since the bacterium is consuming (in the case of the above example) exclusively glucose, and is capable of rapid growth. The second phase is a lag phase while the genes used in lactose metabolism are expressed and observable cell growth stops. This is followed by another growth phase which is slower than the first because of the use of lactose as the primary energy source. The final stage is the saturation phase. This process can also refer to the positive control of the lac operon.

Bacterial genetics are subtly different from eukaryotic genetics, however bacteria still serve as a good model for animal genetic studies. One of the major distinctions between bacterial and eukaryotic genetics stems from the bacteria's lack of membrane-bound organelles (this is true of all prokaryotes. While it is a fact that there are prokaryotic organelles, they are never bound by a lipid membrane, but by a shell of proteins), necessitating protein synthesis occur in the cytoplasm. Like other organisms, bacteria also breed true and maintain their characteristics from generation to generation, yet at the same time, exhibit variations in particular properties in a small proportion of their progeny. Though heritability and variations in bacteria had been noticed from the early days of bacteriology, it was not realised then that bacteria too obey the laws of genetics. Even the existence of a bacterial nucleus was a subject of controversy. The differences in morphology and other properties were attributed by Nageli in 1877, to bacterial pleomorphism, which postulated the existence of a single, a few species of bacteria, which possessed a protein capacity for a variation. With the development and application of precise methods of pure culture, it became apparent that different types of bacteria retained constant form and function through successive generations. This led to the concept of monomorphism. Transformation Transformation in bacteria was first observed in 1928 by Frederick Griffith and later (in 1944) examined at the molecular level by Oswald Avery and his colleagues who used the process to demonstrate that DNA was the genetic material of bacteria. In transformation, a cell takes up extraneous DNA found in the environment and incorporates it into its genome (genetic material) through recombination. Not all bacteria are competent to be transformed, and not all extracellular DNA is competent to transform. To be competent to transform, the extracellular DNA must be double-stranded and relatively large. To be competent to be transformed, a cell must have the surface protein Competent Factor', which binds to the extracellular DNA in an energy requiring reaction. However bacteria that are not naturally competent can be treated in such a way to make them competent, usually by treatment with calcium chloride, which make them more permeable. Bacterial conjugation Bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material (plasmid) between bacterial cells by direct cell-to-cell contact or by a bridge-like connection between two cells. Discovered in 1946 by Joshua Lederberg and Edward Tatum, conjugation is a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer as are transformation and transduction although these two other mechanisms do not involve cell-to- cell contact. Bacterial conjugation is often regarded as the bacterial equivalent of sexual reproduction or mating since it involves the exchange of genetic material. During conjugation the donor cell provides a conjugative or mobilizable genetic element that is most often a plasmid or transposon.[4][5] Most conjugative plasmids have systems ensuring that the recipient cell does not already contain a similar element. The genetic information transferred is often beneficial to the recipient. Benefits may include antibiotic resistance, xenobiotic tolerance or the ability to use new metabolites.[6] Such beneficial plasmids may be considered bacterial endosymbionts. Other elements, however, may be viewed as bacterial parasites and conjugation as a mechanism evolved by them to allow for their spread.

As a spiritual movement with roots in metaphysical beliefs, New Thought has helped guide a variety of social changes throughout the 19th, 20th, and into the 21st centuries. Psychologist and philosopher William James labelled New Thought \\"the religion of healthy-mindedness\\" in his study on religion and science, The Varieties of Religious Experience.James, W. (1902) \\"The religion of healthy-mindedness\\", The Varieties of Religious Experience. Retrieved June 12, 2011.\\"Our history\\" . NewThoughtHistory.com. Retrieved June 15, 2011.  Roots  Rooted universal science, early New Thought leaders shared a Romantic interest between metaphysics and American Christianity. In addition to New Thought, Christian Science, transcendental movement, theosophy, and other movements were born from similar interests, all in the late 18th and early 19th century. John Locke's definition of ideas as anything that existed in the mind that could be expressed through words;and the transcendentalist belief that ideal spirituality \\"transcends\\" the physical and is realized only through individual intuition, instead of through religion.Braden, C.S. (1963) \\"A Brief History of The New Thought Movement\\" , Spirits In Rebellion. Retrieved June 14, 2011.  Founding figures  Before anyone practiced New Thought as a set of beliefs there were a few influential figures whose teaching later contributed to the movement. The founder of the 18th century New Church, Emanuel Swedenborg, extended clear influence on many authors' New Thought writings on the Bible.Mosley, G. (2006) New Thought, Ancient Wisdom: The History and Future of the New Thought Movement. Templeton Foundation Press. p 131. Ralph Waldo Emerson was also influential, as his philosophical movement of transcendentalism is incorporated throughout New Thought.Mosley, G. (2006) p. 132. Franz Mesmer's work on hypnosis drove the work of Phineas Quimby, who was influenced in part by hearing a lecture by Charles Poyen.Fuller. (1982) Mesmerism and the American Cure of Souls. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press Phineas P. Quimby is widely recognized as the founder of the New Thought movement. Born in Lebanon, New Hampshire but raised in Belfast, Maine, Quimby learned about the power of the mind to heal through hypnosis when he observed Charles Poyen's work.Fuller. (1982) About 1840, Quimby began to practice hypnotism, or mesmerism as it was called. Through this practice and further study, he developed the view that illness is a matter of the mind. He opened an office for mental healing in Portland in 1859. Calvinistic Baptist ministerial candidate Julius Dresser and his future wife Annetta G. Seabury came from Waterville, Maine to be healed by Quimby in 1860. They were healed in a short time.(1999) \\"Horatio Willis Dresser\\", Religious Leaders of America 2nd ed. Farmington Hills, MI: Gale Group. In 1882, Dresser and Annetta (his wife by then) began promoting what they called the \\"Quimby System of Mental Treatment of Diseases\\" in Boston. Their son Horatio figures importantly as New Thought's first historian. Horatio, a popular lecturer, edited The Quimby Manuscripts, which Quimby wrote between 1846 and 1865.Quimby, P.P. (1921) The Quimby Manuscripts. Edited by J. Horatio and H. Horatio. Retrieved June 15, 2011. In 1862 Mary Baker Eddy, originally a Congregational Church member, came to Quimby hoping to be healed from lifelong ill-health. In later years Eddy went on to found Christian Science. Because of this, while not seen as a New Thought denomination, Christian Science is largely regarded by New Thought followers to be heavily driven by New Thought beliefs. Christian Scientists disagree, frequently stating that Eddy was not influenced by Quimby.Gottschalk, S. (1973) The Emergence of Christian Science in American Religious Life. Berkeley: University of California Press, p. 130. In 1875 Eddy published Science and Health, thus establishing Christian Science as a denomination. A former Methodist minister and Swedenborgian minister named Warren Evans came to Quimby for healing in 1863. When he was healed shortly after, he started writing New Thought literature immediately. One source names him as the first person to publish a clear philosophy based on Quimby's practices.Teahan, J.F. (1979) \\"Warren Felt Evans and Mental Healing: Romantic Idealism and Practical Mysticism in Nineteenth-Century America\\", Church History. Vol. 48, No. 1.Also see Albanese, Catherine (2016). The Spiritual Journals of Warren Felt Evans: from Methodism to Mind Cure, Indiana University Press. Prentice Mulford was pivotal in the development of New Thought thinking. From his writings in the White Cross Library, including Your Forces and How to Use Them, the terms \\"New Thought\\" and the \\"Law of Attraction\\" first came to fruition.  Movement leaders  After the philosophy of New Thought was established, several individuals and organizations rose to prominence to promote the beliefs. However, there is no consensus on who founded the New Thought movement. Charles Brodie Patterson has been credited. Patterson, a Canadian expatriate who lived in New York City, was labelled the movement's leader when he died in the early 20th century.Mount, N.J. and Mount, N. (2005) When Canadian literature moved to New York. University of Toronto Press, 2005 . p 91. One of Eddy's early Christian Science students, Ursula Gestefeld, created a philosophy called the \\"Science of Being\\" after Eddy kicked her out of her church. Science of Being groups eventually formed the Church of New Thought in 1904, which was the first group to refer itself as such.Braden, C.S. (1963) \\"A Brief History of The New Thought Movement\\" , Spirits In Rebellion. Retrieved June 14, 2011. While Julius Dresser, and later his son Horatio, are sometimes credited as founders of New Thought as a named movement, others share this title. Horatio wrote A History of the New Thought Movement, which was published in 1919, and named his father an essential figure in founding the movement. Emma Curtis Hopkins is also considered a founder. Hopkins, called the \\"Teacher of Teachers\\", was a former student of Mary Baker Eddy. Because of her role in teaching several influential leaders who emerge later in New Thought movement history, she is also given credit as a mother of the movement. Inspired by medieval mystic Joachim of Fiore, Hopkins viewed the Christian Trinity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Mother-Spirit. She wrote High Mysticism and Scientific Christian Mental Practice and founded the Emma Hopkins College of Metaphysical Science, which graduated a large number of women.Harley, G.M. (2002) Emma Curtis Hopkins: Forgotten founder of New Thought. Syracuse University Press. p 53.  Organizations  Numerous churches and groups developed within the New Thought movement. Emma Curtis Hopkins is called the \\"Teacher of Teachers\\" because of the number of people she taught who went on to found groups within the New Thought movement. After learning from Hopkins, Annie Rix Militz went on to found the Home of Truth. Another student, Malinda E. Cramer became a co-founder of Divine Science, along with Mrs. Bingham, who later taught Nona L. Brooks, who co-founded Divine Science with Cramer. Charles and Myrtle Fillmore, who went to Hopkins together, went on to found the Unity School of Christianity afterwards. Authors learned from Hopkins, too, including Dr. H. Emilie Cady, writer of the Unity textbook Lessons in Truth; Ella Wheeler Wilcox, New Thought poet; and Elizabeth Towne. Considerably later, Ernest Holmes, who established Religious Science and founded the United Centers for Spiritual Living.Braden, C.S. (1963) \\"A Brief History of The New Thought Movement\\" , Spirits In Rebellion. Retrieved June 14, 2011. The Unity Church is the largest New Thought church today, with thousands of members around the world. It was formed by the Fillmores in 1891. Divine Science was also founded in the late 19th century by Melinda Cramer and Nona Brooks. The United Centers for Spiritual Living was founded by Ernest Holmes in 1927. A similar organization, the Society for Jewish Science,originally conceived by Rabbi Alfred G. Moses in the early 1900s, the movement was institutionalized in 1922 with Rabbi Morris Lichtenstein's. The New Thought movement extends around the world. The largest denomination outside the U.S., Seicho-no-Ie, was founded in 1930 by Masaharu Taniguchi in Japan. Today, it has missions around the world, including the U.S.(1970) Rice University Studies, Volume 56, Issues 1-2. p. 210.

Dr. Michael Beckwith in the Los Angeles-area. A variety of umbrella New Thought organizations have existed, including the International New Thought Alliance, which existed in some form as early as 1899. The Affiliated New Thought Network was formed in 1992 to provide an overarching New Thought organization. Since 1974 the Universal Foundation for Better Living has been a gathering of Christian New Thought congregations around the world.DuPree, S.S. (1996) African-American Holiness Pentecostal Movement: An annotated bibliography. Taylor & Francis. p 380. In New York City, New Thought leaders created an umbrella organization called the League for the Larger Life. It lasted from 1916 through the 1950s. There have been many New Thought schools. The most famous may be the Unity School of Christianity in Missouri, founded in the early 20th century. The Emerson Theological Institute has operated since 1992.Mosley, G.

Early life Reed attended Jesuit High School in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he played on the football team. For undergraduate studies, he attended Spring Hill College, where he continued playing the sport. Reed entered Tulane University Law School and played football under head coach Clark Shaughnessy as a center from 1919 to 1922. In 1921, he was named team captain,2009 Tulane Football Media Guide, p. 190, Tulane University, 2009. and the following season, Reed was selected to the All-Southern team.Loyola Back Holds Record, The Milwaukee Journal, December 4, 1926.

He was responsible for coaching the freshman team.The Wolf, p. 107, Loyola University of New Orleans, 1927. In the spring of 1926, Reed was promoted to head coach at Loyola, which Spalding's Official Foot Ball Guide estimated made him \\"perhaps the youngest university coach in America\\" at 25 years old.Spalding's Official Foot Ball Guide 1927, Barnes., 1927.

After the season, Clark Shaughnessy was hired as head coach, and Reed was retained as an assistant coach. In February 1928, his contract expired and he resigned from his post at Loyola.Reed Resigns as Coach at Loyola, St. Petersburg Times, February 4, 1928.

He wrote and published for fifty years. He wrote seven novels, 11 short story collections, and five poetry collections, and made many translations of world literature, essays, letters and book reviews. Personal life Sukhbir alias Balbir Singh was born on 9 July 1925 to S. Mansha Singh and Smt. Shiv Kaur in Mumbai, India. He was the eldest of his siblings, who included three brothers and three sisters. He adopted the pen name Sukhbir after partition, when he was arrested during the student unrest in Mumbai in 1950. He had already started publishing in literary magazines and was a known name as a budding writer. While he was in jail in Nasik, one of his editor friends in whose magazine his poems were to be published, changed his name to Sukhbir, to avoid the authorities' attention. Subsequently, Sukhbir chose to retain this as his pen name, as many other writers with the name of Balbir Singh had sprung up by then and were cashing in on his established name. Sukhbir with Jasbir Kaur His father, S. Mansha Singh, was a civil engineer in Indian Railways. He was a religious man, but with a rational and liberal attitude. He was the first person to have opened Sukhbir up to rational interpretation of his own religion, and subsequently, to everything in life. He can safely be called the first influence in Sukhbir's life, which he remained throughout. Sukhbir's early schooling was in his native village Beerampur in Punjab. His father being in the Railways, the family was always on the move. When he was in the 6th standard, the family shifted to Mumbai. He did his subsequent schooling in Podar High School, Mumbai. He completed his graduation from Khalsa College, Mumbai, after which he moved to Khalsa College, Amritsar to pursue his master's in Punjabi in 1958, which earned him the rank of university topper and a gold medal. As much as he wanted to, he could not pursue a post-graduate degree in psychology. He started publishing in the leading Punjabi journal of the time, Preet Lari, edited by Gurbaksh Singh Preetlari. Simultaneously, he started taking an interest in the activities of Communist Party of India, and had great regard for its founder, Puran Chand Joshi. This interest did not last long as he soon became disillusioned with the political tactics that led to the severe humiliation and expulsion of Joshi from the party. He reflected hard on the communist ideology and chose to step aside to find his own way, while remaining committed to the Marxist thought and philosophy. Before taking up writing as a full-time career, Sukhbir was an advertisement-writer and college lecturer to earn his livelihood. By this time, he had married Jasbir Kaur. Soon thereafter, he left his job of lecturer in Khalsa College, Mumbai to take up writing as a full-time career, which was unusual and a risky proposition at that time considering the fate of writers in the country. Sukhbir suffered multiple complications after severe cardiac arrest and died on 22 February 2012. His son - Navraj Singh who is making an effort to share with the world the unpublished writings of his father. Influences Sukhbir's major literary influences were John Steinbeck, Anton Chekhov, Irving Stone, Sigmund Freud, T. S. Eliot, Pablo Neruda, Sardar Jafri, Krishan Chander, and Rajinder Singh Bedi. He was greatly influenced by the philosophy of Gautama Buddha and Portuguese philosopher Baruch Spinoza. His writings depicted the inner travails of the human mind as a significant aspect of the life of the characters, and these thinkers dwelt upon the ambiguous nature of mental processes. He also studied the works of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung to understand the inner workings of the mind to add psychological dimensions to the characters of his novels and short stories. Karl Marx's life and works also had a lasting influence on him, as Sukhbir identified with his empathy and concern for the underprivileged in society. Sukhbir was an avid reader of biographies of great writers and other personalities because he believed that an understanding and appreciation of their work is not complete unless one has studied the background contexts in which they lived and worked. Writing style Sukhbir is considered the pioneer of stream-of-consciousness writing in Punjabi. His novel Raat da Chehra (The Face of Night) published in 1961 is a stream-of-consciousness novel depicting the story spanned over one night. Even in his short stories, he pioneered the stream-of-consciousness genre of writing. A noted example is the story \\"Ruki Hoyi Raat (The Suspended Night)\\" in which the narrator in his reminiscences is recalling his long lost childhood friend who has become a rebel and is evading the repressive authorities. Sukhbir brought a new sensibility to the Punjabi novel by introducing lyrical beauty in prose and distributing his narrative material into pictorial scenes and adding dimensions to characters through exchange of dialogue. Sukhbir being essentially a poet wanted his prose to vie with poetry for the virtues of precision, harmony and rhythm. In Sukhbir's writings, progressive, psychological and artistic strands are inter twined. His realistic literary vision got strength from the pragmatic approach of Marxism on the one hand and depths of psychology and intricacies of arts on the other. Sukhbir had a good appreciation of painting and he occasionally did sketches. A painter's perspective is seen in all his writings. The poems in Nain Naksh (The Features) are written specifically in techniques of modern painting like Portrait, Nude, Collage, Still Life, Landscape, Self-Portrait, etc. This is a unique experiment in Punjabi literature. Observing the environs and its life from the perspective of a painter, he brought in a new approach in all three genres ‚Äì poetry, short story and novel. Sukhbir's self-portrait which is part of the poetry collection Nain Naksh is reproduced. ‡®∏‡©Å‡®ñ‡®¨‡©Ä‡®∞ : ‡®∏‡©á‡®≤‡©ç‡®´ ‡®™‡©ã‡®∞‡®ü‡©ç‡®∞‡©á‡®ü ‡®∏‡©Å‡®™‡®®‡®ï‡®æ‡®∞ ‡®π‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®≠‡®æ‡®µ‡©á‡®Ç ‡®Ü‡®Æ ‡®ú‡®ø‡®π‡©Ä ‡®Æ‡®ø‡©±‡®ü‡©Ä ‡®π‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®Æ‡©à‡®Ç ‡®ñ‡®∞‡®µ‡©Ä ‡®§‡©á ‡®§‡®ó‡©ú‡©Ä ‡®ö‡®æ‡®®‡®£ ‡®®‡®æ‡®≤ ‡®ú‡©ã ‡®ó‡©Å‡©∞‡®®‡©ç‡®π‡©Ä ‡®ó‡®à ‡®è ‡®Æ‡®ø‡©±‡®ü‡©Ä ‡®ú‡®ø‡®∏ ‡®¶‡©á ‡®∏‡®µ‡®æ‡®¶ ‡®Ö‡®®‡©á‡®ï‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®Æ‡®ø‡©±‡®ü‡©Ä ‡®ú‡®ø‡®∏ ‡®¶‡©á ‡®§‡©á‡®≤ '‡®ö ‡®¨‡©±‡®§‡©Ä ‡®ú‡®ó‡®¶‡©Ä ‡®Æ‡®ø‡©±‡®ü‡©Ä ‡®ú‡®ø‡®∏ ‡®µ‡®ø‡®ö ‡®¶‡®∞‡®¶ ‡®¶‡©Ä‡®Ü‡®Ç ‡®§‡©ç‡®∞‡®æ‡®ü‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®∏‡©Å‡®™‡®®‡©á ‡®§‡©á ‡®∞‡©∞‡®ó ‡®π‡®® ‡®Ü‡®Æ ‡®ú‡®ø‡®π‡®æ ‡®á‡®ï ‡®ö‡®ø‡®π‡®∞‡®æ ‡®ï‡®ø‡©∞‡®®‡©Ä‡®Ü‡®Ç ‡®π‡©Ä ‡®ö‡®ø‡®π‡®∞‡®ø‡®Ü‡®Ç ‡®¶‡©á ‡®®‡®ï‡®∏‡®º‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®¶‡©Ä‡®Ü‡®Ç ‡®≤‡®ï‡©Ä‡®∞‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®®‡®ï‡®∏‡®º ‡®ú‡©ã ‡®ù‡®ñ‡©ú‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®¶‡©á ‡®µ‡®ø‡®ö ‡®§‡®∞‡®æ‡®∏‡®º‡©á ‡®ó‡®è ‡®π‡®® ‡®®‡®ï‡®∏‡®º ‡®ú‡®ø‡®®‡©ç‡®π‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®®‡©á ‡®≠‡©Å‡©±‡®ñ‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®§‡©ç‡®∞‡©á‡®π‡®æ ‡®§‡©ç‡®∞‡®ø‡®™‡®§‡©Ä‡®Ü‡®Ç '‡®ö‡©ã ‡®≤‡©∞‡®ò ‡®∏‡©Å‡®™‡®®‡®ø‡®Ü‡®Ç ‡®¶‡®æ ‡®§‡®æ‡®Ö ‡®ñ‡®æ‡®ß‡®æ ‡®á‡®π ‡®Æ‡©á‡®∞‡®æ ‡®ö‡®ø‡®π‡®∞‡®æ ‡®®‡®π‡©Ä‡®Ç ‡®≠‡®æ‡®µ‡©á‡®Ç ‡®á‡®∏ '‡®§‡©á ‡®Æ‡©á‡®∞‡©Ä‡®Ü‡®Ç ‡®¶‡©ã ‡®Ö‡©±‡®ñ‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®π‡®® ‡®§‡©á ‡®â‡®®‡®π‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®Ö‡©±‡®ñ‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®µ‡®ø‡®ö ‡®Æ‡©á‡®∞‡©Ä ‡®∞‡©Å‡®π ‡®¶‡®æ ‡®Ö‡®§‡©á ‡®ï‡®ø‡®§‡®æ‡®¨‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®¶‡®æ ‡®ö‡®æ‡®®‡®£ ‡®è ‡®á‡®ï ‡®ö‡®ø‡®π‡®∞‡®æ ‡®ú‡©ã ‡®ï‡®ø‡®∏‡©á ‡®µ‡©Ä ‡®¨‡©∞‡®¶‡©á ‡®¶‡®æ ‡®ö‡®ø‡®π‡®∞‡®æ ‡®è ‡®§‡®æ‡®π‡©Ä‡®Ç ‡®π‡®∞ ‡®á‡®ï ‡®ö‡®ø‡®π‡®∞‡®æ ‡®Æ‡©à‡®Ç‡®®‡©Å ‡®≠‡®æ‡®â‡®Ç‡®¶‡®æ ‡®â‡®∏ ‡®µ‡®ø‡®ö ‡®Æ‡©à‡®Ç ‡®Ü‡®™‡®£‡©á ‡®ö‡®ø‡®π‡®∞‡©á ‡®¶‡®æ ‡®π‡®∞‡®ñ ‡®∏‡©ã‡®ó ‡®π‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®§‡©±‡®ï‡®¶‡®æ ‡®Ö‡®ú‡©á ‡®§‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®Æ‡©á‡®∞‡®æ ‡®ö‡®ø‡®π‡®∞‡®æ ‡®Æ‡®ø‡©±‡®ü‡©Ä ‡®µ‡®ø‡®ö‡©ã‡®Ç ‡®≤‡©∞‡®ò ‡®∞‡®ø‡®π‡®æ ‡®è ‡®ß‡©Ç‡©ú‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®´‡©±‡®ï‡®¶‡®æ ‡®ú‡®π‡®ø‡®∞ ‡®¶‡®æ ‡®ï‡©ã‡©ú‡®æ ‡®∏‡®µ‡®æ‡®¶ ‡®™‡®ö‡®æ‡®â‡®Ç‡®¶‡®æ ‡®≠‡®æ‡®µ‡©á‡®Ç ‡®á‡®∏ ‡®®‡©á ‡®ï‡®¶‡©á ‡®∏‡©Ä ‡®Ö‡®Æ‡©ç‡®∞‡®ø‡®§ ‡®™‡©Ä‡®§‡®æ ‡®§‡®æ‡®Ç‡®π‡©Ä ‡®§‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®á‡®π ‡®Ö‡©±‡®ú ‡®§‡®æ‡®à‡®Ç ‡®ú‡®ø‡®â‡®Ç‡®¶‡®æ ‡®è ‡®∏‡©Å‡®™‡®®‡©á ‡®∏‡®ø‡®∞‡®ú‡®¶‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®π‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®Æ‡©à‡®Ç ‡®â‡®Ç‡®ú ‡®§‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®Ü‡®Æ ‡®ú‡®ø‡®π‡©Ä ‡®Æ‡®ø‡©±‡®ü‡©Ä ‡®π‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®Ü‡®¶‡®ø ‡®ï‡®æ‡®≤ ‡®¶‡©á ‡®ö‡®æ‡®®‡®£ ‡®®‡®æ‡®≤ ‡®ú‡©ã ‡®ó‡©Å‡©∞‡®®‡©ç‡®π‡©Ä ‡®ó‡®à ‡®è I Literary career Sukhbir's first short story collection Dubda-Charda Suraj (Setting and Rising Sun) was published in 1957. The next year saw his collection of poems in print ‚Äì Pairhan (The Footprints). His first novel Kach Da Shehar (The Crystal City) was published in 1960. By then, he had already become a renowned name, publishing in leading literary journals like Preet Larhi and Aarsi. His works in Hindi were also published in magazines like Navneet, Kadambari, Parag, Sarika, and Dharamyug. He published regularly in the Times of India and Navbharat Times. In the November 1973 issue of Illustrated Weekly of India, the literary editor Nissim Ezekiel gave him an entire page for his poems ‚Äì a rare honour at that time for a poet. In the early 1960s, he took up the translation of Russian works, funded by the Russian government. His most acclaimed translation is Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace in Punjabi as Jang te Aman. Other translations include short stories, plays and letters of Maxim Gorky, Mikhail Sholokhov's And Quiet Flows the Don, Askad Mukhtar's Sisters (Bhaina), and Konstantin Paustovsky's The Golden Rose (Sunehra Gulab). The Russian government used to honour the translators who translated important Russian works into native languages of India with an award and a short-period travel to Russia. However, the corrupt bureaucracy led to another writer getting the award that year, although Sukhbir's translation of War and Peace in Punjabi was published that year. The following year the awards were terminated. One of his unique contributions is the brilliant poetic character-sketches of illustrious personalities of Punjab like First Guru of Sikhs Guru Nanak, Gurbaksh Singh Preetlari, writer Nanak Singh, Mohan Singh, Amrita Pritam, Kartar Singh Duggal, Rajinder Singh Bedi, Balraj Sahni, Pyara Singh Sehrai, and Santokh Singh Dheer, which were published in the leading Punjabi monthly Dharti Da Suraj in February‚ÄìApril 2010. These were also published in the poetry collection Lafz te Leekan (Words and Lines) in 1989. He also wrote memoirs of literary personalities like Devinder Satyarthi. He did book reviews as well, the latest being the poetry collection Rishta by noted painter Imroz. Sukhbir wrote seven novels, 11 short story collections, and seven poetry collections. He published in Punjabi journals including Aarsi (now defunct), Nagmani (now defunct), Preet Lari, Dharti Da Suraj, and Akhar, and all the Punjabi newspapers like Punjabi Tribune, Navan Zamana, and Desh Sewak. He started the trend of financial remuneration for his writings and established himself as the first and only full-time freelance writer in Punjabi literature. Sukhbir believed letters to be a great source of information about a person's beliefs and values over time. He wrote various letters and articles on literary, political and social issues engaging in dialogue with truth, honesty, sympathy and reason. In this way he created a distinct genre in Punjabi literature. Being a reclusive and self-effacing person, Sukhbir stayed away from the literary cliques who controlled and ran literary circles, academies and universities in Punjab. He believed that awards and recognitions are given for extraneous considerations and not for literary merit or contributions. He decided not to accept any awards, nor attend any conferences and seminars for this reason. Acclaim Sukhbir's most acclaimed novel is Sarkaan Te Kamre (Streets and Rooms), dealing with the metropolitan life of Mumbai, which was published in 1964. It depicts the trials and tribulations of ambitious young people in the dream city of Mumbai. The title of the novel is poignantly evocative, telling the sad plight of dwellers of a metropolis who have no homes to live in, but have streets for the day and shabby rooms for the night. The novel was included in the post-graduate curriculum of Punjabi University, Patiala. His novel Adde- Paune (The Fragmented Ones) is a powerful portrayal of fragmented personalities in modern society. It is a bold theme in Punjabi literature to depict a gay hero in the work of fiction.

William was the eldest son of George Bowes of Streatlam and Dorothy Mallory and succeeded to his father's encumbered estates in 1580. He was elected Member of Parliament for Westmorland in 1593 In Scotland Bowes represented Elizabeth I at the court of James VI of Scotland.Mackie, J. D., Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 13 part 1 (Edinburgh, 1969), xx-xxi; Bruce, John, ed., Letters of Queen Elizabeth and King James VI of Scotland (Camden Society, 1849), pp.135-8. His uncle, Robert Bowes, had earlier held the position. In May 1597 William Bowes cames to Edinburgh, and Sir George Home of Wedderburn and Sir John Carmichael brought him to meet James VI in the garden of Holyrood Palace. Robert Bowes introduced his nephew, and William Bowes gave his speech to the king at the end of garden alley. They were brought into the garden for a second audience by Sir William Stewart of Traquair and George Young, and after a discussion Robert and William Bowes were escorted to the Council Chamber in the palace by Carmichael and Wedderburn. Sitting at the table were the Duke of Lennox, the Earl of Mar, Lord Home, Lord Seton, Lord Ochiltree, the President Alexander Seton, and other members of the council and border commissioners. They discussed the request from Queen Elizabeth that Sir Robert Ker and Sir Walter Scott be sent to London for their infringements of border custom. Bowes cited the delivery by Henry VII of Sir William Heron to Scotland for the murder of Robert Ker of Cessford (1511), and the more recent rendition of Carmichael for the Raid of Redeswire (1575). Uncle and nephew discussed this conference with the king on 26 May, and the cases of other fugitives including Bothwell and Brian O'Rourke.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1595-1597, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1952), pp. 535, 559-566.

As of November 2019, his videos have over 475 million views and his channel has more than 1.5 million subscribers.  YouTube  Many of Vale's pranks are what he calls \\"Pooter\\" pranks. These involve Vale walking around in public making flatulence sounds, using a handheld device and capturing the reactions of the people nearby on a hidden camcorder. On one occasion this resulted in a physical altercation between Vale and an elderly man (whose wife Vale used the device on nearby). The subsequent police intervention led to the man being banned from that specific supermarket. Many of his pranks are completed in Huntington Beach, California. Other pranks include \\"Paranoid\\", sketches in which Vale, pretending to be talking on his mobile phone, walks past customers in a shop or on the street and describes them to his imaginary conversational partner (in order to see whether they will react with paranoia), and \\"Nonsense\\", in which Vale confuses members of the public by approaching them and speaking gibberish. Jack Vale's most elaborate prank to date which by most, is considered to be more of an experiment, is called \\"The Social Media Experiment\\". Vale searched hashtags in his local area and located people nearby. He then learned all about these people and convinced them he was psychic. The video was picked up by several national publications and he made appearances on various talk shows explaining how he did the experiment.

Life Baret matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge in 1551 as a sizar before migrating to Trinity College, Cambridge and receiving a degree of B.A. in 1554-5, and an M.A. in 1558. He became a fellow of the college in 1560. He later received the degree of M.D. from Peterhouse College, Cambridge in 1577, but there is no evidence that he ever practised medicine. About 1555 he describes himself as \\"having pupils at Cambridge, studious of the Latin tongue.\\" In later years he is said to have travelled abroad, and to have taught in London. Baret died before the close of 1580, but the exact date is uncertain. Dictionary Baret published, in about 1574, a dictionary of the English, Latin, and French languages, with occasional illustrations from the Greek. It was called An Alvearie, or Triple Dictionarie in English, Latin, and French, and was dedicated to William Cecil, Lord Burghley, the chancellor of Cambridge University. The date, 2 Feb 1573‚Äì4, appears among the introductory pages, but not on the title-page. The materials for the volume were gradually collected during eighteen years by Baret's many pupils, and he entitled it, on that account, an \\"Alvearie\\", or beehive. Every English word is first explained, and its equivalent given in Latin and French. Two indexes at the end of the volume collect the Latin and French words occurring in the text. The expenses of publication were mainly borne by Sir Thomas Smith, \\"principall secretarie to the queenes majestie,\\" and Alexander Nowell, \\"Maister Nowell, deane of Pawles\\".Ralph Churton, Life of Alexander Nowell, p. 220 Latin, Greek, and English verses in praise of the compiler and his work were prefixed to the book, among the writers being Richard Mulcaster and Arthur Golding. A second edition of the dictionary, in which Greek took almost as important a place as the other languages, was published shortly after Baret's death, and bore the date 2 January 1580‚Äì1. A lengthy poem \\"to the reader,\\" signed \\"Tho. M.\\", laments the recent death of the author, and new Latin elegiacs are added by Mulcaster. The title of the book in its final form runs: .Restituta: or Titles, Extracts, and Characters of Old Books in ..., Volume 3 Baret's dictionary is still of great service in enabling readers to trace the meaning of Elizabethan words and phrases that are now obsolete.

His long career produced many famous works of arts including several renowned public monuments in his native country of Poland. Life Henryk Kuna was born to a Jewish family in Warsaw in 1885 or possibly earlier (various sources give his year of birth as far back as 1879). Kuna studied art at the Academy of Fine Arts in Krak√≥w where he met fellow artists who would become lifelong friends. Many of them became deeply involved in Kuna's informal school of art known as Rytm (Rhythm). The group focused on the development of a Polish national style melding modernity with classicism. Kuna was a well-established artist in his time. He was appointed, along with the artists Teodor Axentowicz, Julian Fa≈Çat and others, to represent Poland at the XII Venice Biennale in 1920. Kuna's fame flourished further with a well-received solo exhibition in London two years later. Kuna died in the northern city of Toru≈Ñ in 1945. He was interred in Warsaw's historic PowƒÖzki Cemetery. Works Kuna was chosen for a project to sculpt a statue of Polish national hero Adam Mickiewicz for the city of Vilnius in the early 1930s. His work progressed on a number of bas reliefs, evocative of the romantic themes of Mickiewicz's writing, which were to surround the statue. When the Nazis invaded in 1939, the monument site was largely destroyed by a bomb, and under their occupation many of the bas reliefs were hauled off to a cemetery as paving stones. A new sculpture by Gediminas Jok≈´bonis was unveiled in 1984 with Kuna's surviving bas reliefs emplaced around it. In the turbulent 1980s and 1990s, the site was a popular meeting place for political dissidents. Kuna's most iconic work, the lifesize female nude Rytm (Rhythm, 1925), seemingly sways waterside in the Praga Po≈Çudnie district of Warsaw. Another female figure, Alina, stands amid a fountain at Stefan ≈ªeromski Park in the ≈ªoliborz district. Among Kuna's other works are Jutrzenka (Daybreak, 1919); Rozowy marmur (Pink Marble, 1930); and Portraits of K.R Witkowski (1930). In 1930, Kuna was awarded the Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta and, in 1935, the Golden Laurel of the Polish Academy of Literature.

It is a sequel to the 2009 film Overheard where Koo, Lau and Wu play different roles with a different storyline, but the key elements of the first film are kept. Another sequel, Overheard 3 was released on 30 May 2014. Production started in February and filming lasted for three months. A press conference was held during the 2011 Shanghai International Film Festival on 10 June. The film was released on 18 August in China, Hong Kong, and Singapore.  Plot  Manson Lo, the head broker of Man Sang Securities is shown giving his prediction of the Hong Kong stock market on television. Through the viewpoint of an eavesdropper, it is revealed that Lo works for five of the richest in Hong Kong to manipulate the prices of shares in the stock market. When leaving his office, he realizes that he is being tailed (by Joe Sze-ma) and though successful in shaking off the tail, is involved in a traffic accident. Inspector Ho and his team discover a military grade eavesdropping device upon examining Lo's Ferrari. Ho later visits Lo in hospital and attempts to ask him questions but Lo denies knowledge of being followed and evades the other questions at the advice of Emily, his wife and lawyer. Lo's past is revealed by Ho ‚Äì Lo's firm owed the bank money but because of the stock market crash, Lo instead made a lot of money and then became the broker to the five. In his office, Lo reveals to Emily that he was being followed. She then tells him about Inspector Ho's history ‚Äì not much is known about his previous cases in the police force but his wife (Tsui Foon) was a lawyer that went to jail for using clients‚Äô money to pay off debts after losing money in the stock market, with him being the one that aided in her arrest. Ho then enters the room and scans the opposing buildings. After noticing something at Diamond House, he directs Tsui Hoi and Fanny to proceed there. However, as Ho was about to go there with more men, the suspect (Joe Sze-ma) escapes, injuring Tsui Hoi. A chase then ensues. Joe sets off some flares and eventually manages to injure Ho and escape via a bus for elderly living in a home for those with dementia. It is revealed that Joe's mother (Mrs Sze-ma) is a resident in the nursing home. Mrs Sze-ma regains her memory temporarily and asks Joe if he has managed to track Tony down and Joe says no. Soon after, her memory lapses and she starts addressing Joe as her husband and speaks to him of the good times they had together. Ho and his team are shown combing the apartment at Diamond House. They have traced the identity of the person that rented the apartment to a Kim So but found that he is apparently no longer in Hong Kong, having migrated to Canada. Here, it is revealed that Tsui Foon is Tsui Hoi's sister. Lo is shown to be meeting the four rich men (without Tony). Manson reveals to them that his car and home were bugged for over a month. Tony calls and Lo reveals the number plate of the vehicle. Tony is then seen instructing Brother Kam to get someone to take care of matters. Lo and the rest are later photographed leaving the hotel. At home, Lo has a flashback. Intertwined with the story from the hotel manager, Lo is shown meeting Fred of Nixon Electronics, whom he urges to approach a loan shark to borrow fifty million to avoid a hostile takeover by Americans. It was upon knowing how Lo tried to help Fred, that Lo was invited by Sze-ma Cheung (Joe's Dad) to join the six men, known collectively as the Landlord Club. It was also revealed that Sze-ma Cheung was eventually convicted for insider trading and because of that, expelled from the Club. Ho and Tsui Hoi are seen picking up Tsui Foon after her release from prison. Tsui Foon blames Ho for her time in jail and asks for a separation from Ho (which Ho reluctantly agrees to) Tsui Hoi then tells Ho that the police have received a package. Lo receives the same package ‚Äì in it is a phone with a voice recording of Lo receiving instructions to manipulate the share price of a stock. Lo then realizes his house was being watched. Joe is pictured heading to the carpark near Lo's place where some men attempt to beat him up. He flees successfully but is eventually thrown over a ledge and saved by Ho. Joe turns the tables, holding Ho at gunpoint and questioning him about the inaction of the police before handcuffing Ho to a scaffolding and leaving in Ho's vehicle, not before hinting to Ho that something would happen to the stock market in the next few days. Later, Lo recalls that he first saw Joe at Sze-ma Cheung's funeral. Lo then receives a call that there is a game on tomorrow and he should attend it. Ho heads home after being told his car was found at the gate. He finds a plastic tag in the car and his wife is witnessed walking out of the house. He later learns from Tsui Hoi that she is leaving and plans to sell the house and go to a trading firm. Joe is later seen to be tailing Tsui Hoi. The next day, Ho goes to Lo's office and helps him pay for a gift. When Ho asks Lo what the Landlord Club does, Law refuses to answer but instead starts trading. Later, Lo directs Ho to sign a contract for opening an account. Lo then tells Ho that a typical account opening at his firm would cost $500 000 but he is only charging Ho $100, the cost of the gift that Ho paid for. Ho then says that the Landlord Club is powerful and since Joe is stepping on their tail, they can easily kill him. Ho reveals that he knows that the Landlord Club deals in illegal funds from conflicts. However, Lo does not seem to know that the Landlord Club has arranged for Joe to be killed and Ho asks to talk to the Landlord Club. Then, Joe calls Lo and Lo asks Ho to leave. Joe asks Lo to record the conversation he has with Tony later and assures him that the phone he was given is secure. Ho tries to get Fanny to track the call but she is unable to. Later, Fanny briefs Ho that the 3 ID cards found in the various scenes were all registered on the same day but to different people. In the evening, the police tail Lo but lose his tail after Lo gets his subordinate to take his car. Lo heads to the docks to meet his wife but is instead invited on board a yacht along with the other rich men to Tony's mansion. Tony reveals that the eavesdropper is Joe, who is Sze-ma Cheung's son. Later, he contacts Joe from a number indicated at the back of all the cellphones of the other rich men, after confiscating them upon realizing they were all the same brand. Joe tells Tony he wants 50 million shares of stock 749 to be deposited in Man Seng Securities by tomorrow. Tony instructs the rest of get the shares and after they leave, asks Lo if he can still trust him because Lo was brought in by Sze-ma Cheung, and now Joe, Sze-ma's son, wants to go after them. Lo says he can be trusted because he does not want to go to jail. Later, Lo arrives home to find Ho and his team at the gate. When he gets to his apartment, he is held at gunpoint by Joe, who asks about the cashing of the cheque Lo once passed to Sze-ma Cheung. Joe demands that Lo keeps his word to his Dad about being able to cash the cheque when he needed money. In the night, Ho arrives at the nursing home and speaks to its director. The director explains to Ho that a tag found in Ho's car after Joe took it is supposed to contain a GPS tracker so that Alzheimer's patients can be tracked The number attached to the empty tag, G-41, is Mrs Szema's bed number. The next day, Joe asks Ho to open a bag by Mrs Sze-ma's bedside and Ho discovers photos of his wife inside. Meanwhile, Lo, through Man Seng, is engaged in buying stock 749. The Landlord Club realizes that Joe is controlling the price because he owns a lot of the shares. Joe is later caught by Brother Kam & brought to Tony's mansion. At the same time, Tsui Hoi discovers that the names of those on 3 IDs cards previously discovered were actually managers of stock 749, which was the nursing home fund. They then reveal that Sze-ma Cheung used to be their fund manager and that they are just taking their revenge on Tony. The purchase of stock 749 continues after Joe reveals that he would upload recorded conversations of the rich men giving instructions to manipulate share prices onto a highly subscribed website. Joe also reveals that he gave some of stock 749 to Ho. Later, Tony reveals that he ordered Sze-ma Cheung to be killed in prison and when Joe admits that he did not actually upload any recordings to any website but just wanted to continue to blackmail the rich men, Tony shoots and kills Joe. Ho successfully rescues Tsui Foon in an apartment after Emily passes him the keys. She passes him a phone that has GPS coordinates of Joe's location and Ho and his team eventually discovers Brother Kam and his men burying Joe. Tony is eventually arrested based on the recording that Joe obtained through the military grade device that he has been using to bug the rich men, which was embedded in his arm. Upon his release from prison, Lo approaches the nursing home where Mrs Sze-ma is housed at and offers to be their fund manager. He meets Ho there, who advises him to take good care of Mrs Sze-ma. The film ends with a flashback of Mrs Sze-ma happily watching a film with Sze-ma Cheung and Joe sitting beside her.

Coastal military zone A zone of restricted access to civilians was established to increase the security of the Atlantic wall. It was 20 km wide and ran along the Atlantic coast from Dunkirk to Hendaye. It was administered by the military administration in Northern France and Belgium () from Brussels. Zone of intended German settlement A vast expanse of territory in northern and eastern parts of occupied France comprising a total of six d√©partements and parts of four others running from the mouth of the Somme to the Swiss frontier in the Jura was separated from the rest of the Occupied Zone by a demarcation line and was effectively cut off from the rest of France. The terms zone r√©serv√©e (\\"reserved zone\\") and zone interdite were often used interchangeably, but some sources distinguish a smaller forbidden zone, comprising parts of Somme, Aisne and Ardennes d√©partements, from the larger reserved zone. This extra demarcation line never seems to have existed beyond theory. Although Adolf Hitler had initially no plans of territorially expanding towards eastern France except for the return of the formerly German Alsace-Lorraine (even so he did not regard the acquiring of these provinces as a real benefit to Germany, telling Albert Speer his belief that they had become \\"racially worthless\\" after decades of French ruleOvery, Richard (2002). The Nazi Elite in Allied Hands, 1945, p. 325. Penguin Books.), the position of total German hegemony gained after the Battle of France now made it possible for him to plan the annexation of those regions of France deemed to possess strategic or economic advantage to Germany. This was especially the case with frontier regions whose incorporation could be somehow justified on the basis of historical Franco-German borders. During the end of May 1940 (before the Armistice), Hitler instructed Wilhelm Stuckart, State Secretary in the Ministry of Interior to prepare suggestions for a new western frontier. A memorandum written on 14 June 1940 by Stuckart or someone in his vicinity in the Interior Ministry discusses the annexation of certain areas in Eastern France to the German Reich. The document presents a plan to weaken France by reducing the country to its late mediaeval borders with the Holy Roman Empire and replacing the French populace of the annexed territories with German settlers. This memorandum formed the basis for the so-called \\"North-east line\\" (also called the \\"Black line\\" and the \\"F√ºhrer line\\"),J√§ckel, E. (1966). Frankreich in Hitlers Europa, Deutsche Vlg. p. 89 which marked the territorial extent of the forbidden zone. On 28 June 1940, the zone was hermetically closed, allegedly because of devastation caused by heavy fighting during the German campaign. The refugees who had fled the German advance during the Battle of France were not initially allowed to return to the territory, but passes were however gradually issued for workers in short-staffed occupations. After August 1940, the lands of farmers who had not returned to the zone were confiscated by the Ostdeutsche Landbewirtschaftungsgesellschaft (\\"East German Land Management Company\\") which managed confiscated Polish farmlands. The company took the name Westland in the forbidden zone, and by the summer of 1942 was managing some 4 million hectares of farmland. Land redistribution to German peasants was however not immediately possible because of the limited quantity of potential settlers, a problem exacerbated further by the ever- increasing manpower needs of the Wehrmacht. In any event, the German forces guarding the line were insufficient in number to prevent the return of the territory's inhabitants, and thus by the end of 1940 only about a million of them were still missing (amounting roughly to one-seventh of the pre-war population). Following the commencement of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, any lingering German ambitions to expand the Reich westward beyond annexation of Alsace-Lorraine and Luxembourg were, for all intents and purposes, abandoned. The war with the Soviet Union brought the prospect of vast conquests in the East that would have taken decades (if not generations) to colonize. Hitler, who had always believed Germany's destiny lay in the east, basically lost whatever interest he had in diverting German settlers and resources from the East in an effort to colonize what he saw to be Germany's relatively \\"civilized\\" western neighbors. During the night of 17‚Äì18 December 1941, the German troops guarding the line were simply withdrawn, as the military commander of France Otto von St√ºlpnagel decided that diverting increasingly limited German manpower to guard a line that he deemed as being merely illusory (since almost the whole population had returned) could no longer be justified. Nevertheless, in theory the line continued to exist for the rest of the German occupation.

Route description =Tipton County= Western Terminus of SR 59 SR 59 begins as a secondary highway at the Mississippi River in Tipton County in an area known as Richardson Landing. The route used to extend about further, but has since been eroded by the river, so much that barricades block the edge of the pavement to prevent motorists from driving into the river (See photo at left). As one continues east along the highway, one will notice that the elevation increases from around above sea level in less than . This sharp increase is due to what is known as the second Chickasaw Bluff, a formation created by wind-blown silt which has accumulated from around the last Ice Age. At the top of this bluff is the small community of Randolph, which was important during the civil war and at one time was bigger than Memphis, down the river. Continuing eastward from the bluffs, the road starts to level out into gently rolling farmland. SR 178 (via a Y-Intersection) intersects SR 59 in the town of Gilt Edge.

Originally intended for a business career, he studied stage design in London, and was quickly in demand in theatres and opera houses, working with John Copley and other directors. Originally his style was lavish and naturalistic, but he changed to a less traditional style, working with David Pountney and other more avant garde directors at English National Opera and elsewhere. He occasionally directed operas, and was for a short time director of the Greek National Opera.

In 1962 he went to London to take a course in business administration, but instead enrolled at the Byam Shaw School of Art in Kensington and later transferred to the Central School of Speech and Drama where he studied theatre design. His fellow Greek, the designer Nicholas Georgiadis, took him on as an apprentice,Sutcliffe, Tom. \\"Stefanos Lazaridis ‚Äì Demanding stage designer for opera and theatre renowned for his boldness and clarity of interpretation\\", The Independent, 24 May 2010 and he designed his first theatre production in Guildford in 1967, Tennessee Williams's Eccentricities of a Nightingale.Jays, David and David Pountney. \\"Stefanos Lazaridis: Iconoclastic stage designer who always started with the idea, never with the visual\\", The Guardian, 17 May 2010 He attracted attention for his designs for Antony Tudor's \\"Knight Errant\\" for the Royal Ballet's touring company in 1968, and was invited to design a new production of Carmen for the director John Copley at Sadler's Wells Opera in 1970. Lazaridis's early designs were naturalistic and lavish, and suited Copley's approach to production. They worked together both at English National Opera (ENO) (The Seraglio, 1971, Il trovatore, 1972) and Covent Garden (Le nozze di Figaro, 1971, Don Giovanni, 1973). In the 1980s, Lazaridis worked a great deal with David Pountney at ENO. His design style moved away from opulent naturalism, and embraced Pountney's non-naturalistic approach. Pountney later wrote, Lazaridis designed more than 30 productions for ENO. Pountney rated among the best of them Rusalka, Hansel and Gretel, Dr Faustus and Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, the last of them set in a meat-packing factory. Other directors with whom Lazaridis worked were Nicholas Hytner, Patrick Garland, Colin Graham, Tim Albery and Phyllida Lloyd. Not all his productions were well received. The Times described his set for an ENO Tosca as \\"one of the ugliest and drabbest ever devised for Tosca.\\"Higgins, John. \\"A lop-sided view of Puccini\\", The Times, 30 January 1987 Together with the director Steven Pimlott, Lazaridis presented a 1989 Carmen in the vast Earls Court arena in London, which The Times considered \\"a new benchmark in the intelligent popularisation of opera.\\". With Pountney, Lazaridis worked on three lake-stage productions for the Bregenz Festival, Der fliegender Holl√§nder (1989), Nabucco (1991) and Fidelio (1995). Pountney called Lazaridis's designs for these productions \\"astonishing ‚Ä¶ The opportunity to work on this scale somehow triggered Stefan's most sensitive dramaturgical instincts, allied to his phenomenal aesthetic sense and understanding of scale.\\" Away from opera, Lazaridis designed productions of a wide range of plays from a show about the Mitford sisters to Ibsen dramas and Shakespeare comedy. In 1993 he directed and designed the Duran Duran tour of the U.S. Among Lazaridis's later designs for the opera house was the Covent Garden Ring cycle (2004‚Äì06) directed by Keith Warner, of which The Guardian wrote, \\"Warner and Lazaridis can't decide if the Ring is heroic myth, political allegory, or human story. Instead, they cram the stage with a vast range of imagery, from the uninspired video art which depicts Siegfried's journey on the Rhine, to the surrealist kitsch of the Gibichung Hall and the dark naturalism of the hunt scene.\\"Service, Tom. \\"Is this Ring a myth, allegory or story?\\", The Guardian, 18 April 2006 Between 2006 and 2007 Lazaridis was artistic director and general manager of the Greek National Opera; he found himself frustrated in his attempts to vitalise the company, and resigned.

The project aims to provide production engineers a tool for detailed ecological footprint analyses, which are becoming more important in terms of marketing and legislation. A published report by MIT in 2011 showed companies thought that environmental sustainable strategy is, or will be, vital to be competitive. The report included many sectors, e.g. covering medicals, automobiles and consumer products. EcoProIT will design a tool for industrial applications used for detailed environmental footprint analyses of their production systems and the products produced using simulation. The tool will simulate the production and analyze the product's environmental footprint in a standardized way. It will also be possible to use the tool for bench marking between different sites. The aim for the tool puts high requirements on standardized methods and data management.  Vision - Tool usage  The vision of the usage of EcoProIT is important. Company A, who is a big and important stakeholder, is the main user of the tool in Figure 1. They require their close supplier partner to use the same tool. Company A and supplier A and B then set up an internal connection of their tools. The connection makes the input information for Company A up to date for every use. Company A also sets up a connection to their close partners that buy or distribute Company A‚Äôs products. It will then be possible to give a good estimation of the impact total specific distribution chain that will be up to data. The information can be used to inform the end users about total costs for the production data. The up to date chain gives a possibility to show the consumers that the company makes progress in lowering the environmental impact. Every improvement is delivered directly to the customers, and the new marketing possibility show what the production department is doing for the environment. All information that is produced by the tool should be able to be uploaded to the central EcoProIT Database that stores it in a standardized way to be able to be used by other companies. The tool is also connected to other LCA databases to be able to use as input for the raw materials used in the production. Figure 1 shows a schematic view on how the system could be connected. Figure 1: Concept map of the future use of the tool  Environmental Activity-Based Costing  As an approach to calculation of the impact, activity-based costing (ABC) will be used for calculations of environmental costs. Emblemssv√•g and Bras worked and analyzed the ABC as a method for environmental analyses. The method substitutes the cost for the production in money with an environmental emission, e.g. CO2 emissions. The emissions are measured and calculated from the energy and resources used. Then the emissions are allocated to the different products produced using the resources in the model. The problems with ABC is that it requires a lot of data for a qualitative and accurate allocation of the cost from the resources. This is why the method fits well into a DES model. During a run In a DES environment it is easy to grab lot of detailed results needed for accurate allocation. The problem is that DES require a lot of initial effort to build the model. The approach to analyze environmental impact in a DES model is only beneficial if there is requirements for detailed analyzes and ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù scenarios is needed. Hierarchically modeling approach When LCA is included in a production simulation model, there is a bigger need for output information to perform the calculations. To be able to allocate environmental load that origins from the facilities the product that used the facility need to be traced. Environmental load that origin form the maintenance needs to be allocated based on the machines use of the maintenance. Machines that use other resources as compressed air or other supporting machines needs to be associated to trace the usage of those resources to be able to allocate the environmental load to the products that used the machine. Andersson, J et al. (2012) proposed to model the machines and resources in a hierarchy. The approach is based on that all product types have attributes with weight and size. The attributes is used together with the time the product has been in each resources to allocate the environmental load to all products using the resource at the same time. A product that is using a machine is also using the machines and facilities in the upper hierarchy. The approach supports increasingly detailed modeling. The modeler increase the level of detail by model each box in greater detail in a lower lever in the hierarchy. The modeler can in other nodes stay at a brief level with less dynamics. Verification/Validation Strategies Environmental impact is in general hard to validate. To be able to trust the models is very important that the models are transparent and provide multiple levels of verification. The strategy here is to not calculate everything in the simulation model and instead provide results, which can be verified, to calculate the used resources from. E.g. from the amount of processing time for a machine it is possible to calculate the used energy. From the used resources upstream processes required to produce the resources can be included to get a total emission for the production, e.g. if the emissions to produce one kWh electricity is 0.1 kgCO2 then the 4 kWh electricity used in a machine give an emission of 0.4 kgCO2. The concept is called Level of Equation. The basis is to divide the calculations of environmental impact into 4 levels : * Process times, lead times, idle times, setup times, etc. * Consumption of resources e.g. Electricity, steal, oil, etc. * Emissions * Environmental impact, e.g. [GWP]  Sponsors  The main sponsor for the project is ProViking accompanied by a few big industrial partners.

It is claimed that it is the first official polo trophy in history. The first Ezra Cup was held in 1880. After a period of inactivity, it has now been revived by Keshav Bangur, Calcutta Polo Club's president.  Keshav Bangur's patronage  right Ezra Cup is named after David Elias Ezra, a leading Jewish business tycoon in Calcutta who patronized the sport in the city. As part of its 150 years celebration, the Calcutta Polo Club organized Ezra World Cup at the Pat Williamson Ground, Kolkata from 18‚Äì25 December 2011. It has been doing so since 2006 when the polo was revived in Kolkata by Calcutta Polo Club president Keshav Bangur. After years of neglect the Calcutta Polo Club was put in cold storage by the army in 1998 through a resolution and the season was revived in 2006, at the initiative of Keshav Bangur. ‚ÄúWe are happy that the army is cooperating with us to make the season a success now, and hope to get their continued support going forward,‚Äù said Keshav Bangur, CPC's current president.  Revival  Despite the claimed legacy of being the world's oldest polo club, the Calcutta Polo Club almost disappeared before being revived by Keshav Bangur. In 2006, after almost a decade of inactivity, the first tournament was held. In 2011, teams from India, the United States, Italy, Brazil and Indonesia competed for the Ezra Cup. \\"Time was when major-generals and personages in high political office stood up in the grandstand waving their hats and shouting themselves hoarse, as the women, resplendent in their silk finery, screamed during a hearty game of polo on the Pat Williamson Ground at Calcutta‚Äôs race course.\\" Polo can no longer look to its royal patrons for support, says Keshav Bangur. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beyond the means of most of these estates to back the sport.‚Äù The sport has found new patrons, though, according to Gaj Singh. ‚ÄúAvailability of grounds is the biggest problem facing Indian polo,‚Äù says Singh‚Äînot lack of patronage. Besides companies such as Keshav Bangur‚Äôs BFL Corporation Limited, Naveen Jindal‚Äôs Jindal Steel and Power Limited and Sunjay Kapur‚Äôs Sona Koyo Steering Systems Limited, which have fielded and backed polo teams, the sport has had a lot of support from the army. Carlos Gracida, captain of the team from the US, suggests a scope for revival. He says that in Argentina, the country prominent in the world of polo, the sport has become popular among the masses to a great extent. ‚ÄúThe young in Argentina are drawn to the sport because they can make a living out of it,‚Äù says Gracida.  2011 winners  The local side, Calcutta Polo Club emerged as the champion of the BFL Corp Ezra World Cup 2011, defeating the team from Italy, Rome, by 6 goals to 4.5. Starting with an advantage of 0.5 goals, Rome began well but failed to sustain the tempo against CPC which played a fluent and effective game. George Meyrick led the scoring for CPC with three goals. Major Vishal Chauhan added a brace while Colonel Tarun Sirohi scored the solitary field goal. For Rome, Gofferdo C. Rendina scored two and Santiago Buzzi scored a brace. Earlier, Rome qualified for the final by defeating what was arguably the best team of the tournament, Carnoustie of the US, by a narrow margin of 0.5 goal. The final score read 5.5 to 5 goals in favour of Rome. The spectators witnessed great heroics by Carlos Gracida, perhaps the highest handicap player in the world. Playing for Carnoustie, he scored all the five goals. For Rome, which enjoyed a 0.5-goal handicap, Boris Bignoli got one and Gofferdo C. Rendina scored the rest.The tournament also had a team from Indonesia called Nausantara. It failed to make an impact on the meet while the other Indian team, Army Polo Riding Club, caused a few surprises before bowing out.  2011 celebrations  The grand finale of the seven-day celebration of BFL Corp Ezra World Cup 2011 was staged at the Pat Williamson ground. On December 25, the players from Manipur, with a traditional Manipuri Polo Match, gave the spectators a glimpse of history . The army band gave a performance of flute, pipes and drums. The CPC, headed by its president, Keshav Bangur, commented on organising the event. ‚ÄúIt's a moment of pride for me and the committee members to have hosted the Ezra Cup and to have brought the world of polo population together to this magnificent venue. We had a terrific tournament and the game was celebrated in its full glory. This is just the beginning of the celebration of the 150th year of the club and I feel very happy and proud to have led the show along with the relentless support of the Indian Polo Association and the Indian Army. I wish to encourage young players in the city to actively participate and join this game,\\" The event saw performances by bubble and fire dancers, who were flown in from different parts of the country. The event saw polo celebrities like Colquhoun-Denvers and international players like George Meurick, Gabriel Nicolas Curto, Carlos Gracida and Goffredo C Rendina, amongst others.  Calcutta Polo Club  A press report commented, \\"The current club membership is about 200, with members from the business and royal families of Cooch Behar, Burdwan, Darbhanga and the illustrious Mullickbari of north Kolkata. Pat Williamson Polo Ground in Kolkata overlooks the Victoria Memorial and has seen polo stalwarts like Maharaja Sawai Man Singh of Jaipur and Maharaj Prem Singh. The legendary Gayatri Devi, the princess of Cooch Behar, fell in love with her future husband Sawai Man Singh at this polo ground.\\" Two British soldiers, Robert Stewart and Joe Shearer, saw a game called sagol kangjei played by locals on horses in Manipur . Impressed by this game, the soldiers introduced it to their peers in Kolkata and in 1862, the Calcutta Polo Club was founded with the subsequent creation of a new format. The club stable for horses is near the second Hooghly Bridge. The Indian Army continues to support the club, allowing it to use the Pat Williamson Polo Ground, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Indian Army‚Äôs Eastern Command. Earlier, most of the key players, like Maharaj Prem Singh, a seven-handicapper, and Col Kishen Singh, a six-handicapper, were based in Kolkata and other leading players from elsewhere rallied round them. As part of the 2011 Ezra Cup, a History Gallery was opened at the Pat Williamson Ground, and a coffee table book was released that showcases the history and heritage of the Calcutta Polo Club.

She is a 1964 graduate of Brooklyn College. Participation in politics =1991 race for New York City Council= After having failed in her first attempt to run for office against incumbent City Councilman Samuel Horowitz in the 33rd district of New York City in 1989, Cohen made her second run for office in the 1991 Democratic primary election for New York City Council District 48 in Southern Brooklyn, which had been created as part of the expansion of the city council membership prior to the election. She ran in a tightly contested six-way Democratic primary that included both Anthony Weiner, the future Congressman who was then a congressional aide to U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer, and Michael Garson, who was endorsed by the Kings County Democratic County Committee, representing a labor-dominated coalition known as the Majority Coalition for a New New York. Controversy erupted in the last weeks of the campaign, however, when Weiner's campaign anonymously spread leaflets around the district which alleged ties between Cohen and the so- called \\"Jackson-Dinkins agenda.\\" The leaflets referred to the Crown Heights riots earlier in the year, which suggested that Jesse Jackson (who became notorious for his earlier remarks about New York City as \\"Hymietown\\") and mayor David Dinkins as having been beholden to the predominantly-African- American rioters, and thus endangering white residents. Dinkins, during the campaign, described the leaflet as \\"hateful\\". When Weiner admitted his campaign's distribution of the leaflets, he stated that he \\"didn't want the source to be confused with the message\\"; The New York Times issued an editorial which rebuked Weiner's \\"hit-and-run tactics\\". Cohen lost the primary to Weiner by 195 votes. Weiner also won the November election, widely considered a formality with no opposition in the heavily Democratic district. The next year, Cohen was selected as the state chairwoman of the National Women's Political Caucus. She ran again for the City Council's 27th District against Howard L. Lasher in 1997, but lost in the three-way Democratic primary. =State Assembly= In 1998, Cohen ran for the New York State Assembly's 46th district in the special election to succeed outgoing assemblyman Jules Polonetsky, with the nomination of the Democratic, Independence and Liberal parties and she won against Joseph A. Kovac, a nominee of the Republican and Conservative parties. She served as an assemblywoman until she returned to private law practice in 2006. Initially a member of the Standing Committee on Insurance, she served from 2005 to 2006 as chairwoman of the Assembly Commission on Science and Technology during her time in office. Personal life Cohen is a 1964 graduate of Brooklyn College. She later pursued a law degree from the New York Law School after her children grew up, gaining it in 1987. She then became a lawyer for District Council 37. She is married to Steven, a former principal of P.S.

Life Barford was educated at Eton College, and elected to King's College, Cambridge in 1737. He proceeded B.A. in 1742, M.A. in 1746, and D.D. in 1771. He became tutor of his college, was thrice moderator in the Sophs' school, was proctor in 1761, and from 1762 to 1768 Public Orator, only resigning the post to stand for the Greek professorship, which he failed to obtain. In 1768, his college presented him with the living of Fordingbridge, in Hampshire, and in the year following he was appointed Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons by Sir John Cust, the then speaker, but held the office for only one session. The next speaker appointed another chaplain, and Barford's friends feared he would be deprived of the usual preferment conferred on holders of the office; but on the plea that he was to be considered chaplain, appointed not by the speaker but by the house, it was resolved, 9 May 1770, that the king be addressed to confer some dignity upon him. He was consequently installed a prebendary of Canterbury in June of the same year. In 1773 he resigned Fordingbridge for the rectory of Kimpton, Hertfordshire, which he held along with the living of Allhallows, Lombard Street, till his death in November 1792. He married in 1764.

Barker, of Bristol, in partnership with his brother John, was for some years engaged in the adventurous and often disputed trade with the Spanish settlements. In 1570 one of their ships, named the Falcon, was seized at Terceira, the cargo confiscated, and the greater part of her crew sent to the galleys. In 1575 at Tenerife, the Inquisition laid hands on the captain and crew of their ship, the Christopher, and released them only on payment of fines which amounted to the value of the whole cargo. Andrew Barker thereupon fitted out two ships for a voyage of reprisals‚Äîthe Ragged Staff, of which he himself took command, with one Philip Roche as master, and the Bear, commanded by Captain William Cox. They sailed from Plymouth on Whitsunday, 1576. At the Cape Verde Islands, at Trinidad, at Cura√ßao, and on the Spanish Main, they took several prizes, and collected a fair amount of booty. Afterwards, however, the crews became sickly and several of the men died. Then the officers quarrelled amongst themselves; Barker and Roche fought, and Cox, heading a mutiny, turned Barker and his adherents on shore in the Gulf of Honduras, where they were presently surprised by the Spaniards. Barker and some eight or nine with him were killed, others were wounded, the rest made good their escape and were admitted on board the Bear, which was still in the neighbourhood. Disaster now pursued the adventurers. Party after party was cut off. The Ragged Staff had early in the voyage proved to be unseaworthy, and had been sunk. All the accumulated treasure was in the Bear, and she was now overset in a squall. Only nine men escaped with their lives, and these, having made shift to build a small vessel and to return to England, were arrested at the suit of Andrew Barker's brother, John, and the chief of them sentenced to a long term of imprisonment.

It features Tsuyoshi Kusanagi (of the pop group SMAP) and Y≈´ko Takeuchi in the lead role. Plot Set in the city of Aso in Kumamoto Prefecture, the film begins with scenes of individuals immediately after they have experienced unexplained and mysterious resurrection. One man and woman are uncovering long untouched musical instruments in a daze, and in one case a young boy finds himself alone in the forest, having suddenly reappeared after vanishing years earlier. Eventually a representative from the Japanese Ministry of Welfare named Heita Kawada (Kusanagi) appears. It is his job to investigate this phenomenon, which begins to be seen not in just the two isolated cases, but in various locations around the city. He discovers on his way to his first meeting with the boy that the child's DNA has been found to match that of a boy who disappeared years earlier (through a match with the umbilical cord saved by the mother), though the child should biologically be now in middle age. This evidence suggests the cases of resurrection occur in such a way that the resurrected person reappears at the same age that he or she supposedly died. Kawada, with his team of investigators, meets and interviews those who are purported to have reappeared after death, some of whom have been dead many years. The investigators also interview the families of the resurrected, who have aged (some significantly) since the death of the person who has now reappeared. In the case of the young boy, his mother has grown into an old woman, in other circumstances a youthful wife has reappeared to rejoin a husband now well into middle age. The movie follows Kawada as he wrestles with the impossibility of the claims, which nevertheless seem to be based on empirically sound evidence. Kawada himself, a native of Aso, also reconnects with his old friend Aoi (Takeuchi), who shares with him a bitter memory of the death of Kawada's friend (and Aoi's lover) Shunsuke (Yusuke Iseya).

Fulwood was probably born in London about 1590, was the eldest son of Sir George Fulwood, lord of the manor of Middleton-by-Youlgrave, Derbyshire. His father, who died in 1624, was admitted a member of Gray's Inn in 1589,Harl. MS. 1912, f 33 and appears to have passed the greater part of his life in the practice of the law in London, as in 1608 he is styled of Fulwood Street, Holborn.cf. his will registered in P. C. C. 55, Byrde In 1605 Christopher was also entered at Gray's Inn, of which society he was admitted ancient 28 May 1622, appointed autumn reader in 1628, and treasurer 3 November 1637.Harl. MS. 1912, ff. 33, 183, 194, 248 When disengaged from his professional duties he resided at Middleton. His strict impartiality as a magistrate is commemorated by the ‚Äòapostle of the Peak,‚Äô William Bagshaw. In 1640, at the Bakewell sessions, the curate of Taddington was charged with puritanism. Fulwood, who was chairman, ‚Äòthough known to be a zealot in the cause of the then king and conformity, released him, and gave his accusers a sharp reprimand‚Äô.De Spiritualibus Pecci, 8vo, 1702, p. 17 Civil War and death Fulwood's influence in the district was of great value to the royalist cause. He was specially employed to raise the Derbyshire miners as a life-guard for his majesty in 1642, when the lord- lieutenant of the county, the Earl of Rutland, declined to appear in the service. He was soon at the head of a regiment of eleven hundred men, who were mustered on Tideswell Moor. His success appears to have alarmed the leaders of the parliamentarians in the neighbourhood, who, according to the local tradition, soon found an opportunity of seizing Fulwood while at his house at Middleton. The chief enemy of the king in the district was Sir John Gell of Hopton, and it was by Gell's emissaries that Fulwood was captured. It is said that while in his house he received notice of the near approach of the hostile detachment, and hid himself in a fissure separating an outlying mass of rock from its parent cliff, in the dale of the Bradford, a few hundred yards in the rear of the mansion. His pursuers saw him, and a shot from them inflicted a mortal wound. He was carried off towards Lichfield, a garrison town which had been taken by Gell on the preceding 5 March, but died on the way at Calton in Staffordshire, 16 November 1643. The rock is still pointed out at Middleton. Before the close of 1644 the property had passed out of the hands of the family. Fulwood's two daughters, Elizabeth and Mary, sought refuge among their friends in London, where they died in obscurity. The mansion at Middleton began to be demolished about 1720.

He was the founder and first CEO of Israel Aerospace Industries.  Early life  In 1917, Schwimmer was born in New York City, New York, the son of immigrants from Eastern Europe. Schwimmer never used his given birth name of Adolph, preferring the nickname \\"Al\\".  Career  In 1939, Schwimmer began his aerospace career at Lockheed Corporation as an engineer and also received his civilian pilot license. During World War II, he worked for TWA and assisted the U.S. Air Transport Command as a flight engineer.. During the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, Schwimmer used his World War II experience and his contacts to smuggle surplus war planes to Israel.. Schwimmer reflected on what motivated these actions in an interview with Boaz Dvir. The alternative was described as a \\"Second Holocaust [...] they believed that those 600,000 Jews were going to die.\\" Using circuitous routes, he also recruited the pilots and crews to fly the planes to Israel. Many of these men became the nucleus of the Israeli Air Force. In 1949, Schwimmer returned to the United States and, in 1950, he was convicted in the United States of violating the US Neutrality Acts for smuggling the planes into Israel. Schwimmer was stripped of his voting rights and veteran benefits and fined $10,000, but did not receive a prison sentence. Schwimmer refused to ask for a pardon, believing that smuggling weapons to help create Israel was the right moral decision to make. In 2001, President Bill Clinton gave Schwimmer a presidential pardon. In the early 1950s, Schwimmer, who was running an aircraft maintenance company in Burbank, California, was approached by David Ben-Gurion, Israel's then prime minister, who asked Schwimmer to return to Israel and establish an aircraft company for commercial and military purposes. Schwimmer acceded to Ben Gurion's request and founded Israel Aerospace Industries, of which he became the first CEO. 1958 passport issued to Al Schwimmer which he used on his official trips as head of the IAI. Schwimmer was one of the founders of Savyon, but later moved to Tel Aviv.. In the mid-1980s, Schwimmer was a special adviser for technology and industry for Israel's then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who became a close friend.  Personal life  Schwimmer's wife is Rina. They have two children, Danny and Dafna, and four grandchildren, Orr, Ella, Sarah, and Avi. On June 10, 2011, Schwimmer died on his 94th birthday in a hospital in Ramat Gan, Tel Aviv District, Israel. (confirmed date of death as 10 June 2011).  In popular culture  In 2015, his exploits during 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War were depicted in the PBS documentary A Wing and a Prayer, written, directed, and produced by Boaz Dvir. The film contains the only public interview Schwimmer gave in light of these events. Awards * In 2006, Schwimmer was awarded the Israel Prize, for his lifetime achievement and special contribution to society and the State. *In 2018, Schwimmer was posthumously honored by the Embassy of Israel in Washington, D.C., as one of the 70 most valuable American contributors to the strengthening of Israel and its alliance with the United States.https://www.jns.org/adolph-william-al- schwimmer-1917-2011/http://thejewishvoice.com/2018/05/16/dc-embassy-holds- massive-celebration-israels-70th-anniversary-us-embassy-move-jerusalem/ See also * List of Israel Prize recipients * List of people pardoned by Bill Clinton References  External links  * . * . * Al Schwimmer at LATimes.com * Al Schwimmer's Presidential Pardon at israellobby.org * Al Schwimmer at Forbes.com * Clinton pardons listed at justice.gov Category:1917 births Category:2011 deaths Category:20th-century American businesspeople Category:21st-century American businesspeople Category:Aircraft designers Category:American aerospace businesspeople Category:American aerospace designers Category:American aerospace engineers Category:American aviation businesspeople Category:American consulting businesspeople Category:American emigrants to Israel Category:American Jews Category:American manufacturing businesspeople Category:Businesspeople from New York (state) Category:Israeli aerospace engineers Category:Israeli Air Force personnel Category:Israeli chief executives Category:Israeli Jews Category:Israel Prize for special contribution to society and the State recipients Category:Jewish engineers Category:Lockheed Martin people Category:People from Ramat Gan Category:Recipients of American presidential pardons Category:Trans World Airlines people ","title":"Al Schwimmer"},{"id":"32066785","text":"Jacob de Wolf (1630, in Groningen - 1685, in Groningen), was a Dutch Golden Age painter.

The club was founded in 2009, where they acquired the Castle League franchise of the nearby Bloemfontein club Mangaung FC; which were a newly promoted club to Vodacom League, and not to be confused with Mangaung City in the same division. Both in 2009‚Äì10 and 2010‚Äì11, Roses United won the Free State division of Vodacom League, but at the playoffs fell short to win a further promotion to the National First Division. History Around the beginning of 2009, Roses United bought the Castle League franchise of the now defunct Mangaung FC, to start campaigning in the SAFA Vodacom League. In July 2009 the club received an important transport sponsorship from Ruwacon, providing the team with a mini bus and money to cover all future transportation related costs. When the new sponsorship was announced at a press meeting, the manager of the team proclaimed, that the goal of the club was to qualify for the National First Division, within the next 3 years. The motto of the club was said to be: Roses United will keep on keeping on. The club won the Free State Province of Vodacom league, with a 10-point gap over runner-up Maluti Fet College in 2009‚Äì10, but at the promotional play-offs, they only ended as third in the Coastal Stream. In the next season, another provincial victory was secured, but this time with only a 2-point gap over runner-up Botshabelo. By the end of the season, they were in fact only the runner-up of the division, trailing 1 point behind Botshabelo. After having successfully appealed the result of one of their matches, -an initial 2‚Äì1 defeat against Sasolburg Juventus, being corrected by the Sports Court into a 2‚Äì0 win for Roses United-, the victory of the province was however secured. The reasoning behind the changed result of the match, was that it had been unfairly abrupt after 75 minutes, when Rugby fans suddenly invaded the pitch; and as Sasolburg Juventus had failed to protect the security of the pitch, they were imposed a disciplinary defeat by the court. At the subsequent promotional play-offs in June 2011, Roses United delivered a respectable performance with 7 points in 4 matches. Not quite good enough to win promotion, but good enough to achieve another third place in the Coastal Stream.

The northern areas and Azad Kashmir lie mainly in Central Asia along the edge of the Indian plate and hence are prone to violent earthquakes where the two tectonic plates collide. Earthquakes Since it lies in the centre of tectonic plates, Pakistan has been vulnerable to a number of deadly earthquakes. Mining Mining is an important industry in Pakistan. Pakistan has deposits of several minerals including coal, copper, gold, chromite, mineral salt, bauxite and several other minerals. There are also a variety of precious and semi-precious minerals that are also mined. These include peridot, aquamarine, topaz, ruby, emerald, rare-earth minerals bastnaesite and xenotime, sphene, tourmaline, and many varieties and types of quartz. The Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation is the responsible authority for the support and development of the mining industry. Gemstones Corporation of Pakistan looks after the interests of stake holders in gemstone mining and polishing as an official entity. Baluchistan province is the richest in mineral resources available in Pakistan. While recently Sindh discovered coal deposits in Thar. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is rich in gems. Most of the mineral gems found in Pakistan exist here. Apart from oil, gas and some mineral used in nuclear energy purposes which comes directly under federal control mining of other minerals is provincial issue.

The Union was trying to protect the areas of Virginia opposite Washington, D.C., and established a camp at Vienna, at the end of a 15-mile railroad to Alexandria. As Union Brig. Gen. Robert C. Schenck was transporting the 1st Ohio Infantry to Vienna by train, they were overheard by Confederate scouts led by Colonel Maxcy Gregg, who set up an ambush. They hit the train with two cannon shots, inflicting casualties of eight killed and four wounded, before the Union men escaped into the woods. The engineer had fled with the locomotive, so the Union force had to retreat on foot. The Confederates briefly attempted a pursuit in the dark, but it was called off. Compared with later operations, the battle involved only small numbers, with the Union fielding 274 infantry, and the Confederates about 750 of infantry, cavalry and artillery. But it was widely reported by an eager press, and it worried the government, whose 90-day regiments were due to be disbanded. Background In the early morning of May 24, the day after the secession of Virginia from the Union was ratified by popular vote, Union forces occupied Alexandria, Virginia and Arlington, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. Union troops occupied the area up to distances of about from the river.Weigley, p. 39. On June 1, a small U. S. Regular Army patrol on a scout as far as from their post at Camp Union in Falls Church, Virginia rode into Fairfax Court House, Virginia and fought a small and brief battle with part of a company of Virginia militia (soon to be Confederate Army infantry) at the Battle of Fairfax Court House (June 1861).Long, p. 81. The patrol brought back to the Union Army commanders an exaggerated estimate of Confederate strength at Fairfax Court House. Together with an even smaller affair the same night at a Union outpost in Arlington, the Battle of Arlington Mills, the Fairfax Court House engagement made Union commanders hesitate to extend their bridgehead into Virginia.Long, pp. 81-86.Connery, p. 54.Poland, p. 44. On June 16, a Union force of Connecticut infantry under Brig. Gen. Daniel Tyler rode over about of the Alexandria, Loudon and Hampshire Railroad line between Alexandria, Virginia and two miles (3 km) past Vienna, Virginia. They reported the line clear, although one soldier had been wounded by a shot from ambush.Davis, p. 70. Confederate forces were in the area, however, and it was apparent to Union Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell who was in charge of the department that the railroad would not remain safe without a guard force, especially because he had received information that the Confederates planned to obstruct it.Lossing and Benson, p. 525.Tomes, p. 323. On June 17, McDowell sent Brig. Gen. Schenck with the 1st Ohio Infantry under the immediate command of Col. Alexander McDowell McCookCrafts, p. 235. to expand the Union position in Fairfax County. Schenck took six companies over the Alexandria, Loudon and Hampshire Railroad line, dropping off detachments to guard railroad bridges between Alexandria, Virginia and Vienna, Virginia. As the train approached Vienna, about north of Fairfax Court House and from Alexandria, 271 officers and men remained with the train.Poland, p. 44 says the number was 274. Yet Poland says in a footnote on p. 84 that Schenck left camp with 697 and detached 387 for guard duty, which would have left him with 310 men. Given Eicher's and Davis's number of 271 for the remaining Union force, the 274 number Poland gives on p. 44 should be closer to the correct number of men on the train as it approached Vienna.Eicher, p. 78, gives the slightly different figure of 271 men, which actually coincides with General Schenck's report.Davis, 1977, p. 71 On the same day, Confederate Col. Gregg took the 6-month 1st South Carolina Infantry Regiment, about 575 men, two companies of cavalrymen (about 140 men) and a company of artillery with two artillery pieces (35 men), about 750 men in total, on a scouting mission from Fairfax Court House toward the Potomac River.Scott, pp. 128-130. On their return trip, at about 6:00 p.m., the Confederates heard the train whistle in the distance. Gregg moved his artillery pieces to a curve in the railroad line between the present locations of Park and Tapawingo Streets in Vienna and placed his men around the guns.Eicher, p. 78Williams, p. 8 Seeing this disposition, an elderly local Union sympathizer ran down the tracks to warn the approaching train of the hidden Confederate force. The Union officers mostly ignored his warning and the train continued down the track. In response to the warning, an officer was placed on the forward car as a lookout.Poland, p. 45. Battle The Union soldiers were riding open gondola or platform cars as the train backed down the track toward Vienna. As the train rounded the curve, one of the men spotted some Confederate cavalrymen on a nearby hill. As the Ohio soldiers prepared to shoot at the horsemen, the Confederates fired their cannons from their hiding place around the curve. The Union force suffered several casualties but were spared from incurring even more by the slightly high initial cannon shots and by quickly jumping from the slow-moving train and either running into nearby woods or moving into protected positions near the cars. Schenck ordered Lieutenant William H. Raynor to go back to the engine and have the engineer take the train out of range in the other direction. Schenck quickly followed Raynor. Raynor had to help loosen the brakes. Because the brakeman had uncoupled most of the cars, the engineer left them. He did not stop for the Union soldiers to catch up but continued all the way back to Alexandria. Schenck now had no means of communication and had to have the wounded men carried back to their camp in blankets by soldiers on foot. The regiment's medical supplies and instruments had been left on the train. Many of the Union infantrymen took shelter behind the cars and tried to return fire against the Confederate force amid a confusion of conflicting orders. McCook reorganized many of them in the woods.Tomes, p. 325. The two forces were slightly out of effective musket range and few shots were taken by either side. As darkness fell, the Union force was able to retreat and to elude Confederate cavalry pursuers in the broken terrain. The Confederate pursuit also was apparently called off early due to apprehension that the Union force might be only the advance of a larger body of troops and because the Confederate force was supposed to return to their post that night.Lossing, 1866, p. 526 Confederates took such supplies and equipment as were left behind and burned a passenger car and five platform cars that had been left behind.Poland, p. 46 When the Union commanders at Arlington got word of the attack, they sent wagons to bring back the wounded and the dead but these did not reach the location of the fighting. The next day, a Union sympathizer picked up the bodies of six of the Ohio men and brought them into the Union camp. Aftermath The Union force suffered casualties of eight soldiers killed and four wounded. The Confederates reported no casualties. The Union officers were criticized for not sending skirmishers in front of the train which had moved slowly along the track and for disregarding the warning given to them by the local Union sympathizer.Poland, p. 47 The Battle of Vienna followed the Union defeat at the Battle of Big Bethel only a week earlier and historian William C. Davis noted that \\"the press were much agitated by the minor repulse at Vienna on June 17, and the people were beginning to ask when the Federals would gain some victories.\\"Davis, 1977, p. 72 Historian Charles Poland, Jr. says the Battle of Fairfax Court House (June 1861), the Battle of Arlington Mills, the Battle of Vienna, Virginia and several other brief clashes in the area at this time \\"were among the antecedents of the forthcoming first battle at Bull Run.\\"Poland, p. 43. He also said that the battle has been \\"cited as the first time the railroad was used in warfare.\\" He no doubt was referring to the use of the railroad for troop movements or involvement in combat or both because some use of railroads for moving ammunition and supplies was made during the Crimean War.Wolmar, Christian. The Railways and War. Retrieved June 12, 2011 Skirmishes took place at Vienna, Virginia on July 9, 1861 and on July 17, 1861 as Union forces began their slow march to Manassas, Virginia and the First Battle of Bull Run (Battle of First Manassas).Long, 1971, pp. 92, 96 The railroad, which had eventually become the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad, was abandoned in 1968 and later turned into the Washington & Old Dominion Railroad Trail.Williams, p. 131 A historical marker that the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority erected near the Trail stands at the battle site, about east of the crossing of the Trail and Park Street.Historical marker at battle site: Commemorations The Town of Vienna has given the name of \\"Battle Street\\" to a street near the battle site.Coordinates of Battle Street in Vienna: To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the battle, the Town hosted in 1961 a battle reenactment that featured a steam train that operated on the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad's tracks, which were still in active use. The Town also commemorated the 125th anniversary of the battle in 1986. On June 18, 2011, the Town and other organizations presented a reenactment of the battle near its site to commemorate the battle's 150th anniversary. That reenactment featured a replica steam locomotive that had been leased from the Town of Strasburg, Virginia for $2,500 and transported to Vienna. Notes References * Connery, William S.

The series was edited by J. S. Brewer, James Gairdner and R. H. Brodie, and originally published between 1862 and 1932. It remains a key resource for historians of the period, and is now freely available online as part of British History Online. Surviving documents from the Public Record Office (now The National Archives), the British Museum (now the British Library), other archives, and reliable older publications, are presented in date order. The texts are calendared: that is to say, they are slightly summarised and edited, the language modernised, and some explanatory footnotes added; but all substantive content is retained. Undated documents are printed at the end of the assumed month or year. Grants and payments from accounts are also inserted at the end of their respective months. The earlier State Papers of Henry VIII, published by the Royal Commission for State Papers in 11 volumes between 1830 and 1852, is not wholly superseded because the editors of that series sought to reproduce the original phrasing and orthography of the selected letters. Publication history The first volume, edited by Brewer and covering the years 1509 to 1514, was published in 1862. Brewer also edited the next three volumes, covering the years 1515 to 1530, published in a total of eight parts between 1864 and 1876. Following Brewer's death in 1879, Gairdner edited the next nine volumes (5‚Äì13), covering the years 1531 to 1538, which appeared in a total of eleven parts between 1880 and 1893. Gairdner and Brodie jointly edited the next eight volumes (14‚Äì21), covering the years 1539 to 1547, published in a total of thirteen parts between 1894 and 1910. This brought the series down to the end of the reign of Henry VIII, but by this date a number of new documents had been discovered, and the first volume in particular was felt to be defective. A second, greatly expanded, edition of Volume 1 was therefore published in three parts (two volumes of text and an index) in 1920. Two further volumes of Addenda were published in 1929 and 1932. A full set of the series therefore amounts to 21 nominal volumes, plus two volumes of Addenda; but in physical terms (with Volume 1 represented by the second edition) it amounts to a total of 37 volumes. A full reprint of the series was issued by the Kraus Reprint Co. in 1965. The full text is also available online as part of British History Online.

He is a singer, composer, and a regional playback singer. He sings in the two major languages of Nepal, Nepal Bhasa and Nepali. He is also known as the Golden Voice and King of Romantic Melodies of Nepal. Prem Dhoj is known for being the first to perform with a guitar in Nepal. He was also the first Nepali singer to sing with Indian playback singer Usha Mangeshkar for the movie Maitighar in 1965. In 1985, he sang duet songs with Asha Bhosle for the movie Mayalu in Bombay, India. Prem Dhoj has varied his musical style throughout his career and recorded approximately 700 songs on Radio Nepal, including live broadcasting and recorded songs.  Early life  Prem Dhoj Pradhan is a Nepali musician born in 1938 in Chautara, a small town 28 miles east of Kathmandu. Brought up by his mother at a time in Nepal when music was synonymous with meaningful living, Prem Dhoj grew up to love it. His mother, Pran Devi Pradhan, a talented singer in her own right, taught him his first lessons of music. He then spent fifteen months, starting in 1954, studying with the late Mr. Ganesh Lal Shrestha. It was from Nepal's laureate of music that Prem Dhoj learned the fundamentals of classical music. Nevertheless, for the most part, Prem Dhoj remains a self-educated artist because for him music is both discipline and relaxation in a constant journey of self-expression.  Musical career  1950's In 1952, when Prem Dhoj was sixteen, he participated in a voice test sponsored by Radio Nepal. The first song he sang was Yad Kasaikko Aairahecha Yo Andheri Ratama. Prem Dhoj became the most sought-after artist by organizers of cultural programs in Nepal, enthralling them with songs like a Maun Nisha Ka Tara Ho, Magmagaundo Basana Yo Phoola Ko Hoki Timro Ho, Niraba Ratma Aanshu bhahai, O Chhu Galli Thow Chhu Galli, and Rajamati kumati. It seemed as if his songs had lent self-expression to the turbulent inner urges of a whole generation of Nepalese youth. The young artist was, however, searching for a fitting style and technique that would help in the flowering of his musical talents. By 1957 he had begun singing a combination of patriotic songs -- like Yo Nepali Shir Wuchali, the first patriotic Nepali duet with Tara Devi ever recorded on Radio Nepal -- and romantic melodies of lost love. 1960's In 1961, Prem Dhoj had to stop singing for two years after undergoing a surgery to remove a non-malignant polyp in his left vocal cord. This was a significant time in his career because it gave him the opportunity to focus inward and reflect on his life passion. It also served as a turning point in his career. It was during this break that he discovered the guitar and made it a part of his new style, becoming the first Nepali singer to do so. And it was only after the operation that Prem Dhoj started recording his songs in earnest. The same year he began performing again, Prem Dhoj was awarded a prize for the best voice in the All Nepal Modern Songs Competition in 1963. That was for his popular hit, Goreto Tyo Gaunko. After mastering his signing style, Prem Dhoj went on to produce a series of brilliant and successful recordings using then-modern recording techniques. It was in the Autumn of 1963 that he released his first LP records -- two 78 rpm discs, with hit numbers including Goreto Tyo Gaunko Ko, Maya Na Mara Mayalu, Ruka Ya Na Ruka, Timi Aayo Mero Dil Ma, Rajamti, Wachu Gali, and Wangu Lapte. By the end of 1969, he had recorded 32 songs. He also worked 40 hours a week in Kathmandu for the United States Information Services office and attended college in the evenings, graduating with an arts degree in 1967. Not only did Prem Dhoj dedicate all of his free time to music, but, unable to find a sponsor, he personally funded eleven out of his sixteen discs. Towards the end of 1964 Prem Dhoj recorded a group of songs -- eight in Nepali and six in Nepal Bhasa, his native language -- several of which remain well-known festival songs still listened to today throughout Nepal. Many of his songs, including Rajamati Kumati, O Chhu Galli Thaw Chhu Galli, Wanghu Lapte Tuyu Baji, and Balabala Chingu Mikha Ohu, have won Prem Dhoj a lasting place in the hearts of his people. The new trend set by this group of songs, both in Nepali and Nepal Bhasa, shows Prem Dhoj as an artist increasingly drawn towards a rich musical blend between Nepal's traditional folk and rural style and its modern romantic style. Like the snows behind the sub‚ÄìHimalayan Mountains, the tranquil natural landscape is almost always present as a backdrop in Prem Dhoj's melodies. Love ‚Äì its solitude, nostalgia and endless complaints against the coyness of idyllic beauty are fused with a deep attachment to Nepal's soil, and her enchanting rural landscape so that a love-song by Prem Dhoj ceases to be a mere love song. The lyrics of M.B.B Shah, Ravindra Shah, Kiran Kharel, Ratna Shumshere Thapa, and Ratna Lal Shrestha are his favorites, and his mellow and refined voice invests their lyric idiom with a subtle rhythm. In November 1965, Prem Dhoj was invited by the celebrated Indian music director Jaidev to accompany Usha Mangeshker in a duet for the Nepali film, Maiti Ghar. Prem Dhoj's duet with Usha, composed by Jaidev, is a classic in Nepal, particularly for its lyrical atmosphere of romance. It was, however, his last group of twenty-two songs discs -- 16 Nepali and 6 Nepal Bhasa -- that firmly established Prem Dhoj among Nepal's leading modern singers. In this group, there is a distinct trace of deep sadness and deeper shadows beginning with songs like Yo Masuam Udas and resolving in the tragic expectancy of Yo Janam Ma Vet Na Bhaya. But Prem Dhoj continues with his native strain of wild and romantic, coy and rural in an intricate mingling of guitar and madal, jhyaure and shayari. The continuous search it seems is for making the folk musical expression new. This search continued in the group of ten songs recorded in the first LP disc by Prem Dhoj. Each number is an experiment of its own kind on five instruments which he uses in all the songs. While he vows not to abandon his old loves-the flute, madal and guitar, he makes a very subtle use of saxophone and the electronic organ as well. In his obstinate difference for both old and new, Prem Dhoj creates yet another disc full of hit songs. 1970s In 1970, in his own music composition, he recorded 10 Nepali songs in Bombay for Polydor Co. for marketing. The name of album is ‚ÄòHimalayan Bouquett from Swinging Kathmandu.‚Äô In the same year he also recorded bhajan songs (six pieces) under the music of Music director Jaidev in Bombay for Gandhi Ashram shadow bale program in Ahmadabad. 1980s To present  Public life  Prem Dhoj started singing at Radio Nepal in 1952 and sang his first song Yad Kasaiko Aairahechechha Yo Aundheri Raatma. Worked in United States Information Service (USIS) Kathmandu; retired from the USIS, 1994; Letter of Appreciation received for the participation in Cultural Program titled \\" Samjhana Sanj\\" held by Radio Nepal Karmachari Sangh to help the families of martyrs and casualties during Jana Andolan (Movement) for democracy. Prem Dhoj sang for Nepali feature films ; Maitighar, Jeevan Rekha, Mayalu, Pachchis Basanta, Anayaya, Shantideep, Rajamati (Nepal Bhasa historical film) Jeevan Sangharsha, and Phare Vatoula Badledo aakash. Prem Dhoj is also a member of Nepal Association of Performing Arts (NEPA), 1991.  Personal life  Prem Dhoj Pradhan lived with his father and helped him with his businesses after his parents got divorced in 1944. Though he lived with his father, he spent a few hours every day with his mother to have his music lessons. In 1967 he decided to a build house for his mother who was renting a house in Jamal. To buy the land and construct a house he needed money, so he decided to organize a solo musical concert named \\"Sanjh Ko Rimjhim\\" . It was a three-day-long show where Nati Kaji, Tara Devi and several other artists supported as guest performers. He completed the house in 1969 and left for Bombay soon after for one year to learn light music (Sugam Sangeet) from music director Jaidev. A few years after returning from Mumbai, he sold the old house and built another house in Bagbazar and moved in with his mother. Shortly after the moving he married Kiran Devi. He has two sons, Prasanna and Kabir; both are currently settled in America.  Retirement  These days Prem Dhoj wakes up at 5:00 A.M. every day, places holy water in front of his parents‚Äô photos and goes to feed the pigeons. He follows with a short session of yoga and some light exercise and a walk. He practices riyaz (voice practice) for an hour every day. A vegetarian by choice Prem Dhoj loves curd and stays away from salt on Sundays, which he believes has been very beneficial for his health.

Its sister clade is the Xenacoelomorpha. The Ambulacraria (conventionally deuterostomes) was formerly thought to be sister to the Xenacoelomorpha, forming the Xenambulacraria as basal Deuterostomes, or basal Bilateria invalidating Nephrozoa and Deuterostomes in earlier studies. The coelom, the digestive tract and excretory organs, and nerve cords developed in the Nephrozoa. It has been argued that, because protonephridia are only found in protostomes, they can't be considered a synapomorphy of this group. This would make Nephrozoa an improper name, leaving Eubilateria as this clade's name. Chordates (which include all the vertebrates) are deuterostomes. It seems very likely that the Kimberella was a member of the protostomes. If so, this means that the protostome and deuterostome lineages must have split some time before Kimberella appeared ‚Äî at least , and hence well before the start of the Cambrian .

Ibn Bilia was the author of many works, the greater part of which, no longer in existence, are known only by quotations. Among them were: Me'or 'Enayim, a commentary on the Pentateuch, quoted by Caspi, Levi ben Gershon, and chiefly by the author's countryman Samuel Zarza, who often criticized Ibn Bilia's interpretations as being too mystical; and Yesodot ha-Maskil, published, with a French translation by S. Klein, in the collection Dibre ·∏§akamim, Metz, 1849. In the Yesodot Ibn Bilia propounded thirteen articles of belief in addition to those of Maimonides. These are: # The existence of incorporeal intellects; # The creation of the world; # The existence of a future life; # Emanation of the soul from God; # The soul's existence through its own substance and its self-consciousness; # Its existence independent of the body it subsequently occupies; # Retribution of the soul; # Perdition of the souls of the wicked; # Superiority of the Mosaic law over philosophy; # The presence of an esoteric as well as an exoteric meaning in Holy Scripture; # Inadmissibility of emendations of the Torah; # The reward of the fulfilment of the divine precepts implied in the precepts themselves; # The inadequacy of ceremonial laws alone for the realization of human perfection. These, together with the thirteen articles of Maimonides, make twenty-six, the numerical value of the Tetragrammaton. Ibn Bilia also wrote ·∫íiyyurim, an ethical work; Kilale ha-Higgayon, a work on logic, of which only a fragment has been preserved (Neubauer, \\"Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS.\\" No. 2168); Ma'amar bi-Segullot 'Or ha-Na·∏•ash, a treatise on the medicinal virtues of the skin of the serpent, translated from Johannes Paulinus' Latin translation \\"Salus Vit√¶\\" (Munich, No. 228). In the past some scholars, including the nineteenth century scholar Moritz Steinschneider, have identified Ibn Bilia with the David ben Yom Tov who was the father of the Catalan astronomer Jacob ben David ben Yom Tov Poel. That David wrote works including the Kelal Qatan (\\"Concise Summary\\"), a treatise on the medical applications of astrology. However the two are now believed to have been separate individuals.

Its origin and extent are obscure. According to Niketas Choniates, the theme was founded by Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143‚Äì1180) between 1162 and 1173. Manuel I scoured the region around three cities‚ÄîChliara (mod. Kƒ±rkaƒüa√ß), Pergamon and Adramyttion‚Äîfrom the Turkish bands that raided it, rebuilt and refortified the cities and established forts in the countryside and made them into a separate province under a governor titled harmostes (\\"supervisor\\") by the archaizing Choniates, but whose actual title in all probability must have been doux.Ahrweiler (1965), p. 133Kazhdan (1991), p. 1454 The imperial chrysobull of 1198 to the Venetians on the other hand mentions Adramyttion apart from the Neokastra, and the Partitio Romaniae of 1204 mentions the province of Neokastra as being entirely separate from all three cities. The Byzantinist Helene Ahrweiler interpreted the evidence to suggest that Neokastra did indeed originally encompass the three cities, but that in 1198 Adramyttion may have formed a separate district, and that the separation between the cities and the province evidenced in the Partitio was the result of a copyist's error.Ahrweiler (1965), pp. 134‚Äì135 The theme survived the destruction of the Byzantine Empire by the Fourth Crusade, and was retained by the Empire of Nicaea, where it constituted, along with the Thracesian Theme to the south, the most important provinces.Ahrweiler (1965), p. 163 The boundaries of the Nicaean province were different, however: Adramyttion was lost to the new Latin Empire, and Pergamon was abandoned and fell in ruins. The account of George Akropolites, reflecting the new situation, mentions Neokastra apart from Chliara and Pergamon, and records the village of Kalamos (mod. Gelenbe) as the northernmost point of the theme, at the Nicaean frontier zone with the Latins.Ahrweiler (1965), p. 135 On the basis of Akropolites' passage, the scholar Ruth Macrides suggested an alternative reading of Choniates' passage, which would place the original theme of Neokastra immediately to the east of the three cities.Macrides (2007), p. 152 (Note #15) Ahrweiler also suggested that the Nicaean-era province of Neokastra extended as far south as Magnesia or Sardis, but this is conjectural. A handful of governors of the theme are known: Manuel Kalampakes ca. 1284, a certain Libadarios, who was involved in the revolt of Alexios Philanthropenos in 1296, and the parakoimomenos Constantine Doukas Nestongos, active in 1303/4, whom Ahrweiler identifies as the theme's last known doux. The region fell shortly thereafter to the Anatolian beyliks of Karasi and Sarukhan.Ahrweiler (1965), pp. 164‚Äì165  References   Sources   Category:States and territories established in the 12th century Category:Byzantine Anatolia Category:Themes of the Byzantine Empire ","title":"Neokastra"},{"id":"32067403","text":"The Palace is a 2011 Cypriot‚ÄìAustralian short film co-production, written and directed by Anthony Maras, that had its international premiere at the 2011 Telluride Film Festival and won Best Short Fiction Film and Best Screenplay in a Short Film in the 2012 Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts Awards.

It gives the asymptotic tail distribution of a random variable X, when the true distribution F of X is unknown. Unlike for the first theorem (the Fisher‚ÄìTippett‚ÄìGnedenko theorem) in extreme value theory, the interest here is in the values above a threshold. Conditional excess distribution function If we consider an unknown distribution function F of a random variable X, we are interested in estimating the conditional distribution function F_u of the variable X above a certain threshold u. This is the so-called conditional excess distribution function, defined as : F_u(y) = P(X-u \\\\leq y  X>u) = \\\\frac{F(u+y)-F(u)}{1-F(u)} for 0 \\\\leq y \\\\leq x_F-u, where x_F is either the finite or infinite right endpoint of the underlying distribution F. The function F_u describes the distribution of the excess value over a threshold u, given that the threshold is exceeded. Statement Let (X_1,X_2,\\\\ldots) be a sequence of independent and identically-distributed random variables, and let F_u be their conditional excess distribution function. Pickands (1975), Balkema and de Haan (1974) posed that for a large class of underlying distribution functions F, and large u, F_u is well approximated by the generalized Pareto distribution. That is: : F_u(y) \\\\rightarrow G_{k, \\\\sigma} (y),\\\\text{ as }u \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty where *G_{k, \\\\sigma} (y)= 1-(1+ky/\\\\sigma)^{-1/k} , if k eq 0 *G_{k, \\\\sigma} (y)= 1-e^{-y/\\\\sigma} , if k = 0. Here œÉ > 0, and y ‚â• 0 when k ‚â• 0 and 0 ‚â§ y ‚â§ ‚àíœÉ/k when k < 0\\\\. Since a special case of the generalized Pareto distribution is a power-law, the Pickands‚ÄìBalkema‚Äìde Haan theorem is sometimes used to justify the use of a power-law for modeling extreme events. Still, many important distributions, such as the normal and log-normal distributions, do not have extreme-value tails that are asymptotically power-law.

It is in South West Kolkata, part of the greater Behala region. It is reachable through Behala Chowrasta or through Budge Budge Trunk Road (from Taratala crossing) and Dakghar / Maheshtala of South 24 Parganas. It is starting just two kilometers from Behala Chowrasta and extended up to nearly four kilometers till Oxytown / Shibrampur. It is a predominantly Bengali neighborhood, but especially after 2000s, many South Indians,Oriyas,Goans,North Indians like residents of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan also reside in the area. It is bordered by Shakuntala Park area (Patton Tank Factory) in the east and Ketopole to the west. The main road is Biren Roy Road (West) renamed Ho-Chi- Minh Sarani. The area was extremely rural prior to the 1972 Bangladesh war. Two people who played a very significant role in shaping this area are Kali Ranjan Thakur Chakraborty, a teacher by profession, and Biru Chakraborty. They named this area as Shakuntala Park. The lane which is now called 12 feet road, was originally called Shakuntala Park. Later, 16 feet road locality, Kalipur locality, Syamsundar pally locality (1st, 2nd, 3rd lane), Benimaster lane locality, Daspara locality got included and the area is now called Shakuntala Park as a whole. The West Bengal government's Housing Developments Authority, West Bengal Housing Board developed the township for residential projects, selling vacant plots (2K and 3K series), pre-constructed houses (H2, H1, M1, L and E schemes) and 4 storied apartments as New Shakuntala Park and Swaranika Co-operative Housing Societies. Swaranika consists of 465 flats. The township is divided into 5 zones/ sectors. Also, there are several older locality which later got included under this area like Kalipur locality, Syamsundar pally locality (1st, 2nd, 3rd lane), Benimaster lane locality, Daspara locality etc. The area was under the jurisdiction of Thakurpukur Police Station and partly under Parnasree Police Station, which are a part of the South West Division of the Kolkata Police Department. There was a Police Outpost situated inside the township beside Mother Dairy booth, Shakuntala Park unit. On 25 February 2014 this outpost was converted into Sarsuna Police Station and the area which was under Thakurpukur PS comes under the jurisdiction of this new police station. Remaining area is under Parnasree PS as it was. This new police station was inaugurated by the then Commissioner of Police, Mr. Surajit Kar Purkayastha, IPS. There are three lakes (in Bengali known as 'jhil', Lake No. 1, 2, and 3 respectively) located within half a kilometer of the township. Lake 1 is beautified and maintained by Kolkata Corporation. Beautification of Lake 2 & 3 is in the pipeline. This is the center of attraction of the locality for its serene and natural ambience. Apart from the casual visitors countless morning and evening walkers visit this place daily to rejuvenate. It is also a coveted fishing spot. During 'Chat Puja' the Biharis assemble here in scores to offer puja, in a year. There are many clubs and associations in the area (six co- operative societies and their clubs), which organise celebrations for Durga Puja, the main Bengali festival, Kali Puja and all other pujas in their respective puja grounds in different areas of the township. The entire Shakuntala Park Housing area is now a place of growing interest for shooting of different films and TV serials. There is a big playground beside Lake1 named Central Park under joint supervision of all cooperative societies of the township. A swimming pool is also situated beside Lake1 in the Central Park. On the southern end of the township there are two colleges as Sarsuna General College, Law College and a supermarket named Faayada Store. The Life Insurance Corporation of India has constructed their Zonal Training Institute, Jeevan Vidya, here which is near Muchipara area. Many L.I.C. employees from across India go there to train, and stay at the L.I.C. Hostel adjacent to the training institute. The branches of following banks are available viz, Punjab National bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Allahabad Bank, United Bank of India, Canara Bank (Shakuntala Park branch located at Ketopole), State Bank of India (Shibrampur branch located at Ketopole) and Axis Bank (Shakuntala Park branch located at Shibrampur). The ATMs of following banks are available viz, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, SBI, PNB, PSB and UBI. The area is also now served by HDFC bank,ICICI bank and another bank apart from the banks mentioned above. There are two local milk bars, Mother Dairy and Metro Dairy. This area is suffering from the problem of water logging in rainy seasons. Though the problem is reduced to a great extent in the area which belongs to Ward No 128 after construction of underground sewerage. The portion which is in Ward No 127 shows no improvement as no underground drainage system is there. Transport *Auto Services are there in between Behala Chowrasta and Shakuntala Park Bus Stoppage. From Behala Chowrasta all over Kolkata is well connected. Also several shuttle car services are there in between Behala Chowrasta and Shakuntala Park. Two Govt bus routes are newly started in Shakuntala Park. Bus routes are S22= From Shakuntala Park to Karunamoyee, Salt lake and S45= From Shakuntala Park to Kolkata Railway Station.

It is located on the western side of the glen of the Strontian River, to the south of former lead mining sites that lie further up this glen. The wood is part of the ancient Sunart Oakwood, and is a remnant of ancient oakwoods that once spanned the Atlantic coasts of Europe from Norway to Portugal.The Story of Ariundle Oakwood National Nature Reserve. p. 4. It was designated as a National Nature Reserve in 1977, and is managed primarily by NatureScot, in conjunction with Forestry and Land Scotland, who own the land surrounding the National Nature Reserve.The Story of Ariundle Oakwood National Nature Reserve. p. 1. The reserve is classified as a Category IV protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and also forms part of both a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation. NatureScot has provided two marked trails in the wood, both of which can be accessed from a car park near the entrance to the reserve. One path takes walkers through the woods on the north side of the reserve, visiting the site of a ruined croft and providing views up the glen to the hills beyond. The other trail visits the lower part of the woods, beside the river Strontian. The two routes can be combined to form a 5 km circular walk. Both marked trails utilise the main track through the nature reserve, which can also be used to visit the lead mines further up the glen, and forms the starting section of the most accessible route to Sg√πrr Dh√≤mhnuill, a Corbett and the 17th highest relative peak in Britain and Ireland. History The wood contains remains from earlier settlements in the Strontian area, including charcoal platforms, pony tracks, enclosure dykes, potato lazy beds, and old coppice trees. The people there were described as sluagh an torraidh bhain, or the people of the white hillock, with the settlement recorded as \\"Torban\\" in Clan Cameron records. Torban was abandoned to sheep farming in the early 19th century. From 1752, the wood was a source of charcoal for the Bonawe iron furnace on Loch Etive and locally in the lead mining industry. The oak trees were coppiced to ensure a steady of wood for the furnaces, and many of the mature oak trees are multi-stemmed as a result of this practice. Managing the woodland brought about a thousand workers to the area. Lead mining fell off in the early 19th Century and the Bonawe Furnace closed in 1876. After this the woods were no longer needed to supply fuel, but were used as a sheltered area for livestock.The Story of Ariundle Oakwood National Nature Reserve. p.p. 11-12. In 1961, Ariundle Wood was designated a Forest Nature Reserve, before its designation as a National Nature Reserve in 1977. Flora and Fauna The wood is an example of an Atlantic Oakwood, with sessile oaks, pedunculate oaks, and hybrids of the two forms being the dominant species. The dominance of oak is artificial, and results from the management practices employed during the period when the wood was used for charcoal. Other native species present include holly, hazel, birch, rowan, willow, ash and wych elm.The Story of Ariundle Oakwood National Nature Reserve. p. 5. There are also Scots pine within the wood, however it is unclear whether they would normally occur naturally at Ariundle, or have been introduced as a result of the historic management of the forest. Due to this uncertainty, Scottish Natural Heritage's 2009-15 management plan for the reserve aimed to favour broadleaf species when taking action to promote the natural regeneration of woodland. Ariundle is particularly noted for the variety of mosses, liverworts and lichens. Over 270 species of lichen have been recorded, including the nationally rare species Biatora vernalis.The Story of Ariundle Oakwood National Nature Reserve. p. 6. Ariundle hosts a large selection of insect species, including caterpillars, beetles, dragonflies, butterflies, and over 200 species of moths. Of particular note is the chequered skipper butterfly, which is of international importance. Other rare butterfly species found at Ariundle are the pearl-bordered fritillary and the small pearl-bordered fritillary.The Story of Ariundle Oakwood National Nature Reserve. p. 7. Migrant bird species found in the wood include common crossbills, redstarts, wood warblers, tree pipits, and willow warblers. Otter, pipistrelle bats, wildcats, pine martens and badgers are amongst the more significant mammals found in the NNR.The Story of Ariundle Oakwood National Nature Reserve. p. 9.

Figure 2: Schematic of a modern master link. SRAM Powerlink, joining two ends of a chain. Figure 4: A master link with a slightly raised profile. Note that the embossed arrow should point toward the inside of the chain-loop. Note also the more prominent pin excess. Figure 5: Master link pliers. They fit over the rollers to take the hard work out of link removal. A master link or quick-release link is a roller chain accessory that allows convenient connection and disconnection of a chain without the need for a chain tool. It acts as a set of the chain's outer plates, so joining two sets of the chain's inner plate ends. Such master links may or may not be re-usable. A chain tool is nonetheless needed to adjust a chain's length, for example to shorten a new chain before connecting its ends. They are used on bicycles and motorcycles. On bicycles There are at least two styles of master link used to connect bicycle chain. In both cases the master link set consists of two outer plates, each of which resembles the outer plate of a chain. =Straight chainline compatible= The oldest type of master link, available for decades, has two pins connected to the same plate. (Refer to Figure 1). It has been in use mainly in single-speed, hub-geared, or other bicycle drivetrain systems with straight chainlines or widely spaced sprockets. In this assembly, the outside plate with the two pins protruding from it are spaced at the same pitch as the chain, one half-inch, and the free ends of the pins are grooved. The other plate fits over the ends of the pins and is secured with a spring clip to make the connection, and this type of master link comes closest to being re-usable. =External derailleur compatible= For bicycles with derailleur gears, a special kind of master link has been developed to fit the narrow chains used on closely spaced sprockets. In this case, each plate has one pin protruding from it, and the pin ends are grooved. (Refer to Figures 2, 3 and 4). In addition to pins, each link plate has a tapered slot, one end of which is wide enough to accommodate the end of a pin, while the other presents a tight fit. The link plates fit together, and connect the chain by feeding their pins through the bushings of the inner plates, from opposite sides. In this way the pair form a loosely interconnected, closed set, with each master link's pin located in the slot of the other, and the two bushings held captive. The connection is then made secure by pulling the chain outwards on both sides of the link. This latter action forces the pin ends into the narrow ends of the slots where they become locked. The overall security of such a master link depends upon the chain being under tension in normal use, though it can fail in extreme conditions where this condition does not hold. The manufacturers' instructions for the removal of a master link is to press the face of the two plates together, while pressing both ends inward. When a link is new, or when otherwise difficult to remove, master link pliers can be used (see figure 5). The special pliers have curved ends to accommodate the rollers, and make easy work of even the most difficult removal. Some links have side plates that are raised on top (figure 4), while some are straight, (figure 3), and some have more prominent pin projections than others. Since a chain on a derailleur- fitted bicycle is reversed for part of its excursion through the drive-train, and because some cogsets have close ramp tolerances, such a link might cause a malfunction if the wrong selection were made. Bushingless chains, with smaller projections, are used on bicycles with large cogsets, since their clearances are more critical than those with only seven speeds. In these former cases a master link of comparable quality is needed. As a result, some manufacturers of derailleurs (e.g. SRAM) recommend only their own products, and these days package a master link with each new chain that is purchased. Chains for small cogsets (e.g. seven-speeds) and other than derailleur-fitted bicycles are more tolerant of these master link dimensions.

Schirripa Spagnolo in 2008. It was used for the first time in an international context in 2010. The hylemetric approach is based, as for biometry, in the identification of a unique random characteristic, used to create a template, which can uniquely identifying the object. Hylemetric identification requires properties which are unique, permanent, measurable, and non-invasive, i.e., that the characteristics can be measured without modifying anything. A typical example is the security metallic fibers distributed inside banknotes. Background It is a composition of two Greek words: Hyle and Metros. Aristotle used the term ·ΩïŒªŒ∑ (hyle) to mean non-living matter. Since biometric identification has given excellent results, it comes naturally to apply similar criteria to uniquely identify ‚Äúnon-living matter‚Äù, such as banknotes. Process The hylemetric approach is based, as for biometry, in the identification of a unique random characteristic, used to create a template, which can uniquely identifying the object. In theory, every random and irreproducible characteristic could be used in hylemetric identification. However, a valid feature also needs the following properties: * uniqueness, which indicates that no two objects should be the same in terms of the characteristic, * permanence, which means that the characteristic should be invariant with time, * collectability, which indicates that the characteristic can be measured quantitatively, * non- invasive, which indicates that the characteristics can be measured without modifying anything. Banknote authentication Example of UV image of a Euro banknote. It is possible to see the security metallic fibers randomly distributed. A typical example is the security metallic fibers distributed inside banknotes. These, as can be seen in the image (right), are put inside paper pulp during the making of banknote paper, so their distribution and number is absolutely random. It is possible to create a Hylemetric Template, which uniquely identifies a particular banknote, starting from the analysis of the fibers distribution. This approach is also valid for all non-living matter, after having identified one or more correct characteristics.

(TEPCO), Japan. He was the plant manager during the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, where he played a critical role by disobeying corporate headquarters orders to stop using seawater to cool the reactors. According to nuclear physicist Dr. Michio Kaku, the decision to use seawater arguably prevented a much greater disaster. Without the last ditch effort to use seawater to cool the reactor, a much greater catastrophe that could have contaminated much of northern Japan may have occurred. Yoshida managed to gain the trust of Prime Minister Naoto Kan, whom he met the day after the tsunami on a plant tour. They had both attended the Tokyo Institute of Technology. On 12 March 2011, about 28 hours after the tsunami struck, Yoshida and other TEPCO executives had ordered workers to start injecting seawater into Reactor No. 1 to keep the reactor from overheating and going into meltdown. But 21 minutes later, they ordered Yoshida to suspend the operation. Yoshida chose to ignore the order and ordered the plant workers to continue. At 20:05 JST that night, the Japanese government again ordered seawater to be injected into Unit 1. The week of 7 June 2011, TEPCO gave Yoshida a verbal reprimand for defying the order and not reporting it earlier. Yoshida was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, which was determined by TEPCO to be unrelated to the nuclear accident, due to the rapidness of its onset. He retired as plant manager in early December 2012.

Course and countryside  The main valley is about 70 km long and begins north of the Zeller See. It forms the broad vale of the Saalfelden Basin, the heart of the Saalachpinzgau region. Initially it separates the Kitzb√ºhel Alps in the west, from where the Saalach originates, from the Salzburg Slate Alps in the east; later, it divides the Loferer Steinberge and the Chiemgau Alps in the west from the Berchtesgaden Alps in the east. Near Reichenhall and Gro√ügmain the valley broadens again and ends between Freilassing and Salzburg, the Saalach flowing for its last few kilometres through the plain of the Salzburg-Freilassing Basin. The roughly 30 km long upper reaches of the Saalach is not called the Saalachtal, but bears the name Glemmtal, the area of its source streams being called Hinterglemm.  Geology  The Saalach Valley was formed by the Salzach-Saalach Glacier. When it retreated the glacier left behind thick sheets of morainic debris about 10,000 years ago that extend from the Zeller See in the north to just in front of Saalfelden, roughly by the K√ºhbichl (875 m). In the post-glacial period, the Saalach flowed into the Zeller See and then into the Salzach river to the south. The drift deposits from the Glemmtal, that were laid down between the Zeller See and Maishofen as gravel, blocked the southerly course of the Saalach and force it to flow northwards along its present riverbed. This has been evinced by excavations between Atzing and Unterreit.  Tributaries and transport  The Pinzgau Road (B 311) runs through the Saalach Valley from Zell am See to just after Lofer followed by a short section of the Lofer Road (B 178) as far as the Austro-German border. In Bavaria the line of the valley is followed by the Bundesstra√üe 21 and, from Piding, the Bundesstra√üe 20\\\\. This route is known as the Little German Corner (Kleines Deutsches Eck).

Ash cloud The eruption has ejected a large ash cloud near the Eritrea‚ÄìEthiopia border region, extending over into neighboring Sudan. The height of the ash cloud peaked at 14,000 m, implying a VEI of 4.

A secretary for the Guelph Maple Leafs, he also served as mayor of Guelph from 1891 to 1892.  Biography  = Early life = Born in Paterson, New Jersey, the son of James Goldie and Frances Owen, Goldie moved to Guelph, Ontario with his parents in 1860 where his father established a successful milling business. His grandfather was John Goldie, a botanist originally from Ayrshire, Scotland who toured Upper Canada in the early nineteenth century and settled in Ayr, Ontario in 1844. Goldie received his education at McGill College, now McGill University, and Eastman's National Business College in Poughkeepsie, New York. Upon completing his education, he entered his father's milling enterprise and assumed a managerial position. = Career = Following his involvement in his family's business, he subsequently became instrumental in establishing the Guelph Junction Railway in 1886, and later served as its director. Goldie was additionally involved in the operation of several insurance firms, including the Gore Fire Insurance Company the Canadian Milliers Mutual Fire Association and the Wellington Mutual Fire Insurance Company. He also served as president of the Millers and Manufacturers Insurance Company. Goldie had taken an active interest in public life since arriving in Guelph. He sat on the school board and from 1881 to 1890 was an alderman. In the 1891 mayoral election, he was elected Mayor of Guelph with a majority of five hundred votes and was acclaimed the following year. Cited as one of the community's most popular nineteenth century mayors, Goldie was well-known for his policies of modernization, as during his tenure Guelph hired its first civil engineer. On a more national-scale, he was conservative in his politics, and served as president of the Liberal-Conservative Association of South Wellington from 1888 to 1892. His brother Lincoln served as a Conservative member in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, and his father was a perennial Conservative candidate for the federal riding of Wellington South.alt= = Involvement in sports = However, despite his successful careers in both industry and politics, Goldie is most prominently remembered for his involvement and promotion of amateur field sports in Ontario. Though he was an ardent cricket and lacrosse enthusiast, Goldie was most prominent in the sport of baseball. In the 1870s, he became secretary for the Guelph Maples Leafs shortly after their 1869 victory in the Canadian Silver Ball Championship. In 1874, the team received international acclaim when it won the world semi-professional championship in Watertown, New York. Along with the team's president, the prominent brewer and future mayor of Guelph George Sleeman, Goldie sought to capitalize on the popularity following this victory to enhance the image of Guelph. This interest by both men in associating sport with civic promotion was typical, according to sports historian William Humber, of an era ‚Äúwhen leagues meant little, and the size of a town meant less than the promotional elan of some local patron who wanted to put his town on the map‚Äù. During the early days of baseball in Guelph, the sport reflected the varied social composition of the city. It was an ideal social equalizer, as it allowed young men from prominent and privileged families, such as Goldie‚Äôs sons, to play with those from families of less means. The Guelph champions of 1869 included ‚Äúlocally born machinists, as well as a butcher, a tinsmith, a miller, and a Methodist clergyman.‚Äù By the mid 1880s, however, the team was facing financial trouble in the semi-professional circuit. Its glory days became overshadowed by the retirement of players and narrowing profit-margins which forced Sleeman to disband the team in 1886. Following this dissolution, Goldie shifted his interests to other sports such as lacrosse, cricket, curling, horse racing and speed skating. Goldie's personal reputation as an athlete was in cricket, his favourite sport, which he played in his youth as a member of Toronto's Albany Club. In 1891, he was the star of the annual match in Guelph which pitted the municipal council against the school board. While serving as mayor, he simultaneously acted as president of the Ontario Cricket Association in 1892. However, Goldie would contract pneumonia and die in office that same year aged 41. Goldie's contributions to the sporting, business and municipal life of Ontario were warmly remembered in tributes published in Toronto and Guelph newspapers, which praised him for his amiable nature, generosity, and public service. The Toronto World affectionately described him as ‚Äúone of Toronto‚Äôs most welcome visitors. . . . None was more fond of him than the Queen City Cricketers. His funeral was reported in the Guelph Daily Mercury as attracting over two thousand people, with a procession that included over four hundred carriages.
