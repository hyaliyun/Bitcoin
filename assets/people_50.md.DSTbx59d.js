The town is south-west of Sydney, east of the Hume Highway, It was proclaimed as a village on 28 October 1890. As of 2016, the town had a population of 446. It serves a local farming community relying for its prosperity mainly on sheep and cattle, and the interstate truckies who use the town as a halfway change-over point in the trade between the state capital cities of Sydney and Melbourne. History The Tarcutta area was first visited by the European explorers Hume and Hovell as they passed through on their way from Sydney to Port Phillip in the Colony of Victoria. On 7 January 1825, near the present site of Tarcutta, they met a group of Wiradjuri aborigines. A decade after this first European contact around 1835-37, \\"Hambledon\\", a U-shaped slab house was built at Tarcutta. It was the first inn and post office to be built between Gundagai and Albury. Tarcutta Post Office opened on 1 January 1849. Gold was mined in the area round Tarcutta. By the 1880s Tarcutta locals were actively lobbying for a rail branch line from Wagga Wagga to Tumbarumba via Tarcutta, and in 1917 the Tumbarumba branch line became a reality. A section of the line sustained major flood damage in 1974, and the remainder of the line was closed in 1987. The Tarcutta bypass is west of the village, linking-up to the freeway to the north of the village and south of the village. It was opened to traffic on 15 November 2011. Trucking industry Tarcutta is situated halfway between Sydney and Melbourne on the Hume Highway, and has long been popular in the trucking industry as a stopping and changeover point for drivers. The local park houses the National Truck Drivers' Memorial to the truck drivers who have died on the infamous local stretch of the Hume Highway, as well as around the country. The country singer, Slim Dusty, endorsed the memorial with a plaque. A commemorative event is held annually in October. The local caf√©, which has sustained generations of truckies, has also been the source of inspiration for some of Australia's recent modern poets, Les Murray and Bruce Dawe. Murray wrote \\"The Burning Truck\\" while visiting the caf√© in 1961 and Dawe immortalised the eatery in a couple of lines in his poem \\"Under Way\\". The poem reads in part: 'there would be days / banging open and shut like the wire door of the cafe in Tarcutta / where the flies sang at the windows'. There had been extensive political arguing since 1999 between Federal and State Governments over funding and where to site a proposed Tarcutta truck changeover facility. It was finally decided to place it off the main street and the project which was completed early 2007 was jointly funded at a cost of $6.5m. Truck drivers are required to stop for 30 minutes every five hours. Heritage listings Tarcutta has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Tarcutta Street: Hambledon Homestead Other features Tarcutta is also the birthplace of former Grand Slam champion tennis player Tony Roche. A left-hander, Roche had a successful singles and double career and won 12 Grand Slam men's doubles tournaments. Located nearby is the Tarcutta Hills Reserve, owned and managed by Bush Heritage Australia. This reserve provides an important remnant of white box woodland with a relatively untouched grassy understory: a last refuge for the squirrel glider, endangered birds like the swift parrot, and as many as 11 other threatened wildlife species. The site is listed on the Register of the National Estate. In 1969, the Tarcutta Rugby League side became the Group 13 Rugby League premiers. Their superior season also saw them crowned as the Clayton Cup winners for 1969. Climate Original truckie memorial at site of current memorial.

He played a significant role in the psychological profiling of violent offenders in the 1970s and is often credited with coining the term \\"serial killer\\", though the term is not far from a direct translation of the German term \\"Serienm√∂rder\\" coined in 1930 by Berlin investigator Ernst Gennat. After retiring from the FBI, he authored a number of books on serial murders, and often gave lectures on criminology.  Early life  Robert Ressler grew up on North Marmora Avenue in Chicago, Illinois and graduated from Schurz High School, Class of 1955. He was the son of Joseph, who worked in security and maintenance at the Chicago Tribune, and Gertrude Ressler. At an early age Robert became interested in killers, as he followed the Tribune's articles on \\"The Lipstick Killer\\". Ressler claims that he was more fascinated than afraid of this notorious killer, as other killers fascinated him in his later years with the FBI. Ressler attended two years at a community college before joining the U.S. Army and was stationed in Okinawa. After two years in the army Ressler decided to enroll in the School of criminology and police administration at Michigan State University. He graduated with a bachelor's degree and started graduate work but only finished one semester before going back into the army as an officer, having also completed an ROTC program at Michigan State.  Military career  Ressler served in the U.S. Army from 1957 to 1992 as a provost marshal of a platoon of MPs in Aschaffenburg, as he states in his autobiography Whoever Fights Monsters. He was in charge of solving cases such as homicides, robberies, and arson. After four years in Germany, Ressler decided to leave the position and was reassigned as the Commander of a Criminal Investigation Division (CID) at Fort Sheridan. He then went back to Michigan State to finish his master's in police administration, paid for by the army, in exchange for two more years of service after graduation. After he got his degree, he served a year in Thailand and a year in Fort Sheridan, where he finished out his career with the army as a major, and moved on to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  FBI career  Ressler joined the FBI in 1970 and was recruited into the Behavioral Science Unit that deals with drawing up psychological profiles of violent offenders, such as rapists and serial killers, who typically select victims at random. Between 1976 and 1979, Ressler helped to organize the interviews of thirty-six incarcerated serial killers in order to find parallels between such criminals' backgrounds and motives. He was also instrumental in setting up Vi-CAP (Violent Criminal Apprehension Program). This consists of a centralized computer database of information on unsolved homicides. Information is gathered from local police forces and cross-referenced with other unsolved killings across the United States. Working on the basis that most serial killers claim similar victims with a standard method (modus operandi) it hopes to spot early on when a killer is carrying out crimes in different jurisdictions. This was primarily a response to the appearance of nomadic killers who committed crimes in different areas. So long as the killer kept on the move, the police forces in each state would be unaware that there were multiple victims and would just be investigating a single homicide each, unaware that other police forces had similar crimes. Vi-CAP would help individual police forces determine if they were hunting for the same perpetrator so that they could share and correlate information with one another, increasing their chances of identifying a suspect. He worked on many cases of serial homicide such as Jeffrey Dahmer, Ted Bundy, Richard Chase and John Joubert.  Life after retirement  Ressler retired from the FBI in 1990 and authored a number of books about serial murder. He actively gave lectures to students and police forces on the subject of criminology and in 1993, was brought in to London to assist in the investigation into the murders committed by Colin Ireland. In 1995, Ressler met South African profiler Micki Pistorius at a conference in Scotland and she invited him to review her investigation of the \\"ABC Murders\\", so-called because of their location in the Johannesburg suburbs of Atteridgeville, Boksburg, and Cleveland. A man named David Selepe had died in police custody while being investigated as a suspect for the Cleveland murders, prior to the discovery of the Atteridgeville and Boksburg crimes, and the authorities feared that they had killed an innocent man while the real culprit was still at large. Ressler believed that Selepe was indeed responsible for the Cleveland murders, either alone or with an accomplice, and that the Atteridgeville and Boksburg murders had been committed by the same offender, but that this killer was not involved in the Cleveland murders. He also pointed out that the Atteridgeville-Boksburg murderer was gaining confidence with each killing and would contact the media. As predicted, serial killer Moses Sithole called the South African newspaper The Star to claim responsibility for the Atteridgeville and Boksburg murders, some time after Ressler left the case.Pistorius, Micki (2012) Catch me a killer. Penguin UK, 209 pages.Murray, William (2009) Serial Killers. Canary Press, 192 pages. Ressler's visit to Ciudad Ju√°rez in Mexico to investigate the still-active feminicides occurring there served as inspiration for the character Albert Kessler in Roberto Bola√±o's novel 2666.  Death  Ressler died at his home in Spotsylvania County, Virginia on Sunday May 5, 2013, from Parkinson's disease. He was 76 years old. He is survived by his wife Helen Graszer Ressler, his son Lt. Col. Aaron R. Ressler, daughters Allison R. Tsiumis and Betsy S. Hamlin, three grandchildren and three step grandchildren.  Model for fictional characters  A screenplay adapted from his colleague's John E. Douglas' book Mindhunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit was picked up by Netflix. Mindhunter stars Holt McCallany, who plays the character Special Agent Bill Tench, a lead character based on Ressler.  Books  * Sexual Homicide: Patterns and Motives (with John E.

He is best known for reviving the fraternal organization Ordo Templi Orientis, which he headed from 1971 until his death in 1985. Early life and career He lived in various parts of Oklahoma and the Midwest, and graduated from high school in Valley Center, Kansas in 1937. He then moved to Southern California to study engineering at Pasadena Junior College, where he made friends with some students at the nearby California Institute of Technology. Among them was Jack Parsons, who shared his enthusiasm for science fiction, and who introduced him to Thelema. In 1941 McMurtry was initiated into the Minerval and I¬∞ of Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), a secret society headed at the time by Aleister Crowley. In February 1942, two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, McMurtry's entire Reserve Officers Training Corps class was called to active duty, and he served as an officer in Ordnance. He took part in the invasion of Normandy, the liberation of France and Belgium, and the occupation of Germany. He was recalled to active duty to serve in the Korean War, eventually reaching the rank of major. He was recalled again for another tour of duty in Korea in the early 1960s. Six months prior to completing 30 years of Reserve service, he was mustered out as a lieutenant colonel during a RIF (Reduction In Force) and lost what would have been an earned pension. He continued his academic studies as a civilian between tours of duty at the University of California, Berkeley, where he completed his A.B. in political science in 1948 and an M.A. in the discipline in 1955. His thesis for the latter degree examined the parallels between magic and Marxism. In a 1970 conversation with Jacques Vall√©e (who was flummoxed by McMurtry's lengthy military career), McMurtry identified as a political liberal. He noted his opposition to Richard Nixon's Middle East policies and characterized himself as \\"a poet who happened to fight in two wars.\\" During World War II, especially when he was stationed in England in 1943 and the first half of 1944, McMurtry was able to meet with and become a personal student of Aleister Crowley, who elevated him to IX¬∞ of O.T.O., giving him the name Hymenaeus Alpha (which enumerates to 777) in November 1943. In September and November 1944 (and once again in June 1947), he received letters from Crowley referring to him as Crowley's \\"Caliph\\" (or successor). When McMurtry returned to California after the war he was appointed Crowley's O.T.O. representative in the United States (April 1946), subject only to the authority of Crowley's viceroy and heir apparent, Karl Germer. Crowley died in December 1947, and Germer was recognized as the head of O.T.O. At the time the only functioning Thelemic O.T.O. body in the world was Agape Lodge in Southern California, which was headed for a time by McMurtry's friend Jack Parsons. McMurtry planned to start a lodge in Northern California, but his deteriorating relationship with Karl Germer (based on Germer's refusal to initiate new members) put an end to his plans. He tried to organize other O.T.O. members in California to lobby Germer to change his policy, but the situation came to a head at a meeting in 1959 in which Dr. Gabriel Montenegro (Germer's representative) \\"ordered\\" McMurtry to cease his efforts. This order was reiterated in writing in November 1960. McMurtry unwillingly complied with the order, and he was disillusioned enough by this turn of events that he ended his direct involvement with O.T.O. In 1961 he moved to Washington, D.C., where he soon became completely out of touch with other O.T.O. members. Re-establishing O.T.O. On October 25, 1962 Germer died from prostatic cancer at the age of 77, without naming a successor as head of O.T.O. His widow, who was not a member of O.T.O., retained material possession of the O.T.O.'s extensive archives. Though individual members carried on with their spiritual activities, the central organization, for all intents and purposes, ceased to function. There were a few individuals, notably Kenneth Grant of Britain, Hermann Metzger of Switzerland, and later, Marcelo Ramos Motta of Brazil, who claimed succession to Germer. McMurtry was unaware of any of these developments until 1968, when he received a letter from Phyllis Seckler, a fellow Agape Lodge O.T.O. initiate. Seckler's letter was to inform McMurtry that the archives in Germer's widow's care (including Aleister Crowley's library) had been burglarized the previous year by persons unknown. When he became aware of the situation he decided to take charge of what remained of O.T.O. In 1969 he left his job at the United States Department of Labor and returned to California to investigate the burglary. Though the crime was never officially solved, McMurtry felt that it had probably been carried out by a group, falsely claiming affiliation with O.T.O., that called itself the \\"Solar Lodge\\". McMurtry had moved into Seckler's home in Dublin, California, and soon they were married. At this time, McMurtry decided to restore the Order by invoking his emergency orders from Crowley which gave him authority (subject to Karl Germer's approval) to \\"take charge of the whole work of the Order in California to reform the Organization\\", and he assumed the title \\"Caliph of O.T.O.,\\" as specified in Crowley's letters to McMurtry from the 1940s. His witnesses were Dr. Israel Regardie (1907‚Äì1985) and Gerald Yorke, who both offered their support. Along with Seckler and two other surviving members, Mildred Burlingame and Helen Parsons Smith, he slowly began performing O.T.O. initiations again. They also eventually succeeded in their efforts to find a publisher for the Thoth tarot deck designed by Aleister Crowley. O.T.O. was registered with the State of California on December 28, 1971 as a legal organization. In 1974 McMurtry and Seckler separated, and he moved to Berkeley, California. Germer's widow died in 1975, and in 1976 the surviving members of O.T.O. were enabled by court order to claim the still considerable archives. In October 1977 McMurtry founded Thelema Lodge in Berkeley to serve as the headquarters of his resuscitated O.T.O. Many initiations were performed, and a weekly celebration of the Gnostic Mass was soon established in the San Francisco Bay area. McMurtry, and other initiators chartered by him, established O.T.O. groups in many other areas in the United States and internationally. By 1985 O.T.O., by its own report, had more than seven hundred members in several different countries. In that year McMurtry, in failing health, successfully sued Motta in United States district court over the possession of the O.T.O. trademarks and copyrights. He died in a Martinez, California convalescent hospital on the day that the U.S. court clerk released the text of the decision that set the seal on McMurtry's efforts to reestablish O.T.O. Since then O.T.O. had, by its own report, grown to over three thousand members in more than forty countries, although numbers have declined significantly over the last decade.

Owned and operated by Cogeco, it broadcasts on 104.7 MHz from facilities in the Chemin des Terres neighbourhood of Gatineau, while its transmitter is located in Camp Fortune. The station identifies itself as \\"104,7 FM\\". History The station originally began broadcasting in 1968 as CJRC, on 1150 kHz with a daytime power of 50,000 watts and a nighttime power of 5,000 watts as a class B station, using a directional antenna with slightly different daytime and nighttime directional patterns in order to protect various other stations on that frequency ‚Äì particularly CKOC in Hamilton. The station was launched on June 3, 1968 by Raymond Crepeau, Marcel Joyal, Robert Campeau and Gerard Moreau with the presence of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the former prime minister of Canada as part of the Radiomutuel network. Originally its headquarters were at the Sparks Street Mall in Ottawa but were later moved in the old city of Gatineau in the 1980s after a stay on Belfast Road in Ottawa. It became part of the Radiom√©dia network (later known as Corus Qu√©bec) on September 30, 1994, after Radiomutuel merged with T√©l√©m√©dia (that network's Gatineau station, CKCH, was closed down).

Even after falling out from mainstream favour and chart success, which some say is because of the 1984 video for \\"Rock Me Tonite\\", Squier has maintained his presence on rock radio and attracted a following during the last decades, with his music used in many films and video games. Squier stepped out of music business after the release of his 1993 release Tell the Truth, but he has occasionally continued performing smaller tours and one-off performances. His 1980 song \\"The Big Beat\\" contains one of the most sampled drum breaks, used by artists such as Run-DMC, Alicia Keys, Jay-Z, UTFO, and Dizzee Rascal. \\"The Stroke\\" has also had a fair amount of sampling, most notably in Eminem's 2013 hit \\"Berzerk\\". Career = Early life and first bands (1950-1974) = Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano for two years. Afterwards, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as another story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14. Squier's first public performances were at a Boston nightclub in Kenmore Square called the Psychedelic Supermarket in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band Cream. This encouraged him to take music more seriously and formed the band Magic Terry & the Universe with a school friend. In the early 1970s, Squier tried out with various short-lived bands, beginning with The Kicks alongside future New York Dolls drummer Jerry Nolan. Squier also briefly attended Berklee College of Music in 1971. Squier was desiring to become a teacher, but he ended up moving to New York to form a band named The Sidewinders, which likewise lasted only couple years. = Piper and solo career startoff (1975-1980) = In the mid 1970s, Squier encountered first real experience with the music industry after striking a record deal with his brand new band Piper, which went on to release two studio records, Piper and Can't Wait. The band was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled, Circus Magazine touted it as \\"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\\". Piper was managed by the same management company as Kiss and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's Madison Square Garden. Squier served both as the main songwriter and frontman of the group. Despite receiving considerable success at the local rock scene, Piper broke up. Squier signed a solo deal with Capitol Records in 1979 and started working on his solo debut The Tale of the Tape, which was released in spring 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on Billboard's album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \\"You Should Be High Love\\" and \\"The Big Beat\\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. Along with Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar and Mark Clarke (who has previously had short jobs in Uriah Heep and Rainbow) on bass. = Commercial success: Don't Say No and Emotions in Motion (1981-1983) = Following a small but fairly successful summer tour with Alice Cooper in 1980, Squier got in contact with Queen guitarist Brian May and proposed him to produce his next album. Due to scheduling conflicts, May declined, but he recommended Reinhold Mack, who had produced Queen's most recent album The Game. Squier and Mack joined forces to produce Don't Say No, which earned rave reviews and spawned three hit singles, catapulting him to stardom. The first, \\"The Stroke,\\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well as charting high in Canada and even in Britain, where the song remains his only chart entry. \\"In the Dark\\" and \\"My Kinda Lover\\" were successful follow-ups. The album also featured \\"Lonely Is the Night\\", which became a radio favorite and one of his signature songs, despite not being released as a single (however, in Britain, it was featured as the B-side for \\"In the Dark\\"). Squier was also popular on the new MTV cable channel, where his straightforward performance-based videos received heavy rotation. Don't Say No peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling over 4 million copies in the US alone. Retrospectively, Don't Say No is hailed as Squier's best solo album and one of the greatest rock albums of the 1980s. Squier was known for being a perfectionist and short-tempered at producers sometimes. He ended his partnership with Mack after disagreements between the two escalated because of artistic differences. Despite the problems, Squier's third album Emotions In Motion was released in 1982 and became very successful - though in the long run, it didn't catch its predecessor in sales. Nevertheless, the album hit #5 in both US and Canada, sold approximately 3 million copies and spawned the successful radio and video hits \\"Emotions in Motion\\" and \\"Everybody Wants You\\". The latter is notable for being Squier's first #1 on the Mainstream Rock chart and holding the place for six weeks straight, more than any other number one in 1982. During the tour for Emotions in Motion, Squier and his band served as openers for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 Hot Space Tour and later, he finally became a headliner act for the first time, ascending into the heavyweight of early 1980s hard rock. British newcomer Def Leppard supported him and he helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their breakthrough album Pyromania. = Career pinnacle and downfall: Jim Steinman joins in for Signs of Life (1984) = Squier began writing songs for his fourth album Signs of Life in late 1983 after finishing his first headlining arena tour. In need of as perfect \\"extra set of ears\\" as possible, he planned Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange - the man behind Def Leppard's wildly successful Pyromania - to produce the product. However, Lange was already reserved by The Cars and suffered a breakdown afterward, which prompted him to withdraw completely from the project and Squier to hire a new co-producer just a few days before the sessions were set to start. He then brought in famed songwriter and producer Jim Steinman, who was better known for his grandiose ballads and operatic rock n' roll songs as well as some of the biggest pop hits of early 80s. Both Squier's older fans and the music press reacted demurely to the Squier-Steinman team up, but since Squier admired Steinman's work on Meat Loaf's Bat Out of Hell - which he had described as \\"the most passionate and exciting rock record of our time\\" - and Steinman himself was willing to work again with a rock band, Squier stuck with him. Steinman showed great enthusiasm for the project and he got well along with Squier and his band, despite his role in the studio being significantly smaller than usually. The resulting album was a departure from Squier's typical guitar-heavy hard rock into a more keyboard oriented style, with hints of Steinman's wagnerian producing approach. At the time Signs of Life finally arrived in late July 1984, Squier was at the very peak of his career. Fueled by successful radio hits, bluesy synthpop cut \\"Rock Me Tonite\\" and futuristic hard rocker \\"All Night Long\\", the album brought him his third consecutive platinum certification. However, Squier's fortunes took a sudden hit with the music video for \\"Rock Me Tonite\\", which dominantly featured Squier dancing around in a dark bedroom with a pink tanktop. The image presented didn't conform to standard gender roles or expectations of masculinity at the time and was a perceived challenge to Squier‚Äôs image as a guitar-playing rocker. The video began almost immediately attracting increasingly embarrassed and negative responses from critics, fans, fellow musicians and Squier himself alike, who described it as \\"diabolical\\". It has been later cited as one of the worst music videos of all time and as an infamous example of the phrase \\"video killed the radio star\\". Squier's album and ticket sales took damage; Signs of Life ended up stalling at #11 on the Billboard 200 and he stopped selling out shows. Squier lost his patience: he fired both of his managers and insulted the video's director, Kenny Ortega, for misleading and deceiving him. Whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed the overall commercial appeal of Signs of Life, let alone both the video and the song \\"Rock Me Tonite\\", made him look like a sellout for the most of his fans. = Brief resurgence and feud with Capitol: From Enough Is Enough to Tell the Truth (1985-1993) = Apart from a few live appearances and a new song, \\"Shake Down\\" for the soundtrack of the film St. Elmo's Fire, Squier stayed out of the spotlight for the majority of 1985, taking some time off and preparing his next album with British producer Peter Collins, who was known for his work with Nik Kershaw, Gary Moore and Rush. 1986 saw the release of his fifth album Enough Is Enough, which was carefully crafted but still a commercial flop. The album spawned a minor hit, \\"Love Is the Hero\\", which featured Freddie Mercury on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \\"Lady With a Tenor Sax\\", which also appears on the album. Enough Is Enough sold an estimated 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. While the album was greeted with mostly warm reviews, many noted the lack of a clear hit and its amount of filler songs, though \\"Love Is the Hero\\" has usually been singled out for praise. Squier did not embark on a tour in support of the album. Squier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length Hear & Now, which was finally released in 1989, after going through various delays. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than Enough Is Enough and is often regarded as one of the most consistent inputs of Squier's career by both fans and critics. It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \\"Don't Say You Love Me\\", which peaked at #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. It was his best charting single on both charts since 1984's \\"Rock Me Tonite\\". Other notable tracks also included on the album are Squier's attempt on a late 80s power ballad, in the form of \\"Don't Let Me Go\\", as well as two Desmond Child collaborations \\"Stronger\\" and \\"Tied Up\\". All in all, the album did briefly restore Squier's success by returning to his early 1980s hard rock style and reached gold in US, being his last album to receive a certification. \\"Don't Say You Love Me\\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's well received promotional tour, entitled All Excess, returned him on stages after almost five years of absence from touring. However, despite quite promising comeback chances, Squier wasn't able to pull off a notable return after the turn of the decade. In fact, the success of Hear & Now managed to just slow his ongoing popularity waning. Squier continued making music into the 1990s and released his seventh album, Creatures of Habit, in 1991. Both critical and audience reception were mixed; many criticized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. Some also found the album's polished sound somewhat outdated, since at the time of the album's release, alternative rock and especially grunge began ruling the rock scene. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since Tale of the Tape. However, it did feature notable radio hits, \\"She Goes Down\\" and \\"Facts of Life\\". The former stands as Squier's last Top 5 hit on Mainstream Rock charts and his highest charting radio single of the 1990s. Creatures of Habit was supported with a tour, his last bigger one for a decade. In the middle of grunge's heyday in 1993, Squier released his final album with Capitol Records, Tell the Truth, which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to Don't Say No, Capitol did little to nothing to promote it, which ended up becoming his first album not to chart at all and selling only an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, Squier walked away from the label and music business for good. However, the album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and some have described it as his finest outputs. The album's opening track \\"Angry\\" was a moderate hit on the Mainstream Rock charts. = Later career (1994-) = In 1994, Squier's original screenplay Run To Daylight was short-listed at the Sundance Film Festival. The film itself was never produced. On February 17, 1998, during the initial run of Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God - a monodrama about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \\"I Have Watched You Fly\\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \\"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\\" That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped-down acoustic blues effort entitled Happy Blue. The album was both stylistically and also sonically a great departure from his typical hard rock sound, with the only musician playing on the album being Squier himself accompanied by acoustic guitar with no overdubs. For this album, Squier reworked his hit song \\"The Stroke\\" into an old-fashioned blues number, \\"Stroke Me Blues\\". The year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of Don't Say No. In the same year, Squier embarked on a concert tour that was his first bigger one since the 1991 tour for Creatures of Habit. In 2004, \\"Everybody Wants You\\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \\"Emerge\\" and included on the Queer Eye for the Straight Guy soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined Richard Marx, Edgar Winter, Rod Argent, Hamish Stuart, and Sheila E touring with Ringo Starr & His All- Starr Band. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Ronnie Spector, Mitch Ryder, Tone Loc, Deniece Williams, Dr. Hook, and Tom Cochrane. In 2008, Squier joined Colin Hay, Edgar Winter, Gary Wright, Hamish Stuart and Gregg Bissonette touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon. Squier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \\"Everybody Wants You,\\" \\"Nobody Knows,\\" \\"Learn How to Live,\\" \\"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \\"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\\" In May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to James Cotton including Magic Dick (J. Geils Band), the James Montgomery Band, Jon Butcher, Sib Hashian (Boston), Michael Carabello (Santana), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton. Squier accepted Cotton's invitation in June to join him at the \\"James Cotton's Blues Summit\\" at Lincoln Center in NYC, along with the legendary Pinetop Perkins, Hubert Sumlin (Howlin' Wolf's band), Taj Mahal and many more. In November, Squier appeared at the Iridium in New York and played a double set that night, \\"Blues Deluxe,\\" that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits. Shout! Factory released Don't Say No: 30th Anniversary Edition on July 27, 2010, marking the first time that this album had been remastered in over 20 years. It was released in collaboration with Squier, who provided two live bonus cuts from his personal collection. Also in that same year, all his albums except Tell the Truth and Happy Blue, became available on digital and streaming. Later on, Tell the Truth joined in 2014 and Happy Blue in 2020. In October 2011, Squier performed at the third annual \\"Right to Rock\\" Celebration at the Edison Ballroom in New York (including Steven van Zandt and Lady Gaga) in support of the Little Kids Rock charity and performed \\"Lonely Is The Night\\" with a group of Jersey City students. In May 2012, Squier joined the Li'l Band O' Gold for several shows at the New Orleans Jazzfest. During Memorial Day weekend, Squier made a surprise appearance at the John Varvatos store in Easthampton, NY in support of his friend, rock photographer Rob Shanahan and his new book, \\"Volume One.\\" In June, Squier performed at the \\"Industrial Hedgefund Awards Dinner\\" in New York, in another fundraising effort for 'Little Kids Rock.' In September, Squier appeared as a guest during the set of the James Montgomery Band at the Westport Blues Festival. In December, Squier headlined a fund-raising concert for \\"The American Revolution,\\" a documentary on legendary rock FM station WBCN at the House Of Blues in Boston. In the summer of 2013, Squier performed his 'Electric Man' show at the Patchogue Music Festival on Long Island. In November, he played the Voodoo Festival in New Orleans. The Stooges, a local brass band (not to be confused with Iggy Pop's band), joined Squier on \\"The Stroke.\\" At the same time, Eminem released 'Berzerk' which makes use of various samples from \\"The Stroke.\\" Later, on his 2014 effort, \\"Shady XV,\\" he sampled \\"My Kinda Lover.\\" In September 2014, Squier took his 'Electric Man' show to the 9th Jack Show in Anaheim, California. Personal life In 2002, Squier married Nicole Schoen, a professional German soccer player. They divided their time between a home in Bridgehampton, Long Island and an apartment in The San Remo on Central Park West in Manhattan, New York City. Squier had been, as of 2016, an active volunteer for the Central Park Conservancy for more than 17 years, physically maintaining 20 acres (81,000 m2) of the park, as well as promoting the Conservancy in articles and interviews. He also supported the Group for the East End and its native planting programs on eastern Long Island.

Name  The river, along with the more northern Whanganui River, gives its name to the Manawat≈´-Whanganui region. The name of the river was given by the tohunga Haupipi-a-Nanaia, a descendant of Haunui-a-paparangi. Haupipi-a-Nanaia or Hau, travelled down the west coast in pursuit of his wife Wairaka, who had eloped. When Hau reached what is now known as the Manawat≈´ River, he is said to have stopped and clutched his chest, horrified at the prospect of crossing so mighty an expanse of water. Therefore the river's name comes from the MƒÅori words manawa (heart) and t≈´ (stand still). In this context, when said together, the interpretation is ‚Äòheart standing still‚Äô to represent how Hau felt when he first saw the river. However cross he did, and a few kilometres south of Paekakariki, Hau overtook the fugitives and changed Wairaka into a rock.Reed, A.W. (1996) The Reed Dictionary of MƒÅori Place Names, Te Papakupu Ingoa WƒÅhi MƒÅori a Reed (3rd Ed) Reed Publishing: Auckland, New Zealand Geography The Manawat≈´ River has its headwaters northwest of Norsewood, on the eastern slopes of the Ruahine Range on the North Island of New Zealand. It flows initially eastward before turning south-west near Ormondville, flowing before turning north-west near Woodville. At this point it enters the Manawatu Gorge, between the Ruahine and Tararua Ranges. Beyond the gorge it joins with the Pohangina River at Ashhurst and turns south-west, flowing through the city of Palmerston North. At this stage the river is still flowing swiftly and carrying gravel from the mountains. After Opiki, it slows and has a lower gradient, meandering over the Manawatu Plains; its bed at this point is mud and silty sand. In its meandering and frequent shifting of course it has created oxbow lakes, lagoons, and swamps. Sediment deposited along its course has created levees, higher than the surrounding plain; when the river is in flood it overflows these and creates wetlands. The Manawat≈´ reaches the Tasman Sea at Foxton Beach, on the west coast of the North Island, creating the Manawatu Estuary. Major tributaries of the river include the Makakahi, Mangahao, Pohangina and Oroua Rivers. The Manawat≈´'s total length is , making it only the 12th-longest in the country, but at it is one of New Zealand's greatest rivers in terms of flow, and second only to the Waikato River among North Island rivers. = Bridges = The river is crossed by 18 road, 3 rail bridges and He Ara Kotahi walk/cycleway. The lowest and longest, Whirokino Trestle and Manawat≈´ River Bridge, carry SH1 over the Moutoa Floodway and over the river. It replaced the 1938 and 1942 bridges in February 2020, at a cost of $70m.  Geology  The Manawat≈´ is unique among New Zealand rivers in that it crosses a mountain range. The river has formed a \\"water gap\\" across the mountains because it is older than the Ruahine and Tararua Ranges. Most rivers arise from an already-existing range of mountains or hills, but beginning about 3 million years ago the central North Island mountain ranges began to uplift across the Manawat≈´'s current course. Because it drained a large catchment, the river had sufficient flow to keep pace with and erode the rising mountains, eventually forming the Manawat≈´ Gorge; other rivers were unable to and were diverted into the Manawat≈´ instead. After exiting the Manawat≈´ Gorge, the river carries rock and sediment down from the mountains. During glacial times, with the prevalence of ice, snow, and bare mountains, this erosion increases and forms a stony elevated terrace. During an interglacial, while the mountains are forested, gravel outwash is reduced and the river cuts down into the terrace, forming a gorge. This cycle has created four distinct terraces between the Manawat≈´ Gorge and Palmerston North. The Manawat≈´ Plain was seabed 5 to 6 million years ago, and as it was raised above water by the action of the Australian and Pacific Plates it buckled, forming five long and low ridges (or anticlines) parallel to the mountains, which impede the flow of the Manawat≈´, Rangitikei, and Oroua Rivers, forcing them to flow southwest rather than directly into the Tasman Sea.  Vegetation  At the time of human arrival, the Manawat≈´ Plains were covered with forest. Towards the foothills and the Manawat≈´ Gorge grew black beech, turning into tawa forest at lower altitudes. Along the plains and terraces the forest was mixed podocarp and t≈çtara, changing to mixed tawa, tƒ´toki, and mƒÅhoe in the sand dunes. Across the flood plain of the Manawat≈´ and on the low-lying land bordering the river, the predominant vegetation was semi-swamp forest, mostly kahikatea and pukatea. Three major swamps bordered the Manawat≈´: Moutoa Swamp north of the river, towards the mouth, known as the \\"Great Swamp\\" in the 19th century; Makerua Swamp further inland, to the south of the Manawat≈´ and north of the Tokomaru River, which covered 22000 acres; and Taonui Swamp on the north side of the river. The main vegetation in the swamps was harakeke and raup≈ç: harakeke in the drier parts, raup≈ç in the wetter. The Manawatu river mouth and estuary was listed under the Ramsar Convention as a Wetland of International Importance in 2005.  Flooding  The Manawat≈´ River flooded in February 2004, displacing over 3000 people (primarily from Marton and Feilding) and damaging over 1000 Manawat≈´ farms. The cost of the flood in terms of insurance payouts was NZ$122 million. Further damage was prevented by the opening of the Moutoa floodgates, which intercept the river between Foxton and Shannon. Water quality In 2018 a case study on water quality in the Manawat≈´-Whanganui region was jointly commissioned by Horizons Regional Council and the Ministry for the Environment, the study was conducted by Land Water People (LWP) and the results were reviewed by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) and StatsNZ. Results showed that water quality for sediment and E. coli have improved over the past seven to ten years in the Manawat≈´-Whanganui region. The report found strong statistical evidence of a connection between regional scale water quality improvements and local scale interventions. In 2006 Fonterra were criticised for an application to discharge of wastewater into the Manawat≈´ River. In 2009, the Cawthron Institute found that the river had the highest gross primary production (GPP) compared to 300 rivers and streams in the Western world. High GPP rates are an indication of poor ecological health and can lead to various environmental issues. In 2011, the Horizons Regional Council laid blame with the Palmerston North City Council for \\"considerable\\" and \\"sustained\\" breaches of one of its discharge consents, and some degree of non-compliance with two others. A report by the Ministry for the Environment ranked 76 New Zealand sites for water clarity and E. coli levels. Using those measures, they found four other New Zealand rivers rate worse than the Manawat≈´ (the Waitara, Whanganui, Waipa and Rangitikei).

Nussbaum‚Äôs work gives a rare glimpse into the essence of one person among the victims of the Holocaust.  Early life and education  Nussbaum was born in Osnabr√ºck, Germany, as the son of Rahel and Philipp Nussbaum. Philipp was a World War I veteran and German patriot before the rise of the Nazis. He was an amateur painter when he was younger, but was forced to pursue other means of work for financial reasons. He therefore encouraged his son‚Äôs artwork passionately. Nussbaum was a lifelong student, beginning his formal studies in 1920 in Hamburg and Berlin, and continuing as long as the contemporary political situation allowed him. In his earlier works, Nussbaum was heavily influenced by Vincent van Gogh and Henri Rousseau and he eventually paid homage to Giorgio de Chirico and Carlo Carr√† as well. Karl Hofer‚Äôs expressionist painting influenced Felix‚Äôs careful approach to color. In 1933, Nussbaum was studying under a scholarship in Rome at the Berlin Academy of the Arts when the Nazis gained control of Germany. Adolf Hitler sent his Minister of Propaganda to Rome in April to explain to the artist elites how a Nazi artist was to develop, which entailed promoting heroism and the Aryan race. Nussbaum realised at this point that, as a Jew, he could not remain at the academy.  Deportation to death camps  Plaque in front of former residence in Berlin-Wilmersdorf The next decade of Nussbaum's life was characterised by fear, which is reflected in his artwork. In 1934 he took , a painter whom he had met while studying in Berlin and would later marry during their exile in Brussels in 1937, to meet his parents in Switzerland. Felix's parents eventually grew homesick for Germany and, against his fierce objections,Felix Nussbaum at www1.yadvashem.org they returned. This was the last time Felix would see his mother and father ‚Äî the source of his spiritual and financial support. Felix and Felka would spend the next ten years in exile, mostly in Belgium, a period of emotional and artistic isolation for him but also one of the most artistically productive times in his life. After Nazi Germany attacked Belgium in 1940, Nussbaum was arrested by Belgian police as a \\"hostile alien\\" German, and was subsequently taken to the Saint-Cyprien camp in France. The desperate circumstances in the camp influenced his pictures of that time. He eventually signed a request to the French camp authorities to be returned to Germany. On the train ride from Saint Cyprien to Germany, he managed to escape and rendezvous with Felka in Brussels, and they began a life in hiding. Without residency papers, Nussbaum had no way of earning an income, but friends provided him with shelter and art supplies so that he could continue his craft. The darkness of the next four years of his life can be seen in the expression of his artwork from that period. 1944 was the year in which the plans of Nazi Germany had the greatest impact on the Nussbaum family. Philipp and Rahel Nussbaum were killed at Auschwitz in February. In July, Nussbaum and his wife were found hiding in an attic by German armed forces. They were arrested, sent to the Mechelen transit camp and given the numbers XXVI/284 and XXVI/285. On August 2 they arrived at Auschwitz, and a week later Felix was murdered at the age of 39. On September 3, Nussbaum‚Äôs brother was sent to Auschwitz, and on September 6 his sister-in-law and niece were also murdered there. In December, his brother ‚Äì the last of the family ‚Äì died from exhaustion in the camp at Stutthof. Within one year, the entire Nussbaum family had been murdered. Major works In this time period, Nussbaum created two of his best-known works: Self Portrait with Jewish Identity Card (1943), and Triumph of Death (1944). = Triumph of Death = Triumph of Death shows Nussbaum's attention to detail. According to his biography, Felix Nussbaum: Art Defamed; Art in Exile; Art in Resistance, the crumpled music score has the first several bars of \\"The Lambeth Walk\\", a popular song from the musical Me and My Girl. The words that would normally accompany the music are \\"Ev'rythin' free and easy / Do as you darn well please\\".

The station is owned by RNC Media, as part of a twinstick with Noovo affiliate CFGS-DT (channel 34). The two stations share studios on Rue Jean Proulx and Rue Buteau in the former city of Hull; CHOT-DT's transmitter is located at Camp Fortune in Chelsea, Quebec. This station can also be seen on Vid√©otron channel 4 and in high definition channel 604 in Gatineau, and on Rogers Cable on channel 10 and digital channel 610 and in high definition on digital channel 611 in Ottawa. CHOT-DT is the largest TVA station that is not owned- and-operated by the network. It is also the largest major network affiliate in Canada in a media market that is not owned by its associated network. History From 1974 to 1977, the Ottawa‚ÄìHull area received TVA programming from CFVO-TV (channel 30), which was the first French-language commercial station in the National Capital Region. CFVO was cooperatively owned and constantly struggled financially. After its March 1977 closure, Radio-Qu√©bec bought the channel 30 physical plant directly from CFVO's creditors. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) then invited bids for a new French-language commercial station to be affiliated with TVA and operate on channel 40. Though as many as four bids were rumoured to be incoming for the TVA affiliate, the CRTC only received two, from T√©l√©- M√©tropole (owner of TVA flagship station CFTM in Montreal) and Radio-Nord. The CRTC selected the application from Radio-Nord in December; CHOT, known as \\"T√©l√©-Outaouais\\", began operations on October 27, 1978. Pierre Thibault, who had been a temporary manager for CFVO late in the station's life, served as its first general manager. For a time until the late 1990s, CHOT was branded as CHOT 40, referring to the station's channel number over the air. CHOT was one of the last television stations in Canada to use its over-the-air channel number in station branding. It is currently branded as TVA Gatineau-Ottawa. Cable distribution The station is carried on channel 4 by Vid√©otron in Gatineau and on channel 10 by Rogers Cable in Ottawa. CHOT is also carried by most of EastLink's cable systems in Northeastern Ontario, one of the only regions in English Canada that carries an affiliate station instead of the national feed of CFTM-DT. It has been available on cable in this region since the early 1980s, long before TVA carriage was mandated nationwide. Predecessor companies Northern Cable and Persona picked up CHOT due to the area's large Franco-Ontarian population, and continued to carry CHOT rather than switching providers. News operation Former logo, used from the early 2000s until November 2012 TVA Nouvelles broadcasts a 30-minute local newscast every weekday at 6:00 pm, and, as of 2019, a 17-minute local newscast at 12:13 pm. In the past, CHOT had local news on weekends and a 15-minute noon newscast on weekdays, but recent cuts made by RNC Media had these newscasts replaced with Montreal-based TVA network news programs. Digital television and high definition After the analog television shutdown and digital conversion, which took place on August 31, 2011, CHOT-TV flashcut to digital maintaining operations on UHF channel 40. As part of the UHF spectrum repack, CHOT-DT was required to move broadcast frequencies by July 2020. CHOT-DT moved to UHF Channel 32 in July 2020, however through the use of PSIP, CHOT-DT continues to display as 40.1 References External links *TVA Gatineau-Ottawa  HOT HOT Category:Television channels and stations established in 1978 HOT Category:1978 establishments in Quebec ","title":"CHOT-DT"},{"id":"1261949","title":"Phunphin District"},{"id":"1261950","text":"Cangjie hints and Bopomofo symbols respectively.) Dayi (, literally \\"big easy\\") is a system for entering Chinese characters on a standard QWERTY keyboard using a set of 46 character components. A character is built by combining up to four of the 46 characters (the other six are provided for typing Taiwanese addresses), using a system similar to that of Cangjie, but is decomposed in stroke order instead of in geometric shape in Cangjie. On most keyboards in Taiwan, most keys show four symbols. On the keys, the Latin letters are in the upper left, Bopomofo symbols on the upper right, Cangjie symbols on the lower left, and Dayi symbols on the lower right. Layout Like Cangjie, every radical has some auxiliary shapes; but some of the auxiliary shapes of one radical originate from the mnemonic word of the radical. For example, key 6 is mapped to Ëªä(car) in the keyboard, its mnemonic word is \\"6ÁâáËªäÈñÄ\\"(six pieces of car door), and its auxiliary shapes include \\"Áâá\\"(piece), \\"Áàø\\"(old character for \\"wall\\", its shape is the reflection of \\"Áâá\\"), \\"Áî´\\"(its shape is like \\"Ëªä\\"), \\"ÈñÄ\\"(door), \\"È¨•\\"(to battle or to fight, its shape is like \\"ÈñÄ\\"). A QWERTY keyboard layout for the Dayi input method (annotated with hints and related/auxiliary radicals) A typical keyboard layout for Dayi method Methodology The following are rules of the Dayi input method: # Input is with accordance to Chinese writing stroke order: \\"top first, then bottom\\", \\"left first, then right\\". # For characters made of more than 4 symbols, enter the first three and the last symbol. For instance, \\"Â£Ω\\" (Â£´‰πõÂ∑•Âè£ÊâãËàü) is represented by just 4 symbols: Â£´‰πõÂ∑•Ëàü (FBR.). # For symmetrical characters, enter the center followed by either side. For instance, \\"Â∑´\\" is represented by Â∑•‰∫∫‰∫∫ (RAA). # \\"Ëáº\\" (W) is the wildcard key for the top part of words regardless of the contents: Examples: ÂÖí = ËáºÂÑø (WQ) Ëàá = Ëáº‰∏ÄÂÖ´ (WE8) Ë¶∫ = ËáºÂÜñÁõÆÂÑø (WM3Q) Sample Learning Technique One common frustration of learning any Chinese input method is not knowing the correct sequence of keys to enter. This problem can be alleviated with the help of an answer table. The following technique can be used to familiarize oneself with the Dayi keyboard layout. Speed and proficiency will develop with additional practice. This technique can be used with other input methods as well using similar lookup tables as answers. * Find a source of commonly used Chinese vocabulary to type. This can may be found on the Internet by usage frequency or HSK level. For Dayi, use the list of Chinese Traditional words. (Also see List of Commonly Used Characters in Modern Chinese) * Navigate to a lookup table to use as an answer key. For Dayi [with 4 keystrokes or less], dayin4.cin is publicly available on the Internet at various open-source repositories (see external links). * Using the annotated image of the Dayi keyboard layout, look for the radicals that make up the character. Enter them according to the methodology. * If the character is not successfully entered, search the answer table for the desired sequence of keystrokes. Try to understand why those keystrokes are used. Note that there may be more than one answer for conciseness. ÈÜ´ = ÂåöÁâõÂ§ßÈÖâ (R2V8), It can be condensed into ÂåöÈÖâ (R8) since it does not conflict with other words in the dictionary. * Repeat with roughly 150 words in the word list. * Repeat with roughly the next 150 word in the word list. If possible, this time avoid turning to the annotated layout of the Dayi keyboard. * After successful practice, about 300 items have been entered. The locations of many common radicals (such as Êó•‰∏ÄË®ÄÊú®Âúü) would be quite familiar. Comparison with other Chinese input methods The keyboard layout for the Dayi input method contains keys for many of the Kangxi radicals in its entirety. This means that a single keystroke accounts for the left half or right half of many Chinese characters. For instance, \\"Ëªä\\" in \\"Ëº∏\\" (6AJN) is represented by \\"6\\". This allows for characters to be represented by 4 keys or less. In comparison, in Cangjie, \\"Ëªä\\" in \\"Ëº∏\\" (JJOMN) is represented by \\"JJ\\" for \\"ÂçÅÂçÅ\\", thus requiring up to 5 keys per Chinese character. A user of Cangjie would require experience and attention to decomposition rules to notice that the \\"Áî∞\\" segments of the Kangxi radical are omitted. Unlike other input methods, Dayi's use of 46 character components instead of 26 happens to be its greatest impediment, because it makes typing digits and punctuation marks very inconvenient. Some supported operating systems Some operating systems that support the Dayi input method are: * Microsoft Windows 8/10 * Microsoft Windows 95/XP * Linux (via ibus-tables or similar) * Apple Macintosh (via openvanilla or similar) See also *Chinese input methods for computers *Keyboard layout *List of Commonly Used Characters in Modern Chinese *Cangjie input method References External links * dayi4.cin lookup table from the chinese-opendesktop project, https://github.com/chinese-opendesktop/cin- tables/blob/master/dayi4.cin Category:Han character input ","title":"Dayi method"},{"id":"1261966","text":"Penitente field at an altitude of approximately 6500 m on northern face of Ojos del Salado in summer of 2020 Volcanic Landscapes of the Central Andes. Shown are Nevado Ojos del Salado, Cerro El C√≥ndor, and Peinado, along the Argentina-Chile border. Astronaut photo from International Space Station, 2010 Nevado Ojos del Salado is an active stratovolcano in the Andes on the Argentina‚ÄìChile border and the highest active volcano in the world at . It is also the second highest mountain in both the Western Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere behind Aconcagua at approximately 7,000 meters (23,000 ft) and it is the highest in Chile. Nevado Ojos del Salado is translated to Snowy Salty Eyes describing it being very snowy in the winter and salty with many lakes. Due to its location near the Atacama Desert, the mountain has very dry conditions, with snow usually only remaining on the peak during winter, though heavy storms can cover the surrounding area with a few feet of snow even in summer. Despite the generally dry conditions, there is a permanent crater lake about in diameter at an elevation of on the eastern side of the mountain. This is most likely the highest lake of any kind in the world. The ascent of Ojos del Salado is mostly a hike except for the final section to the summit which is a difficult scramble that may require ropes. The first ascent was made in 1937 by Jan Alfred Szczepa≈Ñski and Justyn Wojsznis, members of a Polish expedition in the Andes. Its name, meaning roughly \\"Eyes of the Salty One\\" in Spanish, comes from the enormous deposits of salt that, in the form of lagoons or ‚Äúeyes‚Äù, appear in its glaciers. An international highway between Chile and Argentina runs north of the mountain.Carter 1957, p.242 Geology and geomorphology = Regional = Ojos del Salado along with several other high volcanoes such as El Muerto, El Solo, Nevado Incahuasi and Nevado Tres Cruces lies at the southern end of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes.Mpodozis, C and Kay, Suzanne and Gardeweg, M and Coira, B, 1996, p.539 Volcanic activity in the region commenced 26 million years ago in the Cordillera Claudio Gay, at the same time as the neighbouring Maricunga Belt volcanoes were active. Starting 18 million years ago, local subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate became increasingly shallower and this caused volcanism to shift from the Maricunga Belt to the Ojos del Salado region. The Paleozoic basement crops out only northwest of Nevado Tres Cruces. Other geologic units in the region are Oligocene sedimentary units and volcanic rocks ranging from Oligocene age to less than 1.5 million years old.Mpodozis, C and Kay, Suzanne and Gardeweg, M and Coira, B, 1996, p.541 The area is part of a tectonic boundary between a volcanically active region north of the boundary and a less volcanically active region south of the boundary, which is also characterized by geographical differences, e.g. the presence of transverse valleys.P. E. BAKER, O. GONZALEZ-FERRAN and D. C. REX, 1987 p.85 = Local = Ojos del Salado like other major neighbouring mountains is a complex of lava domes and lava flows, with the main summit surrounded by peripheral domes such as El Solo and El FraileMpodozis, C and Kay, Suzanne and Gardeweg, M and Coira, B, 1996, p.545 and many other lateral centres.Mpodozis, C and Kay, Suzanne and Gardeweg, M and Coira, B, 1996, p.546 Fumaroles are encountered at the summit of Ojos del Salado within a depression.P. E. BAKER, O. GONZALEZ-FERRAN and D. C. REX, 1987 p.90 Potassium-argon dating has yielded ages of 1.2 ¬± 0.3 million years ago and less than 1 million years ago from rocks north of Ojos del Salado.Mpodozis, C and Kay, Suzanne and Gardeweg, M and Coira, B, 1996, p.542 There are glaciers on the mountain, in the crater and in the form of penitentes which reach heights of . Other reports indicate the absence of glaciers on Ojos del Salado. Permafrost exists on the mountain and its melting nourishes several lakes; one lake fed by a creek lies at altitude. Ojos del Salado is an active volcano, but the question of whether it should be considered currently (or \\"historically\\") active is arguable. According to the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program, the most recent known eruption was about 1,300 years ago, with a large margin of uncertainty. However, there is also some evidence for a minor ash emission in 1993, which would definitely qualify the volcano as historically active. The presence of fumaroles high on the mountain and recent-looking lava flows, albeit of uncertain age, also argues in favor of a categorization as \\"active.\\" By these definitions, Ojos del Salado is the highest historically active volcano on Earth. If the older date is accepted, the title of \\"highest historically active volcano\\" might reside instead with the somewhat lower Llullaillaco volcano, which certainly has erupted in historic times (most recently in 1877) and is considered active. alt= =Composition= Salado's rock is predominantly potassium-rich dacite and rhyodacite. Its lavas are high in biotite, hornblende, plagioclase, and opaques, with lower levels of augite, quartz, and hypersthene. Elevation The elevation of Ojos del Salado has been the subject of debate. The mountain is hidden behind other peaks and thus its height was not appreciated in early research until 1937, when the mountain was climbed by Polish climbers.Carter 1957, pp.240-241 A 2006 article in Andes Magazine offered that Ojos del Salado may be higher than Aconcagua, although the argument was premised on older, less accurate altitude surveys. The results of these older surveys assigned Ojos del Salado an elevation of , which would have made it nearly higher than Aconcagua. As early as 1955, an estimate was made that the elevation of Ojos del Salado was , but that was \\"simply [...] based on the altitude of the final camp, and the hours of ascent to the summit.\\"American Alpine Journal, 1956, p. 134; quoting the \\"Boletin Informativo No. 16\\" (June 1955) of the Argentine Associaci√≥n Tucumana de Andismo. In 1956, the first Chilean expedition led by the retired lieutenant Ren√© Gajardo measured the height of Ojos del Salado as with a pocket pressure altimeter. Apart from being an inexact method, the height shown by the altimeter was far too high as air pressure is generally lower in the afternoon, the time at which the team reached the summit. An expedition to the area in the 1990s claimed that nearby Monte Pissis was even higher than Ojos del Salado. Later measurements using more precise equipment showed that Ojos del Salado is about higher than Pissis. Furthermore, in 2007 a Chilean‚ÄìArgentine‚ÄìEuropean expedition organized by Andes Magazine and Azimut 360 performed a survey on both Ojos del Salado and Monte Pissis using more accurate instruments. It found the former to be and the latter Although this fits within recent handheld GPS surveys, which have estimated the mountain to be between and , the vertical error margin of the expedition's equipment, , leaves uncertainty as to the mountain's more precise altitude. A DGPS study from Phillipe Reuter in 2007, measured Ojos del Salado as 6,891.7 meters (SIRGAS). Ojos del Salado has two summits, one in Argentina and the other in Chile (the border between the two countries runs between the two summits). The difference in elevation of the two summits is less than Motorized partial ascent RMMV HX Ojos del Salado has been a popular mountain for attempts to attain the highest altitude aboard a land vehicle. alt= The previous long- standing record altitude for a four-wheeled vehicle was set on April 21, 2007 by the Chilean duo of Gonzalo Bravo G. and Eduardo Canales Moya. Reaching an altitude of 6,688 meters (21,942 ft.) with a modified Suzuki Samurai, the duo beat the previous record of 6,646 m which had been set on March 13, 2007 by German Matthias Jeschke in a Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon. Jeschke set the high altitude record for trucks reaching a height of 6,675 meters (21,899 ft) with a Mercedes-Benz Zetros truck on March 6, 2015. This is also a world record for a diesel-powered engine. On April 19, 2015 Chilean Gianfranco Bianchi reached an altitude of 6,472 m (21,233 ft) with a Suzuki RMZ 450, setting the altitude record for a motorcycle. On November 6, 2017, Matthias Jeschke, again, attempted to gain two world records, one for construction at altitude and the other by beating the then current 6,688 m record.Rheinmetall MAN High Altitude Truck Expedition A refuge hut was built at 6,100 m (a record), but on December 19 it was announced the altitude record attempt had been called off at a height of 6,150 m for a combination of factors including an insurmountable rock barrier and adverse weather conditions. On December 13, 2019, a 10-person team led once again by Matthias Jeschke finally succeeded in breaking long-standing record. They reached an altitude of 6,694 m (21,962 ft) in a modified Mercedes-Benz Unimog U 5023. It was part of an expedition to set up an emergency radio system on top of the volcano.

Rev: Five lines of ancient Hebrew script; reading \\"Yehochanan Kohen Gadol, Chever Hayehudim\\" (Yehochanan the High Priest, Council of the Jews. Map of the region in the 9th century BCE = Yehudi in the Hebrew Bible = According to the Book of Genesis, Judah (, Yehudah) was the name of the fourth son of the patriarch Jacob. During the Exodus, the name was given to the Tribe of Judah, descended from the patriarch Judah. After the conquest and settlement of the land of Canaan, Judah also referred to the territory allocated to the tribe. After the splitting of the united Kingdom of Israel, the name was used for the southern kingdom of Judah. The kingdom now encompassed the tribes of Judah, Benjamin and Simeon, along with some of the cities of the Levites. With the destruction of the northern kingdom of Israel (Samaria), the kingdom of Judah became the sole Jewish state and the term y'hudi () was applied to all Israelites. The term Yehudi () occurs 74 times in the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible. The plural, Yehudim () first appears in where it refers to a defeat for the Yehudi army or nation, and in , where it refers to the language of the Yehudim (). has the earliest singular usage of the word Yehudi. In , the name \\"Yehudi\\" () has a generic aspect, in this case referring to a man from the tribe of Benjamin: :\\"There was a man a Yehudi (Jewish man) in Shushan the capital, whose name was Mordecai the son of Jair the son of Shimei the son of Kish, a Benjamite; who had been exiled from Jerusalem with the exile that was exiled with Jeconiah, king of Judah, which Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had exiled.\\" The name appears in the Bible as a verb in which states: :\\"Many of the people of the land became Yehudim (in the generic sense) (, mityahadim) because the fear of the Yehudim fell on them.\\" In some places in the Talmud the word Israel(ite) refers to somebody who is Jewish but does not necessarily practice Judaism as a religion: \\"An Israel(ite) even though he has sinned is still an Israel(ite)\\" (Tractate Sanhedrin 44a). More commonly the Talmud uses the term Bnei Yisrael, i.e. \\"Children of Israel\\", (\\"Israel\\" being the name of the third patriarch Jacob, father of the sons that would form the twelve tribes of Israel, which he was given and took after wrestling with an angel, see Genesis 32:28-29http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK;=1&CHAPTER;=32) to refer to Jews. According to the Talmud then, there is no distinction between \\"religious Jews\\" and \\"secular Jews.\\" In modern Hebrew, the same word is still used to mean both Jews and Judeans (\\"of Judea\\").

Ioudaioi), which had lost the 'h' sound. The Latin term, following the Greek version, is Iudaeus, and from these sources the term passed to other European languages. The Old French giu, earlier juieu, had elided (dropped) the letter \\"d\\" from the Latin Iudaeus. The Middle English word Jew derives from Old English where the word is attested as early as 1000 in various forms, such as Iudeas, Gyu, Giu, Iuu, Iuw, Iew. The Old English name is derived from Old French. The modern French term is \\"juif\\". Most European languages have retained the letter \\"d\\" in the word for Jew. Etymological equivalents are in use in other languages, e.g., \\"Jude\\" in German, \\"judeu\\" in Portuguese, \\"j√∏de\\" in Danish and Norwegian, \\"jud√≠o\\" in Spanish, \\"jood\\" in Dutch, etc. In some languages, derivations of the word \\"Hebrew\\" are also in use to describe a Jew, e.g., Ebreo in Italian and Spanish, Ebri/Ebrani () in Persian and –ï–≤—Ä–µ–π, Yevrey in Russian. (See Jewish ethnonyms for a full overview.) The German word \\"Jude\\" is pronounced , the corresponding adjective \\"j√ºdisch\\" (Jewish), and is cognate with the Yiddish word for \\"Jew\\", \\"Yid\\".  Modern use  Yehud coin from the Persian era, with falcon or eagle and Aramaic inscription \\"◊ô◊î◊ì\\" \\"Yehud\\" (Judaea) In modern English, the term \\"Israelite\\" was used to refer to contemporary Jews as well as to Jews of antiquity until the mid-20th-century. Since the foundation of the State of Israel, it has become less common to use \\"Israelite\\" of Jews in general. Instead, citizens of the state of Israel, whether Jewish or not, are called \\"Israeli\\", while \\"Jew\\" is used as an ethno- religious designation. = Perception of offensiveness = The word Jew has been used often enough in a disparaging manner by antisemites that in the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was frequently avoided altogether, and the term Hebrew was substituted instead (e.g. Young Men's Hebrew Association). The word has become more often used in a neutral fashion, as it underwent a process known as reappropriation. Even today some people are wary of its use, and prefer to use \\"Jewish\\". Indeed, when used as an adjective (e.g. \\"Jew lawyer\\") or verb (e.g. \\"to jew someone\\"), the term Jew is purely pejorative. According to The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition (2000): > It is widely recognized that the attributive use of the noun Jew, in phrases > such as Jew lawyer or Jew ethics, is both vulgar and highly offensive. In > such contexts Jewish is the only acceptable possibility. Some people, > however, have become so wary of this construction that they have extended > the stigma to any use of Jew as a noun, a practice that carries risks of its > own. In a sentence such as There are now several Jews on the council, which > is unobjectionable, the substitution of a circumlocution like Jewish people > or persons of Jewish background may in itself cause offense for seeming to > imply that Jew has a negative connotation when used as a noun.

Although considered one self-identifying ethnicity, there are distinct ethnic subdivisions among Jews, most of which are primarily the result of geographic branching from an originating Israelite population, mixing with local communities, and subsequent independent evolutions. As long ago as Biblical times, cultural and linguistic differences between Jewish communities, even within the area of Ancient Israel and Judea, are observed both within the Bible and archeological remains. In more recent human history, an array of Jewish communities were established by Jewish settlers in various places around the Old World, often at great distances from one another, resulting in significant and often long-term isolation from each other. During the millennia of the Jewish diaspora, the communities would develop under the influence of their local environments; political, cultural, natural and demographic. Today, the manifestation of these differences among the Jews can be observed in Jewish cultural expressions of each community, including Jewish linguistic diversity, culinary preferences, liturgical practices, religious interpretations, and degrees and sources of genetic admixture. Historical background =Ancient Israel and Judah= The full extent of the cultural, linguistic, religious or other differences among the Israelites in antiquity is unknown. Following the defeat of the Kingdom of Israel in the 720s BCE and the Kingdom of Judah in 586 BCE, the Jewish people became dispersed throughout much of the Middle East and Africa, especially in Egypt and North Africa to the west, as well as in Yemen to the south, and in Mesopotamia to the east. The Jewish population in ancient Israel was severely reduced by the Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars and by the later hostile policies of the Christian emperors, against non-Christians, but the Jews always retained a presence in the Levant. Paul Johnson writes of this time: \\"Wherever towns survived, or urban communities sprang up, Jews would sooner or later establish themselves. The near-destruction of Palestinian Jewry in the second century turned the survivors of Jewish rural communities into marginal town-dwellers. After the Arab conquest in the seventh century, the large Jewish agricultural communities in Babylonia were progressively wrecked by high taxation, so that there too the Jews drifted into towns and became craftsmen, tradesmen, and dealers. Everywhere these urban Jews, the vast majority literate and numerate, managed to settle, unless penal laws or physical violence made it impossible.\\" Jewish ethnic divisions map Jewish communities continued to exist in Palestine in relatively small numbers: during the early Byzantine 6th century there were 43 communities; during the Islamic period and the intervening Crusades there were 50 (including Jerusalem, Tiberias, Ramleh, Ashkelon, Caesarea, and Gaza); and during the early Ottoman 14th century there were 30 (including Haifa, Shechem, Hebron, Ramleh, Jaffa, Gaza, Jerusalem, and Safed). The majority of the Jewish population during the High Middle Ages lived in Iberia (what is now Spain and Portugal) and in the region of Mesopotamia and Persia (what is now Iran and Iraq), the former known as the Sefardim and the latter known as the Mizrahim. A substantial population existed also in central Europe, the so- called Ashkenazim. Following the expulsion of Sephardim from Iberia during the 15th century, a mass migration into the Ottoman Empire swelled the size of many eastern communities including those in Palestine; the town of Safed reached 30,000 Jews by end of the 16th century. The 16th century saw many Ashkenazi Kabbalists drawn to the mystical aura and teachings of the Jewish holy city. Johnson notes that in the Arab-Muslim territories, which included most of Spain, all of North Africa, and the Near East south of Anatolia in the Middle Ages, the Jewish condition was easier as a rule, than it was in Europe. Over the centuries following the Crusades and Inquisition, Jews from around the world began emigrating in increasing numbers. Upon arrival, these Jews adopted the customs of the Mizrahi and Sephardi communities into which they moved. =Diaspora= Painting of a Jewish man from the Ottoman Empire, 1779 Following the failure of the second revolt against the Romans and the exile, Jewish communities could be found in nearly every notable center throughout the Roman Empire, as well as scattered communities found in centers beyond the Empire's borders in northern Europe, in eastern Europe, in southwestern Asia, and in Africa. Farther to the east along trade routes, Jewish communities could be found throughout Persia and in empires even farther east including in India and China. In the Early Middle Ages of the 6th to 11th centuries, the Radhanites traded along the overland routes between Europe and Asia earlier established by the Romans, dominated trade between the Christian and the Islamic worlds, and used a trade network that covered most areas of Jewish settlement. In the middle Byzantine period, the khan of Khazaria in the northern Caucasus and his court converted to Judaism, partly in order to maintain neutrality between Christian Byzantium and the Islamic world. This event forms the framework for Yehuda Halevi's work The Kuzari (c.1140), but how much the traces of Judaism within this group survived the collapse of the Khazar empire is a matter of scholarly debate. Arthur Koestler, in his book The Thirteenth Tribe (1976), and more recently Shlomo Sand in his book The Invention of the Jewish People (2008) have recently (controversially) theorized that East-European Jews are more ethnically Khazar than they are Semitic.Goldstein, Evan R. \\"Where Do Jews Come From?\\", The Wall Street Journal, 29 October 2009.

However, numerous genetic studies have not supported this theory. In western Europe, following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476, and especially after the re-orientation of trade caused by the Moorish conquest of Iberia in the early 8th century, communications between the Jewish communities in northern parts of the former western empire became sporadic. At the same time, rule under Islam, even with dhimmi status, resulted in freer trade and communications within the Muslim world, and the communities in Iberia remained in frequent contact with Jewry in North Africa and the Middle East, but communities further afield, in central and south Asia and central Africa, remained more isolated, and continued to develop their own unique traditions. For the Sephardim in Spain, it resulted in a \\"Hebrew Golden Age\\" in the 10th to 12th centuries.Gregory B. Kaplan, Review of: The Compunctious Poet: Cultural Ambiguity and Hebrew Poetry in Muslim Spain, Ross Brann, Johns Hopkins UP, 1991. Hispanic Review, Vol. 61, No. 3 (Summer, 1993), pp. 405‚Äì407. Available here, from Jstor The 1492 expulsion from Spain by the Catholic Monarchs however, made the Sephardic Jews hide and disperse to France, Italy, England, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, parts of what is now northwestern Germany, and to other existing communities in Christian Europe, as well as to those within the Ottoman Empire, to the Maghreb in North Africa and smaller numbers to other areas of the Middle East, and eventually to the Americas in the early 17th century. In northern and Christian Europe during this period, financial competition developed between the authority of the Pope in Rome and nascent states and empires. This dynamic, with the Great Schism, recurrent fervid religious Crusades, Episcopal Inquisition and later protestations and wars between Christians themselves, caused repeated periods and occurrences of persecution against the established Jewish minority in \\"Ashkenaz\\" in modern Hebrew means Germanic Jews and with Ancient Hebrew it included the areas that are now northern France, Germany and Switzerland‚Äîmasses of Jews began to move further to the east. There, they were welcomed by the king of Poland,See the History of the Jews in Poland and with Lithuania, grew greatly, and relatively flourished to the end of the 18th century. In western Europe, the conditions for Jewry differed between the communities within the various countries and over time, depending on background conditions. With both pull and push factors operating, Ashkenazi emigration to the Americas would increase in the early 18th century with German-speaking Ashkenazi Jews, and end with a tidal wave between 1880 and the early 20th century with Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazim, as conditions in the east deteriorated under the failing Russian Empire. After the Holocaust, which resulted in the murder of more than 6 million Jews living in Europe, North America became the place where the majority of Jews live.Crowe, David, M., The Holocaust Roots, p. 1, , sourced from Wikipedia article Holocaust and Names of the Holocaust) Modern divisions Jewish women in Algeria, 1851 Historically, European Jews have been classified into two major groups: the Ashkenazim, or \\"Germanics\\" (\\"Ashkenaz\\" meaning \\"Germany\\" in Medieval Hebrew), denoting their Central European base, and the Sephardim, or \\"Hispanics\\" (\\"Sefarad\\" meaning \\"Hispania\\" or \\"Iberia\\" in Hebrew), denoting their Spanish, Portuguese or North African base. A third historic term Mizrahim, or \\"Easterners\\" (\\"Mizrach\\" being \\"East\\" in Hebrew) has been used to describe other non-European Jewish communities to the east, but its usage has changed both over time and relative to the location where it was used. One definition is the Jews who never left the Middle East, in contrast to the Sephardim who went west to Spain, Portugal, and North Africa. A similar three- part distinction in the Jewish community of 16th-century Venice is noted by Johnson as being \\"divided into three nations, the Penentines from Spain, the Levantines who were Turkish subjects, and the Natione Tedesca or Jews of German origin...\\"Johnson, A History of the Jews, p.237 The far more recent meaning of the term, to include both Middle Eastern and North African Jews in a single term, developed within Zionism in the mid-1940s, when Jews from these countries were all combined in one category as the target of an immigration plan. According to some sources, the current sense of the term, as an ethnic group distinct from European-born Jews, was invented at this time. p. 86: \\"The principal significance of this plan lies in the fact, noted by Yehuda Shenhav, that this was the first time in Zionist history that Jews from Middle Eastern and North African countries were all packaged together in one category as the target of an immigration plan. There were earlier plans to bring specific groups, such as the Yemenites, but the \\"one million plan\\" was, as Shenhav says, \\"the zero point,\\" the moment when the category of Mizrahi Jews in the current sense of this term, as an ethnic group distinct from European-born Jews, was invented.\\" p.89‚Äî90 ...\\"Shehav's argument that the one million plan led to the invention of the category of Mizrahi Jews and gave the term the meaning it has today, because the plan treated all Jews who originated in these countries as belonging to a single category of candidates for immigration. ... it added another layer of meaning to the newly minted and still crystallizing Mizrahi category, that is, as implying a quasi-racial division between those who had an \\"oriental appearance\\" and those who did not.\\" The term constitutes a third major layer to some, and following the partition of Mandatory Palestine and Israeli independence, the Mizrahim's often-forced migration, led to their re- established communities in Israel. Smaller Jewish groups include the Georgian Jews and Mountain Jews from the Caucasus; Indian Jews including the Bene Israel, Bnei Menashe, Cochin Jews and Bene Ephraim; the Romaniotes of Greece; the ancient Italian Jewish community; the Teimanim from the Yemen; various African Jews, including most numerously the Beta Israel of Ethiopia; the Bukharan Jews of Central Asia; and Chinese Jews, most notably the Kaifeng Jews, as well as various other distinct but now extinct communities. The divisions between all these groups are rough and their boundaries aren't solid. The Mizrahim for example, are a heterogeneous collection of North African and Middle Eastern Jewish communities which are often as unrelated to each other as they are to any of the earlier mentioned Jewish groups. In traditional religious usage and sometimes in modern usage, however, the Mizrahim are also termed Sephardi due to similar styles of liturgy, despite independent evolutions from Sephardim proper. Thus, among Mizrahim there are Iranian Jews, Iraqi Jews, Egyptian Jews, Sudanese Jews, Tunisian Jews, Algerian Jews, Moroccan Jews, Lebanese Jews, Kurdish Jews, Libyan Jews, Syrian Jews, and various others. The Yemenite Jews (\\"Teimanim\\") from Yemen are sometimes included, although their style of liturgy is unique and they differ in respect to the admixture found among them to that found in Mizrahim. Additionally, there is a difference between the pre-existing Middle Eastern and North African Jewish communities as distinct from the descendants of those Sephardi migrants who established themselves in the Middle East and North Africa after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain by the Catholic Monarchs in 1492, and in 1497 from the expulsion decreed in Portugal. The Suleiman ben Pinchas Cohen family of Yemen, circa 1944 Despite this diversity, Ashkenazi Jews represent the bulk of modern Jewry, estimated at between 70% and 80% of all Jews worldwide; prior to World War II and the Holocaust however, it was 90%. Ashkenazim developed in Europe, but underwent massive emigration in search of better opportunities and during periods of civil strife and warfare. As a result of this, they became the overwhelming majority of Jews in the New World continents and countries, which previously were without native European or Jewish populations. These include the United States, Mexico, Canada, United Kingdom, Argentina, Australia, Brazil and South Africa, but with Venezuela and Panama being exceptions since Sephardim still compose the majority of the Jewish communities in these two countries. In France, more recent Sephardi Jewish immigrants from North Africa and their descendants now outnumber the pre-existing Ashkenazim. =Genetic studies= Despite the evident diversity displayed by the world's distinctive Jewish populations, both culturally and physically, genetic studies have demonstrated most of these to be genetically related to one another, having ultimately originated from a common ancient Israelite population that underwent geographic branching and subsequent independent evolutions. A study published by the National Academy of Sciences stated that \\"The results support the hypothesis that the paternal gene pools of Jewish communities from Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East descended from a common Middle Eastern ancestral population, and suggest that most Jewish communities have remained relatively isolated from neighboring non- Jewish communities during and after the Diaspora.\\" Researchers expressed surprise at the remarkable genetic uniformity they found among modern Jews, no matter where the diaspora has become dispersed around the world. Moreover, DNA tests have demonstrated substantially less inter-marriage in most of the various Jewish ethnic divisions over the last 3,000 years than in other populations. The findings lend support to traditional Jewish accounts accrediting their founding to exiled Israelite populations, and counters theories that many or most of the world's Jewish populations were founded by entirely gentile populations that adopted the Jewish faith, as in the notable case of the historic Khazars. Although groups such as the Khazars could have been absorbed into modern Jewish populations ‚Äî in the Khazars' case, absorbed into the Ashkenazim ‚Äî it is unlikely that they formed a large percentage of the ancestors of modern Ashkenazi Jews, and much less that they were the genesis of the Ashkenazim. Previously, the Israelite origin identified in the world's Jewish populations was attributed only to the males who had migrated from the Middle East and then forged the current known communities with \\"the women from each local population whom they took as wives and converted to Judaism\\". Research in Ashkenazi Jews has suggested that, in addition to the male founders, significant female founder ancestry might also derive from the Middle East, with about 40% of the current Ashkenazi population descended matrilineally from just four women, or \\"founder lineages\\", that were \\"likely from a Hebrew/Levantine mtDNA pool\\" originating in the Near East in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE. Points in which Jewish groups differ are the source and proportion of genetic contribution from host populations. For example, the Teimanim differ to a certain extent from other Mizrahim, as well as from Ashkenazim in the proportion of sub-Saharan African gene types which have entered their gene pools. Among Yemenite Jews, the average stands at 5-10%, due to the relative genetic isolation of Yemenite Jews this is only a quarter of the frequency of the non-Jewish Yemenite sample, which can reach 35%. In Ashkenazi Jews, the proportion of male indigenous European genetic admixture amounts to around 0.5% per generation over an estimated 80 generations, and a total admixture estimate around 12.5%. The only exception to this among Jewish communities is in the Beta Israel (Ethiopian Jews); a 1999 genetic study came to the conclusion that \\"the distinctiveness of the Y-chromosome haplotype distribution of Beta Israel Jews from conventional Jewish populations and their relatively greater similarity in haplotype profile to non-Jewish Ethiopians are consistent with the view that the Beta Israel people descended from ancient inhabitants of Ethiopia who converted to Judaism.\\" Another 2001 study did, however, find a possible genetic similarity between 11 Ethiopian Jews and 4 Yemenite Jews from the population samples. DNA analysis further determined that modern Jews of the priesthood tribe ‚Äî \\"Cohanim\\" ‚Äî share a common ancestor dating back about 3,000 years. This result is consistent for all Jewish populations around the world. The researchers estimated that the most recent common ancestor of modern Cohanim lived between 1000 BCE (roughly the time of the Biblical Exodus) and 586 BCE, when the Babylonians destroyed the First Temple. They found similar results analyzing DNA from Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews. The scientists estimated the date of the original priest based on genetic mutations, which indicated that the priest lived roughly 106 generations ago, between 2,650 and 3,180 years ago depending whether one counts a generation as 25 or 30 years. A study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA by Richards et al. (2013) suggested that, though Ashkenazi paternal lineages were of Middle Eastern origin, the four main female Ashkenazi founders had descent lines that were established in Europe 10,000 to 20,000 years in the past while most of the remaining minor founders also have a deep European ancestry. The majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Levant, nor recruited in the Caucasus, but were assimilated within Europe. The study estimated that 80 percent of Ashkenazi maternal ancestry comes from women indigenous to Europe, 8 percent from the Near East, and the remainder undetermined. According to the study these findings 'point to a significant role for the conversion of women in the formation of Ashkenazi communities.' Some geneticists, such as Doron Behar, a geneticist at Gene by Gene in Houston, US, and Karl Skorecki, at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, are skeptical of these results. A 2014 study by Fern√°ndez et al. found that Ashkenazi Jews display a frequency of haplogroup K in their maternal DNA, suggesting an ancient Near Eastern matrilineal origin, similar to the results of the Behar study in 2006. Fern√°ndez noted that this observation clearly contradicts the results of the 2013 study led by Richards that suggested a European source for 3 exclusively Ashkenazi K lineages. A study by Haber et al. (2013) noted that while previous studies of the Levant, which had focused mainly on diaspora Jewish populations, showed that the \\"Jews form a distinctive cluster in the Middle East\\", these studies did not make clear \\"whether the factors driving this structure would also involve other groups in the Levant\\". The authors found strong evidence that modern Levant populations descend from two major apparent ancestral populations. One set of genetic characteristics which is shared with modern-day Europeans and Central Asians is most prominent in the Levant among \\"Lebanese, Armenians, Cypriots, Druze and Jews, as well as Turks, Iranians and Caucasian populations\\". The second set of inherited genetic characteristics is shared with populations in other parts of the Middle East as well as some African populations. Levant populations in this category today include \\"Palestinians, Jordanians, Syrians, as well as North Africans, Ethiopians, Saudis, and Bedouins\\". Concerning this second component of ancestry, the authors remark that while it correlates with \\"the pattern of the Islamic expansion\\", and that \\"a pre-Islamic expansion Levant was more genetically similar to Europeans than to Middle Easterners,\\" they also say that \\"its presence in Lebanese Christians, Sephardi and Ashkenazi Jews, Cypriots and Armenians might suggest that its spread to the Levant could also represent an earlier event\\". The authors also found a strong correlation between religion and apparent ancestry in the Levant: > \\"all Jews (Sephardi and Ashkenazi) cluster in one branch; Druze from Mount > Lebanon and Druze from Mount Carmel are depicted on a private branch; and > Lebanese Christians form a private branch with the Christian populations of > Armenia and Cyprus placing the Lebanese Muslims as an outer group. The > predominantly Muslim populations of Syrians, Palestinians and Jordanians > cluster on branches with other Muslim populations as distant as Morocco and > Yemen.\\" A 2013 study by Doron M. Behar, Mait Metspalu, Yael Baran, Naama M. Kopelman, Bayazit Yunusbayev et al. using integration of genotypes on newly collected largest data set available to date (1,774 samples from 106 Jewish and non- Jewish populations) for assessment of Ashkenazi Jewish genetic origins from the regions of potential Ashkenazi ancestry:(Europe, the Middle East, and the region historically associated with the Khazar Khaganate) concluded that \\"This most comprehensive study... does not change and in fact reinforces the conclusions of multiple past studies, including ours and those of other groups (Atzmon and others, 2010; Bauchet and others, 2007; Behar and others, 2010; Campbell and others, 2012; Guha and others, 2012; Haber and others; 2013; Henn and others, 2012; Kopelman and others, 2009; Seldin and others, 2006; Tian and others, 2008). We confirm the notion that the Ashkenazi, North African, and Sephardi Jews share substantial genetic ancestry and that they derive it from Middle Eastern and European populations, with no indication of a detectable Khazar contribution to their genetic origins.\\" :The authors also reanalyzed the 2012 study of Eran Elhaik, and found that \\"The provocative assumption that Armenians and Georgians could serve as appropriate proxies for Khazar descendants is problematic for a number of reasons as the evidence for ancestry among Caucasus populations do not reflect Khazar ancestry\\". Also, the authors found that \\"Even if it were allowed that Caucasus affinities could represent Khazar ancestry, the use of the Armenians and Georgians as Khazar proxies is particularly poor, as they represent the southern part of the Caucasus region, while the Khazar Khaganate was centered in the North Caucasus and further to the north. Furthermore, among populations of the Caucasus, Armenians and Georgians are geographically the closest to the Middle East, and are therefore expected a priori to show the greatest genetic similarity to Middle Eastern populations.\\" Concerning the similarity of South Caucasus populations to Middle Eastern groups which was observed at the level of the whole genome in one recent study (Yunusbayev and others, 2012). The authors found that \\"Any genetic similarity between Ashkenazi Jews and Armenians and Georgians might merely reflect a common shared Middle Eastern ancestry component, actually providing further support to a Middle Eastern origin of Ashkenazi Jews, rather than a hint for a Khazar origin\\". The authors claimed \\"If one accepts the premise that similarity to Armenians and Georgians represents Khazar ancestry for Ashkenazi Jews, then by extension one must also claim that Middle Eastern Jews and many Mediterranean European and Middle Eastern populations are also Khazar descendants. This claim is clearly not valid, as the differences among the various Jewish and non-Jewish populations of Mediterranean Europe and the Middle East predate the period of the Khazars by thousands of years\\". A 2014 study by Carmi et al. published by Nature Communications found that the Ashkenazi Jewish population originates from an approximately even mixture of Middle Eastern and European ancestry. According to the authors, that mixing likely occurred some 600‚Äì800 years ago, followed by rapid growth and genetic isolation (rate per generation 16‚Äì53%;). The study found that all Ashkenazi Jews descent from around 350 individuals, and that the principal component analysis of common variants in the sequenced AJ samples, confirmed previous observations, namely, the proximity of Ashkenazi Jewish cluster to other Jewish, European and Middle Eastern populations\\".

Because of the independence of local communities, Jewish ethnic divisions, even when they circumscribe differences in liturgy, language, cuisine and other cultural accoutrements, are more often a reflection of geographic and historical isolation from other communities. It is for this reason that communities are referred to by referencing the historical region in which the community cohered when discussing their practices, regardless of where those practices are found today. The smaller groups number in the hundreds to tens of thousands, with the Georgian Jews (also known as Gruzinim or Qartveli Ebraeli) and Beta Israel being most numerous at somewhat over 100,000 each. Many members of these groups have now emigrated from their traditional homelands, largely to Israel. For example, only about 10 percent of the Gruzinim remain in Georgia. A brief description of the extant communities, by the geographic regions with which they are associated, is as follows: =Europe= Ashkenazi Jews (plural Ashkenazim) are the descendants of Jews who migrated into northern France and Germany around 800‚Äì1000, and later into Eastern Europe. Among the Ashkenazim there are a number of major subgroups: * Yekkes, or German Jews, stemming from the Lowlands, historical Germany, Switzerland, and Scandinavia. They originally spoke Western Yiddish, which had less Slavic influence than other Yiddish dialects. By the early 20th century, Yiddish was in decline in this population, and assimilation was proceeding rapidly. * Oberlanders, originating in the Oberland region of Hungary and the district surrounding Bratislava in Slovakia, originally spoke Western Yiddish. In modern times before the Holocaust, many Oberlander Jews migrated to urban centers of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and adopted German or Hungarian as their first language. * Unterlanders, who resided in the northeastern region of the Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Slovakia, Zakarpattia Oblast in Ukraine and Northern Transylvania.) * Litvaks, or Lithuanian Jews, emerged as a distinct group in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (present-day Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Latvia and the northeastern Suwa≈Çki region of Poland). They have historically spoken the Eastern Yiddish dialect Litvish (Lithuanian Yiddish). * Galitzianers, or Galician Jews, trace their origins to Galicia, Western Ukraine (current Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Ternopil regions) and South-Eastern Poland. * According to some sources, Jews in Udmurtia and Tatarstan can be seen as ethnic group - dos udmurtishe yidntum. Sephardi Jews (plural Sephardim) are Jews whose ancestors lived in Iberia prior to 1492. There are multiple subgroups among the Sephardim: * Western Sephardim, or the Spanish and Portuguese Jews are a distinct subgroup of Iberian Jews. They are largely descended from Jews who lived as New Christians in the Iberian Peninsula during the immediate generations following the forced expulsion of unconverted Jews from Spain in 1492 and from Portugal in 1497. * Eastern Sephardim are a subgroup of Iberian Jews descended from families exiled from Iberia in the 15th century. Most of them settled in various parts of the Ottoman Empire, while some settled as far as the Malabar coast, importing their culture and customs to the local Cochin Jews. * North African Sephardim descend from exiled Iberic Jewish families of the late 15th century and North African Maghrebi Jewish communities already settled in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya. They have historically spoken Haketia, a Judaeo-Spanish language derived from Old Spanish, Hebrew and Aramaic. * Belmonte Jews are a Jewish community in Belmonte that lived in Portugal as Crypto-Jews for centuries. They survived in secrecy for hundreds of years by maintaining a tradition of endogamy and hiding all external signs of their faith. * Xuetes, or Majorcan Jews, are descendants of Jews who were forcibly converted to Christianity and today live in the Balearic Islands. Some maintained their faith, while others observed a syncretist form of Christian worship known as Xueta Christianity. Jewish communities in Europe that are neither Ashkenazic nor Sephardic: *Italkim trace their origins as far back as the 2nd century BCE. It is thought that some families descend from Jews deported from Judaea in 70 CE. They have traditionally spoken a variety of Judeo-Italian languages (Italkian) and used Italian Hebrew as a pronunciation system. * Romaniotes are a distinct Jewish community that has resided in Greece and neighboring areas for over 2,000 years. They have historically spoken the Jud√¶o-Greek dialect Yevanic, although due to the majority of them dying in the Holocaust, combined with assimilation post-WW2 there are no longer any speakers of it. * San Nicandro Jews ‚Äì A group of mid-20th century converts from Italy. =The Caucasus and the Crimea= * Juhurim, better known as the Mountain Jews, are descendants of Persian Jews from Iran and Babylonian Jews from Baghdad who settled in the eastern and northern Caucasus (modern Azerbaijan, Chechnya, Dagestan and Ingushetia). It's believed that they had reached Persia from Ancient Israel as early as the 8th century BCE. The Juhuro survived numerous historical vicissitudes by settling in extremely remote and mountainous areas. They were known to be accomplished warriors and horseback riders. Their language is Judeo-Tat, an ancient Southwest Iranian language which integrates many elements of Ancient Hebrew and Aramaic. *Gruzim, or the Georgian Jews, are one of the oldest surviving Jewish communities tracing back to the Babylonian captivity in the 6th century BCE. The 2,600-year history of the Georgian Jews was unique in its complete absence of antisemitism prior to Russia's annexation of Georgia. They have traditionally spoken Kivruli, a Judaeo-Georgian dialect with a lot of Hebrew and Aramaic loan words. As a result of the Post-Soviet aliyah, the vast majority of Georgian Jews now live in Israel. * Krymchaks and Crimean Karaites are Turkic-speaking Jews of the Crimea and Eastern Europe. The Krymchaks practice Rabbinic Judaism, while the Karaim practice Karaite Judaism. Whether they are primarily the descendants of Israelite Jews who adopted Turkic language and culture, or the descendants of Turkic converts to Judaism, is still debated, although the question is irrelevant as far as Jewish law is concerned, according to which they are Jews, regardless of whether by Israelite descent or by conversion. * Subbotniks are a dwindling group of Jews from Azerbaijan and Armenia, whose ancestors were Russian peasants who converted to Judaism for unknown reasons in the 19th century.ncsj.org =North Africa= Mostly Sephardi Jews and collectively known as Maghrebi Jews and sometime considered part of the wider Mizrahi group: * Moroccan Jews migrated to this area after the destruction of the First Temple in Jerusalem and settled among the Berbers. They were later met by a second wave of migration from the Iberian peninsula in the period immediately preceding and following the 1492 Alhambra Decree, when the Jews were expelled from kingdoms of Spain and Portugal. Their mixed-race descendants in the Amazon Basin are known as Amazonian Jews, and they have retained a separate ethnic identity, often with mixed religious practices. * Algerian Jews: There is evidence of Jewish settlements in Algeria since at least the late Roman period, followed by Jewish immigrants came to North Africa after fleeing from the persecutions of the Visigothic king Sisebut, and finally the largest segment which were Sephardic Jews forced from Spain due to the Inquisition. * Libyan Jews stretch back to the 3rd century BCE, when Cyrenaica was under Greek rule. The Jewish population of Libya, a part of the Berber Jewish community, continued to populate the area continuously until the modern times. * Tunisian Jews: similar to the Libyan Jews * Berber Jews: Jewish communities of the Atlas Mountains = West Asia = Jews originating from West Asia are generally called by the catch-all term Mizrahi Jews, more precise terms for particular groups are: * Babylonian Jews, also known as Iraqi Jews, are descendants of the Jewish people whom have lived in Mesopotamia since the time of the Assyrian conquest of Samaria. * Kurdish Jews from Kurdistan, as distinct from the Persian Jews of central and eastern Persia, as well as from the lowland Babylonian Jews of Mesopotamia. * Persian Jews from Iran (commonly called Parsim in Israel, from the Hebrew) have a 2700-year history. One of the oldest Jewish communities of the world, Persian Jews constitute the largest Jewish community in West Asia outside Israel. * Yemenite Jews (called Temanim, from the Hebrew) are Oriental Jews whose geographic and social isolation from the rest of the Jewish community allowed them to maintain a liturgy and set of practices that are significantly distinct from other Oriental Jewish groups; they themselves comprise three distinctly different groups, though the distinction is one of religious law and liturgy rather than of ethnicity. * Palestinian Jews are Jewish inhabitants of Palestine throughout certain periods of Middle Eastern history. After the modern State of Israel was born, nearly all native Palestinian Jews became citizens of Israel, and the term \\"Palestinian Jews\\" largely fell into disuse. * Egyptian Jews are generally Jews thought to have descended from the great Jewish communities of Hellenistic Alexandria, mixed with many more recent groups of immigrants. These include Babylonian Jews following the Muslim conquest; Jews from Palestine following the Crusades; Sephardim following the expulsion from Spain; Italian Jews settling for trading reasons in the 18th and 19th centuries; and Jews from Aleppo in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. * Sudanese Jews are Jewish community that lived in Sudan, and was concentrated in the capital Khartoum, they were mainly of Sephardic background, who had constructed a synagogue and a Jewish school. * Lebanese Jews are the Jews that lived around Beirut. After the Lebanese Civil War, the community's emigration appears to have been completed; few remain in Lebanon today. * Omani Jews are the early Jewish community of Sohar. They are thought to be descendants of Ishaq bin Yahuda, a Sohari merchant around the first millennium. This community is believed to have disappeared by 1900. * Syrian Jews are generally divided into two groups: those who inhabited Syria from ancient times (according to their own traditions, from the time of King David (1000 BC)), and those who fled to Syria after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain (1492), at the invitation of the Ottoman sultan. There were large communities in both Aleppo and Damascus for centuries. In the early 20th century, a large percentage of Syrian Jews emigrated to the U.S., South America, and Israel. Today, there are almost no Jews left in Syria. The largest Syrian-Jewish community is located in Brooklyn, New York, and is estimated at 40,000. =Sub-Saharan Africa= * Beta Israel or Falashim of Ethiopia, tens of thousands migrated to Israel during Operation Moses (1984), Operation Sheba (1985) and Operation Solomon (1991).Ephraim Isaac, \\"The Question of Jewish Identity and Ethiopian Jewish Origins \\", 2005; Amaleletch Teferi, \\"About the Jewish identity of the Beta Israel\\" in Tudor Parfitt & Emanuela Trevisan Semi (Editors), Jews of Ethiopia: The Birth of an Elite, Routledge, 2005, , pp. 173‚Äì192 * Descendants of the Jews of the Bilad el-Sudan (West Africa). Jews whose ancestry was derived from the communities that once existed in the Ghana, Mali, and Songhay Empire. Anusim in and around Mali who descend from Jewish migrations from North Africa, East Africa, and Spain. * The Lemba people in Malawi which number as many as 40,000. This group claims descent from ancient Israelite tribes that migrated down to southern Africa via southern Arabia. Genetic testing has partially upheld these claims. Genetic testing suggests some males have Middle Eastern Ancestry but could not confirm Jewish ancestry. * South African Jews make up the largest community of Jews in Africa. Dutch Sephardic Jews were among the first permanent residents of Cape Town when the city was founded by the VOC in 1652. Today, however, most of South Africa's Jews are Ashkenazi and, in particular, of Lithuanian descent. *Communities also existed in S√£o Tom√© e Pr√≠ncipe, descended from Portuguese Jewish youths expelled during the Inquisition. =South, East, and Central Asia= * Bene Israel are the Jews of Mumbai, India, most of whom now reside in Israel. * Bukharan Jews are Jews from Central Asia. They get their name from the former Central Asian Emirate of Bukhara, which once had a large Jewish population. * Cochin Jews are also Indian Jews from south-western India, most of whom also now reside in Israel. Included among these are the Paradesi Jews. * Baghdadi Jews Those Jews came from Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and Arab countries who settled in India in the 18th century. * Bnei Menashe. A group of Jews living in Manipur and Mizoram in north-eastern India, claiming descent from the dispersed Biblical Tribe of Menasseh. * Bene Ephraim, the Telugu-speaking Jews of Kottareddipalem in Andhra Pradesh, India. * Chinese Jews: most prominent were the Kaifeng Jews, an ancient Jewish community in China, descended from merchants living in China from at least the era of the Tang dynasty. Today functionally extinct, although several hundred descendants have recently begun to explore and reclaim their heritage. * Pakistani Jews: There was a thriving Jewish community in Pakistan particularly around the city of Karachi but also in other urban areas up north such as in Peshawer, Rawalpindi and Lahore. The origins of the Jewish community was mixed with some being Bene Israel, Bukharan Jews and Baghdadi Jews. In the late 1980s and 1990s, Jewish refugees from Iran had also came via Pakistan's Balochistan province and reached Karachi until the Iranian government closed down the operation. Most of Pakistan's Jewish community has not relocated to Israel and Pakistan's Jewish population is believed to number around 700. Also the Jews of Allahdad have residence in this area. * Afghan Jews: Records of a Jewish population in Afghanistan go back to the 7th century. Before the arrival of Islam in Kabul, Kabul and Gandhara were trading places for Jewish merchants. The Afghan Jewish community has disappeared since the 1950s due to gradual emigration to Israel. Since the Mughal period, there had also been a historiographical tradition of the Afghans themselves being descended from the Lost Tribes of Israel.Sir Henry Yule, \\"Afghanistan\\" article in the 1902 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: \\"The Afghan chroniclers call their people Bani-Israil (Arab. For Children of Israel), and claim descent from King Saul (whom they call by the Mahommedan corruption Talut) through a son whom they ascribe to him, called Jeremiah, who again had a son called Afghana. [...] This story is repeated in great and varying detail in sundry books by Afghans, the oldest of which appears to be of the 16th century; nor do we know that any trace of the legend is found of older date.\\" * Tamil Thattar Jews in Sri Lanka, Jews in Sri Lanka have had a presence on the island nation since at least the 9th century. History of the Jews in Sri Lanka. =Americas= Most Jewish communities in the Americas are descendants of Jews who found their way there at different times of modern history. The first Jews to settle in the Americas were of Spanish/Portuguese origin. Today, however, the great majority of recognized Jews on both the North American and South American continents are Ashkenazi, particularly among Jews in the United States. There are also Mizrahim and other diaspora groups represented (as well as mixes of any or all of these) as mentioned above. Some unique communities associated with the Americas include: * Sephardic Bnei Anusim are the descendants of Sephardi Jewish nominal converts (conversos) to Catholicism who immigrated to the New World escaping the Spanish Inquisition in Spain and Portugal. Following the establishment of the Inquisition in the Iberian colonies, again they hid their ancestry and beliefs. Their numbers are difficult to ascertain as most are at least nominally Catholic, having been converted by force or coercion, or married into the religion. Collectively, people of Sephardic Bnei Anusim Jewish descent in Latin America is in the millions. Most would be of mixed ancestry, although a few claim some communities may have been able to maintain a degree of endogamy (marrying only other Crypto-Jews) throughout the centuries. They may or may not consider themselves Jewish, some may continue to preserve some of their Jewish heritage in secrecy, many others may not even be aware of it. The majority would not be halakhically Jewish, but small numbers of various communities have formally returned to Judaism over the past decade, legitimizing their status as Jews. See also Anusim. * Amazonian Jews are the mixed descendants of Moroccan Jewish communities in Bel√©m, Santar√©m, Manaus, Iquitos, Tarapoto and many river villages in the Amazon basin in Brazil and Peru. ** Iquitos Jews are the \\"accidental\\" descendants of mostly Moroccan Jewish traders and tappers who arrived in the Peruvian Amazon city of Iquitos during the rubber boom of the 1880s. Since their Jewish descent was patrilineal (Jewish traders had been all males who coupled up with local mestizo or Amerindian females), their Jewishness is not recognised according to halakha. An enduring casta system stemming from the colonial period has resulted in virtually no interaction between the Iquitos Jews and the small, mostly Ashkenazi Jewish, population concentrated in Lima (under 3,000) who are integrated into Lima's elite white minority. Thanks to efforts made by Israeli outreach programmes, some have formally returned to Judaism, made aliyah and now live in Israel. * B'nai Moshe are converts to Judaism originally from Trujillo, Peru. They are also known as Inca Jews, a name derived from the fact that they can trace indigenous Amerindian descent, as most are mestizos (persons of both Spanish and Amerindian descent) though none with any known ancestors from other Jewish communities. Again, there is no interaction between Peru's small Ashkenazi population and the Inca Jews. At the neglect of the Ashkenazi community, the conversions were conducted under the auspices of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel. Most have made aliyah and now live in Israel, while a few hundred more of the same community are awaiting conversions. * Veracruz Jews are a recently emergent community of Jews in Veracruz, Mexico. Whether they are gentile converts to Judaism or descendants of anusim returning to Judaism is speculative. Most claim they descend from anusim. =Israel= At the time the State of Israel was proclaimed, the majority of Jews in the state and the region were Ashkenazi. However, by the 1990s, the majority of Israeli Jews were Mizrahi.My Promised Land, by Ari Shavit, (London 2014), page 288 As of 2005, 61% of Israeli Jews are of Mizrahi ancestry.Jews, Arabs, and Arab Jews: The Politics of Identity and Reproduction in Israel, Ducker, Clare Louise, Institute of Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands Karaite rabbi, Moshe Fairouz (left) and vice chairman, Eli Eltahan. Jerusalem, Israel. Following the declaration of the state, a flood of Jewish migrants and refugees entered Israel from the Arab world and the Muslim world in general. Most were Sephardim and Mizrahim, which included Jews from the Maghreb, Yemenite Jews, Bukharan Jews, Persian Jews, Iraqi Jews, Kurdish Jews, and smaller communities, principally from Libya, Egypt and Turkey. More recently, other communities have also arrived including Ethiopian Jews and Indian Jews. Because of the relative homogeneity of Ashkenazic Jewry, especially by comparison to the diversity of the many smaller communities, over time in Israel, all Jews from Europe came to be called \\"Ashkenazi\\" in Israel, whether or not they had any connection with Germany, while Jews from Africa and Asia have come to be called \\"Sephardi\\", whether or not they had any connection with Spain. One reason is that most African and Asian Jewish communities use the Sephardic prayer ritual and abide by the rulings of Sephardic rabbinic authorities, and therefore consider themselves to be \\"Sephardim\\" in the broader sense of \\"Jews of the Spanish rite\\", though not in the narrower sense of \\"Spanish Jews\\". Similarly \\"Ashkenazim\\" has the broader sense of \\"Jews of the German rite\\". The founders of modern Israel, mostly Ashkenazi Jews, are often said to have believed themselves superior to these new arrivals. With higher degrees of Western-standard education, they were better positioned to take full advantage of the emerging Western-style liberal democracy and Western mode of living which they themselves had established as the cultural norm in Palestine during the pre-state era. Cultural or racial biases against the newcomers were compounded by the fledgling state's lack of financial resources and inadequate housing to handle the massive population influx. Thus, hundreds of thousands of new Sephardic immigrants were sent to live in tent cities in outlying areas. Sephardim (in its wider meaning) were often victims of discrimination and were sometimes called schwartze (meaning \\"black\\" in Yiddish). Worse than housing discrimination was the differential treatment accorded the children of these immigrants, many of whom were tracked by the largely European education establishment into dead-end \\"vocational\\" schools, without any real assessment of their intellectual capacities. Mizrahi Jews protested their unfair treatment, and even established the Israeli Black Panthers movement with the mission of working for social justice. The effects of this early discrimination still linger a half-century later, as documented by the studies of the Adva Center, a think tank on social equality, and by other Israeli academic research (cf., for example, Tel Aviv University Professor Yehuda Shenhav's article in Hebrew documenting the gross underrepresentation of Sephardic Jewry in Israeli high school history textbooks. Every Israeli prime minister has been Ashkenazi, although Sephardim and Mizrahim have attained the (ceremonial) presidency and other high positions. The student bodies of Israel's universities remain overwhelmingly European in origin, despite the fact that roughly half the country's population is non-European. And the tent cities of the 1950s morphed into so- called \\"development towns\\". Scattered over border areas of the Negev Desert and the Galilee, far from the bright lights of Israel's major cities, most of these towns never had the critical mass or ingredients to succeed as places to live, and they continue to suffer from high unemployment, inferior schools, and chronic brain drain. Prof. Smadar Lavie, Mizrahi U.S.-Israeli anthropologist, has documented and analyzed the discriminatory treatment Mizrahi single mothers endure from the Ashkenazi-dominated Israeli regime, suggesting that Israeli bureaucracy is based on a theological notion that inserts the categories of religion, gender, and race into the foundation of citizenship. Lavie connects intra-Jewish racial and gendered dynamics to the 2014 Gaza War in her widely-reviewed book, Wrapped in the Flag of Israel: Mizrahi Single Mothers and Bureaucratic Torture, and analyzes the racial and gender justice protest movements in the State of Israel from the 2003 Single Mothers‚Äô March to the 2014 New Black Panthers. While the Israeli Black Panthers no longer exist, the Mizrahi Democratic Rainbow Coalition and many other NGOs carry on the struggle for equal access and opportunity in housing, education, and employment for the country's underprivileged populace ‚Äì still largely composed of Sephardim and Mizrahim, joined now by newer immigrants from Ethiopia and the Caucasus Mountains. Intermarriage of all these regathered Jewish ethnic groups was initially uncommon, due in part to distances of each group's settlement in Israel, and cultural or racial biases. In recent generations, however, the barriers were lowered by state-sponsored assimilation of all the Jewish ethnic groups into a common Sabra (native-born Israeli) identity which facilitated extensive mixed-marriages.

In 2009 the University of the West Indies conferred upon her the honorary degree D.Litt. at graduation ceremonies in Cave Hill, Barbados. Works Her debut novel, Beka Lamb, published in 1982, details the early years of the nationalist movement in British Honduras from the eyes of a teenage girl attending high school in the colony. Published a year after Belize became independent, Beka Lamb was the first novel to be published in the new nation and went on to claim the distinction of being Belize's first novel to gain an international audience, winning Britain's Fawcett Society Book Prize in 1982 (awarded annually to a work of fiction that contributes to an understanding of women's position in society today).Bernardine Evaristo, \\"Zee Edgell\\" (interview), BOMB 82, Winter 2003.

Her subsequent novel, In Times Like These (1991), portrayed the turmoil of nearly independent Belize from the point of view of another female protagonist, this time the adult director of women's affairs (a post Edgell once held). The Festival of San Joaquin (1997), her third novel, told the story of a woman accused of murdering her husband, and in her short stories, Edgell skillfully explores the layers of Belize's complicated social and racial stratification through the lens of her female protagonists.

The concept was propounded by the Russian actor, director and educator Konstantin Stanislavsky, who initially liked to use the term kusok () an ordinary Russian word that can be translated as bit ‚Äì as in a bit, or slice, of bread or meat. This was the term Stanislavsky preferred in the original drafts of his books. Stanislavsky also referred to these bits of action as episodes, events and facts. The term, unit, was introduced in the standard early translations of Stanislavsky's writings. Use of beat in the place of bit has become mainstream in American method acting. This historic mistranslation may have helped spawn the common metaphor of the dramatic script as a musical score. Stanislavsky used the same metaphor to refer to detailed production plans. It was also taken up by the innovative Polish director Jerzy Grotowski as a score of physical actions. Bits of pieces Stanislavsky conceived the segmentation of script as a preparatory tool for actors working on a play. Although he used the Russian word for \\"bit\\" (kusok) in the drafts he originally made for his planned books, he later preferred to speak in terms of \\"episode\\" (epizod in Russian), \\"event\\" (sobytie), and \\"fact\\" (fakt). These were the terms that Stanislavsky chose to use while teaching his system of acting to students at the Opera-Dramatic Studio in Moscow in the final years of his life, when he was concerned about the risk of losing sight of the play as a whole after breaking the action down into small bits. By this time, he was consistently distinguishing between more extended \\"episodes\\" (large bits or \\"events\\") and shorter \\"facts\\" (medium or small bits or \\"events\\"), using the Russian terms he had already employed in his notes and drafts earlier in his career. In Stanislavsky's conception, division into \\"episodes\\" can reveal the basic building-blocks of action, while subdivision into \\"facts\\" can help uncover the changes that occur from one moment to the next. Such divisions can be used to help players explore their characters and discover their actions through improvisation work during the early stages of rehearsal. The frequently used term \\"units\\" derives from the somewhat less intuitive terminology introduced by Stanislavsky's original American translator, Elizabeth Hapgood (a fluent speaker of Russian who had married the diplomat Norman Hapgood). In addition to choosing more abstract terms for her translations, Hapgood was somewhat inconsistent in their use. For example, she sometimes confuses \\"bits\\" (i.e. \\"units\\") with the related \\"tasks\\" that actors must confront in their roles (\\"objective\\" is her translation of zadacha, the Russian for task). The term \\"beats\\" is commonly used in American method acting. The transformation of \\"bits\\" into \\"beats\\" may derive from the pronunciation of √©migr√© Russian teachers in America, possibly in conjunction with the image of a string of \\"beads\\" on a necklace. It has been suggested that oral teachings by Richard Boleslavsky of the Moscow Art Theater, who helped bring Stanislavsky's system to America, may have triggered the persistent mistranslation, and ultimately the metaphor commonly encountered in method acting of the script as a musical score. (Following the 1898 Moscow Art Theatre production of The Seagull, Stanislavsky had himself referred to the detailed production plan that can be made for a play as the directorial score, and later the metaphor was further developed by Jerzy Grotowski, who envisaged a physical score of action.) The word \\"beat\\" is sometimes also employed as a stage direction to indicate a significant pause.

Seleucids  When Judea fell under the authority of the Seleucid Empire, the process of Hellenization was enforced by law. This effectively meant requiring pagan religious practice. In 167 BCE Jewish sacrifice was forbidden, sabbaths and feasts were banned and circumcision was outlawed. Altars to Greek gods were set up and animals prohibited to Jews were sacrificed on them. The Olympian Zeus was placed on the altar of the Temple. Possession of Jewish scriptures was made a capital offense. Roman Empire The Jewish Encyclopaedia refers to the persecution of Jews and the paganisation of Jerusalem during the reign of Emperor Hadrian (117-138 AD): :\\"The Jews now passed through a period of bitter persecution: Sabbaths, festivals, the study of the Torah and circumcision were interdicted, and it seemed as if Hadrian desired to annihilate the Jewish people. His anger fell upon all the Jews of his empire, for he imposed upon them an oppressive poll-tax. The persecution, however, did not last long, for Antoninus Pius (138-161) revoked the cruel edicts.\\"Gottheil, R. and Krauss, S., Hadrian, Jewish Encyclopaedia, 1906, accessed 4 April 2019  Western and  Jews from Worms, Germany wear the mandatory yellow badge. A money bag and garlic in the hands are an antisemitic stereotype (sixteenth-century drawing). In the Middle Ages antisemitism in Europe was religious. Although it is not part of Catholic dogma, many Christians, including members of the clergy, held the Jewish people collectively responsible for killing Jesus. As stated in the Boston College Guide to Passion Plays, \\"Over the course of time, Christians began to accept ‚Ä¶ that the Jewish people as a whole were responsible for killing Jesus. According to this interpretation, both the Jews present at Jesus Christ's death and the Jewish people collectively and for all time, have committed the sin of deicide, or 'god-killing'. For 1900 years of Christian-Jewish history, the charge of deicide has led to hatred, violence against and murder of Jews in Europe and America.\\"Paley, Susan, and Koesters, Adrian Gibbons, eds. \\"A Viewer's Guide to Contemporary Passion Plays\\", accessed March 12, 2006. During the High Middle Ages in Europe there was full-scale persecution of Jews in many places, with blood libels, expulsions, forced conversions and massacres. An underlying source of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious. Jews were frequently massacred and exiled from various European countries. The persecution reached its first peak during the Crusades. In the First Crusade (1096), flourishing communities on the Rhine and the Danube were utterly destroyed, a prime example being the Rhineland massacres. In the Second Crusade (1147) the Jews in France were subject to frequent massacres. The Jews were also subjected to attacks by the Shepherds' Crusades of 1251 and 1320. The Crusades were followed by expulsions, including in 1290, the banishing of all English Jews; in 1396, 100,000 Jews were expelled from France; and, in 1421 thousands were expelled from Austria. Many of the expelled Jews fled to Poland. As the Black Death epidemics devastated Europe in the mid-14th century, annihilating more than a half of the population, Jews were taken as scapegoats. Rumors spread that they caused the disease by deliberately poisoning wells. Hundreds of Jewish communities were destroyed by violence in the Black Death persecutions. Although Pope Clement VI tried to protect them by papal bull on July 6, 1348 - with another following later in 1348 - several months afterwards, 900 Jews were burnt alive in Strasbourg, where the plague hadn't yet affected the city.See St√©phane Barry and Norbert Gualde, La plus grande √©pid√©mie de Histoire (\\"The greatest epidemics in history\\"), in L'Histoire magazine, n¬∞310, June 2006, p.47 One study finds that Jewish persecutions and expulsions increased with negative economic shocks and climactic variations in Europe over the period 1100-1600. The authors of the study argue that this stems from people blaming Jews for misfortunes and weak rulers going after Jewish wealth in times of fiscal crisis. The authors propose several explanations for why Jewish persecutions significantly declined after 1600: * (1) there were simply fewer Jewish communities to persecute by the 17th century; * (2) improved agricultural productivity, or, better-integrated markets may have reduced vulnerability to temperature shocks; * (3) the rise of stronger states may have led to more robust protection for religious and ethnic minorities; * (4) there were fewer negative temperature shocks. * (5) the impact of the Reformation and the Enlightenment may have reduced antisemitic attitudes. In the Papal States, which existed until 1870, Jews were required to live only in specified neighborhoods called ghettos. Until the 1840s, they were required to regularly attend sermons urging their conversion to Christianity. Only Jews were taxed to support state boarding schools for Jewish converts to Christianity. It was illegal to convert from Christianity to Judaism. Sometimes Jews were baptized involuntarily, and, even when such baptisms were illegal, forced to practice the Christian religion. In many such cases, the state separated them from their families, of which the Edgardo Mortara account is one of the most widely publicized instances of acrimony between Catholics and Jews in the Papal States in the second half of the 19th century.   massacre of the Jewish Banu Qurayza in Arabia. According to Mark R. Cohen, during the rise of Islam, the first encounters between Muslims and Jews resulted in friendship when the Jews of Medina gave Muhammad refuge. Conflict arose when Muhammad expelled certain Jewish tribes after they refused to swear their allegiance to him and aided the Meccan Pagans. He adds that this encounter was an exception rather than a rule.Cohen, Mark R. Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages, Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 163. Of the three Jewish tribes of Medina, the Banu Nadir and the Banu Qaynuqa were expelled in the course of Muhammad's rule. On the other hand, the Banu Qurayza tribe was eliminated by Muhammad in the aftermath of the Battle of the Trench. The tribe was accused of colluding with Meccan enemies and besieged. When they surrendered, all grown men were executed and women and children were enslaved.Kister, \\"The Massacre of the Banu Quraiza\\", p. 95f.Rodinson, Muhammad: Prophet of Islam, p. 213. Muhammad is recorded as saying that he would expel all Jews and Christians from Arabia, although this was not carried out until the reign of Umar.Giorgio Levi Della Vida and Michael Bonner, Encyclopaedia of Islam, and Madelung, The Succession to Prophet Muhammad, p. 74 Traditionally, Jews living in Islamic states were subjected to the status of dhimmi, therefore they were allowed to practice their religion and administer their internal affairs but were subjects to certain conditions.Lewis (1984), pp.10,20 They had to pay the jizya (a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males) to Muslims. Dhimmis had an inferior status under Islamic rule. They had several social and legal disabilities such as prohibitions against bearing arms or giving testimony in courts in cases involving Muslims.Lewis (1984), pp. 9,27 Contrary to popular belief, the Qur'an did not order Muslims to force Jews to wear distinctive clothing. Obadiah the Proselyte reported in 1100 AD, that the Caliph had created this rule himself.Scheiber, A. (1954) \\"The Origins of Obadiah, the Norman Proselyte\\" Journal of Jewish Studies London: Oxford University Press. v.5. p.37 Resentment toward Jews perceived as having attained too lofty a position in Islamic society also fueled antisemitism and massacres. In Moorish Spain, ibn Hazm and Abu Ishaq focused their anti-Jewish writings on this allegation. This was also the chief motivation behind the 1066 Granada massacre, when \\"[m]ore than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day\\",Gottheil, Richard and Mayserling, Meyer (1906) \\"Granada\\" in Jewish Encyclopedia and in Fez in 1033, when 6,000 Jews were killed.Morris, Benny (2001) Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist‚ÄìArab Conflict, 1881‚Äì2001. New York:Vintage Books. pp.10‚Äì11. There were further massacres in Fez in 1276 and 1465.Gerber (1986), p. 84 In the Zaydi imamate of Yemen, Jews were also singled out for discrimination in the 17th century, which culminated in the general expulsion of all Jews from places in Yemen to the arid coastal plain of Tihamah and which became known as the Mawza Exile.Qafi·∏•, Yossef (1989) Ketavim (Collected Papers), c.2, Jerusalem, Israel. pp.714-ff. (Hebrew) The Damascus affair occurred in 1840 when a French monk and his servant disappeared in Damascus. Immediately following, a charge of ritual murder was brought against a large number of Jews in the city including children who were tortured. The consuls of the United Kingdom, France and Germany as well as Ottoman authorities, Christians, Muslims and Jews all played a great role in this affair.Frankel, Jonathan (1997) The Damascus Affair: 'Ritual Murder', Politics, and the Jews in 1840 Cambridge, UK:Cambridge University Press. p.1. There was a massacre of Jews in Baghdad in 1828. There was another massacre in Barfurush in 1867. In 1839, in the eastern Persian city of Meshed, a mob burst into the Jewish Quarter, burned the synagogue, and destroyed the Torah scrolls. This is known as the Allahdad incident. Between 30 and 40 people were killed, and it was only by forcible conversion that a large-scale massacre was averted. In Palestine there were riots and pogroms against Jews in 1920 and 1921. Tensions over the Western Wall in Jerusalem led to the 1929 Palestine riots, whose main victims were the ancient Jewish community at Hebron which came to an end. In 1941, following Rashid Ali's pro-Axis coup, riots known as the Farhud broke out in Baghdad in which approximately 180 Jews were killed and about 240 were wounded, 586 Jewish-owned businesses were looted and 99 Jewish houses were destroyed.Levin, Itamar (2001. Locked Doors: The Seizure of Jewish Property in Arab Countries. Praeger/Greenwood. p.6. Border police discovered on March 2, 1974, the bodies of (clockwise from top left: Fara Zeibak, Mazal Zeibak, Eva Saad and Lulu Zeibak, in a cave in the Zabdani Mountains. During the Holocaust, the Middle East was in turmoil. Britain prohibited Jewish immigration to the British Mandate of Palestine. In Cairo the Jewish Lehi (also known as the Stern Gang) assassinated Lord Moyne in 1944 fighting as part of its campaign against British closure of Palestine to Jewish immigration, complicating British-Arab-Jewish relations. While the Allies and the Axis were fighting for the oil-rich region, the Mufti of Jerusalem Amin al-Husayni staged a pro-Nazi coup in Iraq and organized the Farhud pogrom which marked the turning point for about 150,000 Iraqi Jews who, following this event and the hostilities generated by the war with Israel in 1948, were targeted for violence, persecution, boycotts, confiscations, and near complete expulsion in 1951. The coup failed and the mufti fled to Berlin, where he actively supported Hitler. In Egypt, with a Jewish population of about 75,000, young Anwar Sadat was imprisoned for conspiring with the Nazis and promised them that \\"no British soldier would leave Egypt alive\\" (see Military history of Egypt during World War II) leaving the Jews of that region defenseless. In the French Vichy territories of Algeria and Syria, plans were drawn up for the liquidation of their Jewish populations if the Axis powers were triumphant. The tensions which were caused by the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict were also a factor in the rise of animosity towards the Jewish people all over the Middle East, as hundreds of thousands of Jews fled as refugees, the main waves fleeing soon after the 1948 and 1956 wars. In reaction to the Suez Crisis of 1956, the Egyptian government expelled almost 25,000 Egyptian Jews and confiscated their property, and sent approximately 1,000 more Jews to prisons and detention camps. The population of the Jewish communities in Muslim Middle East and North Africa was reduced from about 900,000 in 1948 to less than 8,000 today. On March 2, 1974, the bodies of four Syrian Jewish girls were discovered by border police in a cave in the Zabdani Mountains northwest of Damascus. Fara Zeibak 24, her sisters Lulu Zeibak 23, Mazal Zeibak 22 and their cousin Eva Saad 18, had contracted with a band of smugglers to flee from Syria to Lebanon and eventually to Israel. The girl‚Äôs bodies were found raped, murdered and mutilated. The police also found the remains of two Jewish boys, Natan Shaya 18 and Kassem Abadi 20, victims of an earlier massacre.Friedman, Saul S. (1989). Without Future: The Plight of Syrian Jewry. Praeger Publishers. Syrian authorities deposited the bodies of all six in sacks before the homes of their parents in the Jewish ghetto in Damascus.Le Figaro, March 9, 1974, \\"Quatre femmes juives assassins a Damas,\\" (Paris: International Conference for Deliverance of Jews in the Middle East, 1974), p. 33.  Nazism  Kaunas pogrom in German-occupied Lithuania, June 1941 The persecution of Jews reached its most destructive form in the policies of Nazi Germany, which made the destruction of Jews a priority, culminating in the killing of approximately 6,000,000 Jews during the Holocaust from 1941 to 1945.Dawidowicz, Lucy. The War Against the Jews, Bantam, 1986.p. 403 Originally, the Nazis used death squads, the Einsatzgruppen, to conduct massive open-air killings of Jews who lived in the territories which they had conquered. By 1942, the Nazi leadership decided to implement the Final Solution, the genocide of the Jews of Europe, and increase the pace of the Holocaust by establishing extermination camps for the specific purpose of killing Jews as well as other undesirables such as people who openly opposed Hitler.Manvell, Roger Goering New York:1972 Ballantine Books ‚Äì War Leader Book #8 Ballantine's Illustrated History of the Violent Century This was an industrial method of genocide. Millions of Jews who had been confined to diseased and massively overcrowded ghettos were transported (often by train) to death camps, where some were herded into a specific location (often a gas chamber), then killed with either gassing or shooting. Other prisoners simply committed suicide, unable to go on after witnessing the horrors of camp life. Afterward, their bodies were often searched for any valuable or useful materials, such as gold fillings or hair, and their remains were then buried in mass graves or burned. Others were interned in the camps where they were given little food and disease was common.Berenbaum, Michael. The World Must Know,\\" United States Holocaust Museum, 2006, p. 103. Escapes from the camps were few, but not unknown. The few escapes from Auschwitz that succeeded were made possible by the Polish underground inside the camp and local people outside.Linn, Ruth. Escaping Auschwitz. A culture of forgetting, Cornell University Press, 2004, p. 20. In 1940, the Auschwitz commandant reported that \\"the local population is fanatically Polish and ‚Ä¶ prepared to take any action against the hated SS camp personnel. Every prisoner who managed to escape can count on help the moment he reaches the wall of the first Polish farmstead.\\"Swiebocki, Henryk. \\"Prisoner Escapes,\\" in Berenbaum, Michael & Gutman, Yisrael (eds). Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp, Indiana University Press and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 1994, p. 505.  Russia and the Soviet Union  =Tsarist Russia= For much of the 19th century, Imperial Russia, which included much of Poland, Ukraine, Moldova and the Baltic states, contained the world's largest Jewish population. From Alexander III's reign until the end of Tsarist rule in Russia, many Jews were often restricted to the Jewish Pale of Settlement and they were also banned from many jobs and locations. Jews were subject to racist laws, such as the May Laws, and they were also targeted in hundreds of violent anti-Jewish riots, called pogroms, which received unofficial state support. It was during this period that a hoax document alleging a global Jewish conspiracy, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, was published. The Czarist government implemented programs which ensured that the Jews would remain isolated. However, the government tolerated their religious and national institutions as well as their right to emigrate. The restrictions and discriminatory laws drove many Russian Jews to embrace liberal and socialist causes. However, following the Russian Revolution many politically active Jews forfeited their Jewish identity. According to Leon Trotsky, > [Jews] considered themselves neither Jews nor Russians but socialists. To > them, Jews were not a nation but a class of exploiters whose fate it was to > dissolve and assimilate. In the aftermath of Czarist Russia, Jews found themselves in a tragic predicament. Conservative Russians saw them as a disloyal and subversive element and the radicals viewed the Jews as a doomed social class. =Soviet Union= Even though many of the Old Bolsheviks were ethnically Jewish, they sought to uproot Judaism and Zionism and established the Yevsektsiya in order to achieve this goal. By the end of the 1940s, the Communist leadership of the former USSR had liquidated almost all Jewish organizations, with the exception of a few token synagogues. These synagogues were then placed under police surveillance, both openly and through the use of informants. The campaign of 1948‚Äì1953 against so-called \\"rootless cosmopolitans,\\" the alleged \\"Doctors' plot,\\" the rise of \\"Zionology\\" and subsequent activities of official organizations such as the Anti-Zionist committee of the Soviet public were officially carried out under the banner of \\"anti-Zionism\\", and by the mid-1950s the state persecution of Soviet Jews emerged as a major human rights issue in the West as well as domestically. Apartheid South Africa During the 1930s, many Nationalist Party leaders and wide sections of the Afrikaner people came strongly under the influence of the Nazi movement which dominated Germany from 1933 to 1945. There were many reasons for this. Germany was the traditional enemy of Britain, and whoever opposed Britain was seen as a friend of the Nationalists. Many Nationalists, moreover, believed that the opportunity to re-establish their lost republic would come with the defeat of the British Empire in the international arena. The more belligerent Hitler became, the higher hopes rose that a new era of Afrikanerdom was about to dawn. The National Party of D F Malan closely associated itself with the policies of the Nazis. Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe was controlled under the Aliens Act and it soon came to an end during this period. Although Jews were accorded status as Europeans, they were not accepted into white society. Many Jews lived in mixed race areas such as District Six, from where they were forcibly removed in order to make way for a whites-only development. Another organization with which the Nationalists found much in common during the thirties was the 'South African Gentile National Socialist Movement', headed by Johannes von Strauss von Moltke, whose objective was to combat and destroy the alleged 'perversive influence of the Jews in economics, culture, religion, ethics, and statecraft and re-establish European Aryan control in South Africa for the welfare of the Christian peoples of South Africa'. During the 1960s, Oswald Mosley, the British fascist leader, was a frequent visitor to South Africa, where he was received by the Prime Minister and other members of the Cabinet. At one time, Mosley had two functioning branches of his organization in South Africa, and one of his supporters, Derek Alexander, was stationed in Johannesburg as his main agent. Upon Verwoerd's assassination in 1966, BJ Vorster was elected by the National Party to replace him. While Vorster had been a supporter of Hitler during WWII, his policy towards Jews in his own country, however, can best be described as ambivalent. The 1980s saw the rise of far-right neo-Nazi groups such as the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging under Eugene Terreblanche. The AWB modeled itself after Hitler's National Socialist Party replete with fascist regalia and an emblem resembling the swastika.

It is bounded by Van Cortlandt Park and Woodlawn Cemetery to the north, the Bronx River to the east, and Mosholu Parkway to the southwest. The area is dominated topographically by what was once known as Valentine's Hill, the highest point being near the intersection of 210th Street and Bainbridge Avenue, where Gun Hill Road intersects, and around the Montefiore Medical Center, the largest landowner and employer of the neighborhood. Norwood's main commercial arteries are Gun Hill Road, Jerome Avenue, Webster Avenue, and Bainbridge Avenue. The neighborhood is part of Bronx Community District 7 and is patrolled by the NYPD's 52nd Precinct. As of the 2000 United States Census, the seven census tracts that make up the neighborhood had a population of 40,748. Name Due to its use in city publications, subway maps, and local media, \\"Norwood\\" is the neighborhood's more common name, but the area is also known as \\"Bainbridge,\\" most consistently within the neighborhood's formerly Irish American community that is centered on the commercial zone of Bainbridge Avenue and East 204th Street. However, as this Irish community largely left the country during the 1990s, and Irish Americans moved out of the area, the name \\"Bainbridge\\" has accordingly lost a great deal of currency. Even the name \\"Norwood\\" does not carry a great deal of currency as do nearby neighborhoods such as Riverdale and Woodlawn., p. 855; History At the time of the Civil War, the area was Westchester County farmland on the border of West Farms and Yonkers. Chief property owners included the Valentine, Varian, and Bussing families. Woodlawn Cemetery was founded in 1863 to the north. Annexed to New York City in 1873 along with the rest of the West Bronx, the area's character shifted from rural to suburban by the turn of the 20th century. The neighborhood's streets in their present form were laid out in 1889 by Josiah Briggs between Middlebrook Parkway (renamed Mosholu Parkway) and Woodlawn Cemetery. Contemporary maps show that it was then considered part of Williamsbridge, with which it continues to share a post office. Williamsbridge Reservoir was opened in 1890, transforming the natural lake into an artery that served the New York City water supply system until no longer needed in 1934. A tract of land, known as \\"Columbia Oval\\" was owned by Columbia University at GunHill Road and Bainbridge Avenue. Columbia Oval was used for sporting events including the first United States marathon (40 km), from Stamford, Connecticut in 1896. (The winner of that marathon was John McDermott, who later won the first Boston marathon.) Columbia Oval became the site of Columbia University's War Hospital, which was taken over by the United States Army as \\"U.S. Army General Hospital No. 1\\" during the World War I. The area went through a series of names around the turn of the 20th century, including North Bedford Park, after the neighborhood to the south, and Brendan Hill, after St. Brendan the Navigator and the parish church, established in 1908, that bears his name. The name Brendan Hill was made official by the Board of Aldermen in 1910.John McNamara, A History in Asphalt (Bronx, NY: The Bronx County Historical Society, 1984). . Norwood, the name with greatest common currency, is first attributed in the form Norwood Heights‚Äîeither in honor of Carlisle Norwood, a friend of Leonard Jerome, or simply a contraction of \\"North Woods\\", common to a number of places in the English-speaking world. In the first half of the 20th century Norwood shared with the rest of the Bronx a population made up largely of European-origin Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish families affluent enough to leave Manhattan. These populations were joined by Puerto Ricans during the Great Depression and post World War II eras, and, post-1965, by other Latinos (especially Dominicans), Bangladeshis, Albanians, West Indians (especially Guyanese), West Africans (especially Ghanaians), and a new group of Irish immigrants. = Irish population = In the 1970s through the 1990s the neighborhood was well known for its Irish and Irish American population, having attracted a number of immigrants from Catholic areas of Northern Ireland who fled the Troubles, and others seeking work. During this time that the neighborhood became known by two more names: Bainbridge, after the Bainbridge Avenue ‚Äì East 204th Street commercial strip ‚Äì included Irish restaurants, groceries, and pubs, and Little Belfast, after the city from which many immigrants came. The area contributed much in Irish and Irish- American culture and politics during this time. The musical group Black 47, made up of Irish expatriates, first made their name touring the bar scene here. Their lyrics would go on to reflect the experiences of the Irish in the area, in such songs as \\"Funky Ce√≠l√≠,\\" \\"Her Dear Donegal,\\" and \\"Rockin' the Bronx.\\" Irish pubs in the area attracted press attention as centers of strong support for Irish republicanism, which supports ending the remaining British rule in Ireland. A few pubs hosted benefits for Noraid, the Northern Irish Aid Committee, accused by Unionists of gun running for the Irish Republican Army (IRA). At least one area bar, The Phoenix, was raided by law enforcement in 1994, with Irish authorities simultaneously raiding its owner's holiday home in Donegal. Thomas Maguire, the owner, and five others, were charged with smuggling thousands of bomb detonators to Ireland from Tucson via New York. A jury found the defendants not guilty on all counts.Andrew J. Wilson, Irish America and the Ulster Conflict (1995: Catholic University of America Press, 1995). ix. . A number of factors have contributed to the decline of the Irish population in Bainbridge. The most critical was the downturn in the US economy which forced many Irish immigrants to return to Ireland or to seek work in Germany (whose reunification process coincided with the American recession). A substantial portion of the Irish population were illegally in the country, and thus subject to INS investigation and deportation. The end of the Troubles period, with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, encouraged some residents to return voluntarily to Ireland, particularly with the improvement of the northern economy. The growth of the economy of the Republic of Ireland ‚Äì the so-called \\"Celtic Tiger\\" ‚Äì persuaded some residents to move there. Others have continued to live in New York, moving to the Bronx neighborhoods of Riverdale and Woodlawn Heights, or to nearby Yonkers. The same factors which encouraged return to Ireland have also discouraged further immigration to Bainbridge. Most of the Irish American residents moved out of the area due to over-population and the area becoming an economically depressed neighborhood. Irish pubs were replaced by \\"99 Cent\\" stores. The last Irish pub, McDwyers Pub, closed down in 2011.  Demographics  Storefronts along East 204th Street =2010 Census= Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Norwood was 40,494, a decrease of 323 (0.8%) from the 40,817 counted in 2000.

Since the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE, there has been no single body that has a leadership position over the entire Jewish diaspora. Various branches of Judaism, as well as Jewish religious or secular communities and political movements around the world elect or appoint their governing bodies, often subdivided by country or region.  Historic leadership  =Biblical leadership (before 70 CE)= During the era of the Tanakh, various forms of leadership developed. There were the heads of the original Hebrew tribes, and then also prophets such as Moses, Jeremiah and Samuel and whose words inspire people to this day, judges such as Samson, kings such as David and Solomon, priests of the Temple in Jerusalem, and the Sanhedrin which was the judiciary. =Mishnaic, Talmudic, Middle Ages leadership (70 to 17th century)= With the demise of ancient kingdoms of Israel and Judah and coinciding with the revolt of the Maccabees against ancient Greece and later Jewish-Roman wars, the sages of the Mishnah and subsequently the Talmud, referred to as the Oral Law in Judaism, took on a growing and central leadership role. After the destruction of the Second Temple and the subsequent exile for almost two thousand years, the Jews scattered throughout the world turned to their most learned rabbis for local leadership and council. During Bar Kokhba's revolt against Roman Empire (132-135), the supreme religious authority Rabbi Akiva sanctioned Simon bar Kokhba to be a war leader, whereas during the 2nd century Judah haNasi was not only the supreme temporal leader sanctioned by Rome, but also edited the original work of the Mishnah which became the \\"de facto constitution\\" of the world's Jewry. The final editions of the Talmud became the core curriculum of the majority of Jews. In Babylonia the Exilarch was almost always a rabbinical personality. The Geonim such as Saadia Gaon (892-942) were not only great sages but also political guides. The writings and rulings of those such as Rashi (1040‚Äì1105), Maimonides (1135‚Äì1204), Yosef Karo (1488‚Äì1575) who published the most widely accepted code of Jewish law the Shulkhan Arukh, Isaac Luria (1534‚Äì1572), the Vilna Gaon (1720‚Äì1797), the Chafetz Chaim (1838‚Äì1933) and many others have shaped Jewish law for almost two thousand years, as their religious rulings were published, distributed, studied, and observed until the present time. =Early modern leadership (18th and 19th centuries)= The loose collection of learned rabbis that governed the dispersed Jewish community held sway for a long time. Great parts of Central Europe accepted the leadership of the rabbinical Council of Four Lands from the 16th to the late 18th centuries. In the Eastern Europe, in spite of the rivalry between the schools of thought of the Vilna Gaon (or the GRA, Rabbi Elijah ben Solomon, 1720‚Äì1797) of the Mitnagdim, who spoke against Hasidic Judaism and Baal Shem Tov (Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer, 1700‚Äì1760), the founder of Hasidic Judaism, rabbis were regarded as the final arbiters of community decisions. Tens of thousands of Responsa and many works were published and studied wherever Jews lived in organized communities. In Western Europe, especially in monarchies, where no equal rights were granted for the Jewish population, radical Maskilim defined the new role of religion as an education of just citizens ‚Äî like Moses Mendelssohn in his book Jerusalem or On Religious Power and Judaism which was a response to the Prussian reformer Christian Wilhelm von Dohm. The radical tendency of the pedagogic movement went so far, that Mendelssohn's student David Friedl√§nder identified Judaism with the seclusion of modern European culture and secular Judaism could end up in conversion to the religion of the unsecularized state. In contradiction to his teacher early modern leadership turned out to be misled leadership, whose followers ended up as \\"Jewish citizens without any conscience\\". Modern religious leadership (after 19th century) =Decline of rabbinical influence= With the growth of the Renaissance and the development of the secular modern world, and as Jews were welcomed into non-Jewish society particularly during the times of Napoleon in the 18th and 19th centuries, Jews began to leave the Jewish ghettos in Europe, and simultaneously rejected the traditional roles of the rabbis as communal and religious leaders. New leaders such as Israel Jacobson, father of the German Reform Judaism movement, launched an egalitarian, modernist stance that challenged the Orthodoxy. The resulting fractures in Jewish society has translated into a situation whereby there is no single religious governing body for the entire Jewish community at the present time. =Modern Synagogue leadership= In individual religious congregations or synagogues, the spiritual leader is generally the rabbi. Rabbis are expected to be taught in both the Talmud and the Shulkhan Arukh (Code of Jewish Law) as well as many other classical texts of Jewish scholarship. Rabbis go through formal training in Rabbinical texts and responsa, either at a yeshiva or similar institution. \\"Rabbi\\" is not a universal term however, as many Sephardic rabbinic Jewish communities refer to their leaders as hakham (\\"wise man\\"). Among Yemenite Jews, known as Teimanim, the term mori (\\"my teacher\\") is used. Each religious tradition has its own qualifications for rabbis; for more information, see Semicha (\\"ordination\\"). In addition to the rabbi, most synagogues have a hazzan (cantor) who leads many parts of the prayer service. =Orthodox and Haredi rabbinic leadership= In Israel the office of Chief Rabbi ~~~~has always been very influential. Various Orthodox movements, such as Agudath Israel of America and the Shas party in Israel strictly follow the rulings of their Rosh yeshivas who are often famous Talmud scholars. The last Rebbe of Lubavitch, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the late Rabbi Elazar Menachem Shach, and Rabbi Ovadia Yosef in Israel are examples of powerful contemporary Haredi rabbis. The Haredi Agudah movements receive and follow the policy guidelines of their own Council of Torah Sages. In the Hassidic movements, leadership is usually hereditary. =Reform, Progressive, Liberal, Conservative, and Reconstructionist leadership= :Main articles: Conservative rabbis, Reform rabbis, Reconstructionist rabbis In both the Reform and Conservative of Judaism, rabbis are often trained at religious universities, such as the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City for the Conservative movement, Hebrew Union College for the American Reform movement, and Leo Baeck College for the UK Liberal and Reform Movements. The Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist traditions each have their own governing group or individual leaders. Membership in these governing groups are selected by representatives of the Jewish community they serve, with Jewish scholarship considered to be the key factors for determining leaders. These governing bodies make decisions on the nature of religious practice within their tradition, as well as ordaining and assigning rabbis and other religious leaders. The Union of Reform Judaism (URJ), the synagogue arm of the Reform Movement in North America, is governed by a 253-member Board of Trustees in close partnership with URJ Chair Daryl Messinger, URJ President Rabbi Rick Jacobs, and the senior leadership team. Delegates from URJ congregations meet once every two years for the URJ General Assembly to pass resolutions that guide the organization's future direction. The body of Conservative rabbis is the Rabbinical Assembly, which maintains a Committee on Jewish Law and Standards. The body of Reform rabbis is the Central Conference of American Rabbis. Secular leadership Following the Renaissance and the Enlightenment in Europe (with its Jewish \\"extension\\" the Haskalah movement, which led to much modern-day assimilation into the cultures of their native countries), the variety of Jewish practice grew, with a widespread adoption of secular values and life-styles. Many modern Jewish communities are served by a variety of secular organizations at the local, national, and international levels. These organizations have no official role in religious life, but often play an important part in the Jewish community. Most of the largest groups, such as Hadassah and the United Jewish Communities, have an elected leadership. No one secular group represents the entire Jewish community, and there is often significant internal debate among Jews about the stances these organizations take on affairs dealing with the Jewish community as a whole, such as antisemitism and Israeli policies. In the United States and Canada today, the mainly secular United Jewish Communities (UJC), formerly known as the United Jewish Appeal (UJA), represents over 150 Jewish Federations and 400 independent communities across North America. Every major American city has its local \\"Jewish Federation\\", and many have sophisticated community centers and provide services, mainly health care-related. They raise record sums of money for philanthropic and humanitarian causes in North America and Israel. Additional local organizations include Jewish Family Services, Jewish nursing homes and Jewish community foundations. Other organizations such as the Anti- Defamation League, American Jewish Congress, American Jewish Committee, and the B'nai B'rith represent different segments of the American Jewish community on a variety of issues. Karaite leadership A Karaite synagogue is run by a board of directors, and its spiritual leader is often called a Hakham, the equivalent of a \\"rabbi\\", and matches one in function. The Gabbai is the treasurer, the Shammash is the custodian, the Hazzan leads prayers, and in some the Ba'al Qeri'ah leads in the reading of the Torah. In America, Karaites are represented by the Karaite Jews of America, and in Israel they are represented.

It was founded by three people, Leslie Illsley, Jan Thompson and Benny Sirota who took over the Powell and Wells Pottery at Wheal Dream, where Sirota had previously worked as a decorator and driver. The name is from the Russian , meaning \\"a set of three\\", or triumvirate. History Troika Pottery sign Troika was set up in February 1962 by Leslie Illsley, Jan Thompson and Benny Sirota who took over the Powell and Wells Pottery at Wheal Dream, St Ives, Cornwall, where Benny Sirota had previously worked. They wanted to pursue their vision of pottery as art, without regard to function. This ran counter to the aims of much of the studio pottery movement at the time, as epitomised by the work of Bernard Leach. They initially relied on the ceramics of Leslie's wife, Caroline (Kingston School of Art). This included the novel double egg cup.Photograph shows sign at 1 Island Road St Ives where Caroline's mother lived The venture rapidly became successful, gaining both critical praise and very high sales through a combination of the summer tourist trade and contracts with department stores such as Heals and Liberty in London. Vases, lamp bases and tableware were made using plaster moulds; tiles and wall plaques were also made in the early years. The Troika pottery was based at the Wheal Dream site in St Ives from 1962 to 1970, when it moved to Fragden Place in Newlyn. Benny Sirota left in 1980, and with declining sales, the business closed in 1983. From 19 January to 9 March 2013, an exhibition, Troika 1963-1983, was held at the Penlee House Gallery and Museum Penzance, celebrating 50 years since the inception of Troika, which included a number of prototypes by Leslie Illsley. Benny Sirota attended the opening, and explained the origin of the company's name: \\"my grandfather escaped from Russia dressed as a woman on a troika ‚Äì a sledge with three horses...there were three of us who started the firm ‚Äì and it just gelled.\\" Ranges Troika had two distinct ranges of ceramics ‚Äî the rough textured wares and the smooth glazed wares. Although there was some crossover in shapes and styles between these ranges, they each had different characters and different successes. A number of examples can be found in the V&A; collection.

It is traditionally performed by men, though there are some female performers in the modern era. The name derives from the monosyllabic vocables (non-lexical vocalizations), tra-la-la. In the 1950s, American musicologist Alan Lomax and Diego Carpitella recorded trallalero. Lomax later claimed he was blown away, and called it the most significant work in his long and storied career. Edward Neill worked to revitalize the tradition in the middle of the 20th century. Trallalero groups consist of tenor, baritone and bass parts, accompanied by a contralto and a singer whose voice imitates a guitar (chitarra). As the names of parts suggest, the imitation of instrumental styles replaces traditional vocal polyphony: this is a distinguishing feature of this genre. Nine singers are considered a normal line-up: one each of chitarra, tenor, contralto, baritone and five basses. Group harmony in Liguria is historically associated with mountain villages, where two voices (usually a tenor and a baritone) sung over accompaniment by bass or drone. A repertoire of traditional songs evolved over time, and the style moved to the docks of Genoa, a noted port city. There, metal-workers, longshoremen and stevedores sang trallalero, with the practice peaking in the first three decades of the 20th century. Some trallalero groups are still existing in Genoa and Liguria. External links *Mustrad.org.uk Review by Rod Stradling of trallalero recordings by Alan Lomax, with much background information.

Cisterns are often built to catch and store rainwater. Cisterns are distinguished from wells by their waterproof linings. Modern cisterns range in capacity from a few litres to thousands of cubic metres, effectively forming covered reservoirs.  Origins  = Early domestic and agricultural use = Ancient Buddhist rock-hewn cistern at Pavurallakonda in India Waterproof lime plaster cisterns in the floors of houses are features of Neolithic village sites of the Levant at, for instance, Ramad and Lebwe,Robert Miller, \\"Water use in Syria and Palestine from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age\\", World Archaeology, 2.3 (February 1980:331-341) p. 334. and by the late fourth millennium BC, as at Jawa in northeastern Lebanon, cisterns are essential elements of emerging water management techniques in dry-land farming communities. = Castle cisterns = One of the Cisterns of La Malga, Carthage, 1930 In the Middle Ages, cisterns were often constructed in hill castles in Europe, especially where wells could not be dug deeply enough. There were two types: the tank cistern and the filter cistern. Such a filter cistern was built at the Riegersburg in Austrian Styria, where a cistern was hewn out of the lava rock. Rain water passed through a sand filter and collected in the cistern. The filter cleaned the rain water and enriched it with minerals.  Present-day use  Concrete cistern Cisterns are commonly prevalent in areas where water is scarce, either because it is rare or has been depleted due to heavy use. Historically, the water was used for many purposes including cooking, irrigation, and washing. Present-day cisterns are often used only for irrigation due to concerns over water quality. Cisterns today can also be outfitted with filters or other water purification methods when the water is intended for consumption. It is not uncommon for a cistern to be open in some manner in order to catch rain or to include more elaborate rainwater harvesting systems. It is important in these cases to have a system that does not leave the water open to algae or to mosquitoes, which are attracted to the water and then potentially carry disease to nearby humans. Some cisterns sit on the top of houses or on the ground higher than the house, and supply the running water needs for the house. They are often supplied not by rainwater harvesting, but by wells with electric pumps, or are filled manually or by truck delivery. Very common throughout Brazil, for example, they were traditionally made of concrete walls (much like the houses themselves), with a similar concrete top (about 5 cm/2 inches thick), with a piece that can be removed for water filling and then reinserted to keep out debris and insects. Modern cisterns are manufactured of plastic (in Brazil with a characteristic bright blue color, round, in capacities of about 10,000 and 50,000 liters (2641 and 13,208 gallons)). These cisterns differ from water tanks in the sense that they are not entirely enclosed and sealed with one form, rather they have a lid made of the same material as the cistern, which is removable by the user. To keep a clean water supply, the cistern must be kept clean. It is important to inspect them regularly, keep them well enclosed, and to occasionally empty and clean them with a proper dilution of chlorine and to rinse them well. Well water must be inspected for contaminants coming from the ground source. City water has up to 1ppm (parts per million) chlorine added to the water to keep it clean, and in many areas can be ordered to be delivered directly to the cistern by truck (a typical price in Brazil is BRL$50, US$20 for 10,000 liters). If there is any question about the water supply at any point (source to tap), then the cistern water should not be used for drinking or cooking. If it is of acceptable quality and consistency, then it can be used for (1) toilets, and housecleaning; (2) showers and handwashing; (3) washing dishes, with proper sanitation methods, and for the highest quality, (4) cooking and drinking. Water of non-acceptable quality for the aforementioned uses may still be used for irrigation. If it is free of particulates but not low enough in bacteria, then boiling may also be an effective method to prepare the water for drinking. Bermuda's white-stepped roofs for collecting rainwater channeled into cisterns Many greenhouses rely on a cistern to help meet their water needs, particularly in the United States. Some countries or regions, such as Bermuda and the U.S. Virgin Islands, have strict laws requiring that rainwater harvesting systems be built alongside any new construction, and cisterns can be used in these cases. In Bermuda, for example, its familiar white-stepped roofs seen on houses are part of the rainwater collection system, where water is channeled by roof gutters to below-ground cisterns. Other countries, such as Japan, Germany, and Spain, also offer financial incentives or tax credit for installing cisterns. Cisterns may also be used to store water for firefighting in areas where there is an inadequate water supply. The city of San Francisco, notably, maintains fire cisterns under its streets in case the primary water supply is disrupted. In many flat areas the use of cisterns is encouraged to absorb excess rainwater which otherwise can overload sewage or drainage systems by heavy rains (certainly in urban areas where a lot of ground is surfaced and doesn't let the ground absorb water). Bathing In some southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia showers are traditionally taken by pouring water over one's body with a dipper (this practice comes from before piped water was common). Many bathrooms even in modern houses are constructed with a small cistern to hold water for bathing by this method.  Toilet cisterns  221x221px The modern water closet or toilet utilises a cistern to reserve and hold the correct amount of water required to flush the toilet bowl. In earlier toilets, the cistern was located high above the toilet bowl and connected to it by a long pipe. It was necessary to pull a hanging chain connected to a release valve located inside the cistern in order to flush the toilet. Modern toilets may be close coupled, with the cistern mounted directly on the toilet bowl and no intermediate pipe. In this arrangement, the flush mechanism (lever or push button) is usually mounted on the cistern. Concealed cistern toilets, where the cistern is built into the wall behind the toilet, are also available. A flushing trough is a type of cistern used to serve more than one WC pan at one time. These cisterns are becoming less common however. The cistern was the genesis of the modern bidet. At the beginning of the flush cycle, as the water level in the toilet cistern tank drops, the flush valve flapper falls back to the bottom, stopping the main flow to the flush tube. Because the tank water level has yet to reach the fill line, water continues to flow from the tank and bowl fill tubes. When the water again reaches the fill line, the float will release the fill valve shaft and water flow will stop.  One Million Cisterns Program  One Million Cisterns Program (Programa 1 Milh√£o de Cisternas‚ÄìP1MC) is one of the important grassroots innovations in northeastern Brazil that has assisted local people on water management. In 2003, the Brazilian government adopted this new concept of Rain Water Harvest (RWH) and made a policy of P1MC. The Semi-Arid Articulation (ASA) has been providing managerial and technological support to establish cement-layered containers, called cisterns, to harvest and store rainwater for small farm-holders in 34 territories of nine states where ASA operates (MG, BA, SE, AL, PE, PB, RN, CE and PI). The rainwater falling on the rooftops are passed through pipelines or gutters and stored in the cistern. The cistern is covered with a lid to avoid evapotranspiration. Each cistern has a capacity of 16,000 liters. Water collected in it during 3-4 months of the rainy season can sustain the requirement for drinking, cooking, and other basic sanitation purposes for rest of the dry periods. By 2016, 1.2 million RWH cisterns were implemented for human consumption alone. After positive results of P1MC, the government introduced another program named ‚ÄúOne Land, Two Water Program‚Äù (Uma Terra, Duas √Åguas, P1 + 2), which provides a farmer with another slab cistern to support agricultural production.

They have happened as a product of historical accident, geography, and theology. Samaritans The Samaritans are an ethnoreligious group of the Levant originating from the Israelites (or Hebrews) of the Ancient Near East. Ancestrally, Samaritans claim descent from the Tribe of Ephraim and Tribe of Manasseh (two sons of Joseph) as well as from the Levites,The Samaritan Update Retrieved 1 January 2017. who have links to ancient Samaria from the period of their entry into Canaan, while some Orthodox Jews suggest that it was from the beginning of the Babylonian captivity up to the Samaritan polity under the rule of Baba Rabba. According to Samaritan tradition, the split between them and the Judean-led Southern Israelites began during the biblical time of the priest Eli when the Southern Israelites split off from the central Israelite tradition, as they perceive it. They consider themselves to be B'nei Yisrael ('Children of Israel'), a term used universally by Jewish denominations for the Jewish people as a whole, but do not call themselves Yehudim. The word Yehudim comes from the Hebrew word Yehudi which means from the Tribe of Judah. First Temple era The biblical narrative describes the split by the Kingdom of Israel from the Kingdom of Judah.1 Kings 12 It points to Solomon's unfaithfulness to the divine covenant as the reason for the schism.1 Kings 11 When Rehoboam, Solomon's son, became king, the people requested tax reform. Rehoboam refused. This caused the break. At first, Rehoboam considered a military solution but the prophet Shemaiah told him not fight because God had caused the schism. Jeroboam, the leader of the tax revolt, became the leader of the Kingdom of Israel. After the destruction and exile of the Kingdom of Israel by Assyria, non-Yahwistic practices continued. The narratives of Jeremiah and others interpreted this as the cause of the failure, destruction, and exile of the Kingdom of Judah by Babylonia. Nebuchadnezzar had additional reasons for taking over Judah and turning its inhabitants into exiles, including challenging its great rival Egypt. Second Temple period Conflicts between Pharisees and Sadducees took place in the context of much broader and longstanding social and religious conflicts among Jews, made worse by the Roman occupation. Another conflict was cultural, between those who favored Hellenization (the Sadducees) and those who resisted it (the Pharisees). A third was juridico-religious, between those who emphasized the importance of the Second Temple with its rites and services, and those who emphasized the importance of other Mosaic Laws. A fourth point of conflict, specifically religious, involved different interpretations of the Torah and how to apply it to current Jewish life, with Sadducees recognizing only the Written Torah (with Greek philosophy) and rejecting doctrines such as the Oral Torah, the Prophets, the Writings, and the resurrection of the dead. According to Josephus, the Sadducees differed from the Pharisees on a number of doctrinal grounds, notably rejecting ideas of life after death. They appear to have dominated the aristocracy and the temple, but their influence over the wider Jewish population was limited. The Essenes preached a reclusive way of life. The Zealots advocated armed rebellion against any foreign power such as Rome. All were at violent loggerheads with each other, leading to the confusion and disunity that ended with the destruction of the Second Temple and the sacking of Jerusalem by Rome. Split of early Christianity and Judaism Ecclesia and Synagoga by Konrad Witz (1400‚Äì1447). The first Christians (whom historians refer to as Jewish Christians) were the original Jewish followers of Jesus, a Galilean preacher and, according to early Christian belief, the resurrected messiah. After his crucifixion by the Romans, his followers broke over whether they should continue to observe Jewish law, such as at the Council of Jerusalem. Those who argued that the law was abrogated (either partially or fully, either by Jesus or Paul or by the Roman destruction of the Temple) broke to form Christianity.This theory regarding the law and the birth of Christianity is not supported by the New Testament book of Acts. In Acts, the law becomes an issue after Christianity is already born by the events of Pentecost. See Acts 2. The eventual repudiation of Moses' Law by Jesus' disciples and their belief in his divinity, along with the development of the New Testament, ensured that Christianity and Judaism would become different and often conflicting religions. The New Testament depicts the Sadducees and Pharisees as Jesus' opponents (see Woes of the Pharisees), whereas the Jewish perspective has the Pharisees as the justified predecessors of the rabbis who upheld the Torah including the Oral law, which Christians refer to as the Mosaic Law or Pentateuch or \\"Old Covenant\\" in contrast to the \\"New Covenant\\". Karaite Judaism Karaite Kenesa, Kiev, Ukraine. Karaite Judaism is a Jewish denomination characterized by reliance on the Tanakh as the sole source of binding Jewish Law. Karaites rejected the rabbinic tenet that an Oral Torah (oral law) was transmitted to Moses at Mount Sinai along with the written scriptures. Accordingly, they rejected the central works of Rabbinic Judaism which claimed to expound and interpret this written law, including the Midrash and the Talmud, as authoritative on questions of Jewish law. Karaites had a wide following between the 9th and 12th centuries (they claim that at one time they numbered perhaps 10 percent of Jewry), but over the centuries their numbers have dwindled drastically. Today they are a small group, living mostly in Israel; estimates of the number of Israeli Karaites range from as low as 10,000 to as high as 50,000.Judaism, continued... from Adherents.comKaraims of Israel qumran.com qumran.com There is a divergence of views about the historical origins of Karaite Judaism. Most scholars and some Karaites maintain that it was founded at least in part by Anan ben David, whereas other Karaites believe that they are not the historical disciples of Anan ben David at all, and point out that many of their later sages (such as Ya'acov Al- Kirkisani) argued that most of Anan's teachings were \\"derived from Rabbanite Lore\\". The state of Israel, along with its Chief Rabbinate, ruled that Karaites are Jews, and while critical differences between Orthodox Judaism and Karaite Judaism exist, American Orthodox rabbis ruled that Karaism is much closer to Orthodoxy than the Conservative and Reform movements, which may ease issues of formal conversion. Sabbateans and Frankists Sabbatai Zevi crowned as the messiah. Amsterdam, 1666. In 1648 Shabtai Tzvi declared himself to be the long-awaited Jewish Messiah whilst living in the Ottoman Empire. Vast numbers of Jews, known as Sabbateans, believed him; but when under pain of a death sentence in front of the Turkish sultan Mehmed IV he became an apostate from Judaism by becoming a Muslim, his movement crumbled. Nevertheless, for centuries, small groups of Jews believed in him, and the rabbis were always on guard against any manifestations of this schism, always suspicious of hidden \\"Shebselach\\" (Yiddish for \\"little Sabbatians\\", a play on the word for \\"young dumb sheep\\"). Indeed, when the movement of Hasidism began attracting many followers, the rabbis were once again suspicious that this was Sabbatianism in different garb. It would take many centuries to sort out these complex divisions and schisms and see where they were headed. After his mysterious death somewhere in the area of Turkish Albania, groups of Jews continued to be clandestine followers of Shabtai Tzvi even though they had outwardly converted to Islam, these Jews being known as the Donmeh. Jewish converts to Islam were, at times, therefore regarded with great suspicion by their fellow Muslims. A few decades after Shabtai's death, a man by the name of Jacob Frank claiming mystical powers preached that he was Shabtai Tzvi's successor. He attracted a following, preached against the Talmud, advocated a form of licentious worship, and was condemned by the rabbis at the time. When confronted by the Polish authorities, he converted to Catholicism in 1759 in the presence of King Augustus III of Poland, together with groups of his Jewish followers, known as \\"Frankists\\". To the alarm of his opponents, he was received by reigning European monarchs who were anxious to see their Jewish subjects abandon Judaism and apostacise. The Frankists eventually joined the Polish nobility and gentry. Hasidim and Mitnagdim Rabbi Elijah ben Shlomo Zalman, the Vilna Gaon, leader of the Mitnagdim Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, founder of Chabad-Lubavitch Israel ben Eliezer (1698‚Äì1760), also known as the Baal Shem Tov ('Master [of the] Good Name'), changed much of Jewish history in Eastern Europe for what is now known as Haredi Judaism. His teachings were based on the earlier expositions of Rabbi Isaac Luria (1534‚Äì1572) who had based much of his Kabbalistic teachings on the Zohar. Baal Shem Tov came after Jews of Eastern Europe were collectively recovering from false messiahs Sabbatai Zevi (1626‚Äì1676) and Jacob Frank (1726‚Äì1791) in particular. Baal Shem Tov witnessed Frank's public apostasy (shmad in Hebrew) to Christianity, which compounded Zevi's earlier apostasy to Islam. Baal Shem Tov was thus determined to encourage his influential disciples (talmidim) to launch a spiritual revolution in Jewish life in order to reinvigorate the Jewish masses' connections with Torah Judaism and to vigorously motivate them to bind themselves to the joyous observance of the commandments, worship, Torah study, and sincere belief in God, so that the lures of Christianity and Islam, and the appeal of the rising secular Enlightenment, to the Jewish masses would be weakened and halted. To a large degree he succeeded in Eastern Europe. Already during his lifetime, and gaining momentum following his death, Baal Shem Tov's disciples spread out to teach his mystical creeds all over Eastern Europe. Thus was born Hasidic Judaism (Hasidism). Some of the main movements were in: Russia which saw the rise of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement; Poland which had the Gerrer Hasidim; Galicia had Bobov; Hungary had Satmar Hasidim; and Ukraine had the Breslovers, and many others that grew rapidly, gaining millions of adherents, until it became the dominant brand of Judaism. Only when this new religious movement reached Lithuania did it meet its first stiff resistance at the hands of the Lithuanian Jews (Litvaks). It was Rabbi Elijah ben Shlomo Zalman (c. 1720 ‚Äì 1797), known as the Vilna Gaon (\\"Genius [of] Vilna\\"), and those who followed his classic stringent Talmudic and Halakhic scholasticism, who put up the fiercest resistance to the Hasidim (\\"righteous [ones]\\"). They were called Mitnagdim, meaning \\"[those who are] opposed [to the Hasidim]\\". The Vilna Gaon, who was himself steeped in both Talmudic and Kabbalistic wisdom, analyzed the theological underpinnings of this new \\"Hasidism\\" and in his view, concluded that it was deeply flawed since it had elements of what may be roughly termed as panentheism and perhaps even outright pantheism, dangerous aspirations for bringing the Jewish Messiah that could easily be twisted in unpredictable directions for Jewry as had previously happened with the Zevi and Frank religious \\"revival\\" fiascos, and an array of complex rejections of their religious ideology. The Vilna Gaons views were later formulated by his chief disciple Rabbi Chaim Volozhin (1741‚Äì1821) in his work Nefesh HaChaim. The new Hasidic leaders countered with their own religious counter-arguments, some of which can be found in the Tanya of Chabad-Lubavitch. Little of the split between Hasidim and Mitnagdim remains within the modern Haredi world. In modern-day Israel Hasidim support the Agudat Israel party in the Knesset (Israel's parliament) and the non-Hasidic Mitnagdim support the Degel HaTorah party, led by Rabbi Aharon Yehuda Leib Shteinman in Bnei Brak. Agudat Israel and Degel Torah have formed a political alliance. There is also another large community that follows the rabbinical teachings of the Edah Charedis. These include the Satmar Hasidim and the perushim communities, which do not support any groups that participate in the Israeli government or state activities, including elections. Orthodox versus Reform From the time of the French Revolution of 1789, and the growth of Liberalism, added to the political and personal freedoms granted by Napoleon to the Jews of Europe, many Jews chose to abandon the foreboding and isolating ghettos and enter into general society. This influenced the internal conflicts about religion, culture, and politics of the Jews to this day. Some Jews in Western Europe, and many Jews in America, joined the religiously liberal new Reform Judaism movement, which drew inspiration from the writings of modernist thinkers like Moses Mendelson. They coined the name \\"Orthodox\\" to describe those who opposed the \\"Reform\\". They were criticized by the Orthodox Judaism rabbis, such as Samson Raphael Hirsch in Germany, and condemned, particularly by those known today as followers of Haredi Judaism, based mainly in Eastern Europe. (Later on, in 1880s America, Conservative Judaism split from the Reform movement.) Thus a cultural schism was also created between the more Western English- and French- speaking Western European Jews and their more religiously observant Yiddish speaking Eastern European brethren whom they denigratingly labeled Ost Yidden (\\"Eastern Jews\\"). These schisms and the debates surrounding them, continue with much ferocity in all Jewish communities today as the Reform and Orthodox movements continue to confront each other over a wide range of religious, social, political and ethnic issues. (Today, the largest Jewish communities are in Israel and in the United States, and the geographical separation has resulted in cultural differences, such as a tendency to identify as hiloni and haredi in Israel, as opposed to, say, Reform and Orthodox in the United States.)

It was the first facility of its kind ever to be established in the United States. The Sanatorium later became the site of Piedmont Geriatric Hospital. Influence of Tuberculosis Tuberculosis was the leading cause of death in the early twentieth century, accounting for one out of every 10 deaths. Those infected with the disease were isolated from society in sanatoriums. These self-contained communities became known as \\"waiting rooms for death.\\" Piedmont Sanatorium was established circa 1917 in Burkeville, Virginia as a rest home for blacks suffering from tuberculosis. Concerns about the health of whites were what led to its construction. Segregation In the 1910s, as increasing urbanization began bringing whites and blacks into closer contact, Virginia health officials started compiling evidence of the \\"Negro Health Problem\\" - high disease, death, and maternal and infant mortality rates among blacks. Hard physical labor along with poor diet and sanitation contributed to the problem. Disease flourished in the crowded black neighborhoods, where garbage piled up, sewage went untreated, and running water was often nonexistent. Fearing that black child-care nurses, cooks, and laundresses might spread tuberculosis to white neighborhoods, the government began looking for ways to stamp out TB and other contagious diseases. At the time, the only treatment facilities for blacks were the Central State Hospital for Mental Diseases and the State Penitentiary. The Negro Organization Society, a grassroots advocacy association in Virginia, initiated discussions with the State Board of Health, and particularly Agnes Randolph. Agnes Dillon Randolph, a lifelong political activist and charter member of the Virginia State Association of Nurses, became concerned about the situation. To strengthen her political influence, Randolph rose to the position of Executive Secretary of the Virginia Anti- Tuberculosis Association. She lobbied the General Assembly to establish a sanatorium for Negro tuberculosis patients - the first ever in the United States. Although some legislators were reluctant to try such an unprecedented idea, in 1916, the legislature granted her request. The all-white Blue Ridge Sanatorium was established in 1920. The City of Charlottesville, Virginia actively sought to locate Blue Ridge within their community. Charlottesville paid $15,000 of the $32,000 required for the procurement of the property and funded Blue Ridge's water supply. Piedmont, in contrast, had to hire contractors to dig its well. Blue Ridge patients enjoyed access to University of Virginia medical staff located in the same city. Piedmont patients, on the other hand, had to travel more than 50 miles to St. Phillips Hospital in Richmond, Virginia in the event of a non-tubercular medical emergency. Building Site Finding an acceptable site was an uphill battle. The Board of Health placed ads across the state for a site where a \\"colored sanatorium\\" could be built. The first location considered was in Ivor, Virginia. Local whites fiercely protested the facility, as recorded in the Aug. 24, 1916 State Board of Health minutes: > While the negotiations [for the purchase of the property] were in progress, > and before any papers were passed, a large number of protests began to come > into the health department from citizens of Ivor, objecting seriously to the > location of such an institution at that point. The Commissioner went down to > Ivor and attempted to allay the feeling, without result. A number of the > citizens had employed an attorney and a delegation bringing a large petition > entered emphatic protest before the committee. The Piedmont Sanatorium committee then visited a site in Lynchburg, Virginia but received an even harsher response. According to The Tuberculosis Experience of African-Americans in Virginia, \\"any idea of such purchase was immediately abandoned.\\" In 1917, the committee hired a real estate agent named Mr. Barnes to negotiate the purchase of a site in Burkeville, Virginia. This time, the committee asked a group of citizens from Burkeville to sign a statement which said that the sanatorium could be built there. Nonetheless, opposition emerged for a third time. An attorney named Mr. H.H. Watson wrote a letter to the committee on behalf of a group of citizens who opposed locating the sanatorium in Burkeville. Impatient with the delays, this time the State Board of Health ignored the opposition and began construction of Piedmont Sanatorium on a parcel in Burkeville. The Negro Organization Society continued to be heavily involved with the issue, from raising public awareness to donating funds to improve the facility. Bonds were issued \\"to erect and to equip one Building to be used for the patients and to include rooms for visiting Doctors who shall from time to time be invited for study to the Sanatorium.\\" Daily life According to Gertz, \\"everything at Piedmont was hierarchically organized and routine\\". Patients were awakened every morning at 7:15 a.m. for breakfast. They then rested until lunch, had quiet time from 1:45 until 4:00 p.m., ate supper at 6:00 p.m., and went to bed at 9:30 p.m. Some patients who were advanced in their treatment exercised at certain times of the day. An occupational therapist led the patients in handicraft activities. Some patients were taught skills that they could use upon returning to productive society. Patients were required to attend weekly lectures on tuberculosis. They were taught the proper way to dispose of sputum and other aspects of dealing with the illness. Piedmont staff hoped that they would go back to their home communities and teach other blacks about tuberculosis. Piedmont Sanatorium School of Tuberculosis Nursing Piedmont Sanatorium School of Tuberculosis Nursing, a two-year nursing school for black women, was founded shortly after the Sanatorium opened. It allowed the black women to become certified specifically in tuberculosis nursing; a third year of training at St. Phillips Hospital in Richmond was required in order to become a Registered Nurse. The school became the subject of controversy due to the hospital staffing shortages of World War II. In 1943, Virginia Governor Colgate W. Darden Jr. proposed having an all-black staff at Piedmont in order to free white personnel to work in white hospitals. The proposal failed, partly because of concerns that the quality of care at Piedmont would suffer. Closing In 1965, in a visible sign that racial segregation was beginning to crumble, Piedmont Sanatorium closed and black patients were admitted to the previously all-white Blue Ridge Sanatorium. By 1967, the Burkeville facility had been converted into Piedmont Geriatric Hospital. Notes References *Dr. Julian B.

The onomatopoeia trikiti, apparently stemming from the sound emitted by the tambourine, originally referred to a traditional Basque ensemble, made up of the instrument which now bears the name as well as alboka, txistu and other instruments. Probably introduced by French or Italian immigrants coming from the Alps, the trikiti's first written evidence is attested late in the 19th century, exactly in 1889, when diatonic accordion was used for music in a popular pilgrimage festivity of Urkiola (Biscay). In 1890, a trikiti appears in a picture taken in Altsasu (Navarre), a railway junction. Therefore, some point to the instrument's import to the Basque Country from Italy through the port of Bilbao, while other sources suggest that this kind of diatonic accordion was brought in by Italian or French railway workers from the Alps. The diatonic button accordion itself was devised in Vienna in 1829, Site in Basque expanding thereafter all over Europe. The pair of diatonic button accordion along with tambourine gradually grew in popularity and was adopted to perform in local and popular festivities, where the young danced to its tunes (fandangos, arin-arin etc.), despite the Catholic Church's resistance, who dubbed it \\"hell's bellows\\" on the grounds that its dance-inciting and lively music would lead Basque youths into temptation. That playing pattern remained unchanged up to the 1980s, when Kepa Junkera and Joseba Tapia started to develop unprecedented ways of playing trikiti. While both authors came in for much criticism for their novelties and experimenting, they caught on and both styles, traditional and modern trikiti, have found their way and consolidated their separate paths. Both performers remain nowadays key figures of trikiti accordion. There have been influences of Tejano artists like Flaco Jim√©nez and other international players. Other renowned players include Alaitz Telletxea, I√±aki Malbadi, Maixa Lizarribar, Xabi Aburruzaga, Iker Goenaga and Carles Belda. Currently traditional style ensembles consist of a pair playing trikiti (diatonic button accordion), tambourine and voice.

It acts as the CPP's principal organization, aiming to consolidate political power from what it sees as the present \\"bourgeois reactionary puppet government\\" and to aid in the \\"people's democratic revolution\\". Founded on March 29, 1969, by the collaboration of Jose Maria Sison and former members of the Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan led by Bernabe Buscayno, the NPA has since waged a guerrilla war based on the Maoist strategy of protracted people's war. The NPA is one of the key figures in the ongoing CPP‚ÄìNPA‚ÄìNDF rebellion in the Philippines, the longest ongoing conflict in the country. The NPA operates in the Philippine countryside, where the CPP alleges it has established itself in 73 out of the country's 81 provinces, across over 110 guerrilla fronts. In guerrilla zones where the NPA has entrenched itself, the CPP‚ÄìNPA has established a People's Democratic Government (Gobyernong Bayan), which operates independently of the Philippine government. Within these zones, income taxes which would nominally go to the government treasury instead go to the NPA, which they use to fund community services. The NPA, as represented by the National Democratic Front of the Philippines, is a party to ongoing peace talks between the People's Democratic Government and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines. Peace negotiations have reached an impasse, with the current Rodrigo Duterte administration unilaterally announcing the termination of peace talks. Negotiations between the GRP and the NDFP stalled on signing of the Comprehensive Agreement on Socio-Economic Reforms (CASER), and the issue of localized peace talks between individual units of the NPA. The Philippine government currently has designated the NPA as a terrorist group, along with the CPP. The United States and the European Union have designated the CPP‚ÄìNPA as \\"foreign terrorist organizations\\" in 2002 and 2005, respectively.  History  The New People's Army was established on March 23, 1969, following the splinter of the Communist Party of the Philippines' Lava and Guerrero factions. Mistakes during the previous decades have led to the virtual dissolution of the PKP-1930 as an organization. The 1960s saw a resurgence in radical ideology, following the establishment of Kabataang Makabayan and the emerging popularity of Mao Tse Tsung Thought as an advancement of ideological Marxism-Leninism. In 1966, Jose Maria Sison, under the nom de guerre Amado Guerrero, wrote Rectify Errors and Rebuild the Party!, a treatise which criticized the old Lavaite leadership and emphasized the need to follow Mao Tse Tung Thought to foster re-establishment. The conflict continued until December 26, 1968, when the Communist Party of the Philippines was formally re-established along Maoist lines, and the entire issue was termed the First Great Rectification Movement. After re-establishing the CPP, Guerrero set about to establishing the People's Army. KM cadres in Tarlac had contacted Guerrero and linked him with Bernabe Buscayno, a former member of the older Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan. Relations were established and the New People's Army was formally founded on March 29, in continuity with the previous Hukbalahap. At the time the NPA only had 60 armed fighters. The NPA was immediately tasked with the role of implementing the CPP's program for a People's Democratic Revolution. In the Declaration of the New People's Army, Amado Guerrero outlined the following as its main tasks: # The New People's Army Must Engage in Party Rebuilding # The New People's Army Must Carry Out Agrarian Revolution, Build Rural Bases, and Advance the Armed Struggle # The New People's Army Must Build the National United Front The NPA quickly spread alongside organizational work of the CPP. By 1972, it had established 735 barrio organizing committees and 60 barrio organizing committees, governing an estimated 400,000 people all over the country. The CPP used the NPA to establish barrio organizing and revolutionary committees, which served as instruments in administering the people's revolutionary government. Barrio organizing committees were established to lower land rent, eliminate usury, and ensure the \\"annihilation of enemy troops and the elimination of landlord despots, enemy spies, and such bad elements as cattle rustlers, extortionists, robbers, murderers, arsonists, and the like.\\" Once established, barrio revolutionary committees replaced the BOC to formally establish the area as a stronghold of the revolutionary government. The NPA at the time had 72 squads of 800 regulars armed with weapons. Over the next decade, the NPA expanded in response to Ferdinand Marcos and the declaration of Martial law in the Philippines. The CPP and the NPA were successfully able to establish themselves in the countryside, reaching a mass base of over one million people, with 1,000 fighters armed with high-powered rifles by 1977 By 1981, the NPA began engaging in tactical offensives involving company-sized units emerged, particularly in the Southern Mindanao region. By 1983, the NPA fielded 5000 high-powered rifles. By 1988, it had 10,000 high-powered rifles, with 7,000 inferior firearms. It operated in 60 guerrilla fronts across 63 provinces of the Philippines. = Changes in tactics and Kampanyang Ahos = The momentum gained in the 1980s was also given to multiple setbacks. Changes in strategy and internal conflicts within the CPP resulted in ideological, political, and organizational losses for the CPP-NPA-NDF. The CPP devised a plan called a \\"strategic counteroffensive\\" (SCO) with the aim of \\"leaping over\\" to a higher stage of armed revolution and quickly win the revolution. The SCO program led to \\"regularization\\" of units, urban partisan actions, peasant uprisings, and an insurrectionist concept of \\"seizing opportunities\\". From 1981, the NPA enjoyed strategic gains in Mindanao and was able to consolidate its forces there. However, the Mindanao Commission adopted a strategy of designating areas as Red (where military struggle was applicable) or White (where political struggle and insurrection was applicable) along with the SCO program. The 1980s were also plagued by mass hysteria against \\"deep penetration agents\\" (DPAs or impil) within the CPP-NPA ranks, resulting in widespread internal purges. The Mindanao Commission launched Kampanyang Ahos (\\"Garlic Campaign\\"), which ran from 1985 to 1986 and killed an estimated 606 cadres while forcing more than 6,000 members to resign, surrender, or abandon party work. Ahos was estimated to have decimated the NPA from 16 companies to two. Problems in discipline also emerged during this time, as well as deterioration of the NPA's ability to conduct mass work. These ideological and organizational shortcomings, coupled with the Corazon Aquino administration's counter-insurgency program, Oplan Lambat Bitag, managed to severely harm the NPA and the CPP as a whole. In 1989, the NPA assassinated U.S. Army Colonel James \\"Nick\\" Rowe, founder of the U.S. Army Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) course. Colonel Rowe was part of a military assistance program to the Philippine Army. The NPA asserts that this made him a legitimate military target. = Second Great Rectification Movement = By 1991, the CPP central committee had assessed the mistakes of the previous decade and carried out the Second Great Rectification Movement from 1992 until declaring a success in 1998. The Second Great Rectification Movement, however, saw splits in the CPP ranks, with rejectionists such as Filemon Lagman, Romulo Kintanar, Etta Rosales, and others leaving the CPP and forming their own groups based on ideological differences. The Alex Boncayao Brigade, notorious for its partisan activities, left the CPP with Lagman and formed the Revolutionary Proletarian Army. In 1998, the GRP and NDFP signed the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law (CAHRIHL), which establishes rules of engagement for both parties in accordance to international rules of war. The NPA, as a signatory to CAHIRHL, is bound to international agreements stated in the Geneva Convention and thus follows rules set for prisoners of war, command-detonated explosives, and similar rules of engagement. Since then, rejectionists have been met with reprisals. Lagman was ambushed in the University of the Philippines in 2001 by armed gunmen and slain. The NPA has admitted to killing Kintanar in 2003. Other rejectionists, like Rosales and Walden Bello continue as members of the social-democratic Akbayan party. Ricardo Reyes is active in local politics, having last attempted to secure the mayoralty of Pasig City in 2010. = Post-Rectification= The CPP declared the Second Great Rectification Movement as having been \\"conclusively won\\" in 1998. Since then, it has re-affirmed that the CPP is in absolute command of the NPA, outlining that its most pressing task is to \\"defeat and destroy the US-created and US-supported reactionary Armed Forces of the Philippines. Since then, it has continued to wage a protracted people's war through the use of guerrilla tactics, while steadily expanding. In 2002, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo requested for the United States Department of State to declare the CPP-NPA as a foreign terrorist group, which was granted on August 2. This was in line with her counter-insurgency program, Oplan Bantay Laya, which aimed to end the conflict between the AFP and the NPA. In 2005, the European Union Common Foreign and Security Policy included the NPA as a terrorist group. Despite these efforts, the NPA has declared Oplan Bantay Laya I a \\"failure\\", citing that it did not lose a single guerrilla front despite the AFP's efforts of concentrating its forces in 300 to 600 barrios at any given time. In 2005, the NPA reported that its strength had surpassed its previous peak in 2005. Arroyo, at this time, had replaced OBL1 with Oplan Bantay Laya 2, which aimed at \\"ending the revolutionary movement by 2010\\". OBL2, along with what the CPP identified as \\"conservatism\\" in the ranks, led to a decline in NPA strength until 2009. During the administration of Benigno Aquino III, OBL2 was replaced by Oplan Bayanihan, which had a more \\"people- centered\\" approach compared to OBL's military-heavy tactics. NPA membership, at this time, steadily rose. By 2017, NPA strength had surpassed the previous 2005 peak by 3%. As of 2018, its strength is tallied at greater than the 5,600 rifles recorded in the CPP's 1985 plenum. The Central Committee has stated in its 2017 Congress that it has a five-year plan with aims to \\"carry forward the antifascist, antifeudal and anti-imperialist movement and overthrow the tyrannical US-Duterte regime, and bring the protracted people's war to the advanced phase of the strategic defensive, in order to reach the threshold of the strategic stalemate\\". The five-year plan: # Aims to develop 7 to 10 advanced regions in terms of strength, spread, and advancement of guerrilla warfare, with approximately 20,000 Red fighters across spread across the country. # Calls for the development of sub-regions, with one or two undersized companies and 9 to 15 horizontal platoons, interlocked across three to five company-sized guerrilla fronts. # Aims for every region and sub-region should have one company-sized unit for every nine platoon-sized units, with recruitment campaigns utilized to achieve this goal. The CPP five-year plan emphasizes the need to combat conservatism in the NPA ranks, the importance of mass-work in building and strengthening Party groups, and the intensification of guerrilla warfare against enemy targets. = Ceasefires = * In November 1986, the Philippine government and rebels signed a 60-day ceasefire. This deal was rescinded on January 1987 following the events of the Mendiola massacre, where police fired on protesters and killed 13 farmers, injuring 30 more. * The peace talks between the two sides were intermittent and inconclusive since 1986, bogging down in 2012 when the government refused to free political prisoners. They resumed in August 2016, when Duterte released 19 rebel leaders from jail. However, President Duterte scrapped talks in February 2017, when rebels ambushed an army convoy, breaking a unilateral ceasefire that had held for five months. Both sides returned to the negotiating table on April 1, 2017. * In April 2017, peace talks between the National Democratic Front and the Philippine government brokered by Norway took place in the Netherlands, hoping to reach a political settlement in twelve months to end the conflict. This was the second time the two sides agreed on a bilateral truce since November 1986. * As of 2019, the Duterte administration unilaterally declared the end of peace talks between the GRP and the NDFP, focusing instead on their counter-insurgency program Oplan Kapanatagan and what it terms as a \\"whole-of-nation\\" approach.  Ideology  The NPA, being the primary organization of the CPP, follows a theoretical ideology of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. It regards the Philippines as a semi- colonial, semi-feudal state where political and economic power is concentrated on a local class of landlords and comprador bourgeoisie, aided by foreign imperialists, chief of which is United States imperialism. The CPP regards a two-stage revolution of People's Democratic Revolution followed by socialist reconstruction as the path to achieve socialism and wrest control away from the bourgeois. The CPP-NPA regards three things as central to waging revolution: armed struggle, agrarian revolution, and the building of mass- bases in the countryside. The NPA, aside from being a military force, also puts emphasis in carrying out land reform and organizational work to ensure that villages become bases of the people's democratic government. The CPP regards armed struggle as a necessary component of revolution coinciding with the Party's organizational work. The NPA, as the central agent of armed struggle, serves to achieve its central task of \\"destroying and dismantling the rule of the enemy and taking their political power\\". In waging armed revolution, the NPA follows the strategic line of protracted people's war by \\"encircling the cities from the countryside until conditions are ripe for seizing the cities through a strategic offensive\\". The NPA identifies three stages in waging armed struggle: strategic defensive, strategic stalemate, and strategic offensive. It regards itself as yet unable to conduct symmetric warfare in the urban centers and thus regards the people's war as being in a stage of strategic defensive moving to a stage of strategic stalemate. During the stage of strategic defensive, the NPA \\"maintains the initiative in tactical offensives against the strategic military advantage of the enemy\\", making use of guerrilla tactics to attack targets and defend guerrilla zones, while armed partisans perform special roles in the cities. The second stage is strategic stalemate, where fighting force is more or less equal, while the last stage is that of strategic offensive, where the NPA has developed its strength capable of assaulting military camps and cities. The NPA regards itself as waging a revolution ultimately stemming from the \\"unfinished\\" revolution of the Katipunan, calling itself a revolution of the \\"new type\\"; whereas the Katipunan waged a \\"bourgeois democratic revolution of the old type, the NPA is waging a \\"proletarian socialist revolution\\" in the same vein as the October Revolution in Russia.  Support of international communist organizations  The Philippine Army had apprehended Eduardo Quitoriano in 1994, who was a NPA liaison officer to the Japanese Red Army, who was involved in a money laundering case in Switzerland.Mickolus, Edward F. and Simmons, Susan L. (2014). The 50 Worst Terrorist Attacks. p. 8. It is reported that the NPA had supported the Naxalites (of India) during the Naxalite‚ÄìMaoist insurgency by providing training and technical support.  Support for LGBT rights  In 2005 the NPA conducted the first recorded gay marriage in the history of the Philippines. In contrast to the deeply religious nature of mainstream Filipino society, the NPA leadership openly accepts gay and lesbian people into their ranks, though the attitudes of members within the various and largely isolated guerrilla branches can vary. Filipino president Duterte has mocked the NPA's acceptance of LGBT members, erroneously claiming that '40 percent' of NPA members are gay. Duterte also claimed that NPA guerrillas once attempted to sexually seduce his son. NPA co-founder Jose Maria Sison confirmed that the NPA openly accepted LGBT people and called Duterte's claims \\"unbelievable\\".  Environmental protection  The NPA has a long record of attacking mining corporations and logging companies which they accuse of harming the forests of the Philippines. In 2011 in revenge for the murder of anti-mining activist Rabenio Sungit, the NPA attacked three mines in Mindanao, causing 190 million dollars in damages. Some corporations willing to pay NPA taxes for local social programs are allowed to continue operating within NPA territory, those who do not are often attacked by the NPA who burn their equipment.  Legal status  The Government of the Philippines has outlawed the NPA along with the CPP as through the Anti-Subversion Act of 1957 which branded the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930 and the Hukbalahap as an \\"organized conspiracy\\". As splinter groups which had roots to the two organization, the ban extended to the CPP-NPA. The law was repealed by President Fidel Ramos on October 1992, decriminalizing membership in the NPA and CPP. In December 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte declared the NPA along with the CPP as terrorist organizations. The NPA is also designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the U.S. State Department and as a terrorist group by the EU, and New Zealand.

The precise identity of the Ajivikas is not well known, and it is even unclear if they were a divergent sect of the Buddhists or the Jains. Original scriptures of the ƒÄjƒ´vika school of philosophy may once have existed, but these are currently unavailable and probably lost. Their theories are extracted from mentions of Ajivikas in the secondary sources of ancient Indian literature. Scholars question whether ƒÄjƒ´vika philosophy has been fairly and completely summarized in these secondary sources, as they were written by groups (such as the Buddhists and Jains) competing with and adversarial to the philosophy and religious practices of the Ajivikas. It is therefore likely that much of the information available about the ƒÄjƒ´vikas is inaccurate to some degree, and characterisations of them should be regarded carefully and critically. The ƒÄjƒ´vika school is known for its Niyati (\\"Fate\\") doctrine of absolute determinism, the premise that there is no free will, that everything that has happened, is happening and will happen is entirely preordained and a function of cosmic principles. ƒÄjƒ´vikas considered the karma doctrine as a fallacy. Ajivika metaphysics included a theory of atoms which was later adapted in Vaisheshika school, where everything was composed of atoms, qualities emerged from aggregates of atoms, but the aggregation and nature of these atoms was predetermined by cosmic forces. ƒÄjƒ´vikas were mostly considered as atheists.Johannes Quack (2014), The Oxford Handbook of Atheism (Editors: Stephen Bullivant, Michael Ruse), Oxford University Press, , page 654 They believed that in every living being is an ƒÅtman ‚Äì a central premise of Hinduism and Jainism.Analayo (2004), Satipa·π≠·π≠hƒÅna: The Direct Path to Realization, , pp. 207-208 ƒÄjƒ´vika philosophy reached the height of its popularity during the rule of the Mauryan emperor Bindusara, around the 4th century BCE. This school of thought thereafter declined, but survived for nearly 2,000 years through the 14th century CE in the southern Indian states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.Arthur Basham, Kenneth Zysk (1991), The Origins and Development of Classical Hinduism, Oxford University Press, , Chapter 4 The ƒÄjƒ´vika philosophy, along with the CƒÅrvƒÅka philosophy, appealed most to the warrior, industrial and mercantile classes of ancient Indian society.DM Riepe (1996), Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 39-40 Etymology and meaning Ajivika (Prakrit in the Brahmi script: ëÄÜëÄ§ëÄªëÄØëÄ∫ëÄì ƒÄdƒ´vika, or ëÄÜëÄöëÄªëÄØëÄ∫ëÄì ƒÄjƒ´vika, Sanskrit: ‡§Ü‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï ƒÄjƒ´vika) is derived from Ajiva (ƒÄjƒ´va, ‡§Ü‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ) which literally means \\"livelihood, lifelong, mode of life\\".AjIvika Monier Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, Cologne Sanskrit Digital Lexicon, GermanyA Hoernle, , Editor: James Hastings, Charles Scribner & Sons, Edinburgh, pages 259-268 The term Ajivika means \\"those following special rules with regard to Iivelihood\\", sometimes connoting \\"religious mendicants\\" in ancient Sanskrit and Pali texts. The name Ajivika for an entire philosophy resonates with its core belief in \\"no free will\\" and complete niyati, literally \\"inner order of things, self-command, predeterminism\\", leading to the premise that good simple living is not a means to salvation or moksha, just a means to true livelihood, predetermined profession and way of life.Jarl Charpentier (July 1913), Ajivika, The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, Cambridge University Press, pages 669-674 The name came to imply that school of Indian philosophy which lived a good simple mendicant-like livelihood for its own sake and as part of its predeterministic beliefs, rather than for the sake of after-life or motivated by any soteriological reasons. Some scholars spell Ajivika as Ajivaka.John R. Hinnells (1995), Ajivaka, A New Dictionary of Religions, Wiley-Blackwell Reference, History =Origins= ƒÄjƒ´vika philosophy is cited in ancient texts of Buddhism and Jainism to Makkhali Gosala, a contemporary of the Buddha and Mahavira. In Sandaka Sutta the ƒÄjƒ´vikas are said to recognize three emancipators: Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Sa·πÖkicca, and Makkhali GosƒÅla. Exact origins of ƒÄjƒ´vika is unknown, but generally accepted to be the 5th century BCE. Primary sources and literature of the ƒÄjƒ´vikas is lost, or yet to be found. Everything that is known about ƒÄjƒ´vika history and its philosophy is from secondary sources, such as the ancient and medieval texts of India. Inconsistent fragments of ƒÄjƒ´vika history is found mostly in Jain texts such as the Bhagvati Sutra and Buddhist texts such as the Sama√±√±aphala Sutta and Sandaka Sutta, and Buddhaghosa's commentary on Sammannaphala Sutta, with a few mentions in Hindu texts such as Vayu Purana. The ƒÄjƒ´vikas reached the height of their prominence in the late 1st millennium BCE, then declined, yet continued to exist in south India until the 14th Century CE, as evidenced by inscriptions found in southern India.Ajivikas World Religions Project, University of Cumbria, United Kingdom Ancient texts of Buddhism and Jainism mention a city in the 1st millennium BCE named Savatthi (Sanskrit ≈öravasti) as the hub of the ƒÄjƒ´vikas; it was located near Ayodhya in what is now the North Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. In later part of the common era, inscriptions suggests that the ƒÄjƒ´vikas had a significant presence in the South Indian state of Karnataka, prominently in Kolar district and some places of Tamil Nadu. The ƒÄjƒ´vika philosophy spread rapidly in ancient South Asia, with a Sangha Geham (community center) for ƒÄjƒ´vikas on the island now known as Sri Lanka and also extending into the western state of Gujarat by the 4th century BCE, the era of the Maurya Empire. Classification in Hindu philosophy Riepe refers to ƒÄjƒ´vikas as a distinct heterodox school of Indian tradition.D. M. Riepe (1996), Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 34-46 Raju states that \\"ƒÄjƒ´vikas and CƒÅrvƒÅkas can be called Hindus\\", and adds that \\"the word Hinduism has no definite meaning\\".P.T. Raju (1985), Structural Depths of Indian Thought, State University of New York Press, , page 147 Epigraphical evidence suggests that emperor Ashoka, in the 3rd century BCE, considered ƒÄjƒ´vikas to be more closely related to the schools of Hinduism than to Buddhists, Jainas or other Indian schools of thought. =Biography of Makkhali Gosala= Ashoka's Seventh Pillar Edict mentions Ajivikas: \\"Some Mahamatras were ordered by me to busy themselves with the affairs of the Samgha. Likewise others were ordered by me to busy themselves also with the Brahmanas (and) Ajivikas\\" (Line 25).The Edicts of King Ashoka Ven. S. Dhammika, Colorado State University Archive Photograph of the portion of the 7th Edict, in the Brahmi script on the Ashoka pillar of Feroz Shah Kotla, New Delhi (3rd century BCE), with \\"ƒÄjƒ´vikesu\\" (ëÄÜëÄöëÄªëÄØëÄ∫ëÄìëÅÇëÄ≤ëÄº) inscription. Makkhali Gosala (Pali; Sanskrit Go≈õala Maskariputra, c. 484 BCE) is generally considered as the founder of the ƒÄjƒ´vika movement. Some sources state that Gosala was only a leader of a large ƒÄjƒ´vika congregation of ascetics, but not the founder of the movement himself. The Swedish Indologist Jarl Charpentier and others suggest the ƒÄjƒ´vika tradition existed in India well before the birth of Makkhali Gosala, citing a variety of ancient Indian texts. Gosala was believed to be born in Tiruppatur of Tiruchirappalli district in Tamil Nadu and was the son of Mankha, a professional mendicant. His mother was BhaddƒÅ. His name Gosala \\"cowshed\\" refers to his humble birthplace. Gosala is described in ancient texts as a contemporary of Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, and of Gautama Buddha. The Jain Bhagavati Sutra refers to him as Gosala Mankhaliputta (\\"son of Mankhali\\"). The text depicts Gosala as having been a disciple of Mahavira's for a period of six years, after which the two had a falling out and parted ways. According to the Bhagvati Sutra, Makkhali Gosala met with MahƒÅvƒ´ra again later in life, but Gosala asserted to Mahavira that he was not the same person. Makkhali Gosala referred to the example of a sesame plant which \\"had been pulled up, and had temporarily died, but it had been replanted and thus reanimated, becoming once more living, while the seven pods had developed\\". GosƒÅla declared that the original GosƒÅla who was Mahavira's companion once was dead, and that the soul now inhabiting the apparent GosƒÅla in front of him was a reanimated, completely different Gosala. This argument was declared a form of sophistry by Mahavira, and this led to a significant break in the relations between the two. =Inscriptions and caves= Gaya, Bihar).Pia Brancaccio (2014), Cave Architecture of India, in Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non- Western Cultures, Springer, , pages 1-9 Dedicatory inscription of Ashoka in Visvakarma/Viswamitra cave, Barabar.

Several rock-cut caves belonging to ƒÄjƒ´vikas are dated to the times of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka (r. 273 BC to 232 BC). These are the oldest surviving cave temples of ancient India, and are called the Barabar Caves in Jehanabad district of Bihar.Entrance to one of the Barabar Hill caves British Library. The Barabar caves were carved out of granite, has a highly polished internal cave surfaces, and each consists of two chambers, the first is a large rectangular hall, the second is a small, circular, domed chamber. These were probably used for meditation. The Ashokan dedications of several Barabar Caves to the Ajivikas were engraved during the 12th year and the 19th year of his reign (about 258 BCE and 251 BCE respectively, based on a coronation date of 269 BCE).

The ƒÄjƒ´vika movement is primarily from historical references left behind in Jain and Buddhist sources, that may therefore be hostile to it. It is unknown to what degree the available non- ƒÄjƒ´vika sources reflect the actual beliefs and practices of the ƒÄjƒ´vikas. Most of what is known about them was recorded in the literature of rival groups, modern scholars question the reliability of the secondary sources, and whether intentional distortions for dehumanization and criticism was introduced into the records.The Ajivikas BM Barua, University of Calcutta, pages 10-17 More recent work by scholars suggests that the ƒÄjƒ´vika were perhaps misrepresented by Jain and Buddhist sources. Paul Dundas states that the Jain and Buddhist texts cannot be considered reliable source of ƒÄjƒ´vika history and philosophy, because \\"it seems doubtful whether a doctrine [of Ajivikas] which genuinely advocated the lack of efficacy of individual effort could have formed the basis of a renunciatory path to spiritual liberation\\", and that \\"the suspicion must be that the Jains and Buddhists deliberately distorted Ajivika doctrine for their own polemical purposes\\".Paul Dundas (2002), The Jains (The Library of Religious Beliefs and Practices), Routledge, , pages 28-30 In contrast, other scholars suggest that at least the common elements found about ƒÄjƒ´vikas in Jain and Buddhist literature may be considered, because Jainism and Buddhism were two different, competing and conflicting philosophies in ancient India. Philosophy Tile possibly representing Ajivika ascetics. =Absolute determinism and no free will= The problems of time and change was one of the main interests of the Ajivikas. Their views on this subject may have been influenced by Vedic sources, such as the hymn to Kala (Time) in Atharvaveda. Both Jaina and Buddhist texts state that ƒÄjƒ´vikas believed in absolute determinism, absence of free will, and called this niyati. Everything in human life and universe, according to Ajivikas, was pre-determined, operating out of cosmic principles, and true choice did not exist.DM Riepe (1996), Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 42-45 The Buddhist and Jaina sources describe them as strict fatalists, who did not believe in karma. The Ajivikas philosophy held that all things are preordained, and therefore religious or ethical practice has no effect on one's future, and people do things because cosmic principles make them do so, and all that will happen or will exist in future is already predetermined to be that way. No human effort could change this niyati and the karma ethical theory was a fallacy. James Lochtefeld summarizes this aspect of Ajivika belief as, \\"life and the universe is like a ball of pre-wrapped up string, which unrolls until it was done and then goes no further\\". Riepe states that the Ajivikas belief in predeterminism does not mean that they were pessimistic. Rather, just like Calvinists belief in predeterminism in Europe, the Ajivikas were optimists. The Ajivikas simply did not believe in the moral force of action, or in merits or demerits, or in after-life to be affected because of what one does or does not do. Actions had immediate effects in one's current life but without any moral traces, and both the action and the effect was predetermined, according to the Ajivikas. Makkali Gosala seems to have combined the ideas of older schools of thought into an eclectic doctrine. He appears to have believed in niyati (destiny), svabhava (nature), and sangati (change), and possibly parinama, which may have prompted other philosophical schools to label him variously as ahetuvadin, vainayikavadin, ajnanavadin, and issarakaranavadin. According to him all beings undergo development (parinama). This culminates in the course of time (samsarasuddhi) in final salvation to which all beings are destined under the impact of the factors of niyati (destiny), bhava (nature), and sangati (change). As such destiny does not appear as the only player, but rather chance or indeterminism plays equal part in his doctrine. He thus subscribed to niyativada (fatalism) only in the sense that he thought that some future events like salvation for all were strictly determined. =Ajivikas and theism= Ajivika's was an atheistic philosophy.Stephen Bullivant and Michael Ruse (2014), The Oxford Handbook of Atheism, Oxford University Press, , page 654 They did not presume any deity as the creator of the universe, or as prime mover, or that some unseen mystical end was the final resting place of the cosmos.GR Garg (1992), Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World, Volume 1, South Asia Books, , page 281 In later texts, the Tamil Nƒ´lakƒìci, a story of two divinities, Okkali and ≈åkali, relates the ƒÄjƒ´vikas instructed men in the scriptures. Ajivikas believed that in every being there is a soul (Atman). However, unlike Jains and various orthodox schools of Hinduism that held that soul is formless, Ajivikas asserted that soul has a material form, one that helps meditation. They also believed that the soul passes through many births and ultimately progresses unto its pre-destined nirvana (salvation). Basham states, that some texts suggest evidence of Vaishnavism-type devotional practices among some Ajivikas. =Atomism= Ajivikas developed a theory of elements and atoms similar to the Vaisheshika school of Hinduism. Everything was composed of minuscule atoms, according to Ajivikas, and qualities of things are derived from aggregates of atoms, but the aggregation and nature of these atoms was predetermined by cosmic forces. The description of Ajivikas atomism is inconsistent between those described in Buddhist and Hindu texts. According to three Tamil texts,Dale Riepe (1996), Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 41-44 with footnotes the Ajivikas held there exists seven kayas (Sanskrit: ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Ø, assemblage, collection, elemental categories): pruthvi-kaya (earth), apo-kaya (water), tejo-kaya (fire), vayo-kaya (air), sukha (joy), dukkha (sorrow) and jiva (life). The first four relate to matter, the last three non-matter. These elements are akata (that which is neither created nor destroyed), vanjha (barren, that which never multiplies or reproduces) and have an existence independent of the other. The elements, asserts Ajivika theory in the Tamil text Manimekalai, are made of paramanu (atoms), where atoms were defined as that which cannot be further subdivided, that which cannot penetrate another atom, that which is neither created nor destroyed, that which retains its identity by never growing nor expanding nor splitting nor changing, yet that which moves, assembles and combines to form the perceived. The Tamil text of Ajivikas asserts that this \\"coming together of atoms can take diversity of forms, such as the dense form of a diamond, or a loose form of a hollow bamboo\\". Everything one perceives, states the atomism theory of Ajivikas, was mere juxtapositions of atoms of various types, and the combinations occur always in fixed ratios governed by certain cosmic rules, forming skandha (molecules, building blocks). Atoms, asserted the Ajivikas, cannot be seen by themselves in their pure state, but only when they aggregate and form bhutas (objects). They further argued that properties and tendencies are characteristics of the objects. The Ajivikas then proceeded to justify their belief in determinism and \\"no free will\\" by stating that everything experienced ‚Äì sukha (joy), dukkha (sorrow) and jiva (life) ‚Äì is mere function of atoms operating under cosmic rules. Riepe states that the details of the Ajivikas theory of atomism provided the foundations of later modified atomism theories found in Jain, Buddhist and Hindu traditions. =Antinomian ethics= Another doctrine of Ajivikas philosophy, according to Buddhist texts, was their antinomian ethics, that is there exist \\"no objective moral laws\\". Buddhaghosa summarizes this view as, \\"There is neither cause nor basis for the sins of living beings and they become sinful without cause or basis. There is neither cause nor basis for the purity of living beings and they become pure without cause or basis. All beings, all that have breath, all that are born, all that have life, are without power, or strength, or virtue, but are the result of destiny, chance and nature, and they experience joy and sorrow in six classes\\". Despite this ascribed premise of antinomian ethics, both Jain and Buddhist records note that ƒÄjƒ´vikas lived a simple ascetic life, without clothes and any material possessions. Tamil literature on Ajivikas suggests that they practiced Ahimsa (non-violence) and a vegetarian lifestyle. Arthur Basham notes that Buddhist and Jaina texts variously accuse Ajivikas of immorality, unchastity and worldliness, but they also acknowledge the confusion among Buddhists and Jainas when they observed the simple, ascetic lifestyle of Ajivikas. Scriptures The Ajivikas had a fully elaborate philosophy, produced by its scholars and logicians, but those texts are lost. Their literature evolved over the centuries, like other traditions of Indian philosophy, through the medieval era. The Pali and Prakrit texts of Buddhism and Jainism suggest that Ajivika theories were codified, some of which were quoted in commentaries produced by Buddhist and Jaina scholars. The main texts of the Ajivikas included the ten Purvas (eight Mahanimittas, two Maggas) and the Onpatu Katir. The Mahanimittas of Ajivikas, claims Bhagavati Sutra, was extracted from the teachings Gosala received from Mahavira, when he was a disciple. The belief of Ajivikas in absolute determinism and influence of cosmic forces led them to develop extensive sections in their Mahanimittas texts on mapping the sun, moon, planets, stars and their role in astrology and fortune telling.Kailash Chand Jain (2010), History of Jainism: Jainism before and in the age of MahƒÅvƒ´ra, , pages 414-415 Influence Isaeva states that the ideas of Ajivika influenced Buddhism and various schools of Hinduism. Riepe states an example of an influential Ajivika theory was its theory on atomism. Basham suggests Ajivikas may have possibly influenced the medieval era doctrines of Dvaita Vedanta sub-school of Hinduism. Conflict between Ajivikas, Buddhists and Jains According to the 2nd century CE text Ashokavadana, the Mauryan emperor Bindusara and his chief queen Shubhadrangi were believers of this philosophy, that reached its peak of popularity during this time. Ashokavadana also mentions that after his conversion to Buddhism, Bindusara's son Ashoka issued an order to kill all the Ajivikas in Pundravardhana, enraged at a picture that depicted Gautama Buddha in a negative light. Around 18,000 followers of the Ajivika sect were supposedly executed as a result of this order. The entire story may be apocryphal. An earlier Jaina text, the Bhagavati Sutra, similarly mentions a debate, disagreement and then \\"coming to blows\\" between factions led by Mahavira and by Gosala.

The organization also brings cases to the Supreme and Municipal courts on topics such as building permits and social services in East Jerusalem. An example of this is in May 2016, when Ir Amim filed a petition asking the High Court of Justice to prohibit the Jerusalem Day flag parade from entering the Muslim Quarter, arguing that previous parades have resulted in violence to residents, vandalism, and racist provocations and that in 2016 the parade would coincide with the holy days of Ramadan.Israeli High Court Petitioned to Reroute Jerusalem Day March to Bypass Muslim Quarter Haaretz, June 2, 2016 The High Court rejected the petition. =Monitoring and Reporting= Ir Amim daily monitors the situation in East Jerusalem, and exposes key developments and in-depth analysis in its reports almost monthly.Ir Amim Publications: This type of monitoring and reporting is the basis for the legal and policy activity of Ir Amim, as well as the media work. =Jerusalem Policy Forum= The Jerusalem Policy Forum is a joint project of Ir Amim and the Palestinian NGO, the Peace and Democracy Forum. =Public Outreach= Ir Amim's public outreach is primarily aimed at the Israeli public, with the goal of re-orienting the public discourse on the issue of Jerusalem. The organization encourages the public to evaluate both the current realities and the ongoing developments in Jerusalem with regard to the possible long-term ramifications for Israel. Ir Amim's public outreach centers around study tours, media work, briefings, house meetings, and educational programs. Ir Amim also maintains a blog on the Huffington Post. Study Tours Ir Amim offers study tours of East Jerusalem to both individuals and organizations. The tours focus on the historical background as well as the Ir Amin view of current political and socio-economic developments in East Jerusalem. The tours travel along the Separation Barrier and through Jerusalem neighborhoods, discussing Israeli policies and their impact on Israelis and Palestinians and on a possible political resolution in Jerusalem. =Jerusalem Moments= Jerusalem Moments is a film project sponsored by Ir Amim.

It is located at Bulevardul Geniului, nr. 1, in Bucharest, Romania. The palace also houses the National Cotroceni Museum. History = The Cotroceni Monastery (1679‚Äì1682) = In 1679, a monastery was built by »òerban Cantacuzino on Cotroceni Hill in the first year of his rule on the place of an old wooden hermitage. The plans of this new monastery kept many of the traditional architectural elements found in the principalities of Romania at the time. The Cotroceni monastery was completed in 1682, and has since been visited frequently by many pilgrims and documented in various Chronicles. = The royal palace (1883‚Äì1895) = Painting of Carol I sitting at his desk. Cotroceni Hill was also the place of residence of many of Romania's rulers for a time until 1883, when King Carol I of Romania received the residences and ordered them demolished with plans to build a much larger edifice in their stead which would serve to house the future heirs to his throne. Construction of this new royal palace was commissioned to begin in the year 1893, the project being placed under the direction of French architect Paul Gottereau. = The north wing (1915‚Äì1926) = Early 1900s photograph of Cotroceni Palace, taken by Romanian photographer Alexander Antoniu. During the rule of King Ferdinand I and Queen Marie, further improvements were made to the royal palace. At the request of Queen Marie, the north wing of the palace was completed with the space that would be used to house the maids of honor and adjutants in duplex apartments of sorts. A gymnastics hall at the semi-basement was also built, taking up the space where it is assumed that a chapel would have resided on the ground floor. In October 1915, the space was refitted to accommodate central heating. In 1925, Grigore Cerchez began his work on the Cotroceni Palace by adding a living room with a gazebo on the first floor. On the second floor, he added a small terrace on the northern face along with an additional gazebo. Cerchez continued to work on the two adjacent salons on the first floor of the north wing, as well as the Grand Reception Hall that distinguished this part of the building, until 1926. In 1929, Grigore Cerchez has achieved the functional completion of the north-eastern corner of the palace, having created a loggia at the library's level. Above the library, a large storage area was built as an annex to the royal dormitory. = The socialist occupation (1947‚Äì1948) = On 30 December 1947, King Michael I was forced to abdicate by the communists. At that point, the new government had control of the palace which was then uninhabited by the royal family. On February 13, 1948, the new government held a meeting in which the destiny of the palace would be decided while an inventory of the royal goods was taking place. There were multiple requests for different functions the palace could serve, from a University of Medicine to a headquarters for the National Union of Romanian Students. On May 26 that year, decree number 38 was issued, in which the Presidium of the Grand National Assembly of the People's Republic of Romania has decided that \\"all goods and estates that were found from the date of March 6, 1945 in the possession of the former king Mihai and other members of the former royal family shall be passed into the possession of the Romanian state.\\" Finally, on June 18, 1948, the Council of Ministers has decided that the Cotroceni Palace, its \\"five bodies, 150 rooms, park, the property of the state\\" would be placed under the administration of the Ministry of Interior. The same decree stipulated that other valuables found within the palace would be redistributed among various ministries, including the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Health. After the new administrator of the palace has settled in, around 1,000 objects, including paintings, sculptures, icons, furniture, rugs, draperies, dishes, and other decorative items were missing. They were taken by the Ministry of Art and Information at the proposal of a special commission \\"to take objects of art from the Cotroceni Palace.\\" The majority of the remaining objects were redistributed to various institutions and organizations, including the press arm of the Ministry of Art and Information, the \\"Bee\\" Society (Societatea \\"Albina\\"), and the restaurant union \\"Ambasador\\". = The \\"Pioneers' Palace\\" (1949) = On April 30, 1949, a school children's program called the \\"Pioneers\\" was about to receive its first group ceremony, which would mark a moment in the Cotroceni Palace's history in which it would be re-purposed for the use of these children who were preparing to become \\"dignified citizens devoted to their homeland and The Romanian Worker's Party.\\" It was around this period of time when the Cotroceni Palace took on another name ‚Äî Palatul Pionierilor, known in English as The Pioneers' Palace (also known as young communists). The retrofit was to take place in four stages, during which the building would allocate rooms for a bigger library and centers or workshops for chess, miniature aircraft, automobiles, radiophony, photography, painting, choreography & dance, history, and ceramics. In addition to the retrofits, the palace was also to be used as a cinema and auditorium. The Pioneers' Palace, however, was not inaugurated until June 1, 1950 ‚Äî approximately one year after it was meant to be inaugurated. = Modifications by the socialist regime (1949‚Äì1976) = Staircase at the Cotroceni National Museum After the abdication of King Michael I, the new government has made several well- documented changes to the palace: At the ground floor * Hanging lamps from the principal entrance were unmounted. * Plaster ornaments ‚Äî as well as the anthropomorphic gable over the stairs of honor ‚Äî were either detached, forced down, or broken. * Stucco marble pilasters and boards were covered with clay and paint. They were also perforated for the mounting of electrical cords or piping for heat. At the first floor * The neo-German-style living room and the Golden Salon were destroyed. * All of the Ruse stone columns from the White Salon (known also as the Cerchez salon) were painted with dark ash polyvinyl paint. * All of the space within the new living room (planned by Grigore Cerchez) and kitchen were transformed. At the second floor * All of the spaces used by the children of the royal family ‚Äî as well as the loggia area towards the principal courtyard ‚Äî were emptied of any finishes. * The dormitory of Ferdinand I was completely destroyed. * All of the spaces between the Ferdinand I's dormitory and Maria's painting salon, save for the cherry wood stairs, were dismantled. At the third floor * The spaces on this floor have all been modified radically. In 1976, during the regime of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, the Cotroceni Palace once again changed its purpose after its transfer to the State Protocol (Protocolul de Stat). Its new function would be as a residential building ‚Äî a guest house. = 1977 Vrancea earthquake = In 1977, an earthquake measuring 7.2 on the Richter scale struck Vrancea County and damaged several buildings in Bucharest. The Cotroceni Palace was among these buildings, and suffered such extensive damage that a project had to be commissioned for restoration and consolidation. National Cotroceni Museum The Cotroceni National Museum is the old Royal Palace, built in 1895. In 1991 the palace became the headquarters of the Romanian Presidency and the old wing of the ensemble was opened to the public as Cotroceni National Museum, envisioned as an insight into past ages. You will see a number of function rooms, many of which were decorated to the whims of Marie, the English wife of Carol's heir, his nephew Crown Prince Ferdinand. You will also be able to view her astonishing art collection. =The Hall of Honour= Largely kept intact since the 1890s, the Hall of Honour, built in the French style of Napoleon III, boasts an original Italian marble staircase. The decorations are inspired by the French Opera Garnier. =The German Living Room= Decorated in the German Neorenaissance style, the German Living room was a place of daily reunion for the royal family. King Carol I was a most enthusiastic advocate of this style and no doubt wished to impose it in the rooms of Cotroceni. =The Hunting Room= Built in 1926 under the guidance of the Czech architect Karel Liman, the Hunting Room presents us with some of King Ferdinand's personal trophies. =The Flowers' Room= The Flowers' Room was named the Golden Room in the times of Queen Marie. The rich stucco flower decoration was, at the time, gilded. =The Library= Also known as King Ferdinand's private study room, the library still sports the original elm wood panelling and, even today, houses part of King Ferdinand's collection of books. =The Great Hall of Receptions= Built by the architect Grigore Cerchez in the Neo-Romanian style, the Great Hall of Receptions today also functions as a place for specific activities hosted by the museum, such as concerts, book launches or art exhibitions. =The Royal Dining Room= The Royal Dining Room is situated in a wing also designed by Grigore Cerchez in the Neo-Romanian style, and features a Neo-Byzantine round table, an original design by Queen Marie. =The Apartments= The second floor houses the private apartments of the members of the royal family, such as King Ferdinand's apartment, Queen Marie's apartment or the German apartment. Collections Comprising approximately 20.000 objects, the collection of the Cotroceni National Museum has been continuously enriched through transfers from other institutions and museums (The National Commission for Administrating State Heritage, The Peles National Museum, the National Arts Museum of Romania) and particularly through acquisitions and generous private donations. The collection of the National Cotroceni Museum is divided into the following domains: plastic arts (Romanian and international paintings, graphic arts, Romanian and foreign sculpture, religious art), decorative arts (ceramics, glass, metal, textile, furniture), numismatics, medals, history, archaeology. The plastic arts domain is divided into the following collections: religious arts (wood painted icons), which is representative for the late period of Romanian religious arts (18th- 19th century) and Russian workshops. The Romanian painting collection gathers paintings by famous Romanian painters of the end of the 19th century up to now. The vast majority of these painters were trained in the renowned Arts school of Bucharest and Iasi while others had the privilege of studying abroad in the famous European schools. After returning, some of them became professors, thus contributing to the improvement of plastic arts and educating a new generation of painters. Lately, one of the priorities in the heritage acquisitions of Cotroceni National Museum have been the works of artists in the Artistic Youth society, whose activity was prominent at the beginning of the 20th century and encouraged by princess Mary. Among them: Leon Al. Biju (‚ÄûBalcic Landscape‚Äú), Kimon Loghi (‚ÄûBalcic coffee shop‚Äú), Nicolae Grant (‚ÄûLandscape‚Äú). The graphic arts collection includes numerous drawings, watercolours and engravings of the 19th -20th century and Japanese prints. This particular collection was extended through acquisitions and donations of Romanian modern and contemporary graphics. The decorative art domain is well represented in the permanent exhibitions and includes furniture, ceramics, glass, metal and textiles. The furniture collection is one good reminder of the variety of European styles and evolving techniques. In terms of interior pieces of furniture one can notice wood tables and chairs (Neoromanian style), specific ensembles (Empire, Napoleon the 3rd, Napopleon 3rd, Louis 15th - 16th and oriental furniture). The ceramics collection include valuable pieces of renowned workshops in Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia. The S√®vres, Meissen and Kuznetzov porcelain is truly remarkable. The glass collection includes valuable artistic and historical pieces : the table set of Queen Mary (Neo Byzantine style) and Italian and French workshops. The textile collection includes carpets of famous workshops of Buchara, Sumak Shirvan. The collection of the museum also comprises a number of Art Nouveau objects, created by the artistic movement of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.

It is also known in Burgenland. All took their name and some characteristics from the Persian tanbur but also resemble the mandolin and guitar in the sense that its strings are plucked and often paired. The frets may be moveable to allow the playing of various modes. The variety of tamburica shapes known today were developed in Serbia and Croatia by a number of indigenous contributors near the end of the 19th century. History The area where tamburica is played. There is little reliable data showing how the tamboura entered Central Europe. It already existed during Byzantine Empire, and the Greeks and Slavs used to call \\"pandouras\\" (see pandoura) or \\"tambouras\\" the ancestor of modern bouzouki.Elizabeth Jeffreys, John Haldon, Robin Cormack, The Oxford Handbook of Byzantine Studies, Oxford University Press, 2008, p. 928. Nikos Maliaras, Byzantina mousika organa, EPN 1023, [archive] The instrument was referred to as Œ∏Œ±ŒºœÄŒøœçœÅŒπŒΩ, thambourin in the Byzantine Empire (confer Digenis Akritas, Escorial version, vv. 826-827, ed. and transl. Elizabeth Jeffrey). It is said it was probably brought by the Turks to Bosnia, from where the instrument spread further with migrations of ≈†okci and Bunjevci above the Sava River to all parts of Croatia, Serbia and further,Tre≈°njevka tamburica ensemble: Over tamburica - short history although this theory is not consistent with the generally accepted view that the ancestor of the tamboura is the ancient Greek pandouris. Until the Great Migration of the Serbs at the end of the 17th century, the type of tamboura most frequently used in Croatia and Serbia had a long neck and two or three strings (sometimes doubled). Similar string instruments are the Czech bratsche, Turkish saz and the sargija, √ßiftelia and bouzouki. The oldest of the drum so far known, which is still kept in a museum in Osijek, dates from 1847 and was owned by Pajo Kolariƒá of Osijek, who is also the founder of the first amateur orchestra. According to him, today the festival called tamburitzan which is held every year in Osijek. The development process of the modern tamburica was initiated by several Croatian citizens over a period of time. The original long neck, pear shaped tamburica was called the samica and it came in a small or larger size. The kontra, 4 strings tuned in an upper A chord and used only as an accompaniment, originated in Dalmatia. In the fall of 1875. after a rebellion in Bosnia had broken out, many refugees arrived in Sremski Karlovci. Among these refugees was a man named Marko Capkun who brought two tamburas with him. He called the small one icitel and the larger one sarkija. These tambura did not use wire strings but rather gut strings pulled through little holes on the neck and tied behind. A woodworker, Josif, in Sremski Karlovci began to make Marko's tamburas but instead of the traditional pear shape, he made them into a shape of a tiny guitar. A bird catcher named Joza built a large tambura-much bigger than a guitar in 1877 or 1878. It stretched two thicker and two thinner strings on it and Joza called it the bas or berdon. They developed and orchestra with a little tambura called the prima , 5 kontra and 1 bas.  Systems  Dual-fifths system bears the name by Milutin Farkas' Farkas system \\". This system initially consisted of the first and second bisernom (the second name was still kontra≈°ica), three braƒça, two of bugaria and berde . Later, they have an even ƒçeloviƒá and ƒçelo . This two-part note fifths system was widespread in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Czechoslovakia and Western countries. In the second half of the nineteenth century in Backa and Srem there was a two-part note fourths system, but it quickly grew into a Triple. Three-note fourths system developed in Backa late nineteenth century. It consisted of a first and second tamburitza, third and fourth tambura, the first and second brothers and the bass. This composition of the drum, with the name changed instruments and additional forehead, was common in Srem. All are tamburitzas were pear-shaped, except for the bass, which had a shape similar to the double bass, and less frequently as the guitar. Triple-fifths system was first introduced Pera Z. Ilic 1897. These consisted of the first and second tamburitza, the first and second brothers, cello, bass and counter attacks. All tamburitzas were pear- shaped. This system is in Croatia first applied Alfons Gucci, and later by little perfected. In 1930 this system became the leading system in Croatia, in 1939 it was accepted by the Croatian tamburitza association, and since 1945, a member of the tambura orchestra of Radio Zagreb. The three-fifths tamburitzas are completely dry suction two-part (Farkas), who remained only in some Croatian regions. Four quart system developed from three quart, in the early twentieth century in Backa and Srem and hence his name \\"Srem\\" system . It consists of a first receiving (pearl) and tercprima (other pearl), basprim and basprim thirds (brac I and II), E-basprim (E-brothers), celovic, bugaria and bass (berde, bege≈°). In some orchestras there is also A-cons, as well as H-cons. In Slavonia is also accepted Srijemski system, but the instruments are tuned to tone down, to give the so-called d-tuning instead of e-wrong , which is leading in. There was a tendency to and Triple fifths system converts the four-fifths system, which is, with little success, argued Joseph Rorbaher from Osijek. The first conference tamburitza experts held in 1958 in Novi Sad, the conditions for the unity of all tamburitza system accepted the unique scores and hence unique names. In this unique musical score are represented: the first and second bisernica, first and second brac, E-brac, cello, bass and Bulgaria and ƒçeloviƒá. Types of tamburica Tamburitza instruments displayed at permanent exhibition at The Musical Instrument Museum (MIM) Tempe, AZ 85284. Shell inlaid pear like braƒç and guitar like shaped braƒç and bugarija are made by Gilg, Sisak, Croatia. Smaller dark colored is braƒç made by B. Grƒëan, Graƒçani, Zagreb. The large dark colored is ƒçelo. The number of strings on a tamburica varies and it may have single or double-coursed strings or a mixture of both. Double-coursed strings are tuned in unison. The basic forms of tamburica are (Serbian and Croatian name is given with Hungarian name in the parenthesis, if different): *The samica - while a solo instrument and not generally part of the tamburica orchestra,http://www.atlasofpluckedinstruments.com/europe2.htm#croatia two double strings. *The prim (pr√≠m) - one double string, E, and three single strings B, F#, C#. This is the smallest tamburica (about 50 cm long), but is very loud. It is mostly used as a lead instrument or harmonizing instrument. The bisernica (from Serbian and Croatian \\"biser\\" meaning \\"pearl\\") is almost identical but may have two double strings and two single strings. *The braƒç or basprim (br√°cs or basszpr√≠m) - three double strings, or two double strings and three single strings (basprim), a slightly bigger, lower instrument than the bisernica but played in a similar fashion. *The ƒçeloviƒá - originally two double strings and two single strings; now four single strings are more common. *The bugarija or kontra (br√°cs√≥ or kontra) - one double string D and three single strings, similar to a guitar, mostly plays chords on the \\"back beat\\" for rhythm. A bugarija has five strings, the bottom pair are D, the middle string is A and the top two are tuned F# and F#. *The ƒçelo (csell√≥) - four strings, similar in size to the bugarija and plays a counterpoint line which is usually improvised. *The bas or berda (tamburab≈ëg≈ë), also called bege≈° (b≈ëg≈ës) - four strings. It is the largest instrument in the tamburica family, and is similar to contrabass. It can only be played standing and is used for playing bass lines. There is a view that the first tambura orchestra was formed in Hungary in the 19th century.Volly Istv√°n: Bajai tambur√°sok - A bajai tamburazenekar t√∂rt√©nete (1964.) The instruments' names came from the Hungarian names of the musical instruments of the symphony orchestra (\\"csell√≥\\" meaning cello, \\"b≈ëg≈ë\\" meaning contrabass) and from the Hungarian Gipsy bands (b≈ëg≈ës, pr√≠m, kontra).Magyar N√©prajzi Lexikon, Akad√©miai Kiad√≥, Budapest 1977-1982 These orchestras soon spread to what is now Bosnia, Austria, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

The body (sound box) was pear-shaped until the middle of the nineteenth century CE, and was built by scooping out the log. Today they are mostly built in the way of the guitar and even the smallest, the bisernica, has a constructed box. The fingerboard has frets (). The head (, ) usually had a sharpened form, which can be found still on some bisernicas, but the \\"snail\\" design later got the supremacy.Tre≈°njevka tamburica ensemble: Over the Tamburica ‚Äì in general The snail headstock design dates from at least the 19th century and the Viennese guitars of Johann Georg Stauffer. Composers and ensembles Hungarian tamburica ensemble in Beƒçej, Serbia Tamburica orchestras can have various formats from a trio to a large orchestra. A basic trio consists of a prim, a kontra and a ƒçelo. Larger orchestras also have bas-prims and bass-prim-terc tamburas. The first major composer for the tamburica was Pajo Kolariƒá, who formed the first amateur tamburica orchestra in Osijek in 1847.http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/folk.html Kolariƒá's student Mijo Majer formed the first tamburica choir led by a conductor, the \\"Hrvatska Lira\\", in 1882. Croatian composers for the tamburica include Franjo Ksaver Kuhaƒç, Sini≈°a Leopold and Julije Njiko≈°. The instrument is associated with Croatian nationalism. Vinko ≈Ωganec, an associate of B√©la Bart√≥k, collected more than 19,000 Croatian folk songs. Monument of Janika Bala≈æ with his prim tamburica in Novi Sad, Serbia The Grand Tamburica Orchestra of Radio Novi Sad was founded in 1951 under the leadership of Sava Vukosavljev, who composed and arranged many pieces for tamburica orchestra and published a comprehensive book Vojvoƒëanska tambura (\\"The Tambura of Vojvodina\\"). There are also orchestras of Radio Belgrade and Radio Podgorica, Radio Kikinda etc. Janika Bala≈æ, a member of the Radio Novi Sad orchestra who also had his own octet, was a popular performer whose name became synonymous with the tamburica. Famous tamburica orchestras of Serbia include those of Maksa Popov and Aleksandar Aranicki. The village of Schandorf in Austria, whose Croatian- speaking inhabitants are descended from 16th Century Croatian immigrants, is the home of a tamburica orchestra, a reflection of its ethnic heritage. The orchestra performs frequently, often outside the village.Schandorf ƒåemba: TAMBURIZZAORCHESTER  In popular culture  = Films about tamburicas = *The Popovich Brothers of South Chicago (1978) *:Directed by Jill Godmilow, Martin Koenig and Ethel Raim.

Reception At first, the IDF responded by sentencing any refusenik who refused to serve in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to jail. Seeing that this was not a deterrent and only raised awareness of refusal within the populace, it has stepped down its efforts and has simply stopped calling on the refuseniks or sent them to alternate duties within the 1967 borders - those borders that existed prior to the 1967 Six-Day War. There are differing opinions in the Israeli public regarding the organization. The right wing opposes the movement up to calling their activity a treason during wartime and claims that their refusal encourages the Palestinians to step up suicide bombings in order to break Israeli society. The left wing, which opposes the occupation, is split between those who see refusal as a legitimate political tool, and those who believe that it is unlawful and only serves to undermine the IDF's and the Israeli peace camp's standing within the populace. Israeli left-wing activist professor Amnon Rubinstein has warned that the refusal to serve by soldiers on the left could encourage the refusal by soldiers on the right to remove Israeli settlements. Courage to Refuse and one of its founders, David Zonshein, were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004. The refusenik letter * We, reserve combat officers and soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces, who were raised upon the principles of Zionism, sacrifice and giving to the people of Israel and to the State of Israel, who have always served in the front lines, and who were the first to carry out any mission, light or heavy, in order to protect the State of Israel and strengthen it. * We, combat officers and soldiers who have served the State of Israel for long weeks every year, in spite of the dear cost to our personal lives, have been on reserve duty all over the Occupied Territories, and were issued commands and directives that had nothing to do with the security of our country, and that had the sole purpose of perpetuating our control over the Palestinian people. We, whose eyes have seen the bloody toll this Occupation exacts from both sides. * We, who sensed how the commands issued to us in the Territories, destroy all the values we had absorbed while growing up in this country. * We, who understand now that the price of Occupation is the loss of IDF‚Äôs human character and the corruption of the entire Israeli society. * We, who know that the Territories are not Israel, and that all settlements are bound to be evacuated in the end. * We hereby declare that we shall not continue to fight this War of the Settlements. * We shall not continue to fight beyond the 1967 borders in order to dominate, expel, starve and humiliate an entire people. * We hereby declare that we shall continue serving in the Israel Defense Forces in any mission that serves Israel‚Äôs defense. * The missions of occupation and oppression do not serve this purpose ‚Äì and we shall take no part in them.

They played a major role in the Newfoundland cultural renaissance of the 1970s and 80s. Formed in 1976 by Noel Dinn, who named the band after a kind of traditional pudding, Figgy Duff travelled across Newfoundland, learning traditional songs. They performed with some distinct elements of rock and roll. They began working with Island Records early, though the album that resulted has yet to be released. Instead, they released their independent self-titled debut album: Figgy Duff in 1980. The album was also released by Ottawa-based Posterity Records. It was followed by After the Tempest in 1982. Throughout the next thirteen years, Figgy Duff continued touring and released three more albums: Weather Out the Storm (1989), Downstream (1993) and the compilation Retrospective (1995). The line-up changed several times, but the core of Noel Dinn and Pamela Morgan, singer-songwriter, stayed the same. Weather Out the Storm was nominated for a 1991 Juno Award. Dinn died of cancer in 1993, and Morgan disbanded Figgy Duff soon after. The band has since reunited three times, once in 1999 for a silver anniversary tour, again in summer 2008 to celebrate the release of a cd of live recordings from the bands' previous reunion, and for the 2016 Newfoundland and Labrador Folk Festival, featuring Aaron Collis on accordion.

Lim worked as second steward on , a British merchant ship, when it was sunk by , a German U-boat, on 23 November 1942. He soon found an wooden raft with supplies. When the supplies ran low, Lin resorted to fishing, catching seabirds, and rain collection. On 5 April 1943, Lin was rescued by three Brazilian fishermen as he neared the coast of Brazil. After his return to the United Kingdom, Lin was awarded a British Empire Medal by King George VI. After the war, Lim emigrated to the United States.  World War II  Lim was born on China's Hainan Island on 8 March 1918. In 1942, during World War II, he was working as second steward on the British armed merchant ship , which was on its way from Cape Town to Paramaribo and New York. The ship was armed but slow moving and was sailing alone instead of in a convoy. On 23 November, , a German U-boat, intercepted and struck the Benlomond with two torpedoes in position , some east of Bel√©m, Brazil, where Lim ultimately landed. The ship sank to the nearest land to the South, but ocean currents took him West to Bel√©m. As the ship was sinking, he took a life jacket and jumped overboard before the ship's boilers exploded.\\"S.S. Benlomond, Allied Ships hit by U-boats\\" by Gudmundur Helgason, Ed. Retrieved on 27 November 2008 Benlomond sank in approximately two minutes, allowing only six survivors, including Poon Lim, to abandon ship. After approximately two hours in the water, Poon Lim found and climbed aboard an square wooden raft. The raft had several tins of biscuits, a jug of water, some chocolate, a bag of sugar lumps, some flares, two smoke pots, and a flashlight. Lim was ultimately the only survivor of the sinking. Fifty-three of the crew of 54 were lost at sea, including the master, John Maul, 44 crew, and eight gunners.Tennant, Alan J. British and Commonwealth Merchant Ship Losses to Axis Submarines 1939-1945. Stroud: Sutton Publishing, 2001 (page 287). Lim on his raft Poon Lim initially kept himself alive by drinking the water and eating the food on the raft, but later resorted to fishing and catching rainwater in a canvas life jacket covering. He could not swim very well and often tied a rope from the boat to his wrist, in case he fell into the ocean. He took a wire from the flashlight and made it into a fishhook, and used hemp rope as a fishing line. He also dug a nail out of the boards on the wooden raft and bent it into a hook for larger fish. When he captured a fish, he would cut it open with a knife he fashioned out of a biscuit tin and dry it on a hemp line over the raft. Once, a large storm hit and spoiled his fish and fouled his water. Poon, barely alive, caught a bird and drank its blood to survive. When he saw sharks, he refrained from swimming and sought to catch one, using the remnants of caught birds as bait. The first shark to pick up the taste was only a few feet long. He gulped the bait and hit the line with full force, but in preparation Poon Lim had braided the line so it would have double thickness. He also had wrapped his hands in canvas to enable him to make the catch. The shark attacked him after he brought it aboard the raft, so he used the water jug half-filled with seawater as a weapon. After subduing the shark, Poon Lim cut it open and sucked the blood from its liver. Since it hadn't rained, he was out of water and this quenched his thirst. He sliced the fins and let them dry in the sun. On several occasions he was passed by other vessels. The first was an unidentified freighter whose crew saw him but did not pick him up or even greet him despite his proficient shouts in English. Poon Lim contended that they would not rescue him because he was Asian and they may have assumed he was a stricken Japanese sailor, although another explanation is that German U-boats often set a \\"survivor\\" on a raft as a trap to get a rescuing ship to stop which made it a sitting duck to be sunk. A squadron of United States Navy patrol seaplanes did see him, and one dropped a marker buoy in the water. Unfortunately for Poon, a large storm hit the area at the same time and he was lost again. He was also once spotted by a German U-boat, which had been doing gunnery drills by targeting gulls. At first, he counted the days by tying knots in a rope, but later decided that there was no point in counting the days and simply began counting full moons. Land Poon Lim in the conversation with Rear admiral Julius A. Furer following his rescue. On 5 April 1943, after 133 days in the life raft, Poon Lim neared land and a river inlet. A few days earlier, he had realized that he was nearing land because the color of the water had changed; it was no longer a deep oceanic blue. Three Brazilian fishermen rescued him and took him to Bel√©m three days later. During his ordeal, Poon Lim lost 9 kg (roughly 20 lbs), but was able to walk unaided upon being rescued. He spent four weeks in a Brazilian hospital while the British Consul arranged for him to return to Britain via Miami and New York. When told no one had ever survived longer on a raft at sea, Poon Lim replied, \\"I hope no one will ever have to break that record.\\" People have since lived longer lost at sea; three Mexican sailors floated for 10 months from 2005 to 2006 in the Pacific Ocean in a disabled fishing boat. In a similar situation, Jos√© Salvador Alvarenga, a fisherman from El Salvador, was apparently lost for 439 days, floating from Mexico to the Marshall Islands. , however, no one has broken Poon Lim's record on a life raft.  Aftermath  King George VI bestowed a British Empire Medal on him, and the Royal Navy incorporated his tale into manuals of survival techniques. After the war, Poon Lim decided to emigrate to the United States, but the quota for Chinese immigrants had been reached. However, because of his fame and the aid of Senator Warren Magnuson, he received a special dispensation and eventually gained citizenship. The writer Alfred Bester later stated that Poon Lim's ordeal was used in his novel The Stars My Destination, which opens with a man stranded in space.[Bester, Alfred. \\"My Affair with Science Fiction\\", in Hell's Cartographers ed. by Harry Harrison and Brian Aldiss, 197] Poon Lim died in Brooklyn on 4 January 1991.Social Security Death Index; Lim Poon; 123-20-0128  See also  * Dougal Robertson ‚Äì survived 38 days adrift in the Pacific Ocean * Jos√© Salvador Alvarenga ‚Äì survived 438 days adrift in the Pacific Ocean * Louis Zamperini ‚Äì survived 47 days adrift in the Pacific Ocean * Maurice and Maralyn Bailey ‚Äì survived 117 days adrift in the Pacific Ocean * Steven Callahan ‚Äì survived 76 days adrift in the Atlantic Ocean  Footnotes   External links  * Category:1918 births Category:1991 deaths Category:British Merchant Navy personnel of World War II Category:Castaways Category:Chinese emigrants to the United States Category:People from Hainan Category:Recipients of the British Empire Medal Category:Sole survivors ","title":"Poon Lim"},{"id":"1262132","text":"Ota (alternatively spelled Otta') is a town in Ogun State, Nigeria, and has an estimated 163,783 residents living in or around it Ota is the capital of the Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government Area. The traditional leader of Ota is the Olota of Ota, Oba Adeyemi AbdulKabir Obalanlege. Historically, Ota is the capital of the Awori Yoruba tribe. As of 1999, Ota has the third largest concentration of industries in Nigeria. It also possesses a large market and an important road junction, found just north of the tollgate on the Lagos - Abeokuta Expressway. Ota is also well known as the home of former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo's because of his farm., the Canaanland compound of the megachurch Winners' Chapel, and the Africa Leadership Forum. History Traditional Awori Yoruba folklore tells that Olofin's children, Osolo and Eleidi Atalabi founded Ota after migrating south from Isheri. As the town developed, it eventually came to be locally ruled by a crowned oba, called the Olota, whose ruling privilege came from the Yoruba traditional home of Ile-Ife. Ota soon became important in the production and sale of cocoa. In 1842, the expansion of the Egba nation brought Ota under the control of Abeokuta, however Ota held a semi-independent status within the Egba kingdom, and remained the capital of the Awori people. In the early part of the 1900s, governance and administration of justice were kept by members of the Ogboni secret society, a traditional group that made and enforced the laws. In 1903, modern police crews were introduced, and had almost completely supplanted the traditional enforcement roles of the Ogboni by the 1950s. In 1954, the introduction of a new Federal Government taxation system led to riots in Ota. On February 4, the new tax code was announced. The Aiyepeju Society and the Ota Tax Payers Association began protesting almost immediately. The protests turned violent as aggressive crowds began destroying property. The riots, which came to be known as the \\"Ponpo Aiyepeju\\", were eventually put down by the Nigerian police. In the aftermath of the disturbances, Oba Timothy Fadina was removed by the element of Awori Unity on May 11, 1954. Ota began to grow into the industrial city it is today due to the economic development planning and lobbying by the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria and Chief Bisi Onabanjo, former governor of Ogun State. This led to the official designation of Ota as an industrial town, and the state government began to encourage industries to locate in and around the city. Education Traditionally, Ota only had a few schools, and all were sponsored by various Christian religious organizations. The Muslim community responded by forming a school operated by the Ansar-Ud- Deen Society. State schools began to be formed in the late 1970s, and there are now several private schools in the area. Iganmode Grammar School is the oldest, founded in 1960. Other notable schools include Ansar-Ud-deen Comprehensive College, Bells Comprehensive Secondary School and Faith Academy Secondary School. There are also two universities in Ota: Covenant University and Bells University of Technology. And a private polytechnic:Allover central polytechnic. The Nigerian Navy's School of Music is also located in Ota. Economy Sections of the town are dominated by industries including Lagos - Abeokuta rd and Idi-Oroko rd. Beginning in the early 1970s, many businesses began building factories in Ota partly because it was less congested than the industrial estates in Lagos. Businesses with facilities in Ota include: * Farmex Meyer Limited * Nigerian Breweries * De United Foods Industries Limited * Unique Pharmaceuticals Unique Pharmaceuticals Official Website * Intercontinental Distillers Limited. * Honda Manufacturing (Nigeria),Ltd  Demographics  The indigines are predominantly Yoruba of the Awori dialect group. They trace their ancestry down from Ile-Ife and consider Iganmode as their patriarch. Other Aworis are located in the neighbouring Lagos State. The main occupation of Ota residents is trading and farming. The town's proximity to Lagos and proximity to the border town of Idiroko have led to the creation of two large markets: Kayero Market in Sango and Oba T.T. Dada Market along Idiroko Road. These markets are each so large that they blend together and are more commonly just referred to as Sango-Ota Market. Conflict between Awori and Owu residents There have been several confrontations between Owu and Awori residents of the area. In April, 2008, violent clashes left at least six people dead when Awori and Owu fought over the Olowu of Owu's installation of an Oba in Awori land. The governor of Ogun State, Gbenga Daniel, declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew in the Ado-Odo/Ota Ota local government area.

Caricature of a quack treating a patient with Perkins Patent Tractors by James Gillray, 1801 Modern facsimiles of Perkins tractors Elisha Perkins (January 16, 1741September 6, 1799) was a United States physician who created his own fraudulent medical device, the Perkins Patent Tractors.Quen, Jacques M. (1963). Elisha Perkins, Physician, Nostrum-Vendor, or Charlatan? Bulletin of the History of Medicine 37: 159-166. It was later subject of the first placebo research. Biography Elisha Perkins was born 1741 in Norwich, Connecticut. He was educated by his father Joseph Perkins in Plainfield, Connecticut, where he later practiced medicine with success. When the American Revolutionary War broke out, Elisha Perkins served as a surgeon for the Continental Army during the Battle of Bunker Hill in the Siege of Boston. During the late 18th century, the progression of medicine due to the Enlightenment increased the consumer demand for new therapies, such as therapeutic devices and inventions. Consequently, around 1795‚Äì96, Perkins invented his \\"Tractors\\", for which he took out a 14-year patent on February 19, 1796. The tractors consisted of two 3-inch metal rods with a pointed end. Although they were made of steel and brass, Perkins claimed that they were made of unusual metal alloys. Perkins used his rods to cure inflammation, rheumatism and pain in the head and the face. He applied the points on the aching body part and passed them over the part for about 20 minutes. Perkins claimed they could \\"draw off the noxious electrical fluid that lay at the root of suffering\\". The Connecticut Medical Society condemned the tractors as \\"delusive quackery\\", and expelled Perkins from membership on the grounds that he was \\"a patentee and user of nostrums\\". Perkins nevertheless managed to convince three US medical faculties that his method worked. In Copenhagen, Denmark, twelve surgeons at the royal Frederiks Hospital also began to support the method. Even George Washington bought a set.William Snow Miller. (1935). Elisha Perkins and His Metallic Tractors. Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine 8: 41-57. Other physicians' criticisms were met with charges of elitism and professional arrogance. Perkins boasted of 5,000 cured cases. The cures were certified to by eight professors, forty physicians, and thirty clergymen. Of the purchase made by Washington, Perkins' son, Benjamin Perkins, said that the \\"President of the United States, convinced of the importance of the discovery from experiments in his own family, availed himself of its advantages by purchasing a set of the Tractors for their use.\\"Perkins, Benjamin Douglas. (1798). The Influence of Metallic Tractors on the Human Body. London: Printed for J. Johnson. Benjamin Perkins was a bookseller and introduced the tractors to London. There a Perkinsian Institution for the benefit of the poor was founded under the presidency of Lord Rivers. In 1798, Benjamin published The Influence of Metallic Tractors on the Human Body. In October 1799, an advertisement in The Times said that \\"The tractors, with every necessary direction for using them in Families, may be had for 5 guineas the set, of Mr. Perkins, of Leicester Square; or of Mr. Frederic Smith, Chemist & Druggist, in the Haymarket\\".The Times, October 10, 1799. Aylmer Bourke Lambert, a British botanist, is on record as having written in January 1800 to Richard Pulteney of Blandford (now Blandford Forum), in the English county of Dorset, as follows: > \\"I breakfasted with Sir Joseph [Banks] on Monday morning who is recovered > from the Gout and in high Spirits. We had a good deal of laughing about the > Tractors. Perkins has published several Cases communicated by my Father, and > presented me with a copy of his Book.\\"Clarke, Tom, in La Posta: A Journal of > American Postal History, Vol 28, number 2 (whole number 164), May 1997, pp > 16-17. West Linn, Oregon: La Posta Publications. . Shortly before his death Elisha Perkins also invented purported antiseptic medicine and used it for dysentery and sore throat. Perkins also claimed to have discovered a cure for yellow fever. This consisted of vinegar with muriate of soda which he tested in New York City during an outbreak in 1799. The cure had no effect and Perkins contracted the fever and died.Holbrook, Stewart. (1959). The Golden Age of Quackery. Collier Books. p. 41 After Perkins' death, British physicians began to have doubts about his tractors. In 1799, Dr. John Haygarth conducted a test in which he treated five rheumatic patients with wooden tractors that were made to resemble the metallic ones. Four of them reported that the pain was relieved. The next day the patients were treated with metallic tractors with the same results. Dr. Haygarth reported on his findings in a publication entitled On the Imagination as a Cause & as a Cure of Disorders of the Body. Attempts to use the tractors to cure animals proved futile. By this time, Perkins had numerous influential supporters and the sale of the tractors continued. In 1803, Thomas Green Fessenden published his poem \\"Terrible Tractoration\\" in favor of Perkins and as a satire on other physicians. Perkins' son died in 1810. After that the popularity of the tractors began to wane. In 1932, Morris Fishbein commented that \\"[u]nfortunately no one has yet been able to determine whether Elisha Perkins was merely a somewhat deluded physician or actually a great impostor.\\"Fishbein, Morris.

Grant, 1831) depicting a man who has overdosed on James Morison's Vegetable Pills. Wellcome Library collections. Morison was born at Bognie, Aberdeenshire, in 1770, the youngest son of Alexander Morison. After studying at Aberdeen University and Hanau in Germany, he established himself at Riga as a merchant, and subsequently in the West Indies, where he acquired property. Ill-health obliged him to return to Europe, and about 1814 he settled at Bordeaux. After \\"thirty-five years' inexpressible suffering\\", and experimenting with every imaginable course of medical treatment, he accomplished \\"his own extraordinary cure\\" about 1822 by the simple expedient of swallowing a few vegetable pills of his own compounding at bed-time and a glass of lemonade in the morning. His success led him to set up in 1825 as the vendor of what he called \\"vegetable universal medicines\\", commonly known as \\"Morison's Pills\\", of which the principal ingredient was said to be gamboge. His medicines soon became highly popular, especially in the west of England, and in 1828 he opened an establishment for their sale in Hamilton Place, New Road, London, which he dignified with the title of \\"The British College of Health\\". Morison believed that bad blood was the cause of all disease and that purgation from vegetable laxatives was the only cure. He advertised his pills as curing all disease.Porter, Roy. (2006). The Cambridge Illustrated History of Medicine. Cambridge University Press. p. 115. He bought a pleasant residence at Finchley, Middlesex, called Strawberry Vale Farm, but later lived in Paris. It was said that the profits from the sale of his medicines in France alone were sufficient to cover his expenditure there. From 1830 to 1840, he paid ¬£60,000 to the British government for medicine stamps. In 1836, his business received heavy criticism as an apothecary Robert Salmon was indicted for the manslaughter of John M'Kenzie by administering large quantities of Morison's pills.Strachan, John.

Personal life Morison married twice, and left four sons and several daughters. The only surviving child of his second marriage (with Clara, only daughter of Captain Cotter of the Royal Navy) was James Augustus Cotter Morison. Works Morison's writings were simply puffs of his medicines. They included: #Some important Advice to the World (with supplement entitled More New Truths), 1825 #A Letter Addressed to the Honorable the Court of Directors of the United East India Company; proposing an Easy and Safe Remedy for Prevention and Cure of the Cholera Morbus of India ..., 1825 #The Hygeian Treatment of the Most Prevalent Diseases of India, and of Warm Climates Generally, 1836 His essays were collected together in a volume called Morisoniana, or Family Adviser of the British College of Health (2nd edition 1829; 3rd edition 1831), which was translated into several European languages.

The word comes through Latin litania from Ancient Greek ŒªŒπœÑŒ±ŒΩŒµŒØŒ± (litane√≠a), which in turn comes from ŒªŒπœÑŒÆ (lit·∏ó), meaning \\"supplication\\". Christianity =Western Christianity= The frequent repetition of the Kyrie was probably the original form of the litany, and was in use in Asia and in Rome at a very early date. The Council of Vaison in 529 passed the decree: \\"Let that beautiful custom of all the provinces of the East and of Italy be kept up, viz., that of singing with great effect and compunction the 'Kyrie Eleison' at Mass, Matins, and Vespers, because so sweet and pleasing a chant, even though continued day and night without interruption, could never produce disgust or weariness\\". The number of repetitions depended upon the celebrant. This litany is prescribed in the Roman breviary at the \\"Preces Feriales\\" and in the Monastic Breviary for every \\"Hora\\" (Rule of St. Benedict, ix, 17). The continuous repetition of the \\"Kyrie\\" is used to-day at the consecration of a church, while the relics to be placed in the altar are carried in procession around the church. Because the \\"Kyrie\\" and other petitions were said once or many times, litanies were called plan√¶, tern√¶, quin√¶, septen√¶. Public Christian devotions became common by the fifth century and processions were frequently held, with preference for days which the pagans had held sacred. These processions were called litanies, and in them pictures and other religious emblems were carried. In Rome, pope and people would go in procession each day, especially in Lent, to a different church, to celebrate the Sacred Mysteries. Thus originated the Roman \\"Stations\\", and what was called the \\"Litania Maior\\", \\"Major Rogation\\" or \\"Romana\\". It was held on 25 April, on which day the heathens had celebrated the festival of Robigalia, the principal feature of which was a procession. The Christian litany which replaced it set out from the church of San Lorenzo in Lucina, held a station at San Valentino fuori le mura, and then at the Milvian Bridge. From thence, instead of proceeding on the Claudian Way, as the pagans had done, it turned to the left towards the Vatican Hill, stopped at a cross, of which the site is not given, and again in the atrium of St. Peter's, and finally in the basilica itself, where the station was held. In 590, when an epidemic caused by an overflow of the Tiber was ravaging Rome, Gregory the Great commanded a litany which is called \\"Septiformis\\"; on the preceding day he exhorted the people to fervent prayer, and arranged the order to be observed in the procession, viz, that the clergy from S. Giovanni Battista, the men from San Marcello, the monks from Santi Giovanni e Paolo (Rome), the unmarried women from Santi Cosma e Damiano, the married women from Santo Stefano Rotondo, the widows from San Vitale, the poor and the children from Santa Cecilia, were all to meet at Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. The \\"Litania Minor\\", also called Minor Rogations or \\"Gallicana\\", the Rogation Days before Ascension, was introduced (477) by St. Mamertus, Bishop of Vienne, on account of the earthquakes and other calamities then prevalent. It was prescribed for the whole of Frankish Gaul, in 511, by the First Council of Orl√©ans. For Rome it was ordered by Leo III, in 799. In the Ambrosian Rite this litany was celebrated on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday after Ascension. In Spain we find a similar litany from Thursday to Saturday after Pentecost, another from the first to third of November, ordered by the Council of Gerunda in 517, and still another for December, commanded by the synod of Toledo in 638. In England the Litany of Rogation Days (Gang-Days) was known in the earliest periods. In Germany it was ordered by a Synod of Mainz in 813. Because the Mass Litany became popular through its use in processions, numberless varieties were soon made, especially in the Middle Ages. Litanies appeared in honour of God the Father, of God the Son, of God the Holy Ghost, of the Precious Blood, of the Blessed Virgin, of the Immaculate Conception, of each of the saints honoured in different countries, for the souls in Purgatory, etc. In 1601 Baronius wrote that about eighty forms were in circulation. To prevent abuse, Pope Clement VIII, by decree of the Inquisition of 6 September 1601, forbade the publication of any litany, except that of the saints as found in the liturgical books and that of Loreto. Later, litanies of the Holy Name of Jesus, the Sacred Heart, the Precious Blood, and St. Joseph were also approved for publication and public recitation. Anglican litanies The Anglican Communion also has a Litany in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer. This is substantially the same as Thomas Cranmer's original English vernacular service from 1544, Exhortation and Litany.MacCulloch, Diarmaid. Thomas Cranmer Yale University Press (1996) pp.328 & 326 respectively Cranmer drew on a variety of sources, chiefly two medieval litanies from the Sarum rite, but also the German Litany of Martin Luther. He originally retained the invocation of the Saints and the Blessed Virgin Mary in very shortened form, but these were omitted in 1549, and he made a notable change in the style of the service by expanding and grouping together said by the priest and provided but a single response to the whole group.Litany, The (BCP) in Cross, F. L. & Livingstone, E. A. (eds) The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church OUP (1974) An anti- papal clause was omitted in 1559. The processional aspect was soon eliminated and the service said or sung kneeling in the church.Procter, Francis & Frere, Walter Howard. A New History of the Book of Common Prayer Macmillan (1902) pp. 422f & 394 respectively The term \\"the Lesser Litany\\" is sometimes used to refer to the versicles and responses, with the Lord's Prayer, that follow the Apostles' Creed at Morning Prayer (or Matins) and Evening Prayer (or Evensong). Additionally, the Anglican \\"Great Litany\\" (see above) was with some edits authorized as \\"The Litany\\" for the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of St. Peter (OCSP) of the Latin Rite. Many other litanies are used in private prayer. A Marian litany is one dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary; only one is authorised for public recitation (mentioned above). The Litany of humility is another well-known prayer. Catholic litanies In the Catholic Church, six litanies are approved for public recitation: * The Litany of the Holy Name of Jesus * The Litany of the Sacred Heart of Jesus * The Litany of the Most Precious Blood of Jesus * The Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary (also known as the Litany of Loreto) * The Litany of Saint Joseph * The Litany of the Saints Lutheran litanies Much of the historic Litany was retained by the Lutheran Church. Luther hailed it as one of the greatest Christian prayers ever. When faced with the Turkish armies at the gates of Vienna in 1528/29, Luther exhorted pastors to call their Christian people to repentance and prayer. He recommended the use of the Litany during the Sunday mass or Vespers. In 1529, he, after modifying the traditional Litany of the Saints (mostly by removing the invocation of saints and prayers for the pope), began using the Litany at Wittenberg in Latin and German. Thomas Cranmer used Luther's revised Litany as one of his main sources in the preparation of the Litany in the Book of Common Prayer. Today, a form of the Litany continues to be used in the various Lutheran Churches around the world.Cf. J. T. Pless, \\"Daily Prayer\\", in Lutheran Worship and Practice, ed. F. L. Precht (Concordia Publishing House: St. Louis, 1993), 465-468. Methodist litanies The Methodist The Book of Worship for Church and Home (1965) contains the following litanies: *The Litany of Recollection of Jesus *The Litany on the Will of God *The Litany of the Divine Will *The Litany of Self-Examination *The Litany of Confession *The Litany of Supplication *The Litany of Remembrance *The Litany of Commemoration *The Litany of Intercession *The Litany for Peace =Eastern Christianity= Russian Orthodox deacon giving an ektenia. He holds the edge of his orarion in his right hand, and will raise it as he finishes each petition. In the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite, a litany is referred to as an ektenia. There are numerous ektenias during the Byzantine divine services: the Divine Liturgy, Vespers, Matins, the Sacred Mysteries (Sacraments), and numerous other services. The petitions of the ektenias are usually chanted by a deacon (but if there is no deacon the priest will say the petitions), to each of which the choir (chanters) or congregation will respond. The response is usually Kyrie eleison (\\"Lord, have mercy\\"), but other responses are used at different ektenias. After the final peitition, the priest makes the ekphonesis (exclamation) which summarizes the ektenia, and always involves an invocation of the Holy Trinity. Judaism Although used to a much lesser extent in Jewish worship, litanies do appear in Jewish liturgy. The most notable examples are during the Ten Days of Repentance. The most famous of these \\"supplicatory\\" prayers is Avinu Malkeinu, which is recited during the Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur liturgies. Certain Selichot prayers also take the form of a litany during the month of Elul.

Finlayson was probably born 1772 in Glasgow and became a self- trained engineer. In 1817, he moved to St. Petersburg to found a textile factory with the backing of Tsar Alexander I of Russia. In 1819 Finlayson visited the Grand Duchy of Finland, at the time under Russian rule. During his religious mission to sell bibles he visited Tampere. The next year Finlayson received permission from the Senate of Finland to build a factory in Tampere using water power from the Tammerkoski rapids. He moved to Tampere with his wife Margaret Finlayson. At first Finlayson had to import machinists from England to train new workers. The first factory was completed 1823 with the aid of a state loan, with the stipulation that the technology employed could be freely inspected by the public to further civic technological advancement. Initially he manufactured machinery suitable for the textile industry but in 1828 switched from machine manufacture to cotton mills. He also founded an orphanage.  Finlayson & Compagnie  Finlayson plaque on the house in Edinburgh where he died On 1 March 1836 Finlayson sold the factory to Georg Rauch and Karl Samuel Nottbeck on condition that they would retain his name for the factory. The new owners complied and founded Finlayson & Compagnie. Finlayson worked in an advisory capacity for a couple of years before moving back to Scotland. He later died on 1852 in Edinburgh. The company grew to be Tampere's largest employer, employing, at its peak, over 3,000 people. It still produces textiles. In 1995 the old factories in the center of Tampere were closed down and the old buildings converted to a commercial and entertainment district. A weaving hall, completed in 1877 and at the time the largest in the Nordic countries, housed a total of 1,200 power looms. In accordance with the custom of naming significant new buildings after recent or current events, it was named Plevna after the Siege of Plevna. It now houses a brewpub and a cinema multiplex. = Electric lighting = The Plevna building was the first in any of the Nordic countries and the fourth in Europe to be equipped with incandescent lighting. The lighting with 120 \\"8 candle\\" bulbs was first switched on on 15 March 1882. The Edison \\"dynamo\\" No. 24 is still located in the building. The system used 110 volt direct current; this system was adopted for all of Tampere, resulting in a war of currents with the later introduced Westinghouse alternating current.

Kennedy and Mafia leaders Sam Giancana and John Roselli. She was also known as Judith Campbell Exner, and Judith Campbell.  Early life  She was born Judith Eileen Katherine Immoor in New Jersey; her father, Frederick, was of German descent and an architect. Her mother, Katherine (n√©e Shea), was of Irish descent. When she was a child, her family moved to the Los Angeles area, where she grew up in Pacific Palisades. After her mother nearly died in an auto accident, Judith withdrew from school at the age of 14 and was tutored at home. Her older sister Jacqueline later became an actress and took the professional name Susan Morrow.  Marriage and family  In 1952, at the age of 18, Judith married actor William Campbell; they divorced in 1958. Described as \\"stunningly beautiful,\\" she claimed to have had an 18-month relationship with then-Senator John F. Kennedy, beginning in 1960, which continued after he was elected President of the United States. She had a son, David Bohrer, from a later relationship. In 1975, Campbell married again, to Dan Exner, a golfer. They separated in 1988.  John F. Kennedy  According to Michael O'Brien of the Washington Monthly, on February 7, 1960, Frank Sinatra and Campbell were in Las Vegas, where Sinatra introduced her to John F. Kennedy, then a senator from Massachusetts and presidential candidate. In her 1977 memoir, she said that she became one of JFK's mistresses for a period of about two years, frequently visiting him in the White House after he was elected president. Her account was supported by phone records and other documentation, although Kennedy staff and supporters attacked her veracity when she published her memoir. A few months later in 1960, Sinatra introduced Campbell to \\"Sam Flood,\\" who was actually Sam Giancana, the leading figure in the Chicago Mafia. She also became involved with him and knew his associate John Roselli. = Church Committee = Exner received national media attention when she testified in 1975 before the Church Committee investigating CIA assassination attempts on Fidel Castro. Roselli testified to the committee about Mafia involvement in the CIA attempt on Castro's life. When the Church Committee report was released in December 1975, it said that a \\"close friend\\" of President Kennedy had also been a close friend of mobsters John Roselli and Sam Giancana.\\" Campbell's identity as the close friend was leaked to the Washington Post, which publicized it. William Safire in The New York Times also published it.Frum, David (2000), How We Got Here: The '70s, Basic Books, New York, New York, p. 28. . Note: Frum's account of Safire being the first to print her name in connection to the Church Committee was contradicted by O'Brien, who said it was leaked to the Washington Post. The Committee had sent Exner a subpoena to make her testify. By then, married to Dan Exner, Judith Exner called a press conference that month and denied any knowledge of Mafia involvement with Kennedy.  Memoir  In 1977, Exner published Judith Exner: My Story. In her memoir, she said that her relationship with Kennedy was entirely personal. She also said that Frank Sinatra later introduced her to Sam Giancana, with whom she also became intimate. She said that Giancana never asked her for any information related to Kennedy. She also said that John Roselli was her friend. Aside from her own alleged affair with JFK, Exner claimed to have knowledge of other women who had affairs with Kennedy. These affairs included one with Danish journalist Inga Arvad between late 1941 and early 1942. Exner also said that Kennedy brought prostitutes to the White House swimming pool. Journalists and some historians have also alleged that Kennedy had a number of affairs, citing a memo by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover as part of the evidence.THOMAS POWERS, \\"The Sins of a President\\", New York Times, November 30, 1997 Exner said that President Kennedy's Special Assistant David Powers helped set up encounters with President Kennedy. Powers later stated that Kennedy never had an affair with Exner.Judith Exner: From the Outfit to the Oval Office  Later accounts  In a 1988 interview with Kitty Kelley of People magazine, Exner told a very different story about Giancana and Kennedy. She said that she had lied to the Church Committee and in her memoir out of fear of Mafia retaliation. She said Kennedy had asked her to contact Giancana, and she helped set up a meeting between them during the 1960 presidential election. For about 18 months in 1960‚Äì61, \\"Exner claimed she served as the president's link with the Mob. She crisscrossed the nation carrying envelopes between the president and Giancana, and arranged about 10 meetings between the two.\\" She later claimed these messages concerned plans to assassinate the Cuban president Fidel Castro. In 1997, Exner alleged more details and changed her story, in separate interviews with Liz Smith of Vanity Fair and Seymour Hersh. She said Kennedy told her of his plans related to Cuba, and used her to carry money to Giancana, as well as to arrange numerous meetings between him, Giancana and Roselli. She claimed to Smith to have terminated a pregnancy resulting from a last encounter in 1962 with Kennedy. She said that she had carried payoffs from California defense contractors to the Kennedys, including Robert F. Kennedy. A witness of Hersh's who appeared to support Exner's story of carrying money to Giancana later dropped his story. Both liberal and conservative critics have attacked these later accounts. They depend mostly on Exner and are not supported by what is known of Kennedy and his staff. Her earlier accounts of her affair with Kennedy were supported by FBI reports, Secret Service and White House phone logs and staff documentation. She has been described as an \\"unreliable witness,\\" with a history of instability, depression and paranoia and, by then, she was suffering from cancer. = Later years and death = Judith Campbell Exner lived in Newport Beach and was a painter. She died on September 24, 1999 in Duarte, California from breast cancer.  In popular culture  Exner's memoir was adapted as a made-for-TV movie, Power and Beauty (2002), directed by Susan Seidelman, in which she was played by Natasha Henstridge. Material was added from accounts published after her 1977 memoir. Judy Campbell was portrayed in the 1998 HBO movie The Rat Pack by Michelle Grace. In the 2004 episode \\"In Camelot\\" of the TV series The Sopranos, the character of Fran Felstein is based on Judith Exner. Campbell was portrayed by Megan Vincent in the 2011 TV series The Kennedys. In 2016, she appeared as a character in the third episode of the first season of the television series Timeless, played by Elena Satine.

After considerable attention and further investigation, the mummy proved to be an archaeological forgery and possibly a murder victim. Discovery The mummy was found on October 19, 2000. Pakistani authorities were alerted to a videotape recorded by Ali Aqbar, in which he claimed to have a mummy for sale. When questioned by the police, Aqbar told them where the mummy was located; at the house of tribal leader Wali Mohammed Reeki in Kharan, Baluchistan near the border of Afghanistan. Reeki claimed he had received the mummy from an Iranian named Sharif Shah Bakhi, who had said that he had found it after an earthquake near Quetta. The mummy had been put up for sale in the black antiquities market for 600 million rupee, the equivalent of $11 million. Reeki and Aqbar were accused of violating the country's Antiquities Act, a charge which carries a maximum sentence of ten years in prison. Identification In a press conference on October 26, Pakistani archaeologist Ahmad Hasan Dani of Islamabad's Quaid-e-Azam University announced that the mummy seemed to be a princess dated circa 600 BC. The mummy was wrapped in ancient Egyptian style, and rested in a gilded wooden coffin with cuneiform carvings inside a stone sarcophagus. The coffin had been carved with a large faravahar image. The mummy was atop a layer of wax and honey, was covered by a stone slab and had a golden crown on its brow. An inscription on the golden chest plate claimed that she was the relatively unknown Rhodugune, a daughter of king Xerxes I of Persia and a member of the Achaemenid dynasty.The Mystery of the Persian Mummy. BBC Two. 20 September 2001. (transcript) Hasan Dani speculated that she might have been an Egyptian princess married to a Persian prince, or a daughter of the Achaemenid king Cyrus the Great. However, because mummification had been primarily an Egyptian practice, they had not encountered any mummies in Persia before. Ownership The governments of Iran and Pakistan soon began to argue about the ownership of the mummy. The Iranian Cultural Heritage Organization claimed her as a member of Persian royal family and demanded the mummy's return. Pakistan's Archaeological Department HQ said that it belonged to Pakistan because it had been found in Baluchistan. The Taliban of Afghanistan also made a claim. People in Quetta demanded that the police should return the mummy to them. In November 2000, the mummy was placed in display in the National Museum of Pakistan. Doubts News of the Persian Princess prompted American archaeologist Oscar White Muscarella to describe an incident the previous March when he was shown photographs of a similar mummy. Amanollah Riggi, a middleman working in behalf of an unidentified antiquities dealer in Pakistan, had approached him, claiming its owners were a Zoroastrian family who had brought it to the country. The seller had claimed that it was a daughter of Xerxes, based on a translation of the cuneiform of the breastplate. The cuneiform text on the breastplate contained a passage from the Behistun inscription in western Iran. The Behistun inscription was carved during the reign of Darius, the father of Xerxes. When the dealer's representative had sent a piece of a coffin to be carbon dated, analysis had shown that the coffin was only around 250 years old. Muscarella had suspected a forgery and severed contact. He had informed Interpol through the FBI. When Pakistani professor Ahmad Dani, director of the Institute of Asian Civilizations in Islamabad, studied the item, he realized the corpse was not as old as the coffin. The mat below the body was about five years old. He contacted Asma Ibrahim, the curator of the National Museum of Pakistan, who investigated further. During the investigation, Iran and the Taliban repeated their demands. The Taliban claimed that they had apprehended the smugglers that had taken the mummy out of Afghanistan. The inscriptions on the breastplate were not in proper grammatical Persian. Instead of a Persian form of the daughter's name, Wardegauna, the forgers had used a Greek version Rhodugune. CAT and X-ray scans in Agha Khan Hospital indicated that the mummification had not been made following ancient Egyptian custom - for example, the heart had been removed along with the rest of the internal organs, whereas the heart of a genuine Egyptian mummy would normally be left inside the body. Furthermore, tendons that should have decayed over the centuries were still intact. Ibrahim published her report on April 17, 2001. In it, she stated that the \\"Persian princess\\" was in fact a woman about 21‚Äì25 years of age, who had died around 1996, possibly killed with a blunt instrument to the lower back/pelvic region (e.g., hit by vehicle from behind). A subsequent accelerator mass spectrometry dating also confirmed the mummy's status as a modern fake. Her teeth had been removed after death, and her hip joint, pelvis and backbone damaged, before the body had been filled with powder. Police began to investigate a possible murder and arrested a number of suspects in Baluchistan. Fate The Edhi Foundation took custody of the body, and on August 5, 2005, announced that it was to be interred with proper burial rites. However, police and other government officials never responded to numerous requests, and it was not until 2008 that the foundation finally carried out the burial.Khan, Aamer Ahmed (5 August 2005). \\"Burial for Pakistan's fake mummy\\". BBC News.Pakistan Press Foundation (December 31, 2008) \\"Mummified remains of woman buried\\" Representations in contemporary art The Persian Princess is the name of an exhibition presented in August 2016 in Jerusalem, by artist Hili Greenfeld. The exhibition functions as a tribute to the anonymous woman who, in an instant, went from the status of a Princess in a gold-plated coffin displayed in a national museum, to the victim of a vicious murder in whom everyone quickly lost interest. The extreme transformation of the perception of the archeological object ‚Äì from an honored Princess to a woman who was murdered ‚Äì is what interests Greenfeld. Greenfeld picked up the signs and symbols used by the forgers, such as engraved rosettes, Cypress gold, the icon of Ahura Mazda, Gold Crown, etc. She painted the symbols on artificial grass, and created a hybrid of lyrical abstract paintings, Persian rugs and graffiti murals. The works that are shown on the walls and on the floor seem to be graffiti murals and then seem to be rugs, but in both cases they are synthetic imitations of the original.

In jail, he contacted literary agent Joel Gotler of the Artist Management Group, a talent agency in Hollywood, and convinced him that he was actually Michael Gambino, the illegitimate grandson of Carlo Gambino. When he was released in 2001, Gotler sold his story to Pocket Books, a division of Simon & Schuster, for a $500,000 advance.

However, when the British Admiralty requested a demonstration of the Aerophone, Matthews demanded that no experts be present at the scene. When four of the observers dismantled part of the apparatus before the demonstration began and took notes, Matthews cancelled the demonstration and drove observers away. Newspapers rushed to Matthews' defence. The War Office denied any tampering and claimed that the demonstration was a failure. The government later stated that the affair was just a misunderstanding. In 1914, after the outbreak of the First World War, the British government announced an award of ¬£25,000 to anyone who could create a weapon against zeppelins or remotely control unmanned vehicles. Matthews claimed that he had created a remote control system that used selenium cells. He successfully demonstrated it with a remotely controlled boat to representatives of the Admiralty at Richmond Park's Penn Pond. He received his ¬£25,000 but the admiralty never used the invention. Next, Matthews appeared in public in 1921 and claimed to have invented the world's first talking picture, a farewell interview of Ernest Shackleton recorded on 16 September 1921, shortly before Shackleton's last expedition. The film was not commercially successful. Other talking-picture processes had been developed before that of Matthews, including processes by William K. L. Dickson, Photokinema (Orlando Kellum) and Phonofilm (Lee DeForest). However, Matthews claimed his process was the first sound-on-film process. Death ray 1925 photo that purports to show a night demonstration of the ray on the island of Flat Holm In 1923 Matthews claimed that he had invented an electric ray that would put magnetos out of action. In a demonstration to some select journalists he stopped a motorcycle engine from a distance. He also claimed that with enough power he could shoot down aeroplanes, explode gunpowder, stop ships and incapacitate infantry from the distance of four miles. Newspapers obliged by publishing sensational accounts of his invention. The War Office contacted Matthews in February 1924 to request a demonstration of his ray. Matthews did not reply to them but spoke to journalists and demonstrated the ray to a Star reporter by igniting gunpowder from a distance. He still refused to say how the ray actually worked, but just insisted that it did. When the British government still refused to rush to buy his ideas, he announced that he had an offer from France. The Air Ministry was wary, partly because of previous bad experiences with would-be inventors. Matthews was invited back to London to demonstrate his ray on 26 April to the armed forces. In Matthews's laboratory they saw how his ray switched on a light bulb and cut off a motor. He failed to convince the officials, who also suspected trickery or a confidence game. When the British Admiralty requested further demonstration, Matthews refused to give it. On 27 May 1924, the High Court in London granted an injunction to Matthew's investors that forbade him from selling the rights to the death ray. When Major Wimperis arrived at Matthews's laboratory to negotiate a new deal, Matthews had already flown to Paris. Matthews's backers appeared on the scene as well and then rushed to Croydon airport to stop him, but were too late. Public furore attracted interest of various other would-be inventors who wanted to demonstrate their own death rays to the War Office. None of them were convincing. On 28 May Commander Kenworthy asked in the House of Commons what the government intended to do to stop Matthews from selling the ray to a foreign power. The Under Secretary for Air answered that Matthews was not willing to let them investigate the ray to their satisfaction. A government representative also stated that one ministry official had stood before the ray and survived. Newspapers continued to root for Matthews. The government required that Matthews would use the ray to stop a petrol motorcycle engine in the conditions that would satisfy the Air Ministry. He would receive ¬£1000 and further consideration. From France, Matthews answered that he was not willing to give any proof of that kind and that he already had eight bids to choose from. He also claimed that he had lost sight in his left eye because of his experiments. His involvement with his French backer Eugene Royer aroused further suspicions in Britain. Sir Samuel Instone and his brother Theodore offered Matthews a huge salary if he would keep the ray in Britain and demonstrate that it actually worked. Matthews refused again ‚Äì he did not want to give any proof that the ray worked as he claimed it would. Matthews returned to London 1 June 1924 and gave an interview to the Sunday Express. He claimed that he had a deal with Royer. The press again took his side. The only demonstration Matthews was willing to give was to make a Path√© film The Death Ray to propagate his ideas to his own satisfaction. The device in the movie bore no resemblance to the one government officials had seen. In July 1924, Matthews left for the US to market his invention. When he was offered $25,000 to demonstrate his beam to the Radio World Fair at Madison Square Garden, he again refused and claimed, without foundation, that he was not permitted to demonstrate it outside England. US scientists were not impressed. One Professor Woods offered to stand in front of the death ray device to demonstrate his disbelief. Regardless, when Matthews returned to Britain, he claimed that the USA had bought his ray but refused to say who had done it and for how much. Matthews moved to the US and began to work for Warner Bros. Further inventions In 1925 he invented what he called the \\"luminaphone\\". On 24 December 1930 Matthews was back in England with his new creation ‚Äì a Sky Projector that projected pictures onto clouds. He demonstrated it in Hampstead by projecting an angel, the message \\"Happy Christmas\\" and a reportedly \\"accurate\\" clock face. He demonstrated it again in New York. This invention was not successful either, and by 1931 he faced bankruptcy. He had used most of his investors' money for living in expensive hotels. In 1934 Matthews had a new set of investors and relocated to Tor Clawdd, Betws, South Wales. He built a fortified laboratory and his own airfield. In 1935 he claimed that he worked on aerial mines and in 1937 that he had invented a system for detecting submarines. In 1938 he married Ganna Walska, a Polish-American opera singer, perfumer and feminist, whose four previous husbands had owned fortunes totalling $125,000,000. In 1935 he became involved with the right-wing Lucy, Lady Houston and intended to carry out experiments in French naval submarine detection from her luxury yacht, the Liberty. In 2010 new research chronicled the episode, explaining how Matthews was frustrated in carrying out his aims. Later he propagated the idea of the \\"stratoplane\\" and joined the British Interplanetary Society. His reputation preceded him and the British Government was no longer interested in his ideas. Personal life Harry Grindell Matthews was the fifth husband of singer Ganna Walska: they married in 1938. He died of a heart attack on 11 September 1941. References External links *H.

Biography Born in Paris, he attended the Naval Academy but resigned from the French Navy in 1923. He became a journalist and a poet and was involved with the integralist and monarchist journal Action Fran√ßaise, but turned towards the Left after the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39). When the Second World War broke out, d'Astier re-enlisted into the French Navy and became the head of naval intelligence. However, after the fall of France and the proclamation of Vichy France, he was dismissed for his political dossier. In Clermont-Ferrand, d'Astier formed the Resistant group La Derni√®re Colonne, later known as Lib√©ration-sud, with Raymond Aubrac, Lucie Aubrac and Jean Cavaill√®s. During 1941, the group carried out two sabotage attacks at train stations in Perpignan and Cannes. In February, they organised the distribution of 10,000 propaganda flyers, but one of the distributors was caught by the police, leading to the arrest of d'Astier's niece and uncle. The group decided to cease activities. After a few months' hiatus, they began to work on an underground newspaper, Lib√©ration. The first edition was put together with the help of the typographers from a local newspaper and printed on paper supplied by local trade-unionists. 10,000 copies were produced in July 1941. In 1942 d'Astier met with Jean Moulin to discuss the unification of the Resistance and eventually joined forces into the Conseil National de la R√©sistance (CNR, National Council of Resistance). In 1943 he met Charles de Gaulle in Algiers and joined his Free French Forces government-in-exile as a Commissioner to the Interior. While in London in 1943, he wrote the lyrics for the song \\"La Complainte du partisan\\" with Anna Marly, who wrote the music. In English, it is known as \\"The Partisan\\" and was recorded by Leonard Cohen, Joan Baez, Buffy Saint Marie and many others. After the Liberation, d'Astier became Minister of Interior in the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF). He continued to publish Lib√©ration and wrote books based on his experiences. He ran as an ally of the French Communist Party on the Union r√©publicaine et r√©sistante list in the November 1946 French legislative elections, and won a seat in the National Assembly for Ille-et-Vilaine. He was later among the founders of the Union progressiste. In 1958 he received the Lenin Peace Prize. D'Astier was one of the founders of the Stockholm Committee; he denounced the Soviet Union leadership under Nikita Khrushchev after the crushing of the Hungarian uprising, and broke ties with communists. His brother, Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie, was from the far right, and, initially a member of the Action Fran√ßaise, may even have been involved with the Cagoule terrorist group. Ultimately, Henri d'Astier also took part in the R√©sistance. Emmanuel d'Astier died in Paris in 1969. His wife Liubov was the second spouse of French politician Gaston Bergery (divorced in 1928) and the daughter of Bolshevik Leonid Krasin. They had three sons Jean-Francois, Christophe and J√©r√¥me. Family friend Joan Baez wrote and recorded a song, \\"Luba the Baroness\\", about learning of the death of the oldest son, Jean-Francois.

He had written all the principal parts of the ballet, and was intending to fill in the orchestration as time permitted. However, Strauss died in 1899, and it was finished by composer Josef Bayer in 1900. History The idea for Strauss to write a ballet came from Rudolf Lothar, editor of the influential magazine Die Waage (The Weighing Scales). This occurred after the music and dance critic Eduard Hanslick, having been encouraged by Strauss' impressive Act 3 ballet score in his only opera Ritter P√°sm√°n, suggested that Strauss should write a full-score ballet. On 5 March 1898, a contest was organised in order to decide a proper scenario for Strauss' new ballet. The panel of judges consists of Hanslick; Gustav Mahler, the controversial conductor and composer who at the time also directed the Vienna Court Opera (including its ballet company); patron Nikolaus Dumba; Strauss himself, and Rudolf Lothar. Finally, it was decided (after receiving over 700 entries) that the winner was a certain A. Kollmann from Salzburg. The prize money was even effected through a lawyer representative and there were even rumors circulated that Kollmann was a pseudonym and that he may even be a member of the royalty in Emperor Franz Josef's court. Strauss was not particularly impressed with the scenario set in a modern department store, although he set to work almost immediately. He worked at his pace and refused to be rushed, and by the winter of 1898, he had completed the Act 1 and was able to perform small parts of the orchestral version on the piano. By the time Strauss died in Vienna on 3 June 1899, the work lay unfinished, although sketches of the entire work were already done. Josef Bayer duly completed the work in 1900 and presented the score to Gustav Mahler for future production at the Vienna Court Opera. Mahler refused to appraise the score, doubting the originality of the work, as Bayer himself was also a ballet composer, and when shown the original score in Strauss' writing, he claimed that he could not care for the music. Many persistent rumors suggested that he was not interested in ballet at all and only concentrated on full-scale opera works. This has been disputed by the fact that Mahler himself was eager to obtain the rights to stage Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty ballet and that due to the lack of budget, he was not able to stage Cinderella as envisioned in the scenario. In 1901, Berlin's Royal Opera took interest in the score, with its directors captivated by the music, although they disapproved of the scenario. Their choreographer, Emil Graeb, suggested a change to the scenario and the task fell to Austrian writer Henrich Regel. The work's premiere on 2 May 1901 was a success, although reservations were made by Strauss' biographer, Ignatz Schnitzer, who commented that Bayer's orchestration fell short of Vienna's light-heartedness and the now-revised scenario was too 'puritanical'. Mahler left the Vienna Court Opera at the end of the 1907 season. The new director, Felix Weingartner, who was impressed with the score, eagerly sought it out and conducted the orchestra himself at the premiere in Vienna on 4 October 1908. The ballet was regularly performed for seven years, achieving forty-six performances until the outbreak of World War I. Ironically, Mahler proved to be more accurate in his judgment as to the cost of the production, as the Viennese performances were expensive, and it was neglected until 1975 when the ballet was resurrected.  Summary of plot  The action takes place in a department store, The Four Seasons. The leading characters are Gustav, owner of the store, and Franz, his younger brother and rival for the love of Grete (Cinderella), who works in the women‚Äôs fashions department. Grete‚Äôs stepmother, Mme. Leontine, is the department‚Äôs supervisor. She has, of course, two daughters who lord it over Grete and don‚Äôt seem to work though they are often in the store. Another key character, Piccolo, Gustav‚Äôs valet, is a travesty role. As mentioned, the ballerina (the part is referred to as \\"Floral\\") appears only in the ballroom (Act 2) for the floral divertissement. Typically, the printed program for Cinderella lists all the dances. From this inventory one gets an inkling how Viennese ballets at the time differed from those of St. Petersburg, which we know at least a little. There are four dances in Act 1. The first, called Franz‚Äôs Self-portrait, introduces the ballet‚Äôs junior male lead (probably demicaractere) to the female cast of characters and to the audience. In this solo, Franz (Ferdinand Rathner) proclaims who he is and what he does. One of the things he masters is driving an automobile‚Äîdancemiming this topic seems very Leonide Massine. The stepsisters (danced by real sisters, Lydia and Olga Berger) have a Promenade Adventure and Piccolo (Luise Wopalenski) does a Love Letter Delivery to Grete (Marie Kohler) who, with her trained birds, dances the Waltz of the Doves. Apparently there are no ensemble dances in Act 1, though there are several in Act 2, at the party thrown by Gustav. First comes the Marveilleusen Quadrille for Franz and the female corps. A pas de trois, Masked Game, is for the stepsisters and Gustav (Karl Godlewski, one of Hassreiter‚Äôs deputy choreographers). Grete dances a solo named the Blue Domino after the costume she wears (probably as covering as she arrives at the party). The Confections Waltz (which may have something to do with the refreshments being served) features nine female soloists and the female corps; this is followed by a Salon Quadrille for four couples, a mazurka for the stepsisters, and Grete‚Äôs big solo: the Cinderella Waltz. The ballerina (C√§cilie Cerri, Vienna‚Äôs last Italian prima, was \\"Flora\\") enters in a Welcome with Flowers, which leads into the biggest dance number, the Flowertorch Polonaise with \\"Flora,\\" Grete, thirteen female soloists, Gustav, four male soloists, the adult female corps and the group of female students. An Amoretten polka is the first dance in Act 3, followed by the Bridal-Treasure Waltz for Grete, a female soloist, Piccolo, Gustav, and the female students. The next dance, Old Vienna Porcelain, for Piccolo plus four solo women and four solo men, may represent a wedding present, and the final Jewels Waltz for Piccolo, nine female soloists and the female corps, is perhaps, the setting for the bridegroom‚Äôs gift to his bride.

Today they provide a somewhat macabre tourist attraction as well as an extraordinary historical record Historical background Palermo's Capuchin monastery outgrew its original cemetery in the 16th century and monks began to excavate crypts below it. In 1599 they mummified one of their number, recently dead brother Silvestro of Gubbio, and placed him into the catacombs. The bodies were dehydrated on the racks of ceramic pipes in the catacombs and sometimes later washed with vinegar. Some of the bodies were embalmed and others enclosed in sealed glass cabinets. Monks were preserved with their everyday clothing and sometimes with ropes they had worn as a penance. Originally the catacombs were intended only for the dead friars. However, in the following centuries it became a status symbol to be entombed into the Capuchin catacombs. In their wills, local luminaries would ask to be preserved in certain clothes, or even to have their clothes changed at regular intervals. Priests wore their clerical vestments, others were clothed according to the contemporary fashion. Relatives would visit to pray for the deceased and also to maintain the body in presentable condition. The catacombs were maintained through the donations of the relatives of the deceased. Each new body was placed in a temporary niche and later placed into a more permanent place. As long as the contributions continued, the body remained in its proper place but when the relatives did not send money any more, the body was put aside on a shelf until they resumed payments.  Interments  Rosalia Lombardo as she appeared in 1982. She died in 1920 The last friar interred into the catacombs was Brother Riccardo in 1871 but other famous people were still interred. The catacombs were officially closed in 1880 but tourists continued to visit. The last burials are from the 1920s. One of the very last to be interred was Rosalia Lombardo, then nearly two years old, whose body is still remarkably intact, preserved with a procedure. The embalming procedure, performed by Professor Alfredo Salafia, consisted of formalin to kill bacteria, alcohol to dry the body, glycerin to keep her from overdrying, salicylic acid to kill fungi, and the most important ingredient, zinc salts (zinc sulfate and zinc chloride) to give the body rigidity. The formula is 1 part glycerin, 1 part formalin saturated with both zinc sulfate and chloride, and 1 part of an alcohol solution saturated with salicylic acid. The catacombs contain about 8000 corpses and 1252 mummies (as stated by last census made by EURAC in 2011) that line the walls. The halls are divided into categories: Men, Women, Virgins, Children, Priests, Monks, and Professionals. Some bodies are better preserved than others. Some are set in poses; for example, two children are sitting together in a rocking chair. The coffins were accessible to the families of the deceased so that on certain days the family could hold their hands and they could \\"join\\" their family in prayer. Famous people buried in the catacombs include: * Colonel Enea DiGuiliano (in French Bourbon uniform) * Salvatore Manzella, surgeon * Lorenzo Marabitti, sculptor * Giovanni Paterniti, an American Vice-Consul who died in Palermo in 1911 * Filipo Pennino, sculptor * Son of a king of Tunis who had converted to Catholicism * Giuseppe Velasco also called Vel√°squez the Sicilian painter of Chinese Palace in Palermo. * Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa is sometimes said to be buried in the catacombs, but he is buried in the cemetery next to them.  Scientific research  The Sicily Mummy Project was created in 2007, to study the mummies and to create profiles on those that were mummified. The project is led by the anthropologist Dario Piombino-Mascali of the Department of Cultural Heritage and Sicilian Identity in Palermo, and is backed by the European Academy of Bozen/Bolzano The mummies are X-Rayed and given CT scans in order to preserve the mummies, along with other anthropolicial and paleopathological techniques to confirm the age, and sex of the individuals. Piombino-Mascali credits the program with re-opening the discussion about death in Sicily; Forensic biologist Mark Benecke identified several insects that shed a light on the process of mummification. [.pdf]  Tourism  The catacombs are open to the public and taking photographs inside is supposedly prohibited, with prominent signs making it clear to visitors that photography is not allowed. However, the bodies have been shown on film in Francesco Rosi's Cadaveri Eccellenti (\\"Illustrious Corpses\\"), and television programmes such as the Channel 4 series Coach Trip, BBC TV series The Human Body in 1998, Francesco's Italy: Top to Toe, Ghosthunting With Paul O'Grady and Friends on ITV2 in 2008 and The Learning Channel in 2000. Iron grills have been installed to prevent tourists tampering or posing with the corpses.

While scoring systems vary between organizations, each measures the time of which the course is completed, with penalties for inaccurate shooting. The courses are called \\"stages\\", and are shot individually by the shooters. Usually the shooter must move and shoot from several positions, fire under or over obstacles and in other unfamiliar positions. There are no standard exercises or set arrangement of the targets, and the courses are often designed so that the shooter must be inventive, and therefore the solutions of exercises sometimes varies between shooters. International sanctioning bodies There are several international sanctioning bodies: * The International Practical Shooting Confederation (IPSC) is the oldest and largest sanctioning body within practical shooting. IPSC Open Division is sometimes considered the \\"Formula One\\" of shooting sports,CZ -News - Ceska zbrojovka - PISTOL SHOOTERS - IPSC and is shot with handguns, rifles and shotguns.IPSC.org - Rules ** The United States Practical Shooting Association (USPSA) is the U.S. regional affiliate of IPSC. Many of USPSA's rules differ slightly from those used internationally. ** The Steel Challenge Shooting Association, founded as a separate discipline, was purchased and integrated by USPSA in 2007. In Steel Challenge matches, competitors shoot five strings of fire at a series of five steel plates of varying sizes at varied distances in an attempt to achieve the fastest time possible for knocking down the plates. The order of fire is dictated by a plate designated as the stop plate which must be shot last. The longest time is dropped and the remaining four times are averaged for a composite stage time. * The International Defensive Pistol Association (IDPA) is a game based on the philosophy of using practical equipment to solve real world self- defense scenarios.IDPA.com - About IDPA Fundamental aspects include shooting from behind cover (when available) and a mandate on engaging targets immediately as they become visible. The sport was created to bring defensive tactics back as a component in addition to speed and accuracy. * Cowboy Action Shooting is quite similar to IPSC-shooting, but with an Old West theme. There are multiple international sanctioning bodies, with Single Action Shooting Society being the oldest and largest.Cowboy Action Shooting: Getting Started Firearms must be either original or reproduction designs correct for the 19th century, such as Colt single-action pistols and Winchester rifles. The competitors must also choose and go by a cowboy nickname, and are required to look the part by using cowboy and cowgirl garments in late 19th century period dress. * Multigun, also called 2-Gun or 3-Gun, are shooting events shot with a combination of rifles, handguns, and shotguns. While multi-gun has a lot in common with ordinary IPSC/USPSA matches, the biggest difference is that each stage generally requires the use of several different firearms and that the shooter has to transition between them. Among the largest annual multigun events in the USA are the USPSA Multigun Championship, the Rocky Mountain 3-Gun, the DPMS Tri-Gun Challenge, the Superstition Mountain Mystery 3-Gun, and the Larue Tactical Multigun Championship. * Glock Sport Shooting Foundation (GSSF) is a competition sponsored by Glock and limited to participants using Glock pistols.Glock Sport Shooting Foundation Origins Ray Chapman, Elden Carl, Thell Reed, Jeff Cooper, Jack Weaver. (The sixth \\"Combat Master\\", John Plahn, is missing from this photograph.) Practical shooting evolved from experimentation with firearms for hunting and self- defense. The researchers of what were to become practical shooting were an international group of private individuals, law enforcement officers, and military people generally operating independently of each other, challenging the then-accepted standards of technique, training practices, and equipment. The work was, for the most part, conducted for their own purposes without official sanction. Even so, what they learned has had a great impact on police and military training forever. Some consider the previous Olympic event 100 meter running deer as the first practical rifle shooting competition, \\"Moving target shooting is the original 'Practical Rifle' discipline.\\" Skyting & v√•pen (1983) by Erik Braathen, A/S V√•penlitteratur, Chr. Schibsted forlag, Oslo. p. 82, ch. 7 Viltm√•lskyting which originated in Wimbledon, London in 1862. Other notable rifle speed shooting events are Stang shooting (stangskyting) which has been arranged since 1912, and Nordic field rapid shooting (called felthurtig, sekundf√§lt and sekundskydning in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, respectively) which has been a part of the Nordic Fullbore Rifle Championship since 1953. Around 1900, efforts were done to develop more effective uses of handguns in combat shooting, mainly through experiments by British officers. The first known attempts at developing practical shooting as a handgun sport were done in the U.S. before the second world war, but the attempts resulted in little. Shortly after the second world war a distinct combat shooting sport for handguns known as stridsskyting became popular in Norway. This form of shooting had few similarities with the practical pistol sport which would later emerge. During the 10 to 12 years of its existence, what today is known as field shooting gradually took over as the more popular form of pistol shooting in Norway, and the original stridsskyting was completely gone as a discipline in the beginning of the 1960s. Stridsskyting later also was used separately to describe the completely different sport of IPSC-style practical shooting during its infancy in Norway. In the early 1950s, practical handgun competitions as we know them today emerged in the USA. Competitions begun with the leather slap quick draw events, which had grown out of America's love affair with the TV westerns of that era. However, many wished for a forum that would more directly test the results of the experimentation in modern technique that had been going on at the Bear Valley GunslingersBear Valley Gunslingers at Big Bear Lake, California and other places. Competitions were set up to test what had been learned, and they soon grew into a distinct sport, requiring competitors to deal with constantly changing scenarios. The first public competition was at the Big Bear Lake in 1957. In 1969, the South- West-Pistol-League was formed by individual shooters and clubs from California, which to this day is one of the oldest clubs for practical shooting. The first IPSC World Shoot was held in 1975 in Zurich, about two years before IPSC was formally founded. Ray Chapman from the U.S. became the first ever world class practical pistol champion. The next year, the 1976 IPSC Handgun World Shoot followed with Jan Foss from Norway taking gold. On 24 May 1976 the International Practical Shooting Confederation was formally founded at the Columbia conference in Columbia, Missouri, with representation in fourteen nations.IPSC :: Columbia Conference Jeff Cooper was unanimously chosen as the first president. Between 1974 and 1979, stridsskytterligaen (literally the Combat Shooting League) had been the forerunner of IPSC shooting in Norway, until the Norwegian Association for Practical Shooting took over and was incorporated into IPSC in 1979. Finland pioneered IPSC Rifle in Scandinavia in the beginning of the 1980s,TriggerFreeze.com - IPSC Rifle Norway and the discipline soon spread to Norway where the first competitions were held in Stavanger February 1984. In 1987 the first official Norwegian Rifle Championship was held, and the championship has been held annually since. South Africa has held IPSC Rifle and Shotgun matches since 1983, and IPSC multigun matches since 1984. The United Kingdom Practical Shooting Association (UKPSA) was founded in 1977,United Kingdom Practical Shooting Association website and initially focused on practical handgun competitions. In the 1980s, practical shotgun competitions were held both by UKPSA as well as another organisation known as the Combat Shotgun Society. UKPSA also held IPSC practical rifle competitions, while the NRA UK has held a separate discipline known as NRA Practical Rifle competitions with courses usually including physical elements.NRA ¬ª Civilian Service Rifle & Practical Rifle - NRA Today, the NRA UK also holds Practical Shotgun competitions (PSG) alongside the IPSC Shotgun of UKPSA.Clive's PSG Journey into IPSC - Practical- Shotgun.com One of the first 3-Gun matches to be held in the United States was the Soldier of Fortune matches held in 1979 in Missouri, \\"Kurt Miller [..] about the origin of 3-Gun: As far as I know the first of its kind was the S.O.F.

The first USPSA Multigun Championship was held in 1990 at Pike-Adams Sportsmen's Alliance (PASA) in Barry, Illinois, \\"PASA has for 29 years also been home to a wide variety of national and international championship shooting sports events, including [... the] inaugural USPSA National 3-Gun Championship (1990)\\" but USPSA did not take on multigun full-time until around 2000.

Adjustments were later formalized in supplementary rulebooks, e.g. UKPSA published a supplementary Rifle and Shotgun rulebook in 1989.First supplementary rulebooks: \\"International Practical Shooting Confederation Rifle and Shotgun Rules\\", UK Edition 1.1. UKPSA. July 1989. Since 1996 IPSC Shotgun and Rifle rules have been published in standalone rulebooks separate from the IPSC Handgun rules.\\"IPSC Rifle Rules\\", 3rd Edition. International Practical Shooting Confederation. October 1996. =Organizations= In 1976, an international group of enthusiasts, interested in what had become known as \\"practical shooting\\", met in Columbia, Missouri. From that meeting came the International Practical Shooting Confederation (IPSC). In 1984, the United States Practical Shooting Association (USPSA) was incorporated as the US Region of IPSC. After many years of established IPSC competition, some shooters, including some of the original founders, became dissatisfied with IPSC, as more specialized equipment was allegedly required to remain competitive. The International Defensive Pistol Association (IDPA) was formed in 1996 with the aim of returning to the defensive pistol roots of practical shooting. Soon after this split, the USPSA devised a series of competition \\"divisions\\" with varying limits on type and modification of equipment, including a \\"Production\\" division with rules similar to the IDPA's regulations. Today USPSA and IDPA matches are two of the most popular forums of practical handgun shooting in the United States, with more than 25,000 and 11,000 members respectively. In 1977 the UKPSA was formed to promote and regulate practical pistol shooting in the UK, and became England's regional affiliate of the IPSC. The association proved very popular, gaining international respect within the practical shooting community, and hosted many National, European and International competitions. Despite the 1997 Firearms Amendment Act in the UK, worldwide practical shooting is currently the second most popular international target shooting discipline and now the fastest growing. Most pistol shooting in the UK suffered severely after the handgun ban, which wiped out many shooting disciplines by removing the ability to participate. Practical shotgun has gained much popularity since the handgun ban, with numerous graded matches each year, and large entries to the European Practical Shotgun Championships.

He used fraudulent combined titles like Prince d'Anjou Durazzo Durassow Romanoff Dolgorouki de Bourbon-Conde. He also sold false titles of nobility through \\"orders\\" he and his associates had created. Early life Alex Brimeyer was born on 4 May 1946Brimeyer changed his birth year to 1948 in connection with his claim to be a Prince of Anjou: in Costermansville (now Bukavu, Democratic Republic of the Congo). His parents were the engineer Victor Brimeyer and his wife Beatrice Dolgoruky, daughter of Ceclava Czapska. Noble Pretender Brimeyer's first attempt to ennoble himself came when he named himself, Brimeyer de la Calchuy√©re, in the 1950s when he was about ten years old. This came to nothing. In 1955, he took a name, His Serene Highness Prince Khevenh√ºller-Abensberg, but the real Princess Khevenh√ºller threatened to sue him. He backpedaled and apologized. Brimeyer also wrote to a number of aristocrats to convince them to adopt him. In 1969, he received a passport of the Principality of Sealand with the name His Highness Prince Alexis Romanov Dolgorouki. When he contacted a Brussels Orthodox priest, Jean Maljinowski, to be baptized, the priest was suspicious since the supposed prince did not speak a word of Russian. He commissioned two death certificates to be published in Le Soir. Through them, he claimed that Nikolai Dolgorouki, his supposed father, had used a pseudonym of Nicholas di Fonzo to escape the October Revolution and lived under the name. In actuality, the Bolsheviks executed the real Nikolai Dolgorouki after the Revolution. Khevenh√ºller Trial Princess von Khevenh√ºller-Metsch, Princess Maria Dolgoroukov and Prince Alexander Pavlovich Dolgorouki sued Brimeyer. They charged that Brimeyer was using their noble titles with malicious intent. The prosecutor presented a large number of fraudulent documents, including letters where Emperor Charles V supposedly ennobles Brimeyer. The court noted that his claim of marriage between his \\"grandfather\\", Prince Dolgorouki, and his \\"grandmother\\", Maria Nikolaevna (who had supposedly survived the execution of the Romanov family in July 1918), was false. On 24 November 1971 Brimeyer was sentenced to jail for 18 months but had fled to Greece from where he sent a letter to the prosecutor. In it he claimed descent from such luminaries as Emperors of Byzantium. In Greece Brimeyer presented himself in the police station, and said that his passport had been stolen. He requested temporary documents. He registered then himself as Alexis Romanov Dolgorouki and for the next ten years he used those documents to \\"prove\\" his status. \\"I, Alexis, Great Grandson of the Tsar\\" In 1979 Brimeyer was living in Spain and contacted the cadet line of the Anjou Durassos. He convinced some of them to give their support and recognize him as the head of the royal house of Anjou- Durazzo. 1982 he published a book \\"I, Alexis, Great Grandson of the Tsar\\" by \\"H.R.H. Prince Alexis d'Anjou Romanov-Dolgorouki, Duke of Durazzo\\". The book included a \\"will\\" where Vassili d'Anjou Durassow supposedly recognized him as his only son. Thus he claimed connection to the house of Anjou and the throne of Naples. Alexis was certain that Victor Brimeyer was not his father. He claimed that after his mother divorced Brimeyer she married Vassili d'Anjou Durassow on 15 April 1947 and that he was born in 1948. This supposed marriage was then annulled and she married Prince Igor Dolgorouki on 6 September 1946. Note that she married Farby two years later. The couple had been elected as royal rulers of Ukraine but had to resign in 1939. Ties to the House of Cond√© In August 1984 Alexis' mother, married Bruce Conde, an imposter to the Princes of Cond√©. After the wedding, he adopted Brimeyer. This gave Alexis an excuse to add the title Bourbon-Cond√©. Ties to Russia Next, Alexis claimed that as his father was the son of Prince Dolgorouki and that Prince Dolgorouki had married the supposedly escaped Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia, and that his mother was their only daughter. Alexis claimed that his grandfather had been elected Volodar of Ukraine and persuaded a few orthodox priests that he was the heir to a throne. Through the Grand Duchess, Alexis claimed a connection to the Romanovs and the Russian throne. Serbian Throne He sent numerous letters to King Juan Carlos of Spain and demanded his recognition. He married and had a son. He also managed to convince the British College of Arms to include himself in documents. Lord Mountbatten of Burma wrote to him on 3 January 1977, addressing him as Prince Dolgorouky as a courtesy. In 1992, two Greater Serbian nationalists, including Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj, visited Brimeyer in Spain. Supposedly they offered him the throne of Serbia. He told journalists that he had been in touch with Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, who was supposedly in favor of restoring the Serbian monarchy. Then he used the title, \\"Prince Alexis II Nemanitch Romanov Dolgorouki\\", Grand Master of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem. He had convinced his Serbian nationalist supporters that he was descended, in a very convoluted manner, from Hrebeljanovic Nemanitch. Alexis claimed to have accepted the throne of Serbia. There appeared to be at least some support for him.Brimeyer Serbian Support The European Monarchist Association published a communiqu√©, where it stated Brimeyer's real identity. The scheme then appears to have collapsed. Death Alexis Brimeyer died of in Madrid. Some of his supporters continue to run his affairs.

' () is a term for the channels through which, in traditional Indian medicine and spiritual knowledge, the energies such as prana of the physical body, the subtle body and the causal body are said to flow. Within this philosophical framework, the nadis are said to connect at special points of intensity, the chakras. The three principal nadis run from the base of the spine to the head, and are the ida on the left, the sushumna in the centre, and the pingala on the right. The nadis play a role in yoga, as many yogic practices, including shatkarmas, mudras and pranayama, are intended to open and unblock the nadis. The ultimate aim of some yogic practises are to direct prana into the sushumna nadi specifically, enabling kundalini to rise, and thus bring about moksha, or liberation.  Overview  Nadi is an important concept in Hindu philosophy, mentioned and described in the sources, some as much as 3,000 years old. The number of nadis of the human body is claimed to be up to hundreds-of-thousands and even millions. The Shiva Samhita treatise on yoga states, for example, that out of 350,000 nadis 14 are particularly important, and among them, the three just mentioned are the three most vital. The three principal nadis are ida, pingala, and sushumna. Ida (‡§á‡§°‡§æ, i·∏çƒÅ \\"comfort\\") lies to the left of the spine, whereas pingala (‡§™‡§ø‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó‡§≤, pi·πÖgala \\"orange\\", \\"tawny\\", \\"golden\\", \\"solar\\") is to the right side of the spine, mirroring the ida. Sushumna (‡§∏‡•Å‡§∑‡•Å‡§Æ‡•ç‡§£‡§æ, su·π£um·πáƒÅ \\"very gracious\\", \\"kind\\"spokensanskrit.de) runs along the spinal cord in the center, through the seven chakras. When the channels are unblocked by the action of yoga, the energy of kundalini uncoils and rises up the sushumna from the base of the spine.  Early references  Several of the ancient Upanishads use the concept of nadis (channels). The nadi system is mentioned in the Chandogya Upanishad (8~6 cc. BCE), verse 8.6.6.For reference to Chandogya Upanishad 8.6.6 and interpretation as an early form of the occult physiology see: McEvilley, Thomas. \\"The Spinal Serpent\\", in: Harper and Brown, p.94. and in verses 3.6-3.7 of the Prasna Upanishad (second half of the 1 millennium BC). As stated in the last, The Varaha Upanishad (13-16 cc. CE) further describes it as follows:Varaha Upanishad, c. 1200-1600 CE  Functions and activities  In yoga theory, nadis carry prana, life force energy. In the physical body, the nadis are channels carrying air, water, nutrients, blood and other bodily fluids around and are similar to the arteries, veins, capillaries, bronchioles, nerves, lymph canals and so on. In the subtle and the causal body, the nadis are channels for so called cosmic, vital, seminal, mental, intellectual, etc. energies (collectively described as prana) and are important for sensations, consciousness and the spiritual aura. Yoga texts disagree on the number of nadis in the human body. The Hatha Yoga Pradipika and Goraksha Samhita quote 72,000 nadis, each branching off into another 72,000 nadis, whereas the Shiva Samhita states 350,000 nadis arise from the navel center, and the Katha Upanishad (6.16) says that 101 channels radiate from the heart. All nadis are said to originate from one of two centres; the heart and the kanda, the latter being an egg-shaped bulb in the pelvic area, just below the navel. The Ida and Pingala nadis are sometimes in modern readings interpreted as the two hemispheres of the brain. Pingala is the extroverted (Active), solar nadi, and corresponds to the right hand side of the body and the left hand side of the brain. Ida is the introverted, lunar nadi, and corresponds to the left hand side of the body and the right hand side of the brain (there is a contralateralization). These nadis are also said to have an extrasensory function, playing a part in empathic and instinctive responses. The two nadis are believed to be stimulated through different Pranayama practices, including nadi shodhana, which involves alternately breathing through the left and right nostrils, which would theoretically stimulate the left and right sides of the brain respectively. The word nadi comes from the Sanskrit root nad meaning \\"channel\\", \\"stream\\", or \\"flow\\". Special breathing techniques are practised to influence the flow of prana within these nadis. According to this interpretation, these techniques purify and develop these two energetic currents and may lead to the awakening of kundalini. = Ida, Pingala and Sushumna = * Ida is associated with lunar energy. The word ida means \\"comfort\\" in Sanskrit. IdƒÅ has a moonlike nature and feminine energy with a cooling effect.Three fundamental nadis It courses from the left testicle to the left nostril and corresponds to the Ganges river. * Pingala is associated with solar energy. The word pingala means \\"orange\\" or \\"tawny\\" in Sanskrit. Pingala has a sunlike nature and masculine energy. Its temperature is heating and courses from the right testicle to the right nostril. It corresponds to the river Yamuna. The Ida and Pingala nadis are often seen as referring to the two hemispheres of the brain. Pingala is the extroverted, solar nadi, and corresponds to left hemisphere. Ida is the introverted, lunar nadi, and refers to the right hemisphere of the brain. Ida nadi controls all the mental processes while Pingala nadi controls all the vital processes. * Sushumna interpenetrates the cerebrospinal axis, and in swara yoga is associated with both nostrils being open and free to the passage of air. The lunar channel Ida is pale in color and located on the left side. It is associated with feminine attributes, the moon and an open left nostril. The solar channel Pingala is red in color and located on the right side. It is associated with masculine attributes, the light of the sun, and an open right nostril.Tommaso Palamidessi, The Occult Constitution of Man and Woman, Bio- energy and the energetic ducts Sushumna connects the base chakra to the crown chakra. It is important in Yoga and Tantra. In Raja Yoga or Yoga of Patanjali, when the mind is quietened through the Yamas, Niyamas, Asanas and Pranayama, the important state of Pratyahara begins. A person entering this state never complains of Dispersion of Mind. This is characterized by observing the movements/jerks in sushumna in the subtle body. The medieval Sat-Cakra- Nirupana (1520s), one of the later and more fully developed classical texts on nadis and chakras, refers to these three main nadis by the names Sasi, Mihira, and Susumna.Sat-Cakra-Nirupana, Purnananda Swami The practices of yoga work together to force prana into the central Sushumna channel, allowing kundalini to rise, leading to moksha, liberation. The shatkarmas purify the nadis, while the mudras trap prana, and other practices (not shown) force the prana out of the Ida and Pingala channels. =Unblocking the channels= The purpose of yoga is moksha, liberation and hence immortality in the state of samadhi, union, which is the meaning of \\"yoga\\" as described in the Patanjalayayogasastra. This is obstructed by blockages in the nadis, which allow the vital air, prana, to languish in the Ida and Pingala channels. The unblocking of the channels is therefore a vital function of yoga. The various practices of yoga, including the preliminary purifications or satkarmas, the yogic seals or mudras, visualisation, breath restraint or pranayama, and the repetition of mantras work together to force the prana to move from the Ida and Pingala into the central Sushumna channel. The mudras in particular close off various openings, thus trapping prana and directing it towards the Sushumna. This allows kundalini to rise up the Sushumna channel, leading to liberation.Arthur Avalon, The Serpentine Power (collection of yoga-tantric texts)  Other traditions and interpretations  Other cultures also work with concepts similar to nadis and prana. = Chinese = Systems based on Traditional Chinese Medicine work with an energy concept called qi. Qi travels through meridians similar in description to the nadis. The microcosmic orbit practice has many similarities to certain Indian nadi shuddha (channel clearing) exercises and the practice of Kriya Yoga. = Tibetan = Tibetan medicine borrows many concepts from Yoga through the influence of Tantric Buddhism. One of the Six Yogas of Naropa is a cleansing of the central channel called phowa, preparing the soul to leave the body through the sagittal suture. The Vajrayana practice of Trul Khor is another practice used to direct and control the flow of energy within the body's energetic meridians through breath control and physical postures. = European = Sometimes the three main nadis are related to the Caduceus of Hermes: \\"the two snakes of which symbolize the kundalini or serpent-fire which is presently to be set in motion along those channels, while the wings typify the power of conscious flight through higher planes which the development of that fire confers\\".C.

It is widely regarded as the most significant industrial action in the history of New Zealand's labour movement. It resulted in one striker being killed, one of only two deaths in industrial actions in New Zealand. Origins At the time of the strike, the labour movement in New Zealand was expanding rapidly. The New Zealand Federation of Labour (known as the \\"Red Fed\\"), which was linked to the Socialist Party, was gaining considerable support from the working class, and the Waihi Trade Union of Workers, to which many miners belonged, was part of the Federation. Disputes between the union and the large Waihi Goldmining Company were frequent. Miners had many grievances regarding their working conditions and often downed tools and walked off the site in response to accidents in the mine (falls, broken limbs, crushing, brusings and even the occasional fatality). A more insidious killer than the accidents was miners' phthisis, dust on the lungs. Because of 'miners complaint' as it was known, men who started mining at 16 would be lucky to reach 40. The company offered no compensation for miners and long before the strike (1906) there was a feeling among them that A large march of unionists and their families through Waihi, led by the union band. In May 1912, a number of stationary engine drivers who rejected the Federation of Labour's strong positions established a breakaway union. Although the Waihi Goldmining Company claimed to have no involvement in the breakaway union, saying that it was a matter of union politics, many workers believed that the Company was attempting to split the union, and called a strike. The local police chief reacted cautiously to the action, but Police Commissioner John Cullen ordered a strong response, dispatching additional police. Two months later, the conservative Reform Party came to power ‚Äî the new Prime Minister, William Massey, declared that he would strongly oppose the \\"enemies of order\\". Support from other miners Several other mines around the country were affected by the action at Waihi, with miners downing tools in support of the Waihi miners or with their own claims against the harsh working conditions. At Reefton, in the South Island, this led to a lock-out of workers in June and July 1912.\\"The Reefton lockout,\\" Maoriland Worker, 14 June 1912. Archived at paperspast.natlib.govt.nz. Retrieved 29 March 2018. Confrontation The police buildup in Waihi continued until an estimated 10 percent of New Zealand's police force was present. Around 60 strikers were arrested and jailed. Anger among the strikers grew, and the Federation of Labour gradually began to lose control to even more radical groups, such as the Industrial Workers of the World organisation. In October, the Company was able to re-open the mine with non-union workers (\\"scabs\\"). The union workers reacted angrily, and the new workers were attacked with stones. Tensions between the union and non-union workers were very high -- the union workers saw the newcomers as threatening their livelihoods and as being traitors to the working class, while many of the newcomers felt they had little choice but to take what work they could find, and resented the attacks and condemnation. =Black Tuesday= The scene outside of the Miners' Hall just after it was stormed and Evans was beaten (the Hall is on the right). The violence gradually escalated, with union workers on one side and non-union workers and police on the other. The greatest level of violence came on 12 November, known as \\"Black Tuesday\\". A group of armed non-union workers and police attacked the union hall, which was defended by a small group of union workers (also armed). Thomas Johnston, a non-union worker who had come to the mines after his market garden in Auckland was bankrupted, was shot in the knee, and a police constable (Gerald Wade) was shot in the stomach. The shots were fired by Fred Evans, a radical unionist. Evans himself was struck by Constable Gerald Wade and later died of his injuries. Soon afterwards, the strikers broke ranks, with many fleeing Waihi altogether. Aftermath Evans was later held by the hardliners up as a hero and a martyr, with Bob Semple saying that Evans had been \\"doing his duty and should have shot more of them\\". Despite this, however, many people in the union movement actually moderated their positions after the strike -- it had, after all, failed to achieve its goals. The strike also contributed to unity in the New Zealand labour movement -- the Socialist Party, which had backed the strike, moved towards merger with the more moderate United Labour Party, which had not. The resultant Social Democratic Party later formed the basis of the modern Labour Party. A pamphlet The Tragic Story of the Waihi Strike was co-written by Harry Holland, Robert Samuel Ross and Francis Edward O'Flynn (O'Flynn wrote under pseudonym Ballot Box). The imprisoned strike leaders including Bill Parry were released in November against security of ¬£1600; the bond was later found to have been put up by brewer Ernest Davis, who was a major source of funds for the Labour Party for half a century. Legacy In late 2016, the play 'Scarlet and Gold' told the story of the Waihi strike.

He later admitted his mistake when it proved to be just the product of an inorganic chemical process (precipitation). In 1868 Huxley studied an old sample of mud from the Atlantic seafloor taken in 1857. When he first examined it, he had found only protozoan cells and placed the sample into a jar of alcohol to preserve it. Now he noticed that the sample contained an albuminous slime that appeared to be criss-crossed with veins. Huxley thought he had discovered a new organic substance and named it Bathybius haeckelii, in honor of German biologist Ernst Haeckel. Haeckel had theorized about Urschleim (\\"primordial slime\\"), a protoplasm from which all life had originated. Huxley thought Bathybius could be that protoplasm, a missing link (in modern terms) between inorganic matter and organic life. Huxley published a description of Bathybius that year T. H. Huxley, \\"On Some Organisms Living at Great Depths in the North Atlantic Ocean\\". Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science, 1868, N.S. 8:203-212 (p. 205). See also T. H. Huxley, \\"On Some Organisms which Live at the Bottom of the North Atlantic, in Depths of 6000 to 15,000 Feet.\\" Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, 1869 - Notices and Abstracts, p. 102. NB This only contains a bare mention of the previous paper. and also wrote to Haeckel to tell him about it. Haeckel was impressed and flattered and procured a sample for himself. In the next edition of his textbook The History of Creation Haeckel suggested that the substance was constantly coming into being at the bottom of the sea, \\"monera\\" arising from nonliving matter due to \\"physicochemical causes.\\" Huxley asserted in a speech given to the Royal Geographic Society in 1870 that Bathybius undoubtedly formed a continuous mat of living protoplasm that covered the whole ocean floor for thousands of square miles, probably a continuous sheet around the Earth. Sir Charles Wyville Thomson examined some samples in 1869 and regarded them as analogous to mycelium; \\"no trace of differentiation of organs\\", \\"an amorphous sheet of a protein compound, irritable to a low degree and capable of assimilating food... a diffused formless protoplasm.\\" Other scientists were less enthusiastic. George Charles Wallich claimed that Bathybius was a product of chemical disintegration. In 1872 the Challenger expedition began; it spent three years studying the oceans. The expedition also took soundings at 361 ocean stations. They did not find any sign of Bathybius, despite the claim that it was a nearly universal substance. In 1875 ship's chemist John Young Buchanan analyzed a substance that looked like Bathybius from an earlier collected sample. He noticed that it was a precipitate of calcium sulfate from the seawater that had reacted with the preservative liquid (alcohol), forming a gelatinous ooze which clung to particles as if ingesting them. Buchanan suspected that all the Bathybius samples had been prepared the same way and notified Sir Charles Thomson, now the leader of the expedition. Thomson sent a polite letter to Huxley and told about the discovery. Huxley realized that he had been too eager and made a mistake. He published part of the letter in Nature and recanted his previous views. Later, during the 1879 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, he stated that he was ultimately responsible for spreading the theory and convincing others. Most biologists accepted this acknowledgement of error. Haeckel, however, did not want to abandon the idea of Bathybius because it was so close to proof of his own theories about Urschleim. He claimed without foundation that Bathybius \\"had been observed\\" in the Atlantic. Haeckel drew a series of pictures of the evolution of his Urschleim, supposedly based on observations. He continued to support this position until 1883. Huxley's rival George Charles Wallich claimed that Huxley had committed deliberate fraud and also accused Haeckel of falsifying data. Other opponents of evolution, including George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, tried to use the case as an argument against evolution. The entire affair was a blow to the evolutionary cause, who had posited it as their long-sought evolutionary origin of life from nonliving chemistry by natural processes, without the necessity of divine intervention. In retrospect, their error was in dismissing the necessary role of photosynthesis in supporting the entire food chain of life; and the corresponding requirement for sunlight, abundant at the surface, but absent on the ocean floor.

Crosse was an early pioneer and experimenter in the use of electricity. He became known after press reports of an electrocrystallization experiment he conducted in 1836, during which insects \\"appeared\\". Early life Crosse was the first son of Richard Crosse and Susannah Porter. In 1788 he accompanied them on a trip to France, where he went to school for a time in Orl√©ans. From the age of six until he was eight he stayed with a tutor, the Reverend Mr White, in Dorchester, where he learned Greek. On 1 February 1792 he was sent to boarding school in Bristol. Around the age of 12, Crosse persuaded one of his teachers to let him attend a series of lectures on the natural sciences, the second of which was on the subject of electricity. This was the cause of his lifelong interest in the subject. Crosse first started experimenting with electricity during his time in the sixth form, when he built a Leyden jar. After leaving school he studied at Brasenose College, Oxford. Scientific research Having lost his parents, his father in 1800 and his mother in 1805, Crosse took over the management of the family estates at the age of 21. After abandoning his studies for the Bar, he increasingly devoted his spare time to studying electricity at Fyne Court, where he built his own laboratory. He also studied mineralogy and became interested in the formation of crystalline deposits in caves. Around 1807, he began to experiment with electrocrystallization, forming crystalline lime carbonate from water taken from Holwell Cavern. He returned to the subject again from around 1817 and in subsequent years produced a total of 24 electrocrystallised minerals. Among his experiments Crosse erected \\"an extensive apparatus for examining the electricity of the atmosphere,\\" incorporating at one point an insulated wire some long, later shortened to , suspended from poles and trees. Using this wire he was able to determine the polarity of the atmosphere under various weather conditions. His results were published by his friend George Singer in 1814, as part of Singer's Elements of Electricity and Electro-Chemistry. Along with Sir Humphry Davy (who visited Fyne Court in 1827), Crosse was one of the first to develop large voltaic piles.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1911 edition, Volume V09, Page 185 Although it was not the largest he built, Henry Minchin Noad's Manual of Electricity describes a battery consisting of 50 jars containing of coated surface. Using his wires Crosse was able to charge and discharge it some 20 times a minute, \\"accompanied by reports almost as loud as those of a cannon\\". He became known locally as \\"the thunder and lightning man\\". In 1836, Sir Richard Phillips described seeing a wide variety of voltaic piles at Fyne Court, totalling 2,500, of which 1,500 were in use when he visited. In 1836, Crosse was persuaded to attend a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Bristol. After describing his discoveries over dinner at the house of a friend in Bristol, he was further persuaded to recount them to both the chemical and the geological sections of the meeting. They included his electrocrystallization and atmospheric experiments, and his improvements to the voltaic battery. Crosse went on to separate copper from its ores using electrolysis, experimented with the electrolysis of sea water, wine and brandy to purify them, and examined the effects of electricity on vegetation. He was also interested in the practical uses of electricity and magnetism, including the development of loudspeakers and telegraphy although he did not do research in these areas himself. =Controversy= A few months after the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science Crosse was conducting another electrocrystallization experiment when, on the 26th day of the experiment, he saw what he described as \\"the perfect insect, standing erect on a few bristles which formed its tail\\". More creatures appeared and two days later they began moving their legs. Over the next few weeks hundreds more appeared. They crawled around the table and hid themselves wherever they could find shelter. Crosse identified them as being members of the genus Acarus. Puzzled, Crosse mentioned the incident to a couple of friends. A local newspaper learned of the incident and published an article about the \\"extraordinary experiment,\\" naming the insects Acarus crossii. The article was subsequently picked up by other newspapers across the country and elsewhere in Europe. Some readers apparently gained the impression that Crosse had somehow \\"created\\" the insects, or at least claimed to have done so. He received angry letters in which he was accused of blasphemy and trying to take God's place as a creator. Some of them included death threats. Other scientists tried to repeat the experiment. W. H. Weeks took extensive measures to assure a sealed environment by placing his experiment inside a bell jar. He obtained the same results as Crosse, but due to the controversy that Crosse's experiment had sparked his work was never published. In February 1837 many newspapers reported that Michael Faraday had also replicated Crosse's results. However, this was not true. Faraday had not even attempted the experiment. Later researchers, such as fellow members of the London Electrical Society Henry Noad and Alfred Smee, were unable to replicate Crosse's results. Crosse did not claim that he had created the insects. He assumed that there were insect eggs embedded in his samples. Later commentators agreed that the insects were probably cheese mites or dust mites that had contaminated Crosse's instruments. It has been suggested that this episode was a source of inspiration for Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein, but this cannot have been the case, since Crosse's experiments took place almost 20 years after the novel was first published. The idea appears to have originated in the book The Man Who Was Frankenstein (1979) by Peter Haining. Mary Shelley did, however, know Crosse through a mutual friend, the poet Robert Southey. Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley reportedly attended a lecture by Crosse in London in December 1814, in which he allegedly explained his experiments with atmospheric electricity. However, Mary Shelley's diary speaks only of \\"Garnerin\\" as the lecturer. Similarly dubious is a claim that Edward W. Cox wrote a report of their visits to Fyne Court to see Crosse's work in the Taunton Courier in Autumn 1836. Percy had been dead for over a dozen years by then. Other interests Crosse also wrote a great many poems and enjoyed walking on the Quantock Hills, in which Fyne Court is set, \\"at all hours of day and night, in all seasons\\". Crosse advocated the benefits of education for the lower classes, argued against emigration, and supported a campaign by local farmers against falling food prices and high taxes during the 1820s. He was also active in party politics, speaking in support of friends at election meetings. Following the Battle of Waterloo Crosse boarded a ship at Exeter to see the captured Napoleon Bonaparte on the deck of near Plymouth. Crosse also served as a magistrate.crosseconnections.org.uk Personal life Crosse married Mary Anne Hamilton in 1809. They had seven children, although three died in childhood. Mary died in 1846 following several years of ill health.crosseconnections.org.uk On 22 July 1850 Crosse married again, aged 66. His second wife was the 23-year-old Cornelia Augusta Hewett Berkeley. They went on to have three children. Crosse suffered a stroke while dressing on the morning on 26 May 1855. He died on 6 July 1855, in the same room in which he had been born. The Italian writer Dacia Maraini is his great-great- granddaughter, the socialite Cornelia Edith \\"Yo√Ø\\" Crosse being his granddaughter and her grandmother. Memorial The laboratory table on which Crosse carried out experiments stands in the aisle of the Church of St Mary & All Saints, Broomfield, and an obelisk in his memory is in the churchyard. Crosse's home, Fyne Court, was largely destroyed by fire in 1894. The garden and the estate are now owned by the National Trust, and are open to visitors. Documents A number of documents related to Andrew Crosse and his work are held in the Somerset Record Office. In December 2008 Somerset County Council acquired a further two letters for the sum of 400 pounds to add to the collection.

His existence has not been proven, and the parentage with Charles II is unlikely if 1644 is his correct birth date, since the king was only 14 years old then. James de la Cloche is mainly known through studies of British historian Lord Acton. Arthur Barnes in 1908, and Marcel Pagnol in 1973, developed an identification of the famous Man in the Iron Mask with James de La Cloche. In his historical essay Le Secret du Masque de fer (The secret of the Iron Mask) released in 1973, Marcel Pagnol summarizes and comments various theories of historians. Besides Lord Acton and Mgr Barnes, M. Pagnol also refers to the historian John Lingard, Andrew Lang, Edith Carey, and also the French historian Laloy.  Lord Acton's Research  In 1862 Lord Acton received copies of the so-called Gesu manuscript from Giuseppe Boero of the Jesuit archives in Rome. Lord Acton later wrote an article The Secret History of Charles II. Based on the documents, Charles II would have had an illegitimate son with lady Marguerite de Carteret when he had been in Jersey in 1646. The official father was Marguerite's husband, Jean de la Cloche. The son would have received Protestant education in France and the Netherlands and used the name James de la Cloche du Bourg. Charles II would have recognized him in secret in 1665 and granted him an annuity of ¬£500 as long as he would stay in London and as an Anglican. Apparently de la Cloche spoke mainly French. Jacobus de la Cloche entered a Jesuit seminary in Rome 2 April 1668. He was wearing common clothes and claimed that he was 24 years old. De la Cloche had converted to Catholicism in Hamburg in 1667. He had received a written proof of his ancestry from Queen Christina of Sweden and now wanted to join the seminary. He was accepted and entered St. Andrea al Quirinale as a novice on 11 April. Apparently King Charles was not angry that de la Cloche had switched faiths. In 1668 Oliva, the general of the Jesuits, received a letter in which the king told that he planned to convert to Catholicism. He could not contact any of the local Catholic priests without arousing suspicions but his son, one de la Cloche, would be a perfect choice. He could arrange a cardinal's position for him, if he would not be suitable for the throne. In August the next letter invited de la Cloche to come home, without speaking to queen Christina, who was coming to Rome. The king had arranged him to travel under the name Henri de Rohan. By October de la Cloche was on his way. The next royal letter, dated 18 November 1668, says that Charles II had sent his son back to Rome to act as his unofficial ambassador to the Holy See and he would later return to London when he had received answers to questions the king was willing to deliver only orally. He had asked Oliva to give de la Cloche 800 doppies for expenses. After that, there is no mention of de la Cloche. = Prince \\"Stuardo\\" = However, in 1669, a James Stuart, or Don Giacopo Stuardo, appears in Naples and on 19 February, marries a Donna Theresa Corona, daughter of, Signor Francesco Corona, and Lady Anuccia de Anicis of the Orisini branch, in the chapel of S. Aspremo in the cathedral of Naples. She receives a dowry of 200 doppies. However, when Jacopo is heard to talking of his high birth and seen to live extravagantly, the suspicions of the viceroy of Naples are raised. He orders Stuart's arrest and imprisonment in San Elmo castle, before he eventually he is transferred to the castle of Gaet√†. Theresa is shut up in a monastery. The English consul Browne, is summonsed and reports that this Jacopo can 'give no account of the birth he pretends to,' despite his claim to be a natural son of Charles II (although it is unclear when this was said). The English offered no substantiation of the claims, and he had no documents to verify them, so he was removed from the relative comfort of the castle of Gaeta to the lowly prison of Vicaria. He was sentenced to flogging but his in-laws managed to stop that. Stuart was eventually released, left supposedly for England and returned with more money. By 31 August he was dead. In his confusing will he had asked Charles II to give his unborn child an \\"ordinary principality\\" or something equally appropriate. He also named Henrietta Maria Stuart (Charles II's sister) as his mother.According to Marcel Pagnol's essay, \\"Prince Stuardo\\" declares himself to be the son of Charles II and \\"Lady Mary Henrietta Stuart\\", barons of San Marzo (unidentified). He asks Charles II to grant his son (born of his marriage to a Neapolitan tavern-keeper‚Äôs daughter) the title of Prince of Wales, and to pay his wife and parents-in-law enormous sums. He bequeaths to his son estates that he does not own and a non-existent marquisate title. The matter was mentioned in contemporary newsletters and English consul's messages to England. Stuart's widow gave birth to a son, Giacomo Stuardo. The son married Lucia Minelli di Riccia in 1711 and later regained some of his father's inheritance. The last record of him is from 1752. Various historians have had conflicting opinions about the matter. James de la Cloche might have forged the royal letters himself. The confusing will may have been the handiwork of the Corona family. There might have been two separate men claiming the same ancestry - the change would have been rather drastic. Lord Acton and Father Boero assumed that the second man was an impostor. Boero assumed that de la Cloche had returned to London using yet another name and James Stuart had adopted his claim. Lord Acton suggests that Stuart might have been a servant who had robbed de la Cloche to get his money and papers.  John Lingard  The historian John Lingard, who procured the letters of Charles II to James and Father Oliva, affirmed that they all are fakes, making James an imposter prince. The letters addressed to King Charles II evoke Queen Henrietta Maria as being in London in 1668, when she went to settle in France three years before, where she remained until her death in 1669. M. Pagnol then cited other evidence put forward by John Lingard identifying one of the letters as a fake: \\"On the other hand, one of the King‚Äôs certificates is dated from White Hall while the King, because of the plague in London, had taken refuge in Oxford with all his court\\". Whitehall does not appear in what M. Pagnol transcribed of the certificate. The letter of 18 November 1668, by which Charles II sent a debt of gratitude to Father Oliva, is dated from Whitehall. However, according to the article Charles II of England referring to the book Charles II (London, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1991) by John Miller, the royal family left London in July 1665 for Salisbury, while Parliament met in Oxford. The King returned to London in February 1666, he could therefore have drafted a letter to White Hall in late 1668.  Miss Edith Carey  She is convinced that James is really the son of Charles II and Marguerite Carteret. He would have been ordained a priest in Rome before returning to London in order to catechize (convert) in father. He vanished after the letter from Charles II to Oliva, dated 18 November 1668. According to her, Charles II had Louis XIV arrange the arrest of this embarrassing bastard son in France (in July 1669) and then his incarceration in Pinerolo, which gives the identification with the Man in the Iron Mask, being then cousin of Louis XIV as the son of his first cousin. The Prince Stuardo would then have been made up by Charles II in order to explain James‚Äô disappearance. Charles II would then have got rid of his bastard son, a few month only after requesting his return to London, in order to appeal to his new priest status to be catechized. Marcel Pagnol disagrees with this theory, arguing that Charles II, who made other bastard sons dukes, would certainly not have had James life- imprisoned after having recognised him.  Andrew Lang  According to him, if James de la Cloche had been of royal blood and had acquired deep religious creeds, he would not have married a commoner or displayed his money. Lang made up his mind to demonize James, considering him as a \\"bold crook\\" who screwed Father Oliva for the sole purpose of getting money out of him. This is what Marcel Pagnol retrieves in the Jersey's dictionary: James was not the king's bastard son, but a megalomaniac crook, who died in Naples in on 10 September 1669.  Arthur S. Barnes  In his book The Man of the Mask (1908), Mgr Barnes claims James was really the illegitimate son of Charles II. According to him he returned to London under the name of Father Pregnani to catechise his father before returning to France. Because he held the secret of the Treaty of Dover,In the context of the threat of a Sweden/United Provinces/England alliance to thwart the ambitions of Louis XIV in the Spanish Netherlands (now Belgium), his cousin Charles II promised, in exchange for generous financial support, military support and his conversion to Catholicism \\"as soon as the affairs of his kingdom will allow\\" the vast majority of the English Parliament being anti-Papist and Francophobe. he was arrested and taken to Pinerolo under the name \\"Eustache Dauger.\\" This theory was examined again by the French historian Mr Laloy. Father Pregnani returned from London to Paris in early July 1669, but according to the Memoirs of Primi Visconti, he died in Rome in 1679.  Marcel Pagnol  In the historical essay Le Masque de fer (The Iron Mask) released in 1965, Marcel Pagnol develops a theory identifying the famous prisoner in the Iron Mask as the elder twin brother of Louis XIV, who was born after him (meaning the older brother, born before Louis, was the legitimate heir to the throne). Marcel Pagnol completed his essay in 1973, re-titling it Le Secret du Masque de fer (The Secret of the Iron Mask), adding in particular the result of his research on James de la Cloche, whom he identified as the twin brother of Louis XIV, bearing that name in his youth. = Growing up on the Island of Jersey = M. Pagnol could not find any birth certificate, baptismal death certificate in the Jersey archives. He therefore concluded that James was not born on the island, and that he did not belong to the Carteret family. In 1644 Louis XIV was 6 years old. Cardinal Mazarin sent the midwife Lady Perronette to England where Queen Henrietta of France, sister of Louis XIII and wife of the English king Charles I, gave birth to Henrietta of England. According to M. Pagnol, the midwife brought the twin with her to hide him abroad, which was the actual purpose of her journey. After giving birth, Henrietta of France sent Lady Perronette to the Carterets, the noblest family on the island of Jersey,The importance of the Carteret family was such that even today a small cape in Cotentin has that name, in the Barneville-Carteret municipality. so their daughter Marguerite could raise the child. Perronette paid them a large dowry for the adoptionAccording to the Memoirs of the History of Anne of Austria (1723) of Madame de Motteville, Lady Peronette brought 20,000 shillings to England, being 200,000 Tours pounds. M. Pagnol estimates the dowry amount at 10,000 shillings. but did not reveal his true identity, presenting him as the son of a young noblewoman. It was to the same Carteret family that Henrietta of England sent her son (the future Charles II) at the age of 15 years in 1646 during the English Civil War of 1642-1651. In 1657 Marguerite married Jean de la Cloche, who gave his name to James.When he took the name \\"de la Cloche\\" in 1657, James was 19 years old assuming he was born in 1638 (birth year of Louis XIV), or 11 if it is believed he was born of a liaison between Marguerite and Charles II who visited the island in 1646, aged 16. In Jersey, a rumour spread that James was born of a liaison between Marguerite Carteret and the future King Charles II, who came to the island in his youth.By placing James's birth at the time of that of Louis XIV (5 September 1638), he would only be 8 years younger than Charles II (born in 1630). Thus Charles II was 16 when he arrived in Jersey in 1646 (he was not yet King), and James, already on the island, was 8 years old. James questioned Marguerite, who denied the rumour. Later, finding a striking resemblance between himself and Charles II when seeing his portrait,M.Pagnol sees in it a striking resemblance between Charles II and Louis XIV (first cousins), referring to a portrait of Charles II painted by Peter Lely, offered to Sir Carteret by Henrietta of England. he was convinced of being the King's son and wished to be legally recognised, like two other illegitimate sons.M. Pagnol quoted the Duke of Monmouth, son of Lucy Walter who obtained this title in 1663. He also cited the Duke of St. Albans, son of Nell Gwyn, but he became a duke only in 1684.Being born in 1638, James was therefore 30 years old in 1668, knowing that James Scott, son of Charles II, had been made Duke of Monmouth five years earlier in 1663. Marguerite (or probably her father) approached the King on his behalf, but the latter did not acknowledge him. = Jesuit in Rome = Considering himself unjustly repudiated by the person he believed to be his father,The hypothesis that James sincerely believed he was the illegitimate son of Charles II, actually the twin brother of Louis XIV, implies that he did not know then his own date of birth: placing James's birth at the time of that of Louis XIV (5 September 1638), he would be only 8 years younger than Charles II (born in 1630). When Charles II arrived in Jersey in 1646 (he was therefore 16), James, born in 1638 and already on the island, was 8 years old. In the alleged letter from Charles II, that arrived a few days after the certificate, it is stated: \\"This our son [...] born to us when we were a little more than sixteen or seventeen years old [...]\\". James did not give up just yet. Knowing via the Carteret family that Charles II was secretly preparing to convert to CatholicismThe true intentions of Charles about his conversion to Catholicism remain unknown: he later engaged secretly, by one of the clauses of the Treaty of Dover, and only converted on his deathbed in 1685. On the other hand, it is known that his mother Henrietta of France and his wife Catherine of Braganza were Catholic. (and would thus subject the English Church to the authority of the Pope), he decided to become a Catholic priest in order to be able to convert Charles II. Besides the certificate from the Queen of SwedenIn her certificate, written in Latin, Queen Christina of Sweden affirms that James is King Charles's illegitimate son, and that Charles II told her this himself. She also states that she attended the ceremony during which James was received into the Catholic Church in Hamburg. James applied for his candidacy at the Institute of Jesuit novices with a first certificate from Charles II himself,M. Pagnol obtained photostats of Charles II's letters through the archivist Father of the Ges√π in RomeThe certificate of King Charles II ends with the words: \\"The 27th of September 1665. Written and signed by our hand, sealed with the ordinary stamp for our letters and in no other way.\\" recognising him as his son the \\"Prince Stuart\\". In other letters, Charles II promised the throne to James and a generous reward to the Jesuits. In a letter dated 18 November 1668 (presumably the one cited by Lord Acton), Father Oliva received a debt of gratitude, promising him the sum of 20,000 pounds sterling, and then asked for a payment to James of 800 pounds that he undertook to reimburse to him.Extract from the postscript of the debt of gratitude dated November 18, 1668: \\"We, King Charles of England, [...] have to confess [...] the sum of eight hundred pounds sterling, namely eight hundred jacobus or shillings for the maintenance and travel of our [...] son Prince Jacques Stuart, [...] of which eight hundred shillings aforementioned Reverend Father General Jean Paul Oliva has provided him\\" The sum of 800 pounds is cited as already paid to James, which M. Pagnol interpreted as an express request, with regard to the occurrence of a scam. According to M. Pagnol, Oliva certainly paid that sum to James, believing the authenticity of the letters and royal guarantees. M. Pagnol therefore placed the departure from Rome at the beginning of December 1668, a few weeks later than the date given by Lord Acton. Comparing the letters from Charles II to Father Oliva with other letters addressed to his sister Henrietta of England,M. Pagnol obtained letters from Charles II to his sister Henrietta of England through the Foreign Office archives. They allowed graphologist experts consulted by M. Pagnol to examine the handwriting in order to compare it to the letters sent to Father Oliva in Rome. Regarding the King‚Äôs secret conversion, the letters to Father Oliva were certainly not dictated to a secretary. two expert graphologists consulted by M. Pagnol are positive: the letters sent to Father Oliva are fake, making James a fraud. M. Pagnol's believed in James's good faith though, admitting that he sincerely believed he was the bastard son of Charles II. = The meeting with Charles II = In his last letter, Charles II recommended that James call in to visit his sister Henrietta of England in Paris who could have him ordained as a priest. Knowing this letter was a fake, it was then James who, by the same process of a false supporting letter from Charles II, would have requested an audience with Henrietta of England. Moreover, M. Pagnol also cited a letter of 20 January 1669 by Charles II to Henrietta of England, which referred to a previous letter from Henrietta to Charles delivered by a certain \\"Italian\\" identified as James coming from Rome.The letter of 20 January 1669 from Charles II to his sister Henrietta of England was published by Mgr Barnes. In this letter, Charles II evokes a previous letter to Henrietta delivered in a dark corridor by a certain \\"Italian\\" he did not recognise... Mgr Barnes identified the Italian messenger as James coming from Rome. M. Pagnol describes the content of the letter as \\"ridiculous\\" and false, explaining that Charles II took certain precautions against the possible mislaying of his letter. M. Pagnol concluded that Henrietta received James, in whom she immediately recognised a resemblance to her cousin Louis XIV (she was living in France) and handed him a letter for the attention of Charles II, judiciously leaving to him the responsibility of ordaining James. When James gave the letter to Charles II in London in early 1669, the king recognised him and revealed to him the secret of his birth - information which he certainly inherited from his mother Henrietta of France. Learning that he should reigning instead of his twin brother, James is sent by Charles II to Roux de Marcilly who organised a conspiracy against Louis XIV of which all the English Ministers were aware. In his essay, Marcel Pagnol demonstrates that the famous prisoner in the Iron Mask was not Italian. Identifying James de la Cloche as the prisoner, James would therefore not be the Abbot Pregnani, as Mgr Barnes claims. As for Prince \\"Stuardo\\" M. Pagnol believes that he cannot be the Prince Stuart (in this case James de la Cloche), who would certainly not have returned to Italy to spend the fortune defrauded from the Jesuits in Rome. So it would therefore have been James's butler who, on learning of the arrest of his master, took his money and usurped his identity before fleeing to Naples.

Early life = Family = Yar'Adua was born in Katsina into a titled Fulani family. His father, Musa Yar'Adua, was a teacher who later became the Minister for Lagos Affairs from 1957 to 1966 during Nigeria's First Republic. He held the chieftaincy title of the Mutawallin Katsina (keeper of the treasury). Yar'Adua's grandfather, Mallam Umaru, was also the Mutawalli, and his younger brother Umaru Yar'Adua, who later became the President of Nigeria from 2007 to 2010, held the title as well. = Education = Yar'Adua attended Katsina Middle School and then Katsina Provincial School (now Government College, Katsina) for his secondary education; at the provincial school, where he was classmates with current Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari. At the urging of his father and his father's friend, defence minister Muhammadu Ribadu, Yar'Adua took the entrance exam of the Nigerian Military Training College.Farris, J. W, & Bomoi, M. (2004). Shehu Musa Yar'Adua: a life of service. Abuja, Nigeria: Shehu Musa Yar'Adua Foundation. p27 He passed and was enlisted into the Nigerian Army in 1962 as part of the course 5 intake of the Nigerian military training school. Yar'Adua was selected for further training at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. Military career = Civil war = In 1964, after he returned from Sandhurst, Yar'Adua was posted to the first infantry battalion of the Nigerian Army in Enugu under the command of Col Adekunle Fajuyi as second lieutenant. From 1964 to the end of the Nigerian Civil War, he held various positions including platoon commander in 1964, and from 1965 to 1966 adjutant of the First Infantry Battalion in Enugu. He was a battalion commander in 1967, and in 1968 became a Brigade Commander. During the civil war, he commanded the 6th infantry brigade under the leadership of Murtala Mohammed, commander of the second division. In October 1967, Yar'Adua was given the responsibility for the capture of Onitshahttp://newswirengr.com/2014/06/01/cheta-nwanze-chronology-of-the- nigerian-civil-war-biafra/# after two (2) unsuccessful attempts by the Nigerian troops. = After the war = In 1975, he was an active participant in the military coup d'etat that deposed General Yakubu Gowon as Nigeria's Head of State.Siollun, p. 176-180. After the success of the coup, he served as Transport Minister in General Murtala Mohammad's regime. As Transport Minister his major task was to decongest the Lagos port. Prior to the coup, officials of the previous regime had ordered 16 million tonnes of cement to build military barracks around the country. However, the berthing facilities of the port were inadequate. The financial implications became more striking because the Nigerian government was liable to pay demurrage fees by the shippers. The Mohammed regime decided to transfer some of the cargoes to neighboring ports and introduce cement management firms to clear and sell the cement and build the new Tin Can Island Port.Farris, p. 102-103. =Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters= Following the 1976 Nigerian coup d'√©tat attempt, which resulted in the assassination of Murtala Mohammed, Yar'Adua became the Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters. The new regime was a triumvirate of power consisting of General Olusegun Obasanjo as Head of State, Shehu Yar'Adua as Chief of Staff SMHQ, and General Theophilus Danjuma as Chief of Army Staff. As head of the SMHQ, Yar'Adua was the de facto second-in-command. Yar'Adua who was from the northern aristocracy was relied on heavily by the triumvirate to consolidate power in the north. His office was assigned the task of managing operations of Operation Feed the Nation, a self-reliant agricultural policy of the new Obasanjo regime. Operation Feed the Nation, known as OFN, was an initiative to boost local production of agricultural produce, especially staple crops such as rice and wheat, so as to improve self-sufficiency of food crops and reduce growing food deficits. Mechanisms used to promote the objective included the distribution of heavily subsidized fertilizers and seeds to farmers, loans to small scale farmers to enable them to purchase equipment, and an educational outreach programme manned by Corpers to teach peasant farmers how to use modern agricultural equipment. However, by 1979 the policy had not achieved its primary goal of self-reliance and self- sufficiency.E.O. Arua. \\"Achieving food sufficiency in Nigeria through the operation 'feed the nation' programme\\". Agricultural Administration Volume 9, Issue 2, February 1982, Pages 91‚Äì101 Yar'Adua also guided the Supreme Military Council's initiatives on local government reforms which led to the conduct of local government elections in 1976. The local government reforms excluded traditional rulers from certain governance issues and limited their control over property rights. The reforms also granted recognition to local government as a third tier arm of government. In 1979, the regime transferred power to the civilian elected government of Shehu Shagari ushering in the Second Nigerian Republic which lasted from 1979 to 1983. The triumvirate later retired from the military. Entry into politics After retiring from the military, he established a holding company called Hamada Holdings. He was an investor in the Nigerian branch of Habib Bank. He also started a publishing house called the NationHouse Press and published a now defunct daily newspaper called the Reporter. = Party politics = General Ibrahim Babangida started his political transition program in 1987 with the establishment of a Political Bureau, and a Constituent Assembly was later inaugurated to deliberate on a proposed draft constitution. Though Yar'Adua was not a member of the assembly and a law had proscribed certain old breed politicians from political activities, his associates represented his political leanings at the forum and was active in the formation of political associations during the transitional period.Larry Diamond, 1997, p. 173 Yar'Adua and his group formed the People's Front of Nigeria; Members included Babagana Kingibe, Atiku Abubakar, Bola Tinubu, Magaji Abdullahi, Ango Abdullahi, Ahmadu Rufa'i, Yahaya Kwande, Abdullahi Aliyu Sumaila, Wada Abubakar, Babalola Borishade, Timothy Oguntuase Akinbode, Sabo Bakin Zuwo, Sunday Afolabi, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, Tony Anenih, Chuba Okadigbo.Larry Diamond, 1997, p. 173 The People's Front later merged with other groups to form the Social Democratic Party (SDP). The People's Front and PSP, became the two dominant factions within SDP. However, Yar'Adua's group was very organized and able to win the majority of the elective posts within SDP.Marcus G. Ajibade. Shehu Musa Yar'adua: The Recurring Decimal in Contemporary Politics, p8. 1999 During the Governorship and House of Assembly elections, SDP had a slight numerical edge over the opposition National Republican Convention (NRC). = 1992 presidential campaign = In January 1992, Yar'Adua spent a short stint in detention, jailed for contravening a law banning certain persons from active politics. However, the law was repealed and Yar'Adua subsequently announced his presidential election. His campaign political structure covered the country; he had a national campaign directorate, and each state had its own campaign coordinator and ward mobilizers. Members of his campaign group included former PDP chairman Anthony Anenih, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, former minister Dapo Sarumi, Bola Tinubu, Abdullahi Aliyu Sumaila and Sunday Afolabi. Yar'Adua was leading the SDP presidential field before results were annulled. A new election was later conducted on June 12, 1993 which was won by M.K.O. Abiola. After the June 12 elections were annulled, the Yar'Adua faction negotiated an arrangement for the inauguration of an interim government. In November 1993, the interim government of Ernest Shonekan was booted out and Sani Abacha became the new military Head of State, disbanding the political parties. = 1994 constitutional conference = In 1994, Yar'Adua won a seat representing Katsina to a new National Constitutional Conference. He was an outspoken delegate and in early 1994 organized a political conference at the Nigerian Union of Journalist office in Lagos that earned the attention of the military leadership who detained him for four days.  Arrest and death  In March 1995, General Yar'Adua alongside Olusegun Obasanjo, Lawan Gwadabe and others were arrested on allegations of plotting a coup to overthrow the General Sani Abacha regime. He was sentenced to death by a military tribunal in 1995, after calling on the Nigerian military government of General Sani Abacha and his Provisional Ruling Council to re-establish civilian rule. The sentence was commuted to life in prison but he died in captivity on 8 December 1997. Personal life Shehu Yar'adua married Hajia Binta in 1965, and they have five children, including Murtala Yar'Adua, former Nigerian Minister of State for Defence.

During the time, up to twenty thousand workers went on strike in support of waterfront workers protesting against financial hardships and poor working conditions. Thousands more refused to handle \\"scab\\" goods. The dispute, sometimes referred to as the waterfront lockout or waterfront strike, lasted 151 days‚Äîfrom 13 February to 15 July 1951. During the strike, the Watersiders' Union was deregistered and its funds and records were seized, and 26 local watersiders' unions were set up in its place. The lockout has been described as \\"a key element in the mythologies of the industrial left in this country\\". Background The distance of New Zealand and Australia from their traditional markets, meant that ports played a pivotal role in the economies of the countries. The waterfront inevitably became a point of conflict between workers and their unions on one side, and the employers and the state on the other. During the Second World War due to labour shortages, watersiders and other workers worked long hours, often as much as 15-hour days. Following the war, on the wharves working hours continued to be high. In April 1950 the Waterside Workers' Union lead a walk out of the Federation of Labour (FOL) and set up their own Trade Union Congress, unwittingly isolating themselves from the general union movement. Shortly afterwards severe stoppages on the wharves occurred, infuriating most of the general population. The government threatened to declare a state of emergency before Labour Party leader Peter Fraser intervened and opened the way to a settlement. In January 1951 the Arbitration Court awarded a 15% wage increase to all workers covered by the industrial arbitration system. This did not apply to waterside workers, whose employment was controlled by the Waterfront Industry Commission. The shipping companies that employed the watersiders instead offered 9%. The watersiders then refused to work overtime in protest, and the employers placed the men on a two-day penalty. The men said it was a lock-out, the employers said it was a strike. When the Waterside Workers' Union refused to accept arbitration the government could make a stand on the principle of defending industrial law and order. The lockout The lockout was a major political issue of the time. The National government, led by Sidney Holland and the Minister of Labour Bill Sullivan, introduced heavy handed emergency regulations,Waterfront Strike Emergency Regulations 1951, via New Zealand Legal Information Institute and brought in the navy and army to work the wharves and also deregistered the Waterside Workers' Union under the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Under the emergency regulations Holland's government censored the press, made striking illegal and even made it illegal to give money or food to either strikers or their families. The proclamations have been described as \\"the most illiberal legislation ever enacted in New Zealand\\". In a surprise move, the FOL, which was supported by the majority of unions, backed the government. FOL President Fintan Patrick Walsh was of the opinion that the manner of the strike threatened the existing arbitration system necessitating their defeat. The watersiders held out for 22 weeks, supported by many other unions and sympathy strikers, but ultimately conceded defeat. The miners and seamen who held sympathy strikes were likewise beaten. As a result, the Waterside Workers' Union was split up into twenty-six separate \\"port unions\\" to deliberately diminish its influence. Many watersiders and other unionists involved were blacklisted (e.g. Jock Barnes and Toby Hill) and prevented from working on the wharves for years afterwards. Outcomes A cartoon comparing Holland's reaction to the strike to Nazism Holland condemned the action as \\"industrial anarchy\\", and explicitly sought a mandate to deal with the lockout by calling a snap election. The opposition Labour Party, now led by Walter Nash, attempted to take a moderate position in the dispute, with Nash saying that \\"we are not for the waterside workers, and we are not against them\\". Labour's neutral position merely ended up displeasing both sides, however, and Nash was widely accused of indecision and lack of courage. The government was re-elected with an increased majority in the ensuing 1951 election. Holland was seen as opportunistically using the strike to distract voters from the other issue of rapidly rising inflation which could have made the scheduled election in 1952 harder for him to win. Militant unionism in New Zealand was crushed and the union movement remained fractured for years between the FOL and the defeated militants. The Labour Party was likewise split between the ardent anti-Communists, led by Bob Semple and Angus McLagan, and the moderates, such as Walter Nash and Arnold Nordmeyer. There was a concurrent tension between the FOL and the Labour Party for many years following the strike. The families of both Keith Locke and Mark Blumsky were under surveillance at the time.

The purpose of SOE in France, occupied by Nazi Germany in World War II, was to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance. SOE agents allied themselves with French Resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England. B√©gu√© was the first of 470 SOE F (France) Section agents infiltrated into France. He was a wireless operator. He proposed the use of BBC to transmit coded messages to resistance groups in Europe, a practice which became ubiquitous. He also arranged for the first of many thousands of airdrops of supplies and arms to resistance groups in France. He was captured by the French police in October 1941. He escaped from prison in 1942 and returned to the United Kingdom. Early life Georges B√©gu√© was born 22 November 1911 in P√©rigueux, France. His father was a railway engineer and the family moved to Egypt when B√©gu√© was a child. B√©gu√© also trained as an engineer at University of Hull where he learned English and met his wife. He went through his military service as a signaller.\\"Georges Begue,\\" The Times (London), 2 Feb 1994. World War II At the outbreak of World War II, B√©gu√© was recalled to the French army. Because of his knowledge of English he was assigned to liaison with the British troops. He eventually escaped to Britain during the Dunkirk evacuation. After the surrender of France, he joined the Royal Signals as a sergeant, meeting Thomas Cadett, the Paris correspondent of the BBC, who was working in SOE's F section who recruited him.The Times. =The first SOE agent= In 1940 SOE B√©gu√© joined the new F (French) section. He was given the alias George Noble and trained as a wireless operator. After training, he parachuted \\"blind\\" (nobody met him on arrival) into Indre Department on the night of 5/6 May 1941 with a heavy wireless transmitter in a suitcase. He was the first SOE agent in France. He contacted socialist Max Hymans near Ch√¢teauroux and persuaded him that he was a legitimate English agent. Hymans introduced him to other socialists in the area. On 9 May, he sent his first wireless message back to SOE headquarters in London. On 10/11 May, he was joined by SOE agent Pierre de Vom√©court and on 12/13 May by Roger Cottin, both also parachuted blind.Foot, M.R.D. (1966), SOE in France, London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, pp. 161-164Cookridge, E.H. (1967), Set Europe Ablaze, New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Company, pp. 67-68 The Germans quickly detected B√©gu√©'s wireless transmissions and jammed them and began to hunt for him around Ch√¢teauroux. Nevertheless, he was able to arrange the first airdrop of supplies into France by SOE on 13 June 1941. Two containers were dropped at Bas Soleil, the estate of Pierre de Vom√©court's brother, Philippe, near Limoges. The containers were dropped by an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley bomber and contained sub-machine guns, explosives, and other material. They were the first of nearly 60,000 containers of supplies and arms air-dropped to SOE operatives and resistance groups during World War II.Foot, pp. 163-164 B√©gu√© and Pierre de Vom√©court created the first of about 90 SOE networks (also called circuits and reseau) in France. Their network was called Autogiro.Foot, pp. 145-146 Georges B√©gu√© is sometimes called \\"Georges One\\" as he was the first SOE wireless operator in France. Subsequent wireless operators were called \\"Georges Two, Georges Three, etc. The SOE's slang term for a wireless operator was a \\"pianist.\\"Vom√©court, Philippe de (2016), An Army of Amateurs, Pickle Publishing, Kindle Edition, Location 432 =Engaging the BBC= B√©gu√© had an exhausting schedule, often transmitting and receiving messages to and from SOE three times a day. In addition he often had to serve as a courier traveling by train to deliver or receive messages to other SOE agents. As the Germans and French police were attempting to locate him and his wireless through direction-finding equipment, B√©gu√© proposed sending seemingly obscure personal messages to agents in the field in order to reduce risky radio traffic. In accordance with his proposal, the BBC's Radio Londres broadcasts began with \\"Please listen to some personal messages,\\" followed by spoken messages, often amusing, and without context. Representative messages include \\"Jean has a long mustache\\" and \\"There is a fire at the insurance agency,\\" each one having some meaning to a certain resistance group. They were used primarily to provide messages to the resistance, but also to thank SOE agents and sometimes to mislead the enemy. Because these messages were in code, not cipher, the German occupiers could not hope to decipher them unless they had infiltrated a resistance group, so they focused their efforts on jamming the messages instead. The transmission of coded messages by Radio Londres became ubiquitous in World War II.Cookridge, pp. 55-56 =Arrest= The SOE parachuted in a number of additional agents in September 1941. One agent, Gerry Morel, went his own way to recruit resistance members. The Milice, the Vichy France police, arrested him at Limoges on 3 October 1941. His arrest led to more arrests and eventually to B√©gu√©, who was arrested 24 October in a Marseilles safe house. He was sent to join a dozen SOE agents in the Beleyme prison in P√©rigueux. They were later transferred to a prison camp in Mauzac in March 1942, thanks to intervention of the American Consul-General Hugh Fullerton. B√©gu√© smuggled out a message to London, bribed a guard, and created a duplicate key and the group escaped 16 July 1942.The Times, Jean- Pierre Bloch was one of the prisoners and his wife, Gabrielle Sadourny, assisted in the escape.Foot, p 203 B√©gu√© and the other escapees hid in a forest while the French police searched for them and then continued to Lyon in separate groups. B√©gu√© arrived on July 23. SOE agent, American Virginia Hall, was in contact with the Vic escape network and eventually the escapees were led over the Pyrenees to neutral Spain where B√©gu√© was interned at Figueres and sent to Miranda de Ebro prison camp but was later released to continue to England. He arrived in London in October 1942.Foot, p. 161. The SOE in London had changed leadership in his absence and B√©gu√© had little confidence in the new SOE leader, Maurice Buckmaster. He was named signals officer, but believed his talents were under-utilized. After the war After the war B√©gu√© emigrated to the United States. He worked in a number of lower-level jobs until he could officially become an electronics engineer. He also became an American citizen. He died 18 December 1993 in Falls Church, Virginia.

This demonstration was held by transgender women and their allies to protest against the Festival's policy of excluding trans women from attending the Music Festival. History Camp Trans was sparked by a 1991 incident, in which Nancy Burkholder was ejected from the festival, after refusing to answer when a woman asked her whether or not she was transgender. The MWMF maintained a women-born-women policy since its inception, as evidenced by posters from the first festival in 1975 . Each year afterwards a group of women, both transgender and cisgender, protested the exclusion of trans women from the event. Initially, these protests were small and sometimes carried on inside of the camp. A more organized group of transgender women and their allies began camping and holding demonstrations outside the gate. After a five-year hiatus, Camp Trans returned in 1999, led by transgender activists Riki Ann Wilchins and Leslie Feinberg, as well as many members of the Boston and Chicago Lesbian Avengers The events of this year drew attention and controversy, culminating in tensions as a small group of transgender activists were admitted into the festival to exchange dialogue with organizers and to negotiate a short-lived compromise allowing only transgender women who had sex reassignment surgery on the festival land.Son of Camp Trans Press Release: Protest Called For Women's Music Festival Discriminatory Policy Still In Effect (June 26, 1999) In the early 1980s and in 1999, a transgender musician who had transitioned 10 years earlier did perform in MWMF. During the 1999's Camp Trans event, a number of transgender women purchased tickets and were admitted to the MWMF. A similar claim of victory was published by Camp Trans that year.Son of Camp Trans Press Release: Protest Called For Women's Music Festival Discriminatory Policy Still In Effect (June 26, 1999) Events of 2006 By 2005, activists at Camp Trans and MWMF had become frustrated with the boycott effort and felt that a combined effort of external and internal activism on the grounds of MWMF might be more effective in securing inclusion.Camp Trans Festival Program (August 2005) Camp Trans & Yellow Armbands Info. Sheet (August 2005) In 2006, a transgender woman organizer of Camp Trans named Lorrraine Donaldson was sold a ticket to the 31st annual Michigan Womyn's Music Festival.Camp Trans Festival Program (August 2006) Is The Michigan Debate Over? (July 2007) On Tuesday, August 8, 2006, Donaldson approached the workers at the front gate of the festival and asked if she could purchase a ticket. She was instructed to read an outdated handout that was printed by the festival office in 2000 following the controversial events surrounding the Michigan 8 protest.'Michigan Eight' Evicted Over Festival's New 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' (August 12, 2000) This paper indicated that the festival was still enforcing a policy of exclusion for transsexual women. When Donaldson pointed out that the document was outdated and asked for a current version from the workers, they told her that none was available. Donaldson requested that the workers seek up-to-date policy information in writing from the office and informed them that she would return the next morning. That same day, the newly organized Yellow Armbands pro-inclusion support group held their first meeting at the Watermelon Tree in the common dining area of the festival. On the morning of Wednesday, August 9, Donaldson again approached the box office workers near the front gate and asked to purchase a ticket. She was met at the gate by three members of the Yellow Armbands and one organizer of Camp Trans, all of whom witnessed Donaldson disclosing her trans status to the box office manager, before being sold a ticket and given an orange wristband that designated her as a \\"festie\\". Donaldson attended the festival for the remainder of the week and participated at a trans inclusion workshop that was presented by trans woman Emilia Lombardi, who was also an organizer with Camp Trans and who was sold a ticket to the festival on Friday, August 11, as well. The workshop was listed as part of the official festival program and both Donaldson and Lombardi were open about being trans women at the workshop that was attended by over 50 people.From MWMF 2006 festival program (Lisa Vogel, August 2006) Donaldson and Lombardi also continued to join the Yellow Armbands mealtime gatherings, where they were met with support from festies and workers. The conclusion of the 2006 festivals in Hart, Michigan was marked with noted optimism and collaborative spirit between Camp Trans constituents and their pro-inclusion supporters at MWMF, as was noted immediately by members of the community and media. A camper also captured the good news as it was presented onstage by a Camp Trans committee member and later posted it on YouTube. 2006 press release controversy and resulting organizational changes Following the 2006 festival, a small group of Camp Trans organizers issued a press release that stated that the MWMF had \\"ended its policy of exclusion.\\" A disagreement ensued within the Camp Trans and Yellow Armbands organizations over whether or not this press release was ethical due to issues of transparency and consent.Lorraine Donaldson and Lina Corvus Conversation (September 18, 2006) Hard Questions (04-08-07) Camp Trans argued that the press release was a deliberate and necessary tactic designed to bait Vogel into responding with a transphobic press release which would make the parameters of the \\"wbw-policy\\" officially known. Supporters of this tactic felt that because Vogel hadn't given the Camp Trans organization permission to republish the letter, nor was the policy (or what Vogel referred to as an \\"intention\\") available in writing on the MichFest website or elsewhere, that this was the only way that Camp Trans could ostensibly prove that the policy actually existed. Others felt that the motivation behind the press release was nebulous and not supportive or inclusive of Donaldson or others who were involved in the positive developments that occurred in the summer of 2006. They also believed that the press release caused unnecessary conflict between inclusion activists and the festival office and they preferred to focus on the larger community who were clearly supportive of trans women attending in 2006. Regardless, Vogel did in fact issue a response where she stated again that the festival is intended for women-born-women, and that they hope and expect trans women to respect that intention.MWMF Press Release: Michigan Womyn's Music Festival Sets The Record Straight (August 22, 2006) Following the press release fallout, Donaldson resigned from Camp Trans and joined the Yellow Armbands as an organizer. In 2007, the Yellow Armbands blog was frozen by an organizer who resigned from the activism due to lingering issues regarding lack of transparency in the inclusion movement.dandypants resignation dialog between Yellow Armbands organizers (May 27, 2007) Other activists also resigned over concerns that Camp Trans was privileging the voices of trans men over trans women in their organization. The remaining inclusion activists at Yellow Armbands created a new online community and blog and renamed their organization Fest For All Womyn. Donaldson returned to MWMF in 2007 with the newly renamed Fest For All Womyn/Yellow Armbands and camped in The Twilight Zone area of the festival along with other trans women and female inclusion supporters. 2007 was also a landmark year for Camp Trans, because for the first time in their 16-year history, they held elections for their organizational positions. Camp Trans organizers celebrated this as a positive step in the right direction when the majority of elected positions were filled by trans women. 2010 festivals There were tensions during the 2010 festivals. A piece published in both Anarchist News and the queer zine Pink and Black described a confrontation with a tow truck driver. The driver allegedly threatened to kill Camp Trans members with a tow cable after he was asked to turn off his engine during a Camp Trans speech. Pink and Black wrote that there was vandalism during the festival, saying that, in one incident, someone painted the words \\"Real Womyn Have Cocks\\" in a MichFest kitchen. The zine also said a flyer was distributed that read: \\"Second-Wave 'Feminists', / A hot load from my monstrous tranny- cock embodies womanhood more than the pieces of menstral (sic) art your transphobic cunts could ever hope to create. / Love, Womyn-born-Monsters\\". Since 2010 There have been groups created \\"on the land\\" like Trans Women Belong Here, for support, care, and acquiring a \\"safe space\\" within MichFest. MichFest itself, however, ceased as an ongoing concern after its 40th season in 2015.

In 1719, miners in the Falun copper mine found an intact dead body in a water-filled, long-unused tunnel. When the body was put on display, it was identified by his former fianc√©e, Margaret Olsdotter, as Fet-Mats Israelsson, who had disappeared 42 years earlier. Discovery On December 2, 1719, miners discovered a dead man in the water-filled shaft known as M√•rdskinnsfallet, in a part of the mine that had not been used for a long time. Both legs of the dead man were amputated and missing,http://www.diva- portal.se/smash/get/diva2:520709/FULLTEXT01.pdf but neither clothes, hands nor face showed signs of decay, which made it appear as if he had recently died; the find became a mystery because no person was reported as missing.Engstr√∂m, Bj√∂rn (2010). Daniel Westlings anor fr√•n Svartn√§s ‚Äì Med kulturhistoriska utblickar i byar och milj√∂er under 700 √•r. Bj√∂rn Engstr√∂m. When the body was raised to ground level, it began to dry and became \\"hard as wood\\" according to a contemporary description. http://www.diva- portal.se/smash/get/diva2:520709/FULLTEXT01.pdf According to others, the body had rather turned into stone, giving rise to the epithet \\"the petrified miner\\". http://www.diva-portal.se/smash/get/diva2:520709/FULLTEXT01.pdf After the body was put on display in Stora Kopparberget, Margaret Olsdotter identified it as belonging to Fet-Mats Israelsson, her fianc√© who disappeared in March 1677. When the naturalist Carl Linnaeus visited, he noticed that Fet- Mats was not petrified but just covered with vitriol, a substance now commonly known as the pesticide copper sulfate. Linneus stated that as soon as the vitriol evaporated, the body would begin to decay. That proved to be correct. However, Fet-Mats Israelsson's body remained on display for 30 years, until it was buried in Stora Kopparberg Church on December 21, 1749. During renovation of the floor in the early 1860s, the remains of Fet-Mats were found again and exhibited in a display case, until he was finally buried in 1930 in the church's graveyard. Fet-Mats in culture Fet-Mats became an inspiration for the German romanticists. The philosopher and naturalist Gotthilf Heinrich von Schubert wrote about him in Ansichten von der Nachtseite der Naturwissenschaft, Achim von Arnim wrote a ballad about Fet-Mats, Johann Peter Hebel wrote a short story about him called Unverhofftes Wiedersehen (Unexpected Reunion). Friedrich R√ºckert also wrote about Fet-Mats. Most notably E.T.A. Hoffmann wrote the short story Die Bergwerke zu Falun published in his collection Die Serapionsbr√ºder in 1819. In 1842 Richard Wagner wrote a libretto based on Hoffmann's short story called Die Bergwerke zu Falun, but it was refused and instead he wrote Tannh√§user. In 1901 Hugo von Hofmannsthal's Das Bergwerk zu Falun had a premiere in Vienna.

She is one of only two Japanese women to have presented her collections on the runways of Paris and New York, and the first Asian woman to be admitted as an official haute couture design house by the f√©d√©ration fran√ßaise de la couture in France. Her fashion house, opened in Japan in 1951, grew to become a $500 million international business by the 1990s. Career Mori was born in Muikaichi, Shimane. After graduating from Tokyo Women's Christian University, she married and attended dress-making school. She opened her first atelier, Hiyoshiya, in 1951, and over the next several years designed costumes for hundreds of movies. In 1965, she presented her first New York collection, \\"East Meets West.\\" Twelve years later, she opened an haute couture showroom in Paris, leading to her appointment as a member of the Chambre syndicale de la couture parisienne. Mori designed three consecutive uniforms for the flight attendants of Japan Air Lines (JAL). The first uniform was worn from 1967 to 1970; the second, which created a sensation by featuring a miniskirt, worn from 1970 to 1977; and the third worn from 1977 to 1988. From 1989 to 1996, Mori employed Dominique Sirop as a designer. He became a grand couturier in 1997. In 1992, Mori designed the official uniform for the Japanese Delegation to the Barcelona Olympics and, in 1994, the official uniform for the Japanese Delegation to the Lillehammer Olympics. Also in 1993, Masako, Crown Princess of Japan wore a sleeveless white gown designed by Mori for her wedding ceremony. Mori had the patronage of Masako, Crown Princess of Japan, Hillary Clinton, Nancy Reagan Renata Tebaldi and Princess Grace of Monaco Grace Kelly. Amidst company financial struggles, Mori sold the ready-to-wear and licensed apparel operations in January 2002 to an investment group formed by Japanese trading company Mitsui & Co. and the Rothschild group in Britain. Opting for fast-track corporate rehabilitation, the company then applied to the Tokyo District Court for protection from its creditors on May 30, 2002, as it had () in liabilities. Mori announced her retirement in June 2004, stating that she would be closing her fashion house after the Haute Couture Show for Fall 2004 in Paris. She held her last fashion show in July of that year. =Later life= Mori has retired from the runway but still has a few boutiques in Tokyo's Harajuku neighborhood, including one in the Hotel Okura.

According to himself, he began his climbing career at the age of 12 in 1910 when an owner of a clothing store promised him a suit if he would climb to the roof of the building. He succeeded. Over his career Polley climbed over 2000 buildings. In 1920 he climbed the Woolworth building but was arrested, just when he reached the 30th floor and had 27 floors to go, for climbing without official permission. He also climbed 500 ft up the Custom House Tower in Boston. He would often spice up his performance by pretending to slip and fall from a windowsill to another. George G.

Art critic Robert Hughes of Time magazine wrote that the Throne \\"may well be the finest work of visionary religious art produced by an American.\\" Early life James Hampton was born in 1909 in Elloree, South Carolina as one of four children to James Sr. and Sarah (Johnson) Hampton. His father, who had abandoned the family, was a gospel singer and a traveling Baptist preacher who was also a known criminal who had worked on chain gangs. In 1928, Hampton moved to Washington, D.C. and shared an apartment with his older brother Lee. Hampton worked as a short- order cook until 1943 when he was drafted into the United States Army Air Forces. He served with the 385th Aviation Squadron in Texas, Hawaii and in the jungles of Saipan and Guam. The segregated unit was noncombatant and duties included carpentry and maintenance of airstrips. Hampton built a small, shrine-like object during his time in Guam that he later incorporated into his larger artwork. He was awarded the Bronze Star and was honorably discharged in 1945, after which he returned to Washington. In 1946, Hampton was hired by the General Services Administration as a janitor and worked there until his death. Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations' Millennium General Assembly Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations' Millennium General Assembly in the Smithsonian American Art Museum In 1950, Hampton rented a garage on 7th street in northwest Washington. Over the next 14 years, Hampton built a complex work of religious art inside the garage with various scavenged materials such as aluminum and gold foil, old furniture, pieces of cardboard, light bulbs, jelly jars, shards of mirror and desk blotters held together with tacks, glue, pins and tape. The complete work consists of 180 objects, many of them inscribed with quotes from the Book of Revelation. The centerpiece of the exhibit is a throne, seven feet tall, built on the foundation of an old maroon-cushioned armchair with the words \\"Fear Not\\" at its crest. The throne is flanked by dozens of altars, crowns, lecterns, tablets and winged pulpits. Wall plaques on the left bear the name of apostles and those on the right list various biblical patriarchs and prophets such as Abraham and Ezekiel. The text The Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations' Millennium General Assembly was written on the objects in Hampton's handwriting. Hampton described his work as a monument to Jesus in Washington. It was made based on several religious visions that prompted him to prepare for Christ's return to earth. Hampton wrote that God visited him often, that Moses appeared to him in 1931, the Virgin Mary in 1946, and Adam on the day of President Truman's inauguration in 1949. The term \\"third heaven\\" is based on scriptures that refer to it as the \\"heaven of heavens\\" or God's realm. The work is based on biblical prophecies of the millennium, including St. John's vision of God seated on a silver and gold throne surrounded by angels, references to Judgment Day, the crowns to be worn by the saved and other events described in Revelation. The work also has an affiliation with African-American yard shows as well as altars used in African-derived New World religions such as Vodou, Santer√≠a and Candombl√©. Art critic Robert Farris Thompson describes the Throne as \\"a unique fusion of biblical and Afro-American traditional imagery.\\" The work is associated with the American Millenarian and Dispensationalist movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. These movements divided the history of God's interactions with humanity into seven phases or dispensations, the last of which would be the \\"Millennium.\\" St. James: The Book of the 7 Dispensation Hampton kept a 108-page loose-leaf notebook titled St James: The Book of the 7 Dispensation. Most of the text was written in an unknown script that remains undeciphered. The text is available online and has been the subject of research. Hampton altered the seventh dispensation so that he became not only the author of The Book of the 7 Dispensation but also a prophetic counselor of the Millennium. Hampton recorded \\"the Old and the New Covenant\\" and a second set of commandments, which Hampton believed God had given to him to pass along because man no longer followed the original Ten Commandments. Some of the text was accompanied by notes in English in Hampton's handwriting. In the notebook, Hampton referred to himself as St. James with the title \\"Director, Special Projects for the State of Eternity\\" and ended each page with the word \\"Revelation.\\" Hampton had also written texts, some of which refer to religious visions, on various pieces of paper and cardboard and on a few pages in each of seven other notebooks. Tacked to a bulletin board in a corner of the garage was the message \\"Where there is no vision, the people perish.\\" Hampton also created wall plaques with Roman numerals one through ten and his undecipherable script suggesting commandment-bearing tablets. The largest plaque on the left side of the display contains the text \\"Nations Readjustment Plan\\" and is trimmed in gold foil. Hampton approached local churches about using his creation as a teaching tool but none were interested. Two reporters came to view the display but did not deem it worthy of news coverage. Hampton hoped to develop a storefront ministry but never achieved that goal. Hampton was somewhat reclusive. He had few close friends and spent most of his personal time working on his shrine. Hampton attended various churches in Washington but never joined a particular congregation because of his belief that the proliferation of denominations contradicted the oneness of God. He expressed an interest in finding a \\"holy woman\\" to assist with his life's work but never married. It is unknown whether Hampton considered himself an artist. Hampton's work is an example of outsider or na√Øve art ‚Äì art made by people who are self-taught, who have not studied art techniques, art history or art theory.Getlein, Mark. Gilbert's Living With Art, Sixth Edition, New York, 2002. Death and discovery of the display Hampton died of stomach cancer on November 4, 1964, at the Veteran's Hospital in Washington. He is interred at the Warren Chapel Baptist Church in Elloree, South Carolina. The art was not discovered until after Hampton's death in 1964, when the owner of the garage, Meyer Wertlieb, came to find out why the rent had not been paid. He knew that Hampton had been building something in the garage. When he opened the door, he found a room filled with the artwork. Hampton had kept his project secret from most of his friends and family. His relatives first heard about it when his sister came to claim his body. When Hampton's sister refused to take the artwork, the landlord placed an advertisement in local newspapers. Ed Kelly, a sculptor, answered the advertisement and was so astounded by the exhibit, he contacted art collector Alice Denney. Denney brought art dealers Leo Castelli and Ivan Karp, and artist Robert Rauschenberg, to see the exhibit in the garage. Harry Lowe, the assistant director of the Smithsonian Art Museum, told the Washington Post that walking into the garage \\"was like opening Tut's tomb.\\" The story of Hampton and his artwork finally became public in the December 15, 1964 issue of the Washington Post. Lowe paid Hampton's outstanding rent and took possession of the art display. In 1970, Hampton's work was donated to the Smithsonian American Art Museum, where it has been on display ever since. In popular culture Author and poet Denis Johnson published a book with the name The Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations Millennium General Assembly: Poems Collected and New, which includes a poem named after Hampton's work.Johnson, Denis (1996). The Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations Millennium General Assembly: Poems Collected and New. New York, NY: HarperCollins. In 2007, composer Jefferson Friedman premiered a musical piece inspired by Hampton's artwork titled \\"The Throne of the Third Heaven,\\" commissioned jointly by the National Symphony Orchestra and the ASCAP Foundation. The indie music group Le Loup named their 2007 debut album The Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations' Millennium General Assembly. In 2015, author Shelley Pearsall published a young adult novel, The Seventh Most Important Thing, which put the artwork and the artist in a fictional context, imagining a meeting between Hampton and a troubled thirteen-year-old boy. The author says she was inspired by the fact that \\"for more than a decade, Hampton had labored alone, without fanfare, to create art for art's sake ‚Äì a nearly impossible concept to grasp in today's world of rampant social-media sharing and instant celebrity.\\" In 2018, Cheyenne/Arapaho author Tommy Orange published a short story, \\"The State,\\" that references Hampton and The Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations Millennium General Assembly. The story was an excerpted chapter from Orange‚Äôs 2018 novel There There.

Guge () was an ancient kingdom in Western Tibet. The kingdom was centered in present-day Zanda County, Ngari Prefecture, Tibet Autonomous Region. At various points in history after the 10th century AD, the kingdom held sway over a vast area including south-eastern Zanskar, Upper Kinnaur district, and Spiti Valley, either by conquest or as tributaries. The ruins of the former capital of the Guge kingdom are located at Tsaparang in the Sutlej valley, not far from Mount Kailash and westwards from Lhasa. History Guge was founded in the 10th century. Its capitals were located at Tholing and Tsaparang..Snelling, John. (1990). The Sacred Mountain: The Complete Guide to Tibet's Mount Kailas. 1st edition 1983.

East-West Publications, London and The Hague. . Nyi ma mgon, a great-grandson of Langdarma, the last monarch of the Tibetan Empire, left insecure conditions in √ú-Tsang in 910. He established a kingdom in Ngari (West Tibet) in or after 912 and annexed Puhrang and Guge. He established his capital in Guge. Nyi ma mgon later divided his lands into three parts. The king's eldest son dPal gyi mgon became ruler of Mar-yul (Ladakh), his second son bKra shis mgon received Guge- Puhrang, and the third son lDe gtsug mgon received Zanskar. bKra shis mgon was succeeded by his son Srong nge or Ye shes 'Od (947‚Äì1024 or (959‚Äì1036), who was a renowned Buddhist figure. In his time a Tibetan lotsawa from Guge called Rinchen Zangpo (958‚Äì1055), after having studied in India, returned to his homeland as a monk to promote Buddhism. Together with the zeal of Ye shes 'Od, this marked the beginning of a new diffusion of Buddhist teachings in western Tibet. In 988 Ye shes 'Od took religious vows and left kingship to his younger brother Khor re. Guge in Maryul during 11th century According to later historiography the Turkic Karluks took the Guge king Ye shes 'Od prisoner during a war. The episode has a prominent place in Tibetan history writing. The Karluks offered to set him free if he renounced Buddhism which he refused to do. They then demanded his weight in gold to release him. His junior kinsman Byang chub 'Od visited him in his prison with a small retinue, but Ye shes 'Od admonished him not to use the gold at hand for ransom, but rather to invite the renowned Mahayana sage Ati≈õa (982‚Äì1054). Ye shes 'Od eventually died in prison from age and poor treatment.Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa (1967), Tibet: A political history. New Haven: Yale University Press, pp. 56‚Äì57. The story is historically debated since it contains chronological inconsistencies. In 1037, Khor re's eldest grandson 'Od lde was killed in a conflict with the Kara-Khanid Khanate from Central Asia, who subsequently ravaged Ngari. His brother Byang chub 'Od (984‚Äì1078), a Buddhist monk, took power as secular ruler. He was responsible for inviting Ati≈õa to Tibet in 1040 and thus ushering in the so-called Chidar (Phyi-dar) phase of Buddhism in Tibet. Byang chub 'Od's son rTse lde was murdered by his nephew in 1088. This event marked the break-up of the Guge-Purang kingdom, since one of his brothers was established as separate king of Purang. The usurping nephew dBang lde continued the royal dynasty in Guge.Hoffman, Helmut, \\"Early and Medieval Tibet\\", in Sinor, David, ed., Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), 388, 394; A. McKay, ed. (2003), The History of Tibet, Volume II. Abingdon: Routledge, pp. 53‚Äì66. A new Kara-Khanid invasion of Guge took place before 1137 and cost the life of the ruler, bKra shis rtse. Later in the same century the kingdom was temporarily divided. In 1240 the Mongol khagan, at least nominally, gave authority over the Ngari area to the Drigung Monastery in √ú-Tsang. Grags pa lde was an important ruler who united the Guge area around 1265 and subjugated the related Ya rtse (Khasa) kingdom. After his death in 1277 Guge was dominated by the Sakya monastic regime. After 1363, with the decline of the Mongol Yuan dynasty and their Sakya prot√©g√©s, Guge was again strengthened and took over Purang in 1378. Purang was henceforth contested between Guge and Mustang, but was finally integrated in the former. Guge also briefly ruled over Ladakh in the late 14th century. From 1499 the Guge king had to acknowledge the Rinpungpa rulers of Tsang. The 15th and 16th centuries were marked by a considerable Buddhist building activity by the kings, who frequently showed their devotion to the Gelug leaders later known as the Dalai Lamas.A. McKay, ed. (2003), pp. 42‚Äì45, 68‚Äì89. Tsaparang, the ruins of the ancient capital of Guge The first Westerners to reach Guge were a Jesuit missionary, Ant√≥nio de Andrade, and his companion, brother Manuel Marques, in 1624. De Andrade reported seeing irrigation canals and rich crops in what is now a dry and desolate land. Perhaps as evidence of the kingdom's openness, de Andrade's party was allowed to construct a chapel in Tsaparang and instruct the people about Christianity. A letter by De Andrade relates that some military commanders revolted and called the Ladakhis to overthrow the ruler. There had been friction between Guge and Ladakh for many years, and the invitation was heeded in 1630. The Ladakhi forces laid siege to the almost impenetrable Tsaparang. The King's brother, who was chief lama and thus a staunch Buddhist, advised the pro- Christian ruler to surrender against keeping the state as tributary ruler. This treacherous advice was eventually accepted. Tibetan sources suggest that the Guge population was maintained in their old status.L. Petech (1977), The Kingdom of Ladakh, c. 950‚Äì1842 A.D. Rome: IsMEO, pp. 44-45. A legend has it that the Ladakhi army slaughtered most of the people of Guge, about 200 of whom managed to survive and fled to Qulong.\\"Guge, a lost kingdom in Tibet\\". The last king Khri bKra shis Grags pa lde was brought to Ladakh as prisoner with his kin, and died there. The King's brother-lama was killed by the Ladakhis. Later on the last male descendant of the dynasty moved to Lhasa where he died in 1743.A. McKay, ed. (2003), p. 44. Tsaparang and the Guge kingdom were later conquered in 1679‚Äì80 by the Lhasa-based Central Tibetan government under the leadership of the 5th Dalai Lama, driving out the Ladakhis. Western archeologists heard about Guge again in the 1930s through the work of Italian Giuseppe Tucci. Tucci's work was mainly about the frescoes of Guge. Lama Anagarika Govinda and Li Gotami Govinda visited the kingdom of Guge, including Tholing, and Tsaparang, in 1947‚Äì1949. Their tours of Central and Western Tibet are recorded in stunning black-and-white photos.Li Gotami Govinda, Tibet in Pictures (Berkeley, Dharma Publishing, 1979), 2 volumes.

Regarded as the \\"father of stealth\\",Congressional Record--Senate, January 17, 1995, page S962 (Statement of Senator Robert Dole) Rich was responsible for leading the development of the F-117, the first production stealth aircraft. He also worked on the F-104, U-2, A-12, SR-71, and F-22, among others.  Early in life  Rich was born in Manila in the Philippines. He was one of five children of British lumber mill superintendent Isidore Rich and his French wife, Annie, the daughter of one of his paternal grandfather's Jewish customers who lived in Alexandria, Egypt. The Rich family was one of the first Jewish families to settle in Manila. Having fled the Philippines just weeks before the Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, they moved to the United States in 1942, where Rich became a naturalized US citizen. He worked (with his father) in a Los Angeles, California, machine shop during World War II, and studied at the city's Hamilton High School. After the war he started his college education when he was 21, majoring in mechanical engineering at UC Berkeley, followed by a master's degree in aeronautical engineering at UCLA, instead of in the medical field as he originally planned.http://www.f-117a.com/Ben.html He would later complete the Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School.https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-01-06-mn-16836-story.html  Career  = Lockheed = Upon graduation Rich was hired by Lockheed as a thermodynamicist. There he worked on a variety of projects - he was awarded a patent for designing a nichrome heating system which prevented Navy patrol plane crew members' penises from freezing to their urine elimination pipes. He designed inlet ducts for the F-104 Starfighter, the C-130 transport aircraft, and the F-90 fighter. = The Skunk Works = In December 1954 Rich was transferred to the Skunk Works, the secret research and development section run by Lockheed's Chief Engineer, Clarence \\"Kelly\\" Johnson. There he designed the inlet ducts for the U-2 spy plane, then next led the effort to design and build a large-scale hydrogen liquefaction plant for project Suntan, a proposed hydrogen-powered supersonic very high-altitude aircraft meant to replace the U-2. After Suntan was canceled, hydrogen proving to be impractical for a number of reasons, Rich became propulsion systems program manager for the U-2's successors, the A-12 and the SR-71 Blackbird. Rich was chief aerodynamicist for the projects, designer of the complex translating shock cones inlet design, air conditioning and heat management systems, and the specification of the aircraft's black skin coatings which optimized heat dissipation of their tremendous aerodynamic heating as well as incorporating materials to reduce radar signature ‚Äì the aircraft incorporated a number of features of what would later be referred to as low observables or stealth technology. When SR-71 crews became upset that engineers were not putting enough effort into solving a constant problem with violent engine unstarts in flight, Rich considered taking a flight in the SR-71 to experience the phenomenon himself, which included having to go through the same flight physical as pilots. He did not go through with the flight. He did, however, eventually manage the problem by installing automatic controllers to keep the aircraft in control during unstarts. He briefly worked on a program that used ionizing radiation to help absorb radar coming from ahead of the aircraft. The radiation proved to be excessive and the test pilot disliked the heavy radiation shielding he was forced to wear. The project was cancelled when the military decided the radar signature was already low enough without the ionizing equipment. The concept was proven to work, but unfeasible.Area 51: An Uncensored History of America's Top Secret Military Base By Annie Jacobsen Later, as Johnson's successor as leader of the Skunk Works, Rich championed and directed the early experimental prototypes of stealth technology and led the development of the F-117 stealth fighter. He is the author of Skunk Works: A Personal Memoir of My Years at Lockheed.  Awards  A member of the National Academy of Engineering, he won numerous awards during his career, including the Collier Trophy. In 2005 he was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame. In January 1981, he received the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service for his work on the then-still- classified stealth airplane, in a secret ceremony in the office of then- Secretary of Defense Harold Brown. He was allowed to show the medal to his two children, Karen and Michael, but was not allowed to tell them why he had received it.Skunk Works: A Personal Memoir of My Years at Lockheed (paperback edition), , p. 73.  Personal life  In 1950, Rich married Faye Mayer, a fashion model, who died in 1980. In 1982, Rich married Hilda Elliot. His son, Michael, is the president and CEO of RAND Corporation and his daughter, Karen, is a botanist. =Death= Rich died of esophageal cancer in Ventura, California, on January 5, 1995.

He was acknowledged by Earl Derr Biggers as the inspiration for his fictional Asian detective character, Charlie Chan.  Early life  Chang Ah Ping (ÈÑ≠ÈòøÂπ≥) was born December 26, 1871 in Waipio, Oahu, Hawaii. Apana is a Hawaiianized version of the Chinese name Ah Ping. His family moved back to China when he was 3, but Chang returned at the age of 10 to live with his uncle in Waipio. As an adult, Chang was fluent in Hawaiian, Hawaiian Pidgin, and Cantonese. He never learned to read, relying on his family to read newspapers and documents for him. In his youth, he worked as a paniolo (Hawaiian cowboy), starting in 1891, and it was as part of this job that he first began carrying a bullwhip on a regular basis. Three years later, Chang started working for the Hawaii Humane Society, which at the time was part of the police department on the island. The Humane Society was founded by Helen Kinau Wilder, the owner of the horses that Chang had handled as a paniolo. Wilder was the daughter of shipping magnate Samuel Gardner Wilder.  Police career  In 1898, Chang joined the Honolulu Police Department, where he was assigned to patrol Chinatown. In his early years as a detective, beginning in 1916, Chang worked primarily on opium-smuggling and illegal gambling cases. Due in part to his fluency in several languages, his wide network of informants and because of his shrewd and meticulous detective style, Chang was successful in solving many cases. Many stories about Chang's career have arisen. Chang helped round up people infected with leprosy and send them to a leper colony on the island of Molokai. While performing this duty, Chang was attacked by a Japanese leper with a sickle, leaving him with a scar over his right eye. Another time Chang was thrown out of a second story window by drug addicts, only to land on his feet. There is an account that he raised the alarm on a shipment of contraband after being run over by a horse and buggy. One night in Honolulu, with no backup and armed only with his bullwhip, Chang arrested 40 gamblers, whom he then lined up and marched back to the police station.  Inspiration for Charlie Chan  Earl Derr Biggers vacationed in Hawaii in 1919 where he was inspired to begin to write the novel House Without a Key. While reading Honolulu newspapers in the New York library in 1924, he read about the exploits of Apana Chang. Biggers then created a new character based on Chang for his novel, inserting him a quarter of the way through the book. The character became popular and Biggers expanded his presence in his novels. Chang met actor Warner Oland, who portrayed Charlie Chan, when The Black Camel was filmed in Hawaii. When Biggers met Chang in 1928 the real detective was already being called \\"Charlie Chan\\", and Chang enjoyed watching his fictional counterpart's films. After five more novels, Biggers publicly acknowledged Chang as the inspiration for his character in a letter to the Honolulu Advertiser dated June 28, 1932. His widow states, though, that Chan was actually based on Biggers himself, resembling him in physique and character, whereas Chang was slight in build, quick to anger, and involved in very few actual murder cases.\\"The Real Charlie Chan\\", featurette on: Charlie Chan in Egypt (DVD), 20th Century Fox, 2006.  Retirement and death  After 34 years of service, Chang retired in May 1932 as a detective when he was injured in a car accident. He briefly worked as a watchman at the Hawaiian Trust building. On December 2, 1933, Chang was admitted to Queen's Hospital after a serious month-long illness. On December 7, 1933, his gangrenous leg was amputated and he died the following day. Chang is buried at the Manoa Chinese cemetery in Honolulu.  Influence  Chang's law enforcement career was an influence on other fictional works other than Charlie Chan. Max Allan Collins's 1996 novel, Damned in Paradise, fictionalizes the famous Massie case. Collins included fictionalized depictions of several historical figures, including Chang Apana, who was an active-duty detective at the time of the Massie case (though there's no official record of Chang being one of the investigating officers). Usagi Yojimbo, a comic book series by Stan Sakai that is set in 17th century Japan and features a cast of anthropomorphic characters, includes occasional appearances of a character named Inspector Ishida who is partially based on Chang Apana. As Max Allan Collins points out in the introduction to Usagi Yojimbo Book 13: Grey Shadows, Inspector Ishida is, like the real Chang Apana, a more hardboiled character than the mild- mannered Charlie Chan. In a 2011 comic story written by Mike Curtis and illustrated by Joe Staton for the Dick Tracy newspaper strip, Tracy's friend and colleague, HPD officer Haku Kou, is depicted as being the technical advisor on a movie being filmed in Tracy's city because of the title character's facility with a blacksnake whip. Kou explains that he became proficient with that weapon (leading to his being hired as the film's technical advisor) in emulation of Chang Apana. Chang was featured in the seventh episode of the ninth season of the remake of Hawaii Five-O, entitled \\"Pua A'e La Ka Uwahi O Ka Moe\\" (\\"The Smoke Seen in the Dream Now Rises\\"), which highlighted some of Chang's stories and his successes in solving cases.

Braine in command. Vicksburg was named in honor of the great victory that General Ulysses S. Grant had recently won at Vicksburg, Mississippi. Service history On 7 December, a group of 17 Confederate sympathizers masquerading as passengers seized the steamer Chesapeake off Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The panic caused by that daring Confederate exploit prompted the Navy to order Vicksburg on 21 December to take up station off Sandy Hook, N.J., and detain for inspection all commercial ships outbound from New York. She performed similar duty off Staten Island, N.Y., through January 1864 until she was finally relieved on 8 February and ordered to sail for Hampton Roads, Va., for duty with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Vicksburg put into Hampton Roads two days later and was deployed with the blockade off Wilmington, North Carolina, on 18 February. In the spring, while on temporary duty off the coast of South Carolina, the gunboat seized the blockade-running British schooner Indian east of Charleston on 30 April. Returning to North Carolina, Vicksburg towed the stricken mortar schooner Oliver H. Lee to Beaufort, N.C., on 17 May and 18 May and chased a blockade runner on 31 May, recovering 79 bales of cotton thrown overboard by the vessel's crew. The gunboat put into Hampton Roads for repairs in June. On 11 July, Vicksburg received orders north to Annapolis, Maryland, to help protect Union emplacements there from Confederate raiders. She arrived off Annapolis in the Severn River on 13 July. Lt. Comdr. Braine found that the town was apprehensive over the proximity of Confederate forces and was mainly defended by 300 patients from the local hospital. Together with the gunboat , Lt. Comdr. Braine organized the town defenses and predicted that he would \\"give the rebels a warm reception.\\" That day, he also sent a boat party up the South River under the command of Acting Ensign Francis G. Osborn. The two-day expedition destroyed all means of crossing the South River and thereby protected the rear of the Union forces at Annapolis. Vicksburg received orders to return to Hampton Roads on 15 July, arrived there on 17 July, and left for the blockade off Wilmington later in July in a convoy consisting of the side- wheel steamer and four tugboats. While deployed on patrol and reconnaissance duty off Wilmington, Vicksburg unsuccessfully chased a blockade-running side- wheel steamer on the night of 6 August and another on the night of 23 August which she found aground at daylight the next morning. The gunboat underwent repairs soon thereafter and spent September making an extensive survey of Confederate Fort Fisher and of other Southern land defenses in the Cape Fear River. After completing this mission on 10 October, she assisted in the capture of the new, steel-hulled, blockade-running British steamer Bat off the Cape Fear River and, on 20 October and 24 October, participated in two unsuccessful nighttime chases of blockade-running steamers in the same area. Vicksburg remained off the Cape Fear River for the duration of the year and, on 26 December, assisted in covering the evacuation of troops after the unsuccessful first attack upon Fort Fisher on 24 December and 25 December. Vicksburg began the final year of the war assisting Union forces in mop-up operations following the fall of Fort Fisher during a second amphibious assault which took place between 13 January and 15 January 1865. She also participated in the bombardment of Half Moon Battery, situated on the coastal flank of the Confederate defense line which crossed Cape Fear Peninsula six miles above Fort Fisher, on 11 February. On 22 February, she was ordered north to Hampton Roads. In March, Vicksburg was one of several vessels sent to White House, Virginia, to support General Ulysses Grant's siege of Richmond by keeping open navigation between White House and the mouth of the York River. With the end of the Civil War in April 1865, Vicksburg was decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 29 April and sold at auction to C. C. & H. Cable on 12 July. She was documented for merchant service on 7 August 1865. Her name last appeared on lists of merchant vessels in the autumn of 1874.

They were presented by some to be evidence that people of an ancient Near Eastern culture had lived in North America and the U.S. state of Michigan, which, is known as pre-Columbian contact. Many scholars have determined that the artifacts are archaeological forgeries. The Michigan Relics are considered to be one of the most elaborate and extensive pseudoarchaeological hoaxes ever perpetrated in American history.Ashurst-McGee, Mark. \\"Mormonism's Encounter with the Michigan Relics,\\" BYU Studies, vol. 40, no. 3 (2001), 175. https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/mormonisms-encounter-with-michigan-relics \\"Discovery\\" of the Relics In October 1890, James O. Scotford of Edmore, Michigan, claimed that he had found a number of artifacts, including a clay cup with strange symbols and carved tablets, with symbols that looked vaguely hieroglyphic. The find attracted interest and eager looters arrived to look for more artifacts. Many more elaborate discoveries were made in the area around Wyman in Montcalm County, Michigan following Scotford's original discovery.Kelsey, Francis W., \\"Archaeological Forgeries from Michigan.\\" American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 10, No. 1 (Jan. - Mar., 1908), 48-59. https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/659777.pdf Scotford was a well-known digger and sign painter in the area of Wyman. He and his company \\"would dig until they located an artifact, and then the dignitaries who sponsored the work were invited to remove that artifact\\". Within the first year of Scotford's initial discovery a syndicate was formed in Montcalm County of interested parties. The syndicate purchased many of the artifacts and attempted to exploit the finds financially for the region.Ashurst-McGee, Mark. \\"Mormonism's Encounter with the Michigan Relics,\\" BYU Studies, vol. 40, no. 3 (2001), 177-178. https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/mormonisms-encounter-with- michigan-relics By 1907, Scotford joined forces with Daniel E. Soper, former Michigan Secretary of State, and together they presented thousands of objects made of various materials, supposedly found in 16 counties across Michigan. Soper had resigned as Secretary of State for the State of Michigan after being accused of embezzlement. The objects included coins, pipes, boxes, figurines and cuneiform tablets that depicted various biblical scenes, including Moses handing out the tablets of the Ten Commandments. On November 14, 1907, the Detroit News reported that Soper and Scotford were selling copper crowns they had supposedly found on heads of prehistoric kings, and copies of Noah's diary. Scotford often arranged for a local person to witness him \\"unearthing\\" the objects. Scotford and Soper had many trusting customers who strongly believed in the relics. In 1911, one John A. Russell published a pamphlet, \\"Prehistoric discoveries in Wayne County, Michigan,\\" in which he argued for their authenticity. James Savage, former pastor of the Most Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Detroit, bought 40 of the objects. Savage believed them to be \\"remains relevant to the descendants of the Lost Tribes of Israel,\\" and continued to believe in the relics until his death. Debunking In 1891, Professor Albert Emerson came out to the sites to get a better look at the \\"artifacts\\" that he called \\"bad enough in the photograph... an examination proved them to be humbugs of the first water.\\" In 1892, Professor Francis W. Kelsey, professor of Latin and Literature at the University of Michigan, along with Professor Morris Jastrow, Jr., librarian and professor of Semitic languages at the University of Pennsylvania, assessed the languages found on the objects. Kelsey and Jastrow deemed the Michigan Relics frauds containing a \\"horrible mixture\\" of jumbled ancient scripts.Ashurst-McGee, Mark. \\"Mormonism's Encounter with the Michigan Relics,\\" BYU Studies, vol. 40, no. 3 (2001), 178. https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/mormonisms-encounter-with- michigan-relics The consensus among most all early scholars who assessed the relics was that they were archaeological forgeries, based on the following evidence: *The hieroglyphs were stamped cuneiform characters in random order. *The figures on some of the discoveries included lions with no tails, an omission which would not have occurred by \\"primitive\\" artists. *The clay items were dried on a machine-sawed board. *The objects disintegrated in water, indicating that they could not have been buried in the ground for very long.Kelsey, Francis W., \\"Archaeological Forgeries from Michigan.\\" American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 10, No. 1 (Jan. - Mar., 1908), 49-51. https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/659777.pdf Archaeologists and historians continually concluded that the objects were forgeries. On July 28, 1911, professor Frederick Starr of the University of Chicago declared in the Detroit News that the so-called relics were fakes. Mary Robson, who lived in a room next door to Scotford's sons Percy and Charles, stated that the boys manufactured more \\"relics\\" all the time. In 1911, Scotford's stepdaughter signed an affidavit in which she stated that she had seen him making the objects and when she denied their validity he threatened her life.Ashurst- McGee, Mark. \\"Mormonism's Encounter with the Michigan Relics,\\" BYU Studies, vol. 40, no. 3 (2001), 187-188. https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/mormonisms- encounter-with-michigan-relics While most scholars and academics have determined that Scotford was the craftsman and Soper was the salesman, and the men joined forces for personal financial gain, neither man ever confessed and remained active in the business until their respective deaths in the 1920s. The Relics and LDS The finds attracted the interest of some members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). In 1909, Mormon scientist James E. Talmage participated in a \\"dig\\" and then thoroughly tested the artifacts in his lab back in Utah. His investigations led him to label the artifacts as frauds. In August 1911, he published a work on his findings titled \\"The 'Michigan Relics': A Story of Forgery and Deception.\\" Rudolph Etzenhouser, who was a traveling elder of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS), saw the relics as proof of the historicity of the Book of Mormon. Etzenhouser even published a book on his collection of the Michigan Relics.Etzenhouser, Rudolph, Engravings of Prehistoric Specimens, from Michigan, U.S.A. (Detroit, Mich.: John Bornman & Son Printers, 1910). https://hdl.handle.net/2027/njp.32101078162284 After James Savage died in 1927 he bequeathed his collection of the relics to the University of Notre Dame. While at Notre Dame, the relics sat dormant until the 1960s when Milton R. Hunter, president of the New World Archaeological Foundation, the research institute of the LDS Church, uncovered the relics. Hunter spent the rest of his life attempting to use the relics to prove the historicity of the Book of Mormon. Hunter connected the relics to the \\"Michigan Mound Builders,\\" which he deemed to be the Nephites from the Book of Mormon. Hunter's rhetoric and work with the Michigan Relics perpetuated pseudoarchaeology in religion, with efforts to prove pre-Columbian contact and the myth of the mound builders. Notre Dame gave Hunter the collection in the 1960s and before his death in 1975 he deeded the collection to the LDS Church. Following Hunter's death, the Church kept the collection in their museum in Salt Lake City, Utah for decades. In 2001, the Church had the relics examined by Professor of Anthropology Richard B. Stamps, of Oakland University and found that the artifacts were made with contemporary tools. The LDS Church kept 797 of the objects in their Salt Lake City Museum.

Katherine Maria Routledge (), n√©e Pease (11 August 1866 ‚Äì 13 December 1935), was an English archaeologist and anthropologist who, in 1914, initiated and carried out much of the first true survey of Easter Island. She was the second child of Kate and Gurney Pease, and was born into a wealthy Quaker family in Darlington, County Durham, northern England. She graduated from Somerville Hall (now Somerville College, Oxford), with Honours in Modern History in 1895, and for a while taught courses through the Extension Division and at Darlington Training College. After the Second Boer War, she traveled to South Africa with a committee to investigate the resettlement of single working women from England to South Africa. In 1906 she married William Scoresby Routledge. The couple went to live among the Kikuyu people of what was then British East Africa, and in 1910 jointly published a book of their research entitled With A Prehistoric People. Easter Island The Mana at Easter Island, 1914. In 1910 the Routledges decided to organize their own expedition to Easter Island/Rapa Nui. They had a state-of-the-art long Schooner built and named it Mana. They affiliated with the British Association for the Advancement of Science, the British Museum and the Royal Geographical Society, recruited a crew and borrowed an officer from the Royal Navy. The Mana departed Falmouth on 25 March 1913. They arrived on Easter Island on 29 March 1914. They established two base camps, one in the area of Mataveri and the other at the statue quarry, Rano Raraku and also explored Orongo and Anakena. With the help of an islander named Juan Tepano, Routledge proceeded to interview the natives and catalogue the moai (giant statues) and the Ahus they had once stood on. They excavated over 30 moai, visited the tribal elders in their leper colony north of Hanga Roa and recorded various legends and oral histories including that of Hotu Matua, the Birdman cult, clan names and territories and data on the enigmatic rongorongo script; Van Tilburg credits her with a primary role in assisting preservation of Rapa Nui's indigenous Polynesian culture. The excavated Ahu Tongariki, 1914. At the time, all moai were still overturned and there were no palm trees on the island. One of her findings was the cultural continuity between the statue carvers and the Polynesian Rapa Nui people resident on the island in her time; the designs carved on the backs of the statues she excavated included the same designs tattooed on the backs and posteriors of elderly islanders in the island's leper colony. As the tattooing tradition had been suppressed by missionaries in the 1860s this particular primary evidence was unavailable to later expeditions except through her records. Juan Tepano During their stay, the German East Asia Squadron, including the armored cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, and the light cruisers Dresden, Leipzig, Emden, rendezvoused off Hanga Roa. While the expedition covered up their main discoveries to hide them from the Germans, the Germans converted their fleet to a fighting trim. By the time the Germans landed 48 British and French merchant seamen from sunken prizes it had become clear to all that World War I had broken out, and Routledge complained sharply of this infringement of neutral Chilean territory to the schoolmaster in his capacity as representative of the Government of Chile; whilst her husband sailed the Mana to Valparaiso to pass on a similar complaint to the British Consul in Santiago. There is no record of what steps the schoolmaster took to persuade the German fleet to leave Chilean waters, but they did depart, most of them to Coronel and the Falklands. Some of the stranded French merchant seamen were recruited as labourers by the expedition. Routledge also decided to mediate in the native rebellion against the sheep ranch that was led by local medicine woman and visionary named Angata. The Routledges departed the island in August, 1915 returning home via Pitcairn and San Francisco. She published her findings in a popular travel book, The Mystery of Easter Island, in 1919. Hundreds of the objects that she and her husband found are now in the Pitt Rivers MuseumPitt Rivers Museum Collection and the British MuseumBritish Museum Collection whilst her paper records are held by the Royal Geographical Society in London. Most of her scientific conclusions are accepted to this day. Health Routledge suffered from early childhood with what is today believed to have been the developing stages of paranoid schizophrenia. However, she was able to carry out anthropological research (often under arduous conditions involving living in close quarters with others for years) with no sign of the condition. Her brother, Harold Pease, also suffered from mental illness, although whether he also suffered from schizophrenia is unclear. Routledge became involved with Spiritualism during her Oxford years and practised automatic writing. After 1925, her schizophrenia got worse and displayed itself in the form of delusional paranoia. She threw Scoresby out of her Hyde Park, London mansion and locked herself inside. She also hid many of her field notes. In 1929 Scoresby and her family had her confined to a mental institution. She died institutionalized in 1935. Her husband gave the field notes he found to the Royal Geographical Society. One of his executors found photographs of the Easter Island expedition ten years after his death. Maps of the expedition were found in Scoresby's house in Cyprus in 1961. Family papers and photographs, previously unpublished, including details of her illness, were made public through a biography of her. Archaeology on Easter Island continues to make use of her field notes and ethnographic research. Notes References *Katherine Routledge (1919).

His main passion was painting, but he also produced sculptures and designed some stained glass panels. Biography Robinson was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the son of a house painter. He trained at the Belfast College of Art. He took part in boxing matches, under the name \\"Boyo Marko\\", and later worked as a merchant seaman. Robinson's first exhibitions were in Belfast during World War II. He became better known through over 20 exhibitions of his work at the Oriel Gallery in Dublin, where he used the upstairs framing room as his studio. As well as a steady stream of sales of individual pictures. The Royal Hibernian Academy was another prominent venue for exhibition of his work. He also had a long record of one-man-shows in other venues both in Ireland and elsewhere. Markey's designs for stained glass can be seen over the entrance to the Oriel Gallery and also in the window designed by him in the late 1970s. More than 400 Markey Robinson works can be seen in the online archive catalogues of Whytes Irish Art Auctions His paintings cover a wide range of subjects, but there are certain recurring features. These may appear separately or in combination. * Village scenes of white cottages in which the white gable end of the cottage is distinctive. Frequently, there are no windows visible in these cottages. * Women wearing dark shawls - no facial features are visible * Sailboats, normally with dark brown sails, or sometimes white sails * Jugs feature prominently in his still life paintings * Circus clowns He painted the inhabited countryside with flat muted colour in almost abstract, almost geometrical compositions. Robinson died in Belfast, aged 80. In May 2008, the Taoiseach (the Irish Prime Minister), Brian Cowen TD, officially opened a restropective exhibition of Robinson's work at the Oriel Gallery. Entitled Markey at the Oriel, the exhibition featured paintings and sculpture from the 1950s onwards. A 160-page catalogue on the artist by Paul O'Kelly accompanied the exhibition. In recent years his works have become popular, and widely faked, as his style is relatively easy to copy. His earlier works are more difficult to fake as they are quite detailed. Robinson was very resourceful in sourcing painting materials and many of his works are on bits of plywood or cardboard discarded by shopkeepers. Many of his best works were painted around the 1960s. Towards the end of his life Robinson painted many of the same paintings again and again as he was guaranteed a good price from them. It is estimated that he produced over 10,000 works of art. He never kept any of his paintings. His daughter Annie is also a popular artist and her works are often inspired by Markey. Further reading *\\"Markey - 30 years at the Oriel Gallery\\"..

The statues, created by Italian brothers Pio and Alfonso Riccardi and three of their six sons, were bought by The Metropolitan Museum of Art between 1915 and 1921. Early fakes The Riccardis began their career as art forgers when Roman art dealer Domenico Fuschini hired them to forge shards of ancient ceramics and eventually whole jars. Their first sizeable work was a large bronze chariot. In 1908, Fuschini informed the British Museum that the chariot had been found in the old Etruscan fort near Orvieto, and that the Riccardis had been commissioned to clean it. The British Museum bought the chariot and published the find in 1912. Pio Riccardi died soon after the purchase. Warriors The Riccardis enlisted the aid of sculptor Alfredo Fioravanti and created a statue, later known as the Old Warrior. It was 202 cm tall and was naked from the waist down. It was also missing its left thumb and right arm. In 1915, they sold it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art that also bought their next work, the Colossal Head, in 1916. Experts decided it must have been part of a seven-metre statue. The next work was designed by Pio's eldest son Ricardo, who died in a riding accident before it was completed. When finished, the statue stood a little over two meters tall. In 1918, the Metropolitan Museum of Art bought it for $40,000 and published the find as the Big Warrior in 1921. The forgers subsequently dispersed. Discovery of forgery The three warrior statues were first exhibited together in 1933. In the following years, various art historians, especially in Italy, presented their suspicions that on stylistic and artistic grounds alone, the statues might be forgeries, but there was no forensic proof to support the allegations. A later expert found that these exceptionally large pieces showed extraordinarily even firing characteristics, but he expressed this as cause for admiration, not suspicion. In 1960, chemical tests of the statue glazes showed the presence of manganese, an ingredient that Etruscans had never used. The museum was not convinced until experts deduced how they had been made. The statues had been sculpted, painted with glaze, then toppled while in an unfired, green state to produce fragments. Metropolitan director James Rorimer stated that studies by the Museum's Operating Administrator Joseph V. Noble (an antiquities collector and self-trained ceramic archaeologist) \\"provided the first technical evidence of their having been made in modern times.\\" An Inquiry into the Forgery of the Etruscan Terracotta Warriors in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Dietrich von Bothmer and Joseph Veach Noble. Papers of the Metropolitan Museum of Art No. 11. January 1, 1961. This was confirmed by Alfredo Fioravanti, who on January 5, 1961, entered the US consulate in Rome and signed a confession. The forgers had lacked the skills - and the very large kiln - required to make such large pieces. The fragments had been fired, \\"discovered\\" and sold, or re-assembled (\\"restored\\") then sold. As proof, Fioravanti presented the Old Warrior's missing thumb, which he had kept as a memento. On February 15, the Metropolitan Museum announced that the statues were forgeries.

He was called the Raphael of Cats because of the excellence with which he painted that animal.Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, E. Cobham Brewer, 1898  Early life  Gottfried Mind was born at Bern in the year 1768. His father had come as a joiner and form-cutter to Switzerland from Lipsich, in Upper Hungary. Mind was mostly left to himself because of his weak constitution. Herr Gruner was a lover of art. During the summer, he had a German artist named Legel in his house who often drew buildings and cattle from nature. This excited the attention of young Mind in some of his idle rambles: he followed Legel everywhere, and watched him while he worked. Legel would take him along with him in his walks, or amuse him in his own apartment with exhibitions of prints. In particular, he allowed the boy to turn over Ridinger's Animals, of which Herr Gruner had a collection; some of these Mind tried to imitate with the lead pencil, preferring above all lions. These attempts Legel from time to time corrected, and the youngster at length ventured to draw from nature, like his master, and to draw some sheep, goats, and cats. His father, the joiner, however, thought that wood was the only material that was worthy of one's effort and he also considered drawing on paper to be unworthy. Whenever the boy asked paper for drawing, he threw him a bit of wood; Gottfried also tried cutting animals in wood, an art in which he speedily attained such dexterity, that his wooden sheep and goats came to ornament all the presses and mantel-pieces in the village. He also tried drawing likenesses of some peasant boys of Worblaufen, or carving them in wood; and these attempts were not unsuccessful.  Art education  Mind, in his eighth year, was placed at the academy for poor children, which Pestalozzi had previously instituted at Neuenhof, near Bern, Aargau. In the year 1778, in this authentic account of that institution, published by the Economic Society of Bern, the following short notice:‚Äî\\"Friedly Mynth of Bossi (Mind of Pizy), of the bailliwick of Aubonne, resident in Worblaufen, very weak, incapable of hard work, full of talent for drawing, a strange creature, full of artist- caprices, along with a certain roguishness: drawing is his whole employment: a year and a half here: ten years old.\\" It is not known how long he remained at this academy; somewhere between the years 1780 and 1785, he came to the painter Sigmund Hendenberger at Bern. With him, Mind learnt his art of drawing, and colouring with water-colours. Mind's education dealt mostly with art; he could with difficulty be made to write his name, and he had not the slightest idea of arithmetic. Mind's special talent for representing cats was discovered and awakened by chance. At the time when Hendenberger was painting that since-published picture of the peasant cleaving wood before his cottage, with his wife sitting by, and feeding her child with pap out of a pot, round which a cat is prowling, Mind cast a broad stare on the sketch of this last figure, and said in his rugged, laconic way, \\"That is no cat!\\" Hendenberger asked, with a smile, whether Mind thought he could do it better. Mind offered to try; he went into a corner, and drew the cat, which Hendenberger liked so much that he made his new pupil finish it out, and the master copied the scholar's work.  Work  It was not till after Hendenberger's death that Mind fully developed his peculiar talent for drawing. His pictures of peasant children, which, for the most part, are painted on small sheets, depict sports, banterings, quarrellings, sledge-parties of children, with their half- frozen but still merry faces, in their puffy yet picturesque costume. In the course of his narrow, indoors life, he had worked himself into an almost paternal relation with domestic animals, especially with cats. While he sat painting, a cat might generally be seen sitting on his back or on his shoulder; many times he kept, for hours, the most awkward postures, that he might not disturb it. Frequently there was a second cat sitting by him on the table, watching how the work went on; sometimes a kitten or two lay in his lap under the table. Frogs (in bottle) floated beside his easel; and with all these creatures he kept up a most playful, loving style of conversation; though, often enough, any human beings about him, or such even as came to see him, were growled or grunted at in no social fashion. Cat in a Cage His chief diligence and most careful elegance he brought to work in the painting of his beloved cats. He had both the art to seize the general nature of this animal and to reflect the specific character of each. The sycophantic look full of falseness, the dainty movements of the kittens, several of which are sometimes painted sporting round their dam‚Äîall this, in the most multifarious postures, turns, groups, sports, and quarrels, is depicted with a true observance to nature. On Sundays and winter nights, Mind, by way of pastime, used, out of dried, wild chestnuts, to carve little cats, bears, and other beasts, and this with so much art that these little dainty toys were shortly in no less request than his drawings. It is a pity that insects, such as frequently exist in the interior of chestnuts, have already destroyed so many of these carvings. At the Barengraben (bear-yard) in Bern, where a few live bears are always to be seen, Mind passed many a happy hour. The moment he made his appearance, the bears hastened towards him with friendly grumbling, stationed themselves on their hind feet, and received, impartially, each a piece of bread or an apple out of his pocket. For this reason, bears, next to cats, were a favourite subject of his art; and he reckoned himself, not unjustly, better able to delineate these animals than even celebrated painters have been. Moreover, next to his intercourse with living cats and bears, Mind's greatest joy was in looking at objects of art, especially copper-plates, in which, too, animal figures gave him most satisfaction. Herr Sigmund Wagner, of Bern, who possessed a choice collection of copper-plates, frequently invited Mind, on winter Sunday evenings to his house, and would then show him his volumes. While Herr Wagner might be writing, reading, or drawing, Mind, grumbled to himself half-aloud, made his remarks on each sheet, and frequently gave a true, stubborn, rugged judgment even on the most celebrated masters, especially on pictures of animals. Among these, nothing pleased him but the lions of Rubens, of Rembrandt, and Potter, and the stags of Kidinger; the other animals of the latter he declared to be falsely drawn. Even the most applauded cats of Cornelis Visscher and Wenzel Hollar could not obtain his approbation. Mind seldom drew from Nature; at most he did it with a few strokes. His conception was so strong, that whatever he had once strictly observed, stamped itself so firmly in his memory that, on his return home, and often a considerable time afterwards, he could represent it with entire fidelity. On such occasions he would look now and then, as it were, into himself; and when at these moments, he lifted his head, his eyes had something dreamy in them.  Death  In late 1813, Mind began suffering from \\"an increasing disorder in the breast\\" which left him unable to exert himself. On 17 November 1814, he died of this illness, at the age of 46.

It is named after Frederick Thomas Trouton. Mathematically, it can be expressed as: :\\\\Delta \\\\bar S_{vap} \\\\approx 10.5R where R is the gas constant A similar way of stating this (Trouton's ratio) is that the latent heat is connected to boiling point roughly by: :\\\\frac{L_{vap}}{T_{boiling}} \\\\approx 85-88 \\\\frac{J}{K mol}. Trouton‚Äôs rule can be explained by using Boltzmann's definition of entropy to the relative change in free volume (that is, space available for movement) between the liquid and vapour phases. It is valid for many liquids; for instance, the entropy of vaporization of toluene is 87.30 J K‚àí1 mol‚àí1, that of benzene is 89.45 J K‚àí1 mol‚àí1, and that of chloroform is 87.92 J K‚àí1 mol‚àí1. Because of its convenience, the rule is used to estimate the enthalpy of vaporization of liquids whose boiling points are known. The rule, however, has some exceptions. For example, the entropies of vaporization of water, ethanol, formic acid and hydrogen fluoride are far from the predicted values. The entropy of vaporization of XeF6 at its boiling point has the extraordinarily high value of 136.9 J K‚àí1 mol‚àí1. The characteristic of those liquids to which Trouton‚Äôs rule cannot be applied is their special interaction between molecules such as hydrogen bonding. The entropy of vaporization of water and ethanol shows positive deviance from the rule; this is because the hydrogen bonding in the liquid phase lessens the entropy of the phase. In contrast, the entropy of vaporization of formic acid has negative deviance. This fact indicates the existence of an orderly structure in the gas phase; it is known that formic acid forms a dimer structure even in the gas phase. Negative deviance can also occur as a result of a small gas phase entropy owing to a low population of excited rotational states in the gas phase, particularly in small molecules such as methane - a small moment of inertia I giving rise to a large rotational constant B, with correspondingly widely separated rotational energy levels and, via Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution, a small population of excited rotational states and hence a low rotational entropy. The validity of Trouton's rule can be increased by considering :\\\\Delta \\\\bar S_{vap} \\\\approx 4.5R + R\\\\ln T Here, if T = 400 K, we find the original formulation for Trouton's rule. Another equation which Tboiling < 2100 K is ŒîHboiling = 87 Tboiling ‚àí 0.4 J/K.

During his career with Leeds, Madeley played in a variety of different playing positions which led to him being described as a Utility player. Madeley made more than 500 appearances for Leeds in the Football League and appeared in 24 internationals for England between 1971 and 1977. Leeds United Born in the Beeston area of Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire Madeley signed for Leeds from non-league Farsley Celtic in May 1962 and made his debut for Leeds in January 1964, following injuries to Freddie Goodwin and Jack Charlton, and became a regular in the team from 1966 onwards. Madeley was arguably the most versatile of players ‚Äì in his Leeds United career, he played in every position on the pitch except goalkeeper and wore every shirt from No. 2 to No. 11 (and occasionally No. 12) as a result. His natural ability to adapt to a different role on a frequent basis meant that he was often in the side chosen by manager Don Revie at the expense of a 'specialist' in that position, though the majority of the time there was a player either injured or suspended whom Madeley would replace ‚Äì usually in defence. However, Madeley was utilised in attacking positions when Leeds won their first major honours under Don Revie; in the 1968 Football League Cup Final, Madeley wore the No. 9 shirt (striker) in the 1‚Äì0 win over Arsenal, whilst in 1971 he scored the crucial away goal against Juventus which helped Leeds win the Fairs Cup ‚Äì in the two legs he wore the No. 11 shirt (left wing/midfield). His versatility led to the nickname \\"The Eleven Pauls\\", which was used in the 1972 FA Cup Final song Leeds United. Having deputised so well for Paul Reaney at club level, Madeley was asked by Alf Ramsey to take Reaney's place in the England squad for that summer's World Cup in Mexico, but Madeley politely refused, saying he wanted to rest and, as a stand-in, was unlikely to kick a ball. In the 1971‚Äì72 season, Madeley again found himself moving round the side as injuries and suspensions to his teammates, and in the end he never missed a League match, though for a third year in a row Leeds failed to clinch the title on the last day of the season. In April 1972, left back Terry Cooper suffered a broken leg, so Madeley switched to the No. 3 shirt for the season's end and the FA Cup final, which Leeds finally won with a 1‚Äì0 win over Arsenal. Revie signed Trevor Cherry as a replacement for Cooper in the summer of 1972, and Madeley moved across to the centre of defence for much of the next season as Jack Charlton's distinguished career at Leeds wound down. He wore the No. 5 shirt as Leeds lost the FA Cup final to Sunderland, and the European Cup Winners Cup final a few days later in Salonika, which Leeds lost to A.C. Milan in controversial circumstances. Leeds won the League in 1974 ‚Äì Madeley missing just three matches ‚Äì and even after Revie's departure that summer to take over the England job, reached their first and only European Cup final a year later, with Madeley in the No. 5 shirt again. In his autobiography, Right Back to the Beginning, Revie's successor Jimmy Armfield related a telling story about Madeley negotiating a new contract: \\"He once actually signed a new contract on what was virtually a blank piece of paper. I called him in to discuss terms and opened discussions by saying, 'OK, Paul, we'll give you so much'. He replied that he had no intention of leaving Leeds so he might as well sign the contract and let me fill in the details. I said, 'What do you want, then, two years or three years?' He answered, 'Either way, I'll leave it to you. I just want to play for Leeds,' and that was that.\\" Madeley was granted a testimonial season in 1977, and eventually retired from playing in 1980 with 724 appearances in all competitions to his name. International career Madeley made his England debut in 1971 against Northern Ireland in Belfast in the 1970‚Äì71 British Home Championship at right-back; a position he was to win the majority of his 24 caps in a six-year international career. The then England manager Alf Ramsey had previously approached Madeley to replace injured Leeds teammate Paul Reaney at the 1970 World Cup in Mexico, but Madeley politely declined, stating that he needed a rest and that as a stand-in he was unlikely to play a part. Madeley later partnered Bobby Moore at centre-back as the latter won his 100th cap against Scotland in 1973. His final cap came against the Netherlands in a friendly at Wembley in 1977. Post-playing career After retiring Madeley invested in a shop in Leeds selling sports goods and worked for his family's DIY business. He and his brothers sold this business for ¬£27 million in 1987. In 1992 he had a benign brain tumour removed. He had a mild heart attack in 2002 and was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2004. Madeley was portrayed by actor Chris Moore in the 2009 film The Damned United, an adaptation of David Peace's novel of the same name about Brian Clough's ill-fated tenure at Leeds. Madeley died on 23 July 2018, aged 73.

An inspection locomotive was a special type of steam locomotive designed to carry railroad officials on inspection tours of the railroad property.  Background  These were fitted with passenger car-like bodywork and seating. Many railroads in the nineteenth century owned one, but their use dwindled in the twentieth century. They were replaced with converted passenger-car inspection cars, or HiRail trucks, automobiles fitted with steel flanged wheels. Some were especially built for this service, while others were rebuilt from obsolete locomotives. Many were quite small; the locomotive pictured is in fact one of the largest and most modern inspection locomotives ever constructed. They were generally well cared for and highly decorated.  Region specific  = Russia = The Russian Railways still has two inspection locomotives A Chs2 549 & 552, which are converted electric locomotives. = United Kingdom = Railway companies in the United Kingdom did not use inspection locomotives. Instead dedicated carriages (known as Inspection Saloons) were used. These were either rebuilt from obsolete coaching stock or, occasionally, were newly built. However many companies maintained dedicated locomotives to haul Inspection Saloons. These were usually elderly engines that had been famous top-rank express locomotives when new but had since been surpassed. Examples of such engines include the Caledonian Railway Single, LNWR No.3020 'Cornwall' and NER No. 66 'Aerolite'. Dugald Drummond, when Chief Mechanical Engineer of the London and South Western Railway had a small 4‚Äì2‚Äì4 tank locomotive with a small saloon body mounted on its rear to serve as his personal transport around the L&SWR; system on inspections and visits. = United States = The only known surviving U.S. example is the Reading Railroad's \\"Black Diamond\\", a tiny 2-2-2 with fully enclosed bodywork, at the Museum of Transportation in St. Louis, Missouri.

A tympanostomy tube is inserted into the eardrum to keep the middle ear aerated for a prolonged time and to prevent reaccumulation of fluid. Without the insertion of a tube, the incision usually heals spontaneously in two to three weeks. Depending on the type, the tube is either naturally extruded in 6 to 12 months or removed during a minor procedure. Those requiring myringotomy usually have an obstructed or dysfunctional eustachian tube that is unable to perform drainage or ventilation in its usual fashion. Before the invention of antibiotics, myringotomy without tube placement was also used as a major treatment of severe acute otitis media (middle ear infection). Nomenclature The words myringotomy, tympanotomy, tympanostomy, and tympanocentesis overlap in meaning. The first two are always synonymous, and the third is often used synonymously. The core idea with all of them is cutting a hole in the eardrum to allow fluid to pass through it. Sometimes a distinction is drawn between myringotomy/tympanotomy and tympanostomy, in parallel with the general distinction between an -otomy (cutting) and an -ostomy (creating a stoma with some degree of permanence or semipermanence). In this distinction, only a tympanostomy involves tympanostomy tubes and creates a semipermanent stoma. This distinction in usage is not always made. The word tympanocentesis specifies that centesis (aspiration for sampling) is being done. Etymologically, myringotomy (myringo-, from Latin myringa \\"eardrum\\", \\\\+ -tomy) and tympanotomy (tympano- + -tomy) both mean \\"eardrum cutting\\", and tympanostomy (tympano- + -stomy means \\"making an eardrum stoma\\".  History  In 1649, Jean Riolan the Younger accidentally pierced a patient's ear drum while cleaning it with an ear spoon. Surprisingly, the patient's hearing improved. There are also reports from the 17th and 18th centuries describing separate experiments exploring the function of the ear drum. In particular, the animal experiments of Thomas Willis were expanded upon by Sir Astley Cooper, who presented two papers to the Royal Society in 1801 on his observations that myringotomy could improve hearing. First, he showed that two patients with perforations of both eardrums could hear perfectly well, despite conventional wisdom that this would result in deafness. Second, he demonstrated that deafness caused by obstruction of the Eustachian tube could be relieved by myringotomy, which equalized the pressure on each side of the tympanic membrane. Widespread inappropriate use of the procedure later led to it falling out of use. However, it was reintroduced by Hermann Schwartze in the 19th century. An inherent problem became recognized, namely the tendency of the tympanic membrane to heal spontaneously and rapidly, reversing the beneficial effects of the perforation. In order to prevent this, a tympanostomy tube, initially made of gold foil, was placed through the incision to prevent it from closing. √Åd√°m Politzer, a Hungarian- born otologist practicing in Vienna, experimented with rubber in 1886. The vinyl tube used today was introduced by Beverley Armstrong in 1954.  Indications  Retracted ear drum There are numerous indications for tympanostomy in the pediatric age group, the most frequent including chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) which is unresponsive to antibiotics, and recurrent otitis media. Adult indications differ somewhat and include Eustachian tube dysfunction with recurrent signs and symptoms, including fluctuating hearing loss, vertigo, tinnitus, and a severe retraction pocket in the tympanic membrane. Recurrent episodes of barotrauma, especially with flying, diving, or hyperbaric chamber treatment, may merit consideration.  Procedure  Myringotomy is usually performed as an outpatient procedure. General anesthesia is preferred in children, while local anesthesia suffices for adults. The ear is washed and a small incision made in the eardrum. Any fluid that is present is then aspirated, the tube of choice inserted, and the ear packed with cotton to control any slight bleeding that might occur. This is known as conventional (or cold knife) myringotomy and usually heals in one to two days. A new variation (called tympanolaserostomy or laser-assisted tympanostomy) uses CO2 laser, and is performed with a computer-driven laser and a video monitor to pinpoint a precise location for the hole. The laser takes one-tenth of a second to create the opening, without damaging surrounding skin or other structures. This perforation remains patent for several weeks and provides ventilation of the middle ear without the need for tube placement. Though laser myringotomies maintain patency slightly longer than cold-knife myringotomies (two to three weeks for laser and two to three days for cold knife without tube insertion), they have not proven to be more effective in the management of effusion. One randomized controlled study found that laser myringotomies are safe but less effective than ventilation tube in the treatment of chronic OME. Multiple occurrences in children, a strong history of allergies in children, the presence of thick mucoid effusions, and history of tympanostomy tube insertion in adults, make it likely that laser tympanostomy will be ineffective. Various tympanostomy tubes are available. Traditional metal tubes have been replaced by more popular silicon, titanium, polyethylene, gold, stainless steel, or fluoroplastic tubes. More recent ones are coated with antibiotics and phosphorylcholine. =Incision types= Cutting type: given in posterior inferior quadrant, this is done in cases of acute otitis media. Splitting type: given in anterior inferior quadrant, this is done in cases of serious otitis media (\\"glue ear\\"), this type of incision is suitable for grommet insertion. Incision is either 'j'(hockey) shaped or curvilinear shaped and it is given from below upward so as to ease the drainage. Aftercare There is little scientific evidence to guide the care of the ear after tubes have been inserted. A single, randomized trial found statistical benefit to using ear protective devices when swimming although the size of the benefit was quite small. In the absence of strong evidence, general opinion has been against the use of ear protection devices. However, protection such as cotton covered with petroleum jelly, ear plugs, or ear putty is recommended for swimming in dirty water (lakes, rivers, oceans, or non-chlorinated pools) to prevent ear infections. For bathing, shampooing, or surface-water swimming in chlorinated pools, no ear protection is recommended.  Complications  The placement of tubes is not a cure. If middle ear disease has been severe or prolonged enough to justify tube placement, there is a strong possibility that the child will continue to have episodes of middle ear inflammation or fluid collection. There may be early drainage through the tube (tube otorrhea) in about 15% of patients in the first two weeks after placement, and developing in 25% more than three months after insertion, although usually not a longterm problem. Otorrhea is considered to be secondary to bacterial colonization. The most commonly isolated organism is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while the most troublesome is Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Some practitioners use topical antibiotic drops in the postoperative period, but research shows that this practice does not eradicate the bacterial biofilm. A laboratory study showed that tubes covered in the antibiotic vancomycin prevented in-vitro formation of MRSA biofilm as compared to noncoated ones, although no study has been conducted on humans yet. Comparing phosphorylcholine-coated fluoroplastic tympanostomy tubes to uncoated fluoroplastic tympanostomy tubes showed no statistically significant difference in the incidence of post-operative otorrhea, tube blockage, or extrusion.  Efficacy  Evidence suggests that tympanostomy tubes only offer a short-term hearing improvement in children with simple OME who have no other serious medical problems. No effect on speech and language development has yet been shown.. A retrospective study of success rates in 96 adults and 130 children with otitis media treated with CO2 laser myringotomy showed about a 50% cure rate at six months in both groups. To date, there have been no published systematic reviews. Balloon dilation eustachian tuboplasty (BDET), a new treatment, has proven to be effective in treating OME secondary to eustachian tube dysfunction. However, the number of patients in the studies cited, 22 and 8 respectively and 18 in the tympanometric study, is extremely small and simply points to the need for large, well-controlled studies.

He was one of the peaceful disciples of Melchior Hoffman and later joined Menno SimonsGunnar Westin, Vapaan kristillisyyden historia, s. 203. in laying out practical doctrines for what would become the Mennonite church.  Biography  Dirk Philips was born in Leeuwarden in 1504, the son of a priest (it was not uncommon at the time for a priest to have unofficial wives and families). He was a Franciscan friar. He joined the Anabaptist Brotherhood in 1533 and became an elder in 1534. In 1537, he was named one of the outstanding Anabaptist leaders. In 1561, he was described as an old man, not very tall, with a grey beard and white hair. He died in Het Falder in 1568.  Beliefs  He was the leading theologian of his time among Dutch Mennonites. He was known to be very systematic in his thinking, and very strict and unwavering in his beliefs. There were two key themes to his theology: the word of scripture, and the word incarnate in Jesus. Like other Anabaptists, he gave Christ pre- eminence. He was not as charming or friendly as Menno Simons. He identifies seven ordinances of the church: *Pure doctrine *Scriptural use of the sacraments *Washing the feet of the saints *Separation (the ban and shunning) *Command of love *Obedience to the command of Christ *Suffering and persecution He believed in strict adherence to the ban or shunning. This is when open sinners are expelled from the church until they repent. He felt this was necessary in order to maintain the purity of the church. His emphasis on the ban and the purity of the community makes Dirk Philips' writings more popular with the Old Order Amish. He believed in the absolute opposition between the church and the world, and therefore that believers should expect persecution.

Historical use The name henbane dates at least to AD 1265. The origins of the word are unclear, but \\"hen\\" probably originally meant death rather than referring to chickens. Other etymologies of the word associate it with the Indo-European stem *bhelena whose hypothetical meaning is 'crazy plant' and with the Proto- Germanic element bil meaning ‚Äòvision, hallucination; magical power, miraculous ability‚Äô. Henbane was historically used in combination with other plants, such as mandrake, deadly nightshade, and datura, as an anaesthetic potion, as well as for its psychoactive properties in \\"magic brews\\". These psychoactive properties include visual hallucinations and a sensation of flight.Schultes & Smith 1976, p. 22 It was originally used in continental Europe, Asia, and the Arab world,Joseph Perez, Janet Lloyd, The Spanish Inquisition, Yale University Press, 2006, , , p229 footnote 10] though it did spread to England in the Middle Ages. The use of henbane by the ancient Greeks was documented by Pliny who said it was \\"of the nature of wine and therefore offensive to the understanding\\", and by Dioscorides who recommended it as a sedative and analgesic. The plant, recorded as Herba Apollinaris, was used to yield oracles by the priestesses of Apollo. Recently evidence for its earlier use in the Scottish Neolithic has been debated.Black Henbane (Hyoscyamus niger L.) in the Scottish Neolithic, Journal of Archaeological Science (1999) 26, 45‚Äì52 John Gerard's Herball states: \\"The leaves, the seeds and the juice, when taken internally cause an unquiet sleep, like unto the sleep of drunkenness, which continueth long and is deadly to the patient. To wash the feet in a decoction of Henbane, as also the often smelling of the flowers causeth sleep.\\" The plant was also purportedly used as a fumigant for magical purposes. Albertus Magnus, in his work De Vegetalibus (1250), reported that necromancers used henbane to invoke the souls of the dead as well as demons. Henbane was already being demonized as early as the Late Middle Ages when it became inseparably associated with witchcraft and malefic practices. ‚ÄúThe witches drank the decoction of henbane and had those dreams for which they were tortured and executed. It was also used for witches‚Äô ointments and was used for making weather and conjuring spirits. If there were a great drought then a stalk of henbane would be dipped into a spring, then the sun-baked sand would be sprinkled with this‚Äù (Perger 1864, 181). During a Pomeranian witchcraft trial in 1538, a suspected witch \\"confessed\\" that she had given a man henbane seeds so that he would run around \\"crazy\\" (sexually aroused). In a file from an Inquisition trial, it was noted that \\"a witch admits\\" having once strewn henbane seeds between two lovers and uttering the following formula: \\"Here I sow wild seed, and the devil advised that they would hate and avoid each other until these seeds had been separated\\" (Marzell 1922, 169). Henbane was one of the ingredients in gruit, traditionally used in beers as a flavouring. Several cities, most notably Pilsen, were named after its German name \\"Bilsenkraut\\" in the context of its production for beer flavouring. The recipe for henbane beer includes 40 g dried chopped henbane herbage, 5 g bayberry, 23 l water, 1 l brewing malt, 900 g honey, 5 g dried yeast, and brown sugar. Henbane fell out of usage for beer when it was replaced by hops in the 11th to 16th centuries, as the Bavarian Purity Law of 1516 outlawed ingredients other than barley, hops, yeast, and water. Henbane is sometimes identified with the \\"hebenon\\" poured into the ear of Hamlet's father, although other candidates for hebenon exist. = Theories = Henbane seeds have been found in a Viking grave near Fyrkat, Denmark, that was first described in 1977. This and other archaeological finds show that H. niger was known to the Vikings. Analysis of the symptoms caused by intoxication of this plant suggest that it may have been used by berserkers to induce the rage state that they used in war. Cultivation and use Henbane cultivation, Lilly Experimental Farm, 1919 Henbane originated in Eurasia, and is now globally distributed as a plant grown mainly for pharmaceutical purposes. Henbane is rare in northern Europe; its cultivation for medicinal use is spread and legal in central and eastern Europe and in India. Henbane is an endangered plant according to the World Conservation Union's Red List. Henbane is used in traditional herbal medicine for ailments of the bones, rheumatism, toothache, asthma, cough, nervous diseases, and stomach pain. It might also be used as analgesic, sedative, and narcotic in some cultures. Adhesive bandages with henbane extract behind the ear are reported to prevent discomfort in travel-sick people. Henbane oil is used for medicinal massage. Henbane material in most Western countries can be bought in pharmacies with a prescription only. Sales of henbane oil are not legally regulated and are allowed in shops other than pharmacies in the US. Preparation, dosage, toxicity Henbane leaves and herbage without roots are chopped and dried and are then used for medicinal purposes or in incense and smoking blends, in making beer and tea, and in seasoning wine. Henbane leaves are boiled in oil to derive henbane oil. Henbane seeds are an ingredient in incense blends. In all preparations, the dosage has to be carefully estimated due to the high toxicity of henbane. For some therapeutic applications, dosages like 0.5 g and 1.5‚Äì 3 g were used. The lethal dosage is not known. Henbane is toxic to cattle, wild animals, fish, and birds. Not all animals are susceptible; for example, the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including cabbage moths, eat henbane. Pigs are immune to henbane toxicity and are reported to enjoy the effects of the plant.  Psychoactive material  Hyoscyamine, scopolamine, and other tropane alkaloids have been found in the foliage and seeds of the plant. The standard alkaloid content has been reported to be 0.03% to 0.28%. Effects Henbane ingestion by humans is followed simultaneously by peripheral inhibition and central stimulation. Common effects of henbane ingestion include hallucinations, dilated pupils, restlessness, and flushed skin. Less common effects are tachycardia, convulsions, vomiting, hypertension, hyperpyrexia, and ataxia. Initial effects typically last for three to four hours, while aftereffects may last up to three days. The side effects of henbane ingestion are dryness in the mouth, confusion, locomotor and memory disturbances, and farsightedness. Overdosages result in delirium, coma, respiratory paralysis, and death. Low and average dosages have inebriating and aphrodisiac effects. In his book How Do Witches Fly?, Alexander Kuklin refers to an experience of black henbane had by German scientist Michael Schenck. Schenck recollected his experience: Schenck's pulse became rapid and he experienced a further increase in the hallucinogenic effects of the plant: Misidentification Apothecary vessels for Hyoscyamus preparations, Germany, 19th century Celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson accidentally recommended henbane as a \\"tasty addition to salads\\" in the August 2008 issue of Healthy and Organic Living magazine. The publication promptly warned subscribers against consuming the \\"very toxic\\" plant upon discovery of the error, and Thompson admitted to confusing it with fat hen, a member of the spinach family.

CDIC insures Canadians' deposits held at Canadian banks (and other member institutions) up to C$100,000 in case of a bank failure. CDIC automatically insures many types of savings against the failure of a financial institution. However, the bank must be a CDIC member and not all savings are insured. CDIC is also Canada's resolution authority for banks, federally regulated credit unions, trust and loan companies as well as associations governed by the Cooperative Credit Associations Act that take deposits.  History  The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation was created 4 March 1967 (under Schedule III, Part 1 of the Financial Administration Act and Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act). It is similar to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the United States. Since 1967, 43 financial institutions have failed in Canada and all 43 were members of CDIC. There have been no failures since 1996. At 31 December 2017, member institutions numbered 82, according to CDIC's Summary of the Corporate Plan, 2018/19 to 2022/2023. The roots of the CDIC can be traced back to the 19th century, such as the Upper Canada's financial problems of 1866, the North American panic of 1873 and the 1923 failure of Toronto's Home Bank, symbolized today by Casa Loma. Historically in Canada regional risk has always been spread nationally within each large bank, unlike the uneven geography of US unit banking, layered with savings & loans of regional or national size, who in turn disperse their risk through investors. The Canadian banking system is regulated in part by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions who can, in an extreme case, close a financial institution. Alongside Canada's mortgage rules, the risk of bank failures similar to the US are slim, but not impossible. The original amount of insurance per eligible deposit account was $20,000. This was raised to $60,000 in 1983. As of 2005, CDIC covers $100,000 in eligible deposits per insured category at each CDIC member institution in the event of a failure. On 22 June 2017, CDIC was formally designated as the resolution authority for Canada's largest banks, a recognition of CDIC's role in handling the failure of its member institutions. CDIC has a number of tools to assist or resolve a failing member institution. Coverage Insurance is restricted to CDIC member institutions, and covers $100,000 in certain types of deposits, such as savings accounts and chequing accounts, guaranteed investment certificates (GICs) and other term deposits with an original term to maturity of five years or less, money orders, travellers' cheques and bank drafts issued by CDIC members and cheques certified by CDIC members, and debentures issued by loan companies that are CDIC members. Eligible deposits are insured separately in each of seven categories: * in one name * in more than one name * in an RRSP * in an RRIF * in a TFSA * in trust * for paying taxes on mortgaged properties A key characteristic of CDIC deposit protection is separate coverage. Given that each deposit category is protected separately, depositors can benefit from protection far in excess of $100,000 (e.g. they are protected for $100,000 in each of seven categories). Most credit unions (and caisses populaires in Quebec or New Brunswick) are not insured federally, because they are created under provincial charters and backed by provincial insurance corporations which generally follow the CDIC model. Federal credit unions, such as the UNI Financial Cooperation caisse in New Brunswick, are incorporated under federal charters and are members of CDIC. ATB Financial, a financial institution owned by the Government of Alberta, is insured directly by the Alberta provincial government rather than through a federal or provincial insurance corporation. Funds in foreign banks operating in Canada are not covered. Deposits in foreign currencies, such as United States dollars, are also not insured even if they are held by a registered CDIC financial institution. Guaranteed Investment Certificates with a term longer than 5 years are also not insured. Some funds in Registered Retirement Savings Plans or Registered Retirement Income Funds at a bank may not be covered if they are invested in mutual funds or held in specific instruments like debentures issued by government or corporations. The general principle is to cover reasonable deposits and savings, but not deposits deliberately positioned to take risks for gain, such as mutual funds or stocks. Current financial position According to CDIC's Quarterly Financial Report at 31 December 2017, CDIC protects $774 billion CAD in insured deposits. CDIC's ex ante funding level is $4.2 billion, representing 55 basis points of insured deposits.

It is well known for the wide variety of birds and other wildlife that can be found there. It is currently a wildlife preserve, though urban development posed a serious threat to the lake and its environs during the 1980s and early 1990s.  Etymology  √òstensj√∏vannet (\\"√òstensj√∏ lake\\") is named after the √òstensj√∏ farm (old Norse Austansj√≥r). The first element is austan 'east of', and the last element is sj√≥r 'sea, lake'. The farm was situated on the lake's east side. The last element is the finite form of vann 'water; lake'. The meaning of the name is then 'the lake belonging to √òstensj√∏'.Haugen, Einar (1967) Norwegian-English Dictionary (University of Wisconsin Press)  Wildlife  √òstensj√∏vannet is well known for its birdlife, and over 200 different species of birds have been sighted at or near the lake, quite a significant number by Norwegian standards. Other wildlife is regularly sighted at the lake, but the variety of species is not much different from surrounding places, such as √òstmarka. Fishing during the summer is forbidden, while ice- fishing is allowed.  Cultural history  Finds in the area suggest that people may have been living in the area as far back as the stone age. Farming in the area started around 500 AD. At various locations surrounding the lake, there are burial mounds from the Viking Age. Abilds√∏ g√•rd, located on the lake's west side, was Norway's second farm school. It was where Minna Wetlesen started Europe's, and possibly the world's first \\"household\\" - school where girls and young women could learn about running a household and performing the various tasks related to it.  Environmental issues  The lake itself has been a wildlife preserve since 1992, while Abilds√∏ g√•rd was preserved by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage (Riksantikvar) in 1997. In 2002, the Oslo city council passed plans for the \\"√òstensj√∏vannet Environmental Park\\", which in effect preserves the various habitats and \\"green areas\\" surrounding the lake. Situated inside the Oslo city limits, surrounded on all sides by built-up areas, has put a considerable strain on the lake, both in terms of pollution (especially caused by leaks from less-than-perfectly maintained sewage systems) and plans for using the fields and forested areas surrounding the lake for various purposes, including housing, a cemetery and even a small golf course. The sewage systems affecting the lake have been better maintained in recent years, and the environmental state of the lake is currently much better than it was a decade or two ago.

In physics, dephasing is a mechanism that recovers classical behaviour from a quantum system. It refers to the ways in which coherence caused by perturbation decays over time, and the system returns to the state before perturbation. It is an important effect in molecular and atomic spectroscopy, and in the condensed matter physics of mesoscopic devices. The reason can be understood by describing the conduction in metals as a classical phenomenon with quantum effects all embedded into an effective mass that can be computed quantum mechanically, as also happens to resistance that can be seen as a scattering effect of conduction electrons. When the temperature is lowered and the dimensions of the device are meaningfully reduced, this classical behaviour should disappear and the laws of quantum mechanics should govern the behavior of conducting electrons seen as waves that move ballistically inside the conductor without any kind of dissipation. Most of the time this is what one observes. But it appeared as a surprise to uncover that the so-called dephasing time, that is the time it takes for the conducting electrons to lose their quantum behavior, becomes finite rather than infinite when the temperature approaches zero in mesoscopic devices violating the expectations of the theory of Boris Altshuler, Arkady Aronov and David E. Khmelnitskii. This kind of saturation of the dephasing time at low temperatures is an open problem even as several proposals have been put forward. The coherence of a sample is explained by the off-diagonal elements of a density matrix. An external electric or magnetic field can create coherences between two quantum states in a sample if the frequency corresponds to the energy gap between the two states. The coherence terms decay with the dephasing time or spin‚Äìspin relaxation, T2. After coherence is created in a sample by light, the sample emits a polarization wave, the frequency of which is equal to and the phase of which is inverted from the incident light. In addition, the sample is excited by the incident light and a population of molecules in the excited state is generated. The light passing through the sample is absorbed because of these two processes, and it is expressed by an absorption spectrum. The coherence decays with the time constant, T2, and the intensity of the polarization wave is reduced. The population of the excited state also decays with the time constant of the longitudinal relaxation, T1. The time constant T2 is usually much smaller than T1, and the bandwidth of the absorption spectrum is related to these time constants by the Fourier transform, so the time constant T2 is a main contributor to the bandwidth. The time constant T2 has been measured with ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy directly, such as in photon echo experiments. What is the dephasing rate of a particle that has an energy E if it is subject to a fluctuating environment that has a temperature T? In particular what is the dephasing rate close to equilibrium (E~T), and what happens in the zero temperature limit? This question has fascinated the mesoscopic community during the last two decades (see references below). See also *Dephasing rate SP formula References = Other = * (And references therein.)

He is well known for his commentary on the Talmud, Meir Einai Chachamim. He is also referred to as Maharam (Hebrew acronym: \\"Our Teacher, Rabbi Meir\\"). Biography Maharam was born in Lublin, Poland. He was descended from a family of rabbis, and his father, Gedaliah, was an eminent Talmudist. His principal teacher was his father-in-law, Isaac ha-Kohen Shapiro, rabbi of Krak√≥w. Maharam's knowledge of the Talmud and Poskim was such that he was invited to the rabbinate of Krak√≥w in 1587, when he was not yet thirty years old. In 1591 he became rabbi at Lemberg. (In Lemberg he was engaged in a controversy with Rabbi Joshua Falk concerning a bill of divorce.) In 1613 he became rabbi at Lublin and established a yeshiva. He was well known in the role of Rosh Yeshiva there, owing to his renown as a Talmudic scholar. Many of his students became prominent rabbis or heads of yeshivot; his most famous student is probably Isaiah Horowitz (Shelah HaKodesh). A daughter of the Maharam was married to Benjamin Beinisch Gelernter, whose parents were Rabbi Zachariah Mendel Gelernter and the daughter of the Maharal of Prague. While the Maharam served as Dayan and Rabbi in Lemberg a dispute broke out between him and R Rabbi Joshua Falk (known as the Sema) regarding a bill of divorce. The controversy turned out ugly and the Maharam offended the honor of rabbi Joshua Falk. Abraham Shrenzel, a student of Joshua Falk and an influential scholar, thus avenged the honor his rabbi and the Maharam was forced to leave the city by order of the local governmentThe Early Achronim, The Artscroll history series, p. 122. R' Meir was a sharp polemicist and critical of the people around him, and did not refrain from criticizing the most respected scholars of his generation, including the Rema, Beis Yosef, Maharsha, Maharshal. He even disagreed with the Rishonim when he felt that they have erred. He was forceful in rejecting opinions of his own \\"without any doubt, and there is no way of settling [the issue] in any other way.Responsa no. 111; http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Meir_ben_Gedalyah_of_Lublin. \\" When the Maharsha's commentary to the Talmud was first printed, he dismissed it and wrote \\"from what I wrote you can see that he can't find his hands and feet in the house of learning, and it is an error.\\" Only later when he realized that the Maharsha was a greatly respected scholar, he confessed to him \\"and what happened happened, and love covers all sins.\\" When a rabbi in Worms, whom he thought to be a lesser authority than him, rejected his opinion he was deeply offended. He writes that he wanted to embarrass him in the synagogue of Lublin and to convene with the leaders of the communities to demote him from his position, but he decided not to because \\"perhaps it will be an honor for him that a person like me is occupied with someone like him\\".◊ê◊ì◊ô◊®◊ô ◊ì◊¢◊î p. 57 While he served as the head of the Yeshiva in Lublin, R' Shimon wolf Aurbach, the son in law of the Maharshal, headed another Yeshiva in the same town. They both had different styles of interpretation, and this usually lead to quarreling among the students as everyone claimed that their Rabbi had the correct way. From then on, the communal leaders decreed that the students could not tell one another of the new interpretation of the Rabbis, and that whoever violated this ban would be expelled from the Yeshiva. However, this didn't last for too long. When the Maharam once had a difficulty explaining Tosafot and was eager to find out how R' Shimon Wolf had resolved the issue, he asked his students to find out. When the right opportunity came up, they grabbed one of the students of R' Shimon Wolf, beat him up and forced him to repeat the interpretation of his Rabbi. When the Maharam heard of it, he openly declared that only his interpretation is the correct one. A great controversy flared up between the two Yeshivos. The leaders of Lublin decided that they would send a letter to Sholomo Aboav Rav of Amsterdam to decide which one is the correct interpretation, and whichever interpretation he deems appropriate, the other would lose the right to remain as head of the Yeshiva. When the Answer came back from Amsterdam it was clear that it was in favor of R Shimon Wolf. The communal leaders decided to demote the Maharam of his position as head of the Yeshiva. But the humble R Shimon Wolf refused to accept this decision. Instead they invited the Maharsha to assume the Rabbinate in Lublin. The Maharsha gave a sermon Shabbos night and convinced the community of Lublin to keep both of these Torah giants among them, and the controversy endedLuboml: The memorial book of a vanished shtetl, pp. 25-27. . Works Meir Einei Chachamim is his best known work, a \\"casuistic commentary\\" on the Talmud, Rashi, and Tosafot together. It was published by his son Gedaliah and has since been printed in all principal editions of the Talmud under the heading \\"Maharam.\\" It is considered one of the important commentaries on the Talmud. The commentary, generally, employs short and simple explanations. After his death, over 140 of the Halachic questions posed to him were published in a collection of responsa entitled Mnahir Einai Chachamim.

Eidels is also known as Maharsha (,MaHarSha, accent on \\"SHA\\" a Hebrew acronym for \\"Our Teacher, the Rabbi Shmuel Eidels\\"). Biography The Maharsha was born in Krak√≥w in Poland. His father, Yehuda, was a Talmudist and both parents were descendants of rabbinic families‚Äîhis mother Gitel was a cousin of Rabbi Yehuda Loew, the Maharal of Prague, and his father \\"was a direct descendant of Rabbi Yehuda HaChasid.\\" From early childhood, the Maharsha's remarkable talents were evident. When he came of marriageable age, the Maharsha was offered many prestigious shidduchim (marriage partners), but he rejected them, asserting that he wanted to devote himself solely to Torah study. He married the daughter of Edel Lifschitz of Posen and the late Moshe Lifschitz, rabbi of Brisk. He then moved to Posen and, with his mother-in- law's financial help, established a yeshiva there. She supported it for over 2 decades,24 according to cited source including \\"taking care of every bachur's needs.\\" In appreciation of her support he adopted her name. After her death, he served as rabbi in the following prominent communities: Chelm (1610), Lublin, Tiktin and Ostroh. Eidels was also active in the Council of Four Lands. His son-in-law was R.

It is said that if one grasps the Maharsha, then one has understood the Tosafot. This commentary was quickly accepted and was printed in almost all editions of the Talmud. Chiddushei Halachot is based on Maharsha's teaching in his yeshiva, and he refrained from printing his commentary on those pages that were studied while he served on the Council of Four Lands. The Maharsha also wrote an extensive commentary on the aggadot of the Talmud known as the Chiddushei Aggadot ( - \\"Novellae in Aggadah\\") reflecting a wide knowledge of philosophy and Kabbalah. Maharsha on Aggados is a multi-volume translation by Rabbi Avraham Yaakov Finkel. Great Maharsha Synagogue Maharsha grave in Ostroh The Great Maharsha Synagogue is located in Ostroh (Ukraine). It was built in 1627 under a restriction \\"prohibiting the erection of synagogues taller than churches.\\" The synagogue was damaged during the Khmelnytsky massacres and centuries later, once again, during the Holocaust.

This type of cheese is considered \\"technologically simple\\" to produce. When making soft acid-set cheese the coagulum results from production of lactic acid by the starter microorganisms. Cheeses can be classified according to a variety of features including ripening characteristics, special processing techniques (such as cheddaring) or method of coagulation. Acid-setting is a method of coagulation that accounts for around 25% of production. These are generally fresh cheeses like cottage cheese, queso blanco, quark and cream cheese. The other 75%, which includes almost all ripened cheeses, are rennet cheeses. Some cheeses like ricotta and ziger are made by first heating the milk to between 90-92 degrees Celsius to create coprecipitation of casein and whey protein before addition of lactic or citric acid. Production Traditional cottage cheese can be made without any coagulating enzymes, though modern processing techniques often do make use of such enzymes to increase yield and reduce processing times. These methods produce a milder and sweeter flavored cheese then the traditional method. Rennet is also sometimes used in the processing of other fresh, soft cheeses like fromage frais, but it is not an essential ingredient and these cheeses can be produced by traditional methods without rennet or other enzymes. Ricotta is a high-moisture cheese, like cottage cheese, but it is not a pressed curd cheese. It can be made from whey or a blend of milk and whey. Traditionally, ricotta was produced from the whey byproduct of mozzarella and provolone production, but modern techniques usually use whole milk (sometimes without any whey). Milk can be blended into the whey to improve curd cohesiveness, neutralize the acid in whey and increase yield. This mixture of milk and whey is heated before enough food grade acid is added to drop the pH to the needed level (this could be some type of lactic, citric or acetic acid). Whichever type of acid is used by the cheesemaker it is important to maintain correct PH levels for the sweetness of the cheese's flavor. Some methods of mass produced cheeses will use food grade caustic soda to neutralize the acid of the whey, before heating the blend and adding the coagulating acid.

He became earl in 2003 following the death of his father, Henry Herbert, 17th Earl of Pembroke. Family Pembroke is the only son of the 17th Earl by his wife, the former Claire Rose Pelly, who is now married to Stuart Wyndham Murray-Threipland. He has three older sisters and three younger half-sisters by his father's second marriage. He inherited the ancestral titles and estates, centring on Wilton House, the family seat in Wiltshire, when his father died in 2003. In April 2009, he announced his engagement to his long-time girlfriend, Victoria Bullough. The couple were married on 29 May 2010 at the parish church of St Mary and St Nicholas in Wilton, near Salisbury. Their first child, Lady Alexandra Ekaterina Eloise Herbert, was born at Salisbury District Hospital on 3 April 2011. A son and heir apparent, Reginald Henry Michael, Lord Herbert, was born on 21 October 2012. Their third child, The Honourable Louis Charles Alexander Herbert, was born at Salisbury District Hospital on 20 September 2014. Their fourth child, Lady Beatrice Aurelia Skye Herbert, was born at Salisbury District Hospital on 15 March 2016. The Countess of Pembroke (born 1985) is Victoria Bullough, a daughter of Michael Bullough, owner of McEwens, a department store in Scotland. Her mother, Sandra Lee-Graham Bullough, is a former model. She grew up in Huntingtower, Perth, and was educated at Glenalmond College, and then studied interior architecture at Chelsea College of Art and Design, graduating with First Class honours. While at Chelsea, she appeared in Country LifeCountry Life magazine dated 13 April 2006 and began dating Lord Pembroke. They married in 2010.https://www.salisburyjournal.co.uk/news/8192758.earl-of-pembroke-marries- victoria-bullough/ Lady Pembroke is now a patroness of the Royal Caledonian Ball. Education and career Herbert was educated at Bryanston School, and then at the University of Leeds for two years, where he did a foundation course in 3D computer graphics design. He then pursued a course in industrial design at Sheffield Hallam University, being the first Herbert to graduate with a first class honours degree. He then worked with Sebastian Conran as an industrial designer, being forced to quit that job in October 2004 to assume the responsibilities of the house and estate at Wilton, a year after his father's death from cancer. In a July 2005 interview with The Observer, Herbert spoke frankly of the responsibilities and difficulties in managing a historic home and estate. He wanted to increase the number of celebrity events, such as Madonna's birthday party, at Wilton House to increase revenues; however, opening the property to more tourists does not pay in the long run, he said, as it increases wear-and-tear on the house. He also spoke frankly of the need for him to marry and father a son to secure the succession (for the sake of his immediate family as well as the estate and house and all those who depend on it for a livelihood), but he was not aware at that time who was the heir presumptive. In interviews, he stated that he believed that the heir is \\"one of the Fitzwilliamses\\". However, his heir presumptive at that time was the present George Herbert, 8th Earl of Carnarvon (born 1956), who has legitimate male issue. , the Wilton estate had around 140 employees. Its 14,000 acres are divided into 14 farms, one of which is run by the estate, and more than 200 residential properties. Although the house is open to the public, Lord Pembroke and his wife occupy about a third of the house privately. He also maintains a flat in London. Motoring A keen car and motor racing enthusiast, Lord Pembroke has raced in the Funcup endurance series since 2009 and, in 2011, had a class win in the Spa 25 hour race against 120 international teams. He used to hold an annual Classic and Supercar show in the grounds of Wilton House but it was cancelled in 2017 for unknown reasons He has owned various racing cars, and his road car collection includes a Bugatti Veyron. Pembroke had the car wrapped in a specially- designed form inspired by the Gulf Oil racing colours of the 1960s, designed by Ian Cook who is also known as PopBangColour. Succession Since Herbert's father had no brothers, and his grandfather's brothers died unmarried, and other lines of descent from earlier earls have become extinct, the heir presumptive to the earldoms of Pembroke (created 1551 by Edward VI) and Montgomery (created for the brother of the 3rd Earl, who succeeded him as 4th Earl) was the 8th Earl of Carnarvon (born 10 November 1956), holding the earldom created in 1793 for the first son of the second surviving son of the 8th Earl. However since their marriage in 2010, the 18th Earl and Countess have produced two daughters and two sons; the heir apparent is Reginald, Lord Herbert, born in 2012.

They can be used to view to access benefits or services provided by government authorities, banks or other companies, for mobile payments, etc. Apart from online authentication and login, many electronic identity services also give users the option to sign electronic documents with a digital signature. One form of eID is an electronic identification card (eIC), which is a physical identity card that can be used for online and offline personal identification or authentication. The eIC is a smartcard in ID-1 format of a regular bank card, with identity information printed on the surface (such as personal details and a photograph) and in an embedded RFID microchip, similar to that in biometric passports. The chip stores the information printed on the card (such as the holder's name and date of birth) and the holder's photo(s). Several photos may be taken from different angles along with different facial expressions, thus allowing the biometric facial recognition systems to measure and analyze the overall structure, shape and proportions of the face.NIMC's national id specs It may also store the holder's fingerprints. The card may be used for online authentication, such as for age verification or for e-government applications. An electronic signature, provided by a private company, may also be stored on the chip. Countries which currently issue government-issued eIDs include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Belgium, Bulgaria, Chile, Finland, Guatemala, Germany, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Mexico, Morocco, Pakistan, Portugal, Poland, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Spain, Slovakia, Malta, and Mauritius. Germany, Uruguay and previously Finland have accepted government issued physical eICs. Norway, Sweden and Finland accept bank-issued eIDs (also known as BankID) for identification by government authorities. There are also an increasing number of countries applying electronic identification for voting (enrollment, issuing voter ID cards, voter identification and authentication, etc.), including those countries using biometric voter registration. According to the EU electronic identification and trust services (eIDAS) Regulation, described as a pan-European login system, all organizations delivering public digital services in an EU member state shall accept electronic identification from all EU member states from September 29, 2018.Info on eIDAS, Connectis.Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014  Afghanistan  Afghanistan issued its first electronic ID card on May 3rd 2018. Afghan President Dr. Ashraf Ghani was the first who received his eID. Afghan President was accompanied by First Lady Rula Ghani, his VP, Head of Afghan Senate, Head of Afghan Parliament, Chief Justice and other senior government officials. All these senior officials received their eIDs during the ceremony. The Afghan electronic ID is polycarbonate based card with covert and overt security features. The Card has an embedded chip which hosts applets with textual data, biometrics and electronic identity of the citizen. Belgium Belgium has been issuing eIDs since 2003, and all identity cards issued since 2004 have been electronic, replacing the previous plastic card. =Chip contents= The eID card contains a chip containing: * the same information as legible on the card * the address of the card holder * the identity - and signature keys and certificates =Using the eID= At home, the users can use their electronic IDs to log into specific websites (such as Tax-on-web, allowing them to fill in their tax form online). To do this the user needs * an eID card * a smartcard reader * the eID middleware software When other software (such as an Internet Browser) attempts to read the eID, the users are asked for confirmation for this action, and potentially even for their PIN. Other applications include signing emails with the user's eID certificate private key. Giving the public key to your recipients allows them to verify your identity. =Kids ID= Although legally Belgian citizens only have to carry an ID from the age of 12, as of March 2009, a \\"Kids ID\\" has been introduced for children below this age, on a strictly voluntary basis. This ID, beside containing the usual information, also holds a contact number that people, or the child themselves, can call when they, for example, are in danger or had an accident. The card can be used for electronic identification after the age of six, and it does not contain a signing certificate as minors cannot sign a legally binding document. An important goal of the Kids-ID card is to allow children to join \\"youth-only\\" chat sites, using their eID to gain entrance. These sites would essentially block any users above a certain age from gaining access to the chat sessions, effectively blocking out potential pedophiles. Bulgaria Bulgaria introduced a limited scale proof-of-concept of electronic identity cards, called –ï–ò–ö (E–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω–Ω–∞ –∫–∞—Ä—Ç–∞ –∑–∞ –∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∏—á–Ω–æ—Å—Ç), in 2013.

Denmark Electronic identities in Denmark issued by banks are called NemID. NemID authentication allows larger payments in MobilePay - a service used by more than half of the population as of 2017. Estonia The Estonian ID card is also used for authentication for Estonia's Internet-based voting system. In February 2007, Estonia was the first country to allow for electronic voting for parliamentary elections. Over 30,000 voters participated in the country's e-election. idBlog - The number of electronic voters tripled At end of 2014 Estonia extended the Estonian ID Card to non-residents. The target of the project is to reach 10 million residents by 2025, which is 8 times more than the Estonian population of 1.3 million. Finland The Finnish electronic IDFinnish electronic ID was first issued to citizens on 1 Dec 1999. Germany Germany introduced its electronic identity cards, called Personalausweis, in 2010. Guatemala Guatemala introduced its electronic identity card called DPI (Documento Personal de Identificaci√≥n) in August 2010. Israel Electronic identity cards in Israel have been issued since July 2013. The EIC is not yet compulsory, it is issued free of charge to promote it, and is valid for ten years. Italy Italy introduced its electronic identity cards, called Carta d'Identit√† Elettronica (in Italy identified with the acronym CIE), to replace the paper-based ID card in Italy. Since 4 July 2016, Italy is in the process of renewing all ID cards to electronic ID cards. Kazakhstan Kazakhstan introduced its electronic identity cards in 2009.  Latvia  eID and eSignature service provider in Latvia is called eParaksts Malta Since 12 February 2014, Malta is in the process of renewing all ID cards to electronic ID cards. Mauritius Mauritius has had electronic identity cards since 2013. Mexico Even they have been destroyed in 2018 and there were 3 million cards issued it was a great effort. Mexico had an intent to develop an official electronic biometric ID card for all youngsters under the age of 18 years and was called the Personal Identity Card (Record of Minors), which included the data verified on the birth certificate, including the names of the parents, a unique key of the Population Registry (CURP), a biometric facial recognition photograph, a scan of all 10 fingerprints, and an iris scan registration. Netherlands Electronic identities in Netherlands are called DigiD and Netherlands is currently developing an eID scheme. Nigeria General Multi-purpose Electronic Identity Cards are issued by the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), a Federal Government agency under the Presidency. The NeID Card complies with ICAO standard 9303, ISO standard 7816-4., as well as GVCP for the MasterCard-supported payment applet. NIMC plans to issue 50m multilayer-polycarbonate cards, the first set being contact only, but also dual-interface with DESFire Emulation in the near future. Norway Electronic identities in Norway issued by banks are called BankID (diffrent than Sweden's BankID). They make it possible to log into Norwegian authorities, universities and banks, and to make larger payments using the Vipps mobile payment service, used by more than half of the population as of 2017. The Norwegian BankID p√• mobil service is utilizing the mobile phone SIM card for authentication, and is financed by a fee to the mobile network operator for each authentication. Pakistan Pakistan introduced the Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) in 2000, with over 89.5 x CNICs issued by 2012. In October 2012, the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) introduced the smart national identity card (SNIC), which contains a data chip and 36 security features. The SNIC complies with ICAO standard 9303 and ISO standard 7816-4. The SNIC can be used for both offline and online identification, voting, pension disbursement, social and financial inclusion programmes and other services. NADRA aims to replace all 89.5 million CNICs with SNICs by 2020. Spain Electronic identity cards in Spain are called DNIe and have been issued since 2006. Sweden The most widespread electronic identification in Sweden is issued by banks and called BankID. The BankID may be in the form of a certificate file on disk, on card or on smart phones. The latter (Swedish mobile BankID service) was used by 84 percent of the Swedish population in 2019.The Swedes and the Internet 2019 summary A Mobile BankID login does not require a fee since the service is provided by banks rather than mobile operators. It can be used both for authentication within various apps and web services on the same smart phone, and also for web pages on other devices. It also supports fingerprint and face recognition authentication on compatible iOS and Android devices. Electronic IDs are used for secure web login to Swedish authorities, banks, health centers (allowing people to see their medical records and prescriptions and book doctors visits), and companies such as pharmacies. Mobile BankID also allows the Swish mobile payment service, utilized by 78 percent of the Swedish population in 2019, at first mainly for payments between individuals.Svenskarna och internet 2019 - Banktj√§nster och e-handel BankID was previously used for university applications and admissions, but this was prohibited by Swedbank since universities utilized the system for distribution of their own student logins.

The southern German variety is soft and similar to Teewurst. Braunschweiger mettwurst is partially smoked but still soft and spreadable, while other northern German varieties such as the Holsteiner are harder and more akin to salami, due to longer duration of smoking. The Low German word mett, meaning minced pork without bacon, is derived from the Old Saxon word meti (meaning food), and is related to the English word 'meat'. Mettwurst can be prepared and eaten a variety of ways, such as cooked or fried or spread on rye bread with onions and eaten raw. When minced raw pork is prepared without curing or smoking, it is called simply Mett. In South Australia, due to its large German immigration in the 19th Century (to, for example, the town of Hahndorf), mettwurst (sometimes spelled \\"metwurst\\") is very common: it is created in the Northern German style and served as a cold cut. It is often used in school lunches and as a snack during parties. Well-known South Australian brands of mettwurst include Barossa Fine Foods, Butch's Smallgoods, Kalleske, Linke's, Mullers, Steiney's and Wintulich. South Australian mettwurst is not just made from pork meat; kangaroo mettwurst is a popular variant. In the United States, mettwurst is most commonly associated with the city of Cincinnati, where it is regarded as a signature dish. The town of Mineola, Iowa, which was settled almost exclusively by immigrants from Schleswig-Holstein, hosts an annual heritage dinner with \\"Schoening-style\\" cold-smoked Mettwurst known in the Low German dialect as \\"Metvuss\\". It is important that high quality, fresh ingredients are used otherwise deadly microorganisms and toxins can develop. In January 1995, 23 children became very ill, one of whom died, which the coroner found was a result of eating garlic mettwurst. Finnish meetvursti resembles the Dutch metworst or salami: it is dry, hard, strong-flavored and dense, and is eaten as a cold cut on bread.

King Street is one of the most important thoroughfares of Manchester city centre, England. Formerly the centre of the north-west banking industry it has become progressively dominated by expensive shops. History King Street began in the 18th century at the Spring Gardens end when the Jacobite party in the town created James's Square and to the west of it a fine street. Beyond what is now Cross Street it was much narrower and one 18th century building remains (a former District Bank). Further west beyond Deansgate is King Street West on a different alignment. By the 1970s there was a clear demarcation between the eastern section of mainly financial and office buildings and the narrower section to the west a mostly up market shopping street (later pedestrianised). Subsequently, the eastern section had the monumental National Westminster Bank offices built at no. 55 and some years later further changes brought more and more retail outlets of the expensive sort. In 2008 the grand Midland Bank of Edwin Lutyens was vacated by the HSBC Bank. = Old Town Hall = Manchester's original civic administration (a commission of police) was housed in the Police Office in King Street from 1772; it was near the junction with Deansgate and Police Street is so called because of it.Bradshaw, L. D. (1985) Origins of Street Names in the City Centre of Manchester. Radcliffe: Neil Richardson; pp. 39-40 It was replaced by the first Town Hall, to accommodate the growing local government and its civic assembly rooms. The Town Hall, also located in King Street at the corner of Cross Street, was designed by Francis Goodwin and constructed during 1822‚Äì25, much of it by David Bellhouse. The building was designed in the Grecian style and Goodwin was strongly influenced by his patron John Soane. As the size and wealth of the city grew, largely as a result of the textile industry, its administration outstripped the existing facilities and a new building was proposed. The King Street building was subsequently occupied by a public library and then Lloyds Bank. The facade was removed to Heaton Park in 1912, when the current Lloyds TSB building was erected on the site (No 53 King Street). Notable buildings Many notable buildings survive and are preserved in a conservation area. In King Street there are 11 buildings listed Grade II, two listed Grade II* and one Grade I; in King Street West is one at Grade II and in South King Street nearby three more at Grade II.City Planning Department (1985) Manchester's Architectural Heritage.

Ward's solo work is a mixture of folk and blues-inspired Americana analog recordings; he has released ten studio albums since 1999, primarily through independent label Merge Records. In addition to his solo work, he is a member of indie pop duo She & Him and folk-rock supergroup Monsters of Folk, and also participates in recording, producing, and playing with multiple other artists.  Early life  M. Ward was raised in Glendale, California, and moved to Portland, Oregon, after college. Growing up, Ward taught himself songs by The Beatles on his brother's guitar, and began recording demos on a four-track analog tape recorder when he was about fifteen. Ward continues to only record analog, and starts all of his songs as demos on the same recorder he has had since his teens. Solo recordings = Duets for Guitars #2 and End of Amnesia (1999‚Äì2001) = Ward's solo debut, Duet for Guitars #2, was released by Co-Dependent Records in 1999, then re- issued by Howe Gelb's Ow Om record label in 2000. Described by Joshua Klein of Pitchfork as \\"ragged and lo-fi...recorded on a shoestring and not necessarily worse for it,\\" Duet for Guitars #2 soon went out of print for a second time, before being reissued by Merge in 2007. Ward's second album, End of Amnesia, was put out by Future Farmer Records and Loose Music (Europe) in 2001. In a retrospective review, Ryan Kearney of Pitchfork compares the album to a contemporary band, Sparklehorse, saying that \\"both Linkous and Ward are country- and folk-influenced artists who scratch unavoidable, but nominally disruptive marks on the traditional blueprint.\\" Sparklehorse had released It's a Wonderful Life to critical acclaim earlier in the year. A collection of live recordings, Live Music & The Voice of Strangers, was a self-released disc that was sold at his shows in 2001. = Transfiguration of Vincent and Transistor Radio (2003‚Äì05) = Ward released his third album, Transfiguration of Vincent, on Merge Records in 2003 to critical success. Transfiguration of Vincent received a weighted average score of 82 out of 100 by review aggregator website Metacritic, based on thirteen critical reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim.\\" The title alludes to the 1965 album The Transfiguration of Blind Joe Death by John Fahey, and refers to the life and death of Vincent O'Brien, a close friend to Ward. Fahey's pre-war style of folk music and production techniques, using basic equipment and simple arrangements, greatly influenced Ward's own sound and recording practices. Transistor Radio, Ward's fourth album, was released on Merge in 2005, and he served as the opening act for The White Stripes that fall. The album consists of Ward's own compositions as well as three covers, The Beach Boys' \\"You Still Believe in Me\\", Carmen Lombardo's pop standard \\"Sweethearts on Parade\\", and Bach's \\"Well-Tempered Clavier\\". Transistor Radio received a score of 78 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Josh Terry of Consequence of Sound, writing of Transistor Radio in 2014, described the album as \\"one of the finer examples of ramshackle and intimate mid-aughts folk.\\" A writer for Alternative Press, however, said that \\"Most of Ward's quiet, contemporary folk songs are mere sketches, mediocre if not unmemorable.\\" Transistor Radio was reissued by Merge in December 2014 with four previously unreleased tracks. = Post-War and Hold Time (2006‚Äì09) = In August 2006, Ward released Post-War on Merge Records. Post-War was Ward's first album with a full backing band, with players including Howe Gelb, Jim James, and Neko Case. Post-War was described by Vanity Fair in its August 2006 issue as thematic on the question \\"How will America heal once this craziness in Iraq is over?\\" Ward said in that article that he looked to the post-war music of the late 1940s and 1950s. \\"I had the naive, simplistic idea that producers and writers and artists of the time helped in a minuscule way to change the mind-set of America.\\" In addition to this inspired material, the album also contains a cover of Daniel Johnston's \\"To Go Home\\", which was subsequently re-released on the To Go Home EP in 2007. A critical success, Post-War received \\"universal acclaim\\" of 81 out of 100, aggregated by Metacritic and reached No. 146 on Billboard's Top 200. Ward spent most of 2007 touring with Norah Jones in support of the album, as well as occasionally playing in Norah's touring band, \\"The Handsome Band\\". Ward played on Jones's 2007 release Not Too Late. Hold Time, the followup to Post- War, was released on Merge in February 2009. Hold Time includes guest performances by Jason Lytle of the band Grandaddy, Lucinda Williams, Tom Hagerman of DeVotchKa, and She & Him co-contributor Zooey Deschanel. The album includes a cover of the Buddy Holly song \\"Rave On!\\" Described by Autumn De Wilde Entertainment Weekly as \\"[feeling] timeless, a musical wanderer's dusty, train-hopping tour through folk, blues, and country,\\" Hold Time received an aggregated 79 out of 100 on Metacritic, for \\"generally favorable reviews\\" and reached No. 31 on Billboard's Top 200. = A Wasteland Companion and More Rain (2012‚Äìpresent) = After several years of touring and releasing albums with pop project She & Him and folk supergroup Monsters of Folk, Ward released his seventh studio album, A Wasteland Companion, in 2012 on Merge and Bella Union. Reaching number 21 in the US charts, A Wasteland Companion received an aggregated score of 75 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Will Hermes of Rolling Stone gave the album 3.5 of 5 stars, reflective of the aggregated score, and commented that \\"[A Wasteland Companion] is his most vivid and varied yet, full of exquisite guitar work,...gem-like songcraft...and inspired covers.\\" Matthew McFarland of Prefix offered the criticism, \\"What's missing, though, is the familiar sense of deft control over the album's arc, the lyrical intrigues, and the instrumental detail that make his other work so indispensible [sic] to the indie folk canon of last decade.\\" After another multi-year break from solo recording, M. Ward released his eighth album, More Rain, on March 4, 2016, via Merge and Bella Union. Ward began working on More Rain in 2012, initially experimenting with layering his own vocals to create a doo-wop record. After collaborating with other artists on the record such as R.E.M.'s Peter Buck, k.d. lang, Neko Case, and others, the sound of the album went in a different direction, described as a \\"true gotta-stay-indoors, rainy-season record that looks upwards through the weather while reflecting on his past.\\" Ward (right) and Zooey Deschanel performing as She & Him at the Newport Folk Festival (August 2, 2008) On June 8, 2018, Ward self-released What a Wonderful Industry, his ninth studio album. Using a variety of anecdotes and metaphors, the album examines the complex challenges of working within the cutthroat music industry. As Ward stated in an interview with NPR, \\"You quickly learn there's a perfectly imperfect balance of cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals in the zoo....This record visits the most memorable characters. There's a lot of very inspirational people I've had the pleasure to work with but there are also a few I wish I'd never met.\\"Abshire, Emily. \\"M. Ward Surprise-Releases New Album: Hear 'What A Wonderful Industry\\" NPR, June 18, 2018. Ward's tenth studio album, Migration Stories, was released on April 3, 2020, on Anti Records.Bloom, Madison. \\"M. Ward Announces New Album Migration Stories, Shares New Song: Listen\\" Pitchfork, December 3, 2019. With other musicians = She and Him = In 2006, Ward was working on the soundtrack for the film The Go-Getter, co- starring actress Zooey Deschanel, when Director Martin Hynes suggested Ward and Deschanel record a duet for the movie. Ward later referred to the collaboration as \\"a fruitful, creative experience.\\" Deschanel soon sent Ward demos of songs she had written, and the two formed the pop duo She & Him to record together, with Deschanel writing the songs and Ward composing the music. The duo's first album Volume One ‚Äî which Ward produced ‚Äì was released on Merge Records on March 18, 2008. Volume One found critical and commercial success for Deschanel and Ward's pop music. The album reached No. 31 on Billboad's Top 200, and Metacritic has the critical album reviews aggregated to 76 out of 100, or \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" She & Him's second album, Volume Two, was released on Merge in 2010. Volume Two peaked at No. 6 on Billboard's Top 200, outperforming their first release. A Very She & Him Christmas was released October 25, 2011 on Merge Records, peaking at No. 12. After a break, She & Him released their third album of original songs, Volume 3 in 2013 followed by a collection of standards, Classics, in 2014. Both albums also charted and were released on Merge. = Monsters of Folk = Monsters of Folk is a project formed by Ward, Jim James of My Morning Jacket, and Conor Oberst and Mike Mogis of Bright Eyes. The four had been touring and playing together at various points throughout the 2000s and regularly talked of making an album together. The result, the eponymous Monsters of Folk, was released in September 2009. Monsters of Folk received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" with an aggregate score of 80 out of 100 on Metacritic. Prefix's Dave Clark said of the supergroup that \\"The players on Monsters of Folk complement each other extremely well. There is definitely something to be said for group chemistry. These songs don't always shine the way they could, but the album is a great effort.\\" Monsters of Folk was a commercial success, peaking at No. 15 on Billboard's Top 200. = Other artists = He has performed on recordings by Cat Power, Neko Case, Beth Orton (with whom he co-wrote the title track to her album Comfort of Strangers), The Court & Spark, Bright Eyes (with whom he toured on the 2004 Vote for Change tour with R.E.M. and Bruce Springsteen), Jenny Lewis (whose debut solo album Rabbit Fur Coat he co-produced), and My Morning Jacket. In 2005, Ward was ‚Äì along with Aaron Burtch, Jason Lytle and Jim Fairchild from Grandaddy, Scout Niblett, Marie Frank or Jeremy Gara ‚Äì involved in Howe Gelb's project called Arizona Amp and Alternator, which had officially no band members but a lot of guest musicians (M. Ward's voice can be recognized on the track \\"Aaaa(3)\\"). In 2006, he helped produce and contributed a song to the John Fahey tribute album I Am the Resurrection. He also appears on Norah Jones' album Not Too Late, performing backing vocals and guitar on \\"Sinkin' Soon\\", and toured as the opener and a member of her \\"Handsome Band\\" for the album in the spring of 2007. Also his cover of David Bowie's song \\"Let's Dance\\" is featured on the soundtrack of the 2007 New Zealand film Eagle vs Shark. Ward was previously a member of the band Rodriguez with Kyle Field of Little Wings and Mike Funk of Echodrone. Their album Swing Like a Metronome was released in 2000 and produced by Jason Lytle of Grandaddy. In 2013, Ward contributed guitar work to the Neko Case album The Worse Things Get, The Harder I Fight, The Harder I Fight, The More I Love You. Neko noted on her September 2, 2013, appearance on Comedy Bang! Bang! that Ward not only contributed but was \\"paid in full\\".

The sausage then has to mature for seven to ten days in order to develop its typical taste. Teewurst contains 30 to 40 percent fat, which makes it particularly easy to spread.calories Fine R√ºgenwalder Teewurst & Bread Teewurst was invented in Pomerania, probably in the small Baltic town of R√ºgenwalde (now Dar≈Çowo, Poland), in the middle of the 19th century. The name, which means tea sausage, is said to derive from the habit of serving it in sandwiches at teatime. Up to 1945, the sausage industry in R√ºgenwalde was well established, and Teewurst was its best-known product. In 1927, the term R√ºgenwalder Teewurst was declared a Protected designation of origin. After World War II, sausage makers from R√ºgenwalde fled or were expelled to the Federal Republic of Germany, where they established new companies and resumed the production of Teewurst. They established an association of former R√ºgenwald sausage makers, which registered the trademark R√ºgenwalder Teewurst in 1957.BGH GRUR 1995, S. 354 (356) (de) Teewurst was also made in East Germany, but the brand R√ºgenwalder Teewurst was never used there.

Ferguson-Brown produced the Model A Ferguson-Brown tractor incorporating a Ferguson-designed hydraulic three-point linkage hitch. Of the 1,356 produced 400 of the tractors were sold in Scandinavia. The early tractors were fitted with the Coventry Climax model E engine which was a descendant of the American Hercules engine as fitted to the prototype \\"Black tractor\\" later the engine manufacture was taken on by David Brown Ltd. who made a number of improvements such as a deeper sump, some of the earlier tractors suffered from oil starvation on hillside work. It has been narrowed down by surviving examples that the engine change from the Coventry Climax to the David Brown took place around tractors serial numbers 525 to 528. Harry Ferguson surmised that the tractor hitch was the key to having a better plough and designed a simpler tractor attachment for it. Agreement with Ford In 1938 Ferguson made a handshake agreement with Henry Ford to produce Ferguson System Ford-Ferguson tractors using Ferguson's own self-regulating three-point hitch system, beginning with the Ford-Ferguson 9N tractor. This tractor is recognizable by the blue Ford emblem on the front of the hood and the Ferguson System emblem on the grill. The three-point hitch soon became the favourite hitch attachment system among farmers in North America and around the world. This tractor model also included a rear Power Take Off (PTO) shaft that could be used to power three-point hitch mounted implements such as sickle-bar mowers. This PTO location set the standard for future tractor developments. Agreement with Standard In December 1945 Standard Motor Company Limited announced that an arrangement had been made to manufacture Ferguson's tractors. Standard's newly acquired factory at Banner Lane in Coventry would be used for the project. These tractors would be for the Eastern hemisphere, with Ferguson tractors built by Ford in America for the Western hemisphere. Production was expected to start in 1946. Following conversion of the former WW2 aircraft factory. Implements would be sourced and sold separately by Ferguson.\\"Standard Motor Company Record Turnover and Profit, Mr. C. J. Band On Expansion Policy\\", The Times, Friday 21 December 1945; p. 10; Issue 50331 Split with Ford In 1946 the Ford Motor Company parted from Ferguson, following several disagreements and a protracted lawsuit followed, involving Ford's continued use of Ferguson's patents. Ford altered the hydraulic design of its postwar tractors to avoid Ferguson's hydraulic system patent, but continued to produce machines equipped with the basic Ferguson hitch arrangement. The postwar Ford 8N, equipped with Ferguson's three-point hitch, became the top-selling tractor of all time in North America. Ferguson TE20 Ferguson TE20 After the split with Ford, Ferguson took the opportunity to have the Standard Motor Company of the UK produce a new design, the Model TE20. The model name came from Tractor, England but is affectionately known as the Little Grey Fergie. There were several variants of the TE20; the first tractors were designated TE20 Using an imported Continental Z120 engine. In 1948 the TEA20 was introduced with a Standard brand petrol engine, following the introduction of the TED20 which ran on TVO (tractor vapourising oil, similar to paraffin). Later a diesel model was introduced, the TEF20. There were other variants with narrow wheelbases for working in vineyards and orchards, such as the TEB20 and TEC20. Over 500,000 Little Grey Fergies were built between 1946 and 1956, and many survive today. So successful was the TE20 that Ford nicknamed it the \\"Grey Menace\\" as sales of the tractor spread across the world. Some were used on an expedition to the South Pole in 1958 by Sir Edmund Hillary, a testament to the durability of the machine. Ford ultimately settled the legal proceedings with a multimillion- dollar sum that allowed Ferguson to further expand his own manufacturing interests.\\"Settlement in Suit Against Ford Company ¬£3M. Award to Fergusons\\", The Times, Thursday 10 April 1952; p. 6; Issue 52283 There is a monument in Wentworth on the junction of the Darling and Murray Rivers in commemorating the time in 1956 when both rivers flooded and a fleet of Little Grey Fergies was used to build defensive banks to save the town. Ferguson Park Ferguson built a plant in Detroit where the TO20, TO30, and F40 were assembled. He named it Ferguson Park, perhaps because the 8Ns were then being assembled at Highland Park. Massey Ferguson stopped production at this plant in 1984. Part of the plant is currently in use by an auto parts manufacturer. Three-point linkage right The principal feature of the Ferguson System was the three- point linkage. This allowed trailed implements to be supported on a hydraulic system. Two drag links attached under the rear axle with a single compression link connected to the upper rear transmission case automatically regulating the hydraulic suspension's height. This allowed lighter implement to be used, with no attached wheels or separate manual controls. By assisting the tractor to maintain traction from a combined drag and rotary force to the axle, which kept the rear driving wheels on the ground, the front steering wheels had improved contact with the ground. Consequently, the \\"rearing and bucking\\" of overloaded tractors was reduced, making tractors much safer for the operator. *Ferguson design implements File:Tef L quer.jpgBanana loader File:Ferguson TEF mit Banana Loader und Muck Fork.jpgBanana Loader with Muck Fork attachment File:Ferguson post hole auger - 3342.jpgPosthole borer File:Agritechnica 2011-by-RaBoe-21.jpgPlough File:Ferguson potato spinner - Bath 2009.jpgPotato spinner File:Ferguson tractor with milk churns on trailer - geograph.org.uk - 1572406.jpgLifting trailer Other innovations Ferguson's designs, for tractors, were the first with single-wheel brakes that allowed the driver to turn sharply by braking the inside wheel. The TE20 was one of the first tractors to have a four-speed gearbox, with integrated differential, and a hydraulic system. Merger with Massey-Harris In 1953 Ferguson and Massey-Harris merged, and the combined company Massey-Harris- Ferguson (later shortened to Massey Ferguson) became the manufacturer of the tractors and other designs. By then, many manufacturers had developed their own three-point linkages, and the linkage had become standardised worldwide.

Dress reformists were largely middle class women involved in the first wave of feminism in the Western World, from the 1850s through the 1890s. The movement emerged in the Progressive Era along with calls for temperance, women's education, suffrage and moral purity. Dress reform called for emancipation from the \\"dictates of fashion\\", expressed a desire to ‚Äúcover the limbs as well as the torso adequately,‚Äù and promoted \\"rational dress\\".‚ÄúFashion, Emancipation, Reform and the Rational Undergarment‚Äù Deborah Jean Waugh ‚ÄòDress‚Äô Vol 4, 1978\\" The movement had its greatest success in the reform of women's undergarments, which could be modified without exposing the wearer to social ridicule. Dress reformers were also influential in persuading women to adopt simplified garments for athletic activities such as bicycling or swimming. The movement was much less concerned with men's clothing, although it initiated the widespread adoption of knitted wool union suits or long johns. Some proponents of the movement established dress reform parlors, or storefronts, where women could buy sewing patterns for the garments, or buy them directly.  Criticisms of tightlacing  Fashion in the 1850s through 1880s accented large crinolines, cumbersome bustles and padded busts with tiny waists laced into ‚Äòsteam-moulded corsetry‚Äô.Dress and Morality by Aileen Ribeiro, (Homes and Meier Publishers Inc: New York. 1986) p. 134 ‚ÄòTight-lacing‚Äô became part of the corset controversy: dress reformists claimed that the corset was prompted by vanity and foolishness, and harmful to health. The reported health risks included damaged and rearranged internal organs, compromised fertility; weakness and general depletion of health. Those who were pro-corset argued that it was required for stylish dress and had its own unique pleasures. Eventually, the reformers' critique of the corset joined a throng of voices clamoring against tightlacing, which became gradually more common and extreme as the 19th century progressed. Preachers inveighed against tightlacing, doctors counseled patients against it and journalists wrote articles condemning the vanity and frivolity of women who would sacrifice their health for the sake of fashion. Whereas for many corseting was accepted as necessary for beauty, health, and an upright military-style posture, dress reformists viewed tightlacing as vain and, especially at the height of the era of Victorian morality, a sign of moral indecency. American women active in the anti-slavery and temperance movements, with experience in public speaking and political agitation demanded sensible clothing that would not restrict their movement. While support for fashionable dress contested that corsets maintained an upright, ‚Äògood figure‚Äô, as a necessary physical structure for moral and well-ordered society, these dress reformists contested that women‚Äôs fashions were not only physically detrimental, but ‚Äúthe results of male conspiracy to make women subservient by cultivating them in slave psychology.‚Äù‚ÄúWomen's Clothes and Women's Right,‚Äù Robert E. Riegel, American Quarterly, 15 (1963): 390 They believed a change in fashions could change the whole position of women, allowing for greater social mobility, independence from men and marriage, the ability to work for wages, as well as physical movement and comfort.‚ÄúWomen's Clothes and Women's Right,‚Äù Robert E. Riegel, American Quarterly, 15 (1963): 391 Despite these protests, little changed in restrictive fashion and undergarments by 1900. The Edwardian Era featured a decadence of fashion following the ideal shape of the Gibson Girl, a corseted, big-bosomed ideal of femininity and sophistication.‚ÄúWomen's Clothes and Women's Right,‚Äù Robert E. Riegel, American Quarterly, 15 (1963): 400 Corset styles had altered slightly from the shorter-waisted, bustled 1880s vogue, but they still constricted the waist, forced the hips back with a pointed front waistline, thrust the bosom forward and curved the back into an exaggerated ‚ÄòS‚Äô shape. Skirts weighed from the hips, high collars chafed the neck, and the whole costume prevented natural movement, harmed internal organs and threatened childbearing potential. Invariably, the ideal image of feminine attractiveness that a Victorian woman saw around her (in fashion plates, advertisements, etc.) was of a wasp-waisted, firmly-corseted lady. In the 19th century, poor women were known to wear corsets \\"boned\\" with rope, rather than steel or bone, to facilitate work in the field.  \\"Emancipation waists\\" and undergarment reform  An attempt at dress reform in 1891, but keeping a fashionable silhouette. in her (not fashionable) reform corset from about 1892. It was in fashion from 1900 to 1913, but only after many years of hard work. ‚ÄòThe Emancipation Waist.‚Äô Excerpt from ‚ÄòCatalog of Dress Reform and Other Sanitary Under-Garments For Ladies and Children‚Äô George Frost and Co., Boston Mass June 1, 1876. Dress reformers promoted the emancipation waist, or liberty bodice, as a replacement for the corset. The emancipation bodice was a tight sleeveless vest, buttoning up the front, with rows of buttons along the bottom to which could be attached petticoats and a skirt. The entire torso would support the weight of the petticoats and skirt, not just the waist (since the undesirability of hanging the entire weight of full skirts and petticoats from a constricted waist‚Äîrather than hanging the garments from the shoulders‚Äîwas another point often discussed by dress reformers). The bodices had to be fitted by a dressmaker; patterns could be ordered through the mail. Physician Alice Bunker Stockham railed against the corset and said of the pregnancy corset, \\"The Best pregnancy corset is no corset at all.\\"Alice Bunker Stockham. Tokology 1898. The \\"emancipation union under flannel\\" was first sold in America in 1868. It combined a waist (shirt) and drawers (leggings) in the form we now know as the union suit. While first designed for women, the union suit was also adopted by men. Indeed, it is still sold and worn today, by both men and women, as winter underclothing In 1878, a German professor named Gustav Jaeger published a book claiming that only clothing made of animal hair, such as wool, promoted health. A British accountant named Lewis Tomalin translated the book, then opened a shop selling Dr Jaeger's Sanitary Woollen System, including knitted wool union suits. These were soon called \\"Jaegers\\"; they were widely popular. It is not clear how many women, in either the Americas or on the Continent, wore these so-called \\"reform\\" bodices. However, contemporary portrait photography, fashion literature, and surviving examples of the undergarments themselves, all suggest that the corset was almost universal as daily wear by women and young ladies (and numerous fashionable men) throughout much of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Bloomer suit  Bloomer Suit The most famous product of the dress reform era is the bloomer suit. In 1851, a New England temperance activist named Elizabeth Smith Miller (Libby Miller) adopted what she considered a more rational costume: loose trousers gathered at the ankles, like the trousers worn by Middle Eastern and Central Asian women, topped by a short dress or skirt and vest (waistcoat). She displayed her new clothing to temperance activist and suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who found it sensible and becoming, and adopted it immediately. In this garb, she visited yet another activist, Amelia Bloomer, the editor of the temperance magazine The Lily. Bloomer not only wore the costume, she promoted it enthusiastically in her magazine. More women wore the fashion and were promptly dubbed \\"Bloomers\\". A dress reform was supported by a campaign of the National Dress Reform Association, which was founded in 1856.Cunningham, Patricia A (2003).

Riegel, American Quarterly, 15 (1963):393 Amelia Bloomer herself dropped the fashion in 1859, saying that a new invention, the crinoline, was a sufficient reform that she could return to conventional dress. The bloomer costume died‚Äîtemporarily. It was to return much later (in a different form), as a women's athletic costume in the 1890s and early 1900s.  Aesthetic Dress movement  In the 1870s, a largely English movement led by Mary Eliza Haweis sought dress reform to enhance and celebrate the natural shape of the body, preferring the looser lines of the medieval and renaissance eras. A historic nostalgia for more forgiving fashions, the aesthetic dress movement critiqued fashionable dress for its immovable shapes, and sought the ‚Äòfashioning and adorning of a robe‚Äô as tastefully complementary to the natural body.Dress and Morality by Aileen Ribeiro, (Homes and Meier Publishers Inc: New York. 1986): 139 The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and other artistic reformers objected to the elaborately trimmed confections of Victorian fashion with their unnatural silhouette based on a rigid corset and hoops as both ugly and dishonest. Some women associated with the movement adopted a revival style based on romanticised medieval influences such as puffed juliette sleeves and trailing skirts. These styles were made in the soft colors of vegetable dyes, ornamented with hand embroidery in the art needlework style, featured silks, oriental designs, muted colors, natural and frizzed hair and lacked definitive waist emphasis.The Visual History of Costume. Aileen Ribeiro and Valerie Cumming, (Costume & Fashion Press, New York, 1989):188 The style spread as an \\"anti-fashion\\" called Artistic dress in the 1860s in literary and artistic circles, died back in the 1870s, and reemerged as Aesthetic dress in the 1880s, where two of the main proponents were the writer Oscar Wilde and his wife Constance, both of whom gave lectures on the subject. In 1881 The Rational Dress Society was founded in London. The Society advocated divided skirts as a more practical form of clothing, but its President and co-founder, Lady Florence Harberton, went further - when cycling, she wore full ‚ÄòRational‚Äô dress, which was a shorter skirt worn over voluminous trousers. The rational dress movement by country The dress reform movement spread from the United States and Great Britain to the Nordic countries in the 1880s and from Germany to Austria and the Netherlands. The issue was internationally addressed at the International Congress for Women's Work and Women's Endeavors in Berlin 1896, in which Germany, America, Belgium, Denmark, England, Finland, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland and Hungary participated. =Denmark= In Denmark, the bloomer costume was adopted for girl's sports wear during ice skating already in the 1860s. While there were no separate dress reform societies founded in Denmark, the women's rights society Dansk Kvindesamfund actively addressed the issue under the influence of the Swedish Dress Reform Society in the 1880s; they published their own brochure, Om Sundheden og Kyindedraegten by J. Frisch, collaborated with Stockholm and Oslo with the design of reform costumes and the exposition of them, notably during the Nordic Exhibition of 1888.Hazelius- Berg, Gunnel, Dr√§ktreformer under 1800-talet, Fataburen Nordiska Museets och Skansens √•rsbok 1949 s. 127‚Äì156 =Finland= While there were no separate dress reform societies founded in Finland, the women's rights society Suomen Naisyhdistys actively addressed the issue under the influence of the Swedish Dress Reform Society in the 1880s; they held lectures in many Finnish cities, managed to have the reform costume accepted as sports wear in the girl's schools of the capital by 1887, and was awarded the grand silver medal for their reform costume for school girls in the exhibition of the Russian Hygienic Society in Saint Petersburg in 1893. =France= There were no separate dress reform societies founded in France. While the issue was adopted and discussed by several of the excisting French women's rights organisations, the issue was not given priority and it was not until the great enthusiasm for bicycling in France in the 1890s that women in general adopted the bloomer costume with throuses and no corsets as sports wear. In the early 20th- century, however, the French fashion industry was finally influenced by the reform dress movement, which abolished the corset by the 1910s. =Germany= Germany was a leading country of the dress reform in the 19th-century, as it was an integrated part of the great health reform movement Lebensreform, which spoke for a health reform in clothing for both women and men supported by medical professionals and scientists such as Gustav Jaeger and Heinrich Lahmann, and freedom from the corset and throusers for women was advocated already on. The women's movement, however, did not engage in the issue until after the International Congress for Women's Work and Women's Endeavors in Berlin 1896, and the following year the German dress reform society, Allgemeine Verein f√ºr Verbesserung der Frauenkleidung, was founded. As their equivalents in Austria, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries, the German dress reform society, focused on a reform of women's underwear ad the most realistic goal, mainly focused on the use of corsets. The German movement managed to affect public oppinion to such a degree that one of its leading figures, Minna Cauer, was able to report in 1907 that the German corset industry experienced hardships because of a sinking use of corsets. =The Netherlands= In the Netherlands, interest for the issue was aroused after the foundation of a dress reform society in neighboring Germany, and in 1899 the Dutch dress reform society Veereeniging voor Verbetering van Vrouwenkleeding (V.v.V.V.v.). The dress reform society held lectures, participated in exhibitions and worked with designed to produce a new fashion for women which could be not only attractive but also comfortable and healthy at the same time. =Norway= While there were no separate dress reform societies founded in Norway, the women's rights society Norsk Kvinnesaksforening actively addressed the issue under the influence of the Swedish Dress Reform Society from the 1880s; they collaborated with Stockholm and Copenhagen with the design of reform costumes and the exposition of them, notably during the Nordic Exhibition of 1888. Norway is in fact described as one of the countries were the interest and success for the issue was greatest. The physician Lorentz Dietrichson, a prominent participant for the abolition of the corset in the corset controversy in both Sweden and Norway, held a lecture in Norway in favor of dress reform already in 1886, as a commentary of the Swedish dress reform movement in which he himself also participated; the Swedish dress reform society successfully exhibited their reform dress in Oslo, the Norsk Kvinnesaksforening became interested, and the movement thereby started in Norway the same year as in Sweden. Johanne Bi√∂rn held lectures in the Oslo schools, and the Norwegian designer Kristine Dahl experienced success not only in her home country of Norway but also in Sweden, becoming a central figure of the dress reform movement. =Sweden= Sweden was a leading nation of the dress reform movement, as the movement came first to Sweden of all the Nordic countries and spread from there to Denmark, Finland and Norway. In 1885, professor Curt Wallis brought with him the English language dress reform book Dress and Health from abroad, which was translated to Swedish by Oscara von Sydow as Reformdr√§gten: En bok f√∂r qvinnor skrifven af qvinnor. After a speech by Anne Charlotte Leffler held at the women's club Nya Idun, the Friends of Handicraft gave Hanna Winge the assignment to design a reform costume, which was produced by Augusta Lundin and exhibited in public, which gave further publicity to the issue, and in 1886, the Swedish Dress Reform Society was founded.Bagerius, Henric..

OCLC 1112090542 After an initial attempt to launch a reform costume, the Swedish dress reform movement focused on a reform of women's underwear, particularly the corset. The Swedish reform dress movement corresponded with their equivalent in Great Britain as well as the American dress reform movement of Annie Jenness Miller. The dress reform movement did achieve some success in Sweden; by the 1890s, corsets were no longer accepted for the pupils of the Swedish girls' schools, and the leading Swedish fashion designer Augusta Lundin reported that her clients no longer subjected themselves to tight lacing. Eventual shifts in fashion Although the Victorian dress reform movement itself failed to enact widespread change in women‚Äôs fashion, social, political and cultural shifts into the 1920s brought forth an organic relaxation of dress standards.‚ÄúWomen's Clothes and Women's Right,‚Äù Robert E.

He wrote experimental novels, and distinctive verse novels, one of which was an epic called Pantaloon, a work in several volumes, only some of which are published. He also wrote memoirs of the 1930s, and reviews and literary criticism, the latter mainly via his employment with The Observer newspaper. Life He was born in Oxford; his father was the historian Arnold J. Toynbee, and his maternal grandfather was Gilbert Murray. He was educated at Rugby School, where he became rebellious, reacting against the public school system. Inspired by the example of Esmond Romilly, later a friend, he ran away, returned shortly and was expelled.<Boadilla by Esmond Romilly, The Clapton Press, London, 2018 He later wrote a memoir of Romilly, and Jasper Ridley (1913‚Äì1944), entitled Friends Apart. Through Romilly, Toynbee met Jessica Mitford, who became a close friend after Esmond died in WWII. He was also influenced by bookshop owner and would-be encourager of the young radical element, David Archer, whom he met through David Gascoyne. At Christ Church, Oxford in the late 1930s he became the first communist president of the Oxford Union, at the height of communism's apparent success and social acceptability. He visited Spain at the end of 1936, at the start of the Spanish Civil War, in a student delegation. He was said to have been beaten up by Mosley's Blackshirts at a fascist meeting.Pakenham, Frank.Born to Believe. Cape, 1953, p.83 In 1938‚Äì39 he edited the Birmingham Town Crier. He married twice: in 1939, to Anne Powell and in 1950, Sally Smith. In the early 1940s Philip and Anne lived a bohemian life in London's Fitzrovia, and Philip was drinking heavily. At that time they knew Lucian Freud, Donald Maclean and Robert Kee, Henrietta Moraes and others from David Tennant's Gargoyle Club in Soho. Toynbee was later to be found, with Benedict Nicolson, in the Wednesday Club consisting of raffish male writers, artists and journalists.Claire Harman \\"BOOK REVIEW: Ten years of lunching: 'In the Fifties' by Peter Vansittart\\", Independent on Sunday, 18 June 1995 In 1945 they moved to the Isle of Wight, for a fresh start. They had two children, the second being Mary Louisa, better known as the journalist Polly Toynbee. Anne later married Richard Wollheim shortly after divorcing Philip in 1950.Emma Tennant Obituary: Anne Wollheim, The Guardian, 27 November 2004 As a foreign correspondent with The Observer, Philip then traveled to Tel Aviv, where he met Sally, who was a secretary for the American Embassy there. During the 1950s he continued to work for The Observer, and was one of the more prominent intellectual figures in British life (perhaps to be compared with Edmund Wilson in the United States, for example). In an article written for The Observer in 1961, he notoriously proclaimed the irrelevancy of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord Of The Rings, just prior to its paperback publication in America and subsequent cultural phenomenon: > \\"There was a time when the Hobbit fantasies of Professor Tolkien were being > taken very seriously indeed by a great many distinguished literary figures. > Mr. Auden is even reported to have claimed that these books were as good as > War and Peace; Edwin Muir and many others were almost equally enthusiastic. > I had a sense that one side or the other must be mad, for it seemed to me > that these books were dull, ill-written, whimsical and childish. And for me > this had a reassuring outcome, for most of his more ardent supporters were > soon beginning to sell out their shares in Professor Tolkien, and today > those books have passed into a merciful oblivion.\\"Fuller, Edmund. The Lord > Of The Hobbits: J.R.R. Tolkien, originally printed in Books With Men Behind > Them (Fuller, Random House, 1962), and reprinted in Tolkien And The Critics: > Essays on J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord Of The Rings (ed. Neil D. Isaacs and > Rose A. Zimbardo, Notre Dame Press, 1968). In the early to mid-1970s, Toynbee underwent a personal crisis, slowly entering into a period of deep depression. He had become increasingly concerned about ecological matters and this, along with his own ideological temperament, took him into the controversial decision to initiate a self- sufficient farming community. His family and friends thought this decision to be close to insane, considering as they did his privacy and routine-loving nature. The community quickly became a commune when Toynbee, Sally and their youngest daughter moved out, into a large cottage nearby. Nonetheless Toynbee and Sally continued to have a great deal of contact with the communards, and along with both spouses' active alcoholism, it frequently caused considerable tension in their marriage. Toynbee's depression was sometimes immobilising and prevented him from enjoying his day-to-day life and work, and the regularity of his book reviews was sometimes interrupted as he struggled with the depression and the treatment he insisted on receiving for it ‚Äì against the advice of his GP and consultant ‚Äì namely, ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy). He finally got the go-ahead for the treatment, which he received in Bristol in the summer of 1977. The two books which followed the ECT consisted of the journal writings which Toynbee decided to edit and send off for publication. These largely revolved around his search for some kind of spiritual meaning. It could be said that this arose out of his wish to find some purpose for the deep misery of his worst depression. He was strongly urged to stop drinking alcohol and occasionally managed short periods of abstinence. Yet he never really wanted long-term abstinence enough to make any real success of this. He was as a whole capable of great self-discipline, but needed to want his objectives with intense singular-mindedness in order to achieve them. The two journal books were entitled Part of a Journey (covering 1977 to 1979) and End of a Journey (1979 to 1981). They were generally well received. For many readers, his best writing style shone throughout those pages, with its ready humility and gentle self-mockery. He died at his home in St Briavels, Gloucestershire, with most of his family (he had five children altogether) at his bedside.

Ed. Giroux, Henry and David Purpel. Berkeley, California: McCutchan Publishing Corporation, 198 100-121. Any learning experience may include unneeded lessons. Hidden curriculum often refers to knowledge gained in primary and secondary school settings, usually with a negative connotation where the school strives for equal intellectual development (as a positive aim).Cornbleth, Catherine. \\"Beyond Hidden Curriculum?\\" Journal of Curriculum Studies. 16.1(1984): 29-36. In this sense, a hidden curriculum reinforces existing social inequalities by educating students according to their class and social status. The unequal distribution of cultural capital in a society mirrors a corresponding distribution of knowledge among its students.Apple, Michael and Nancy King. \\"What Do Schools Teach?\\" The Hidden Curriculum and Moral Education. Ed. Giroux, Henry and David Purpel. Berkeley, California: McCutchan Publishing Corporation, 1983. 82-99. It should be mentioned that the breaktime is an important part of the hidden curriculum.Cf. Kaggelaris, N. - Koutsioumari, M. I. (2015), \\"The breaktime as part of the hidden curriculum in Public High School\\", Pedagogy theory & praxis 8 (2015): 76-87 .  Educational history  Early workers in the field of education were influenced by the notion that the preservation of the social privileges, interests, and knowledge of one group within the population was worth the exploitation of less powerful groups. Over time this theory has become less blatant, yet its underlying tones remain a contributing factor to the issue of the hidden curriculum. Several educational theories have been developed to help give meaning and structure to the hidden curriculum and to illustrate the role that schools play in socialization. Three of these theories, as cited by Henry Giroux and Anthony Penna, are a structural-functional view of schooling, a phenomenological view related to the \\"new\\" sociology of education, and a radical critical view corresponding to the neo-Marxist analysis of the theory and practice of education. The structural-functional view focuses on how norms and values are conveyed within schools and how their necessities for the functioning of society become indisputably accepted. The phenomenological view suggests that meaning is created through situational encounters and interactions, and it implies that knowledge is somewhat objective. The radical critical view recognizes the relationship between economic and cultural reproduction and stresses the relationships among the theory, ideology, and social practice of learning. Although the first two theories have contributed to the analysis of the hidden curriculum, the radical critical view of schooling provides the most insight. Most importantly it acknowledges the perpetuated economic and social aspects of education that are clearly illustrated by the hidden curriculum. Aspects Various aspects of learning contribute to the success of the hidden curriculum, including practices, procedures, rules, relationships, and structures. Many school-specific sources, some of which may be included in these aspects of learning, give rise to important elements of the hidden curriculum. These sources may include, but are not limited to, the social structures of the classroom, the teacher's exercise of authority, rules governing the relationship between teachers and students, standard learning activities, the teacher's use of language, textbooks, audio-visual aids, furnishings, architecture, disciplinary measures, timetables, tracking systems, and curricular priorities. Variations among these sources promote the disparities found when comparing the hidden curricula corresponding to various class and social statuses. \\"Every school is both an expression of a political situation and a teacher of politics.\\" While the actual material that students absorb through the hidden curriculum is of utmost importance, the personnel who convey it elicit special investigation. This particularly applies to the social and moral lessons conveyed by the hidden curriculum, for the moral characteristics and ideologies of teachers and other authority figures are translated into their lessons, albeit not necessarily with intention.Kohlberg, Lawrence. \\"The Moral Atmosphere of the School.\\" The Hidden Curriculum and Moral Education. Ed. Giroux, Henry and David Purpel. Berkeley, California: McCutchan Publishing Corporation, 1983. 61-81. Yet these unintended learning experiences can result from interactions with not only instructors, but also with peers. Like interactions with authority figures, interactions amongst peers can promote moral and social ideals but also foster the exchange of information and are thus important sources of knowledge contributing to the success of the hidden curriculum. = Heteronormativity = According to Merfat Ayesh Alsubaie, the hidden curriculum of heteronormativity is the erasure of LGBT identities in the curriculum through the privileging of heterosexual identities. In a quote from Gust Yep, heteronormativity is the \\"presumption and assumption that all human experience is unquestionably and automatically heterosexual\\". Laws such as \\"No Promo Homo\\" that prohibit the mention of or teaching about LGBT identities are considered to work to reinforce the hidden curriculum of heteronormativity. In addition to No Promo Homo laws, currently over half of the states in the U.S. are not legally mandated to have any sexual education. According to Mary Preston, the lack of sexual education in schools removes LGBT identities from the explicit curriculum, and contributes to the hidden curriculum of heteronormativity. When students fall outside the heterosexual norm in schools, some students and teachers have been shown to police students back in line with heteronormative expectations. C. J. Pascoe said policing takes place through the use of bullying behaviors such as the use of words such as \\"fag, queer, or dyke\\" which are used to shame students with identities outside the norm. Pascoe said the use of LGBT slurs forms a \\"Fag Discourse.\\" The \\"Fag Discourse\\" in schools upholds heteronormativity as sacred, works to silence LGBT voices and places LGBT identities to the hidden curriculum. = Autism = The term \\"hidden curriculum\\" also refers to the set of social norms and skills that autistic people have to learn explicitly, but that neurotypical people learn automatically.  Function  Although the hidden curriculum conveys a great deal of knowledge to its students, the inequality promoted through its disparities among classes and social statuses often invokes a negative connotation. For example, Pierre Bourdieu asserts that education-related capital must be accessible to promote academic achievement. The effectiveness of schools becomes limited when these forms of capital are unequally distributed.Gordon, Edmumd W., Beatrice L. Bridglall, and Aundra Saa Meroe. Preface. Supplemental Education: The Hidden Curriculum of High Academic Achievement. By Gordon, Edmumd W., Beatrice L. Bridglall, and Aundra Saa Meroe. Lanham, Maryland: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2005. ix-x. Since the hidden curriculum is considered to be a form of education-related capital, it promotes this ineffectiveness of schools as a result of its unequal distribution. As a means of social control, the hidden curriculum promotes the acceptance of a social destiny without promoting rational and reflective consideration.Greene, Maxine. Introduction. The Hidden Curriculum and Moral Education. By Giroux, Henry and David Purpel. Berkeley, California: McCutchan Publishing Corporation, 1983. 1-5. According to Elizabeth Vallance, the functions of hidden curriculum include \\"the inculcation of values, political socialization, training in obedience and docility, the perpetuation of traditional class structure-functions that may be characterized generally as social control.\\"Vallance, Elizabeth. \\"Hiding the Hidden Curriculum: An Interpretation of the Language of Justification in Nineteenth-Century Educational Reform.\\" The Hidden Curriculum and Moral Education. Ed. Giroux, Henry and David Purpel. Berkeley, California: McCutchan Publishing Corporation, 1983. 9-27. Hidden curriculum can also be associated with the reinforcement of social inequality, as evidenced by the development of different relationships to capital based on the types of work and work-related activities assigned to students varying by social class.Anyon, Jean. \\"Social Class and the Hidden Curriculum of Work.\\" The Hidden Curriculum and Moral Education. Ed. Giroux, Henry and David Purpel. Berkeley, California: McCutchan Publishing Corporation, 1983. 143-167. Although the hidden curriculum has negative connotations, it is not inherently negative, and the tacit factors that are involved can potentially exert a positive developmental force on students. Some educational approaches, such as democratic education, actively seek to minimize, make explicit, and/ or reorient the hidden curriculum in such a way that it has a positive developmental impact on students. Similarly, in the fields of environmental education and education for sustainable development, there has been some advocacy for making school environments more natural and sustainable, such that the tacit developmental forces that these physical factors exert on students can become positive factors in their development as environmental citizens.  Higher education and tracking  While studies on the hidden curriculum mostly focus on fundamental primary and secondary education, higher education also feels the effects of this latent knowledge. For example, gender biases become present in specific fields of study; the quality of and experiences associated with prior education become more significant; and class, gender, and race become more evident at higher levels of education.Margolis, Eric, Michael Soldatenko, Sandra Acker, and Marina Gair. \\"Peekaboo: Hiding and Outing the Curriculum.\\" The Hidden Curriculum in Higher Education. Ed. Margolis, Eric. New York: Routledge, 2001. One additional aspect of hidden curriculum that plays a major part in the development of students and their fates is tracking. This method of imposing educational and career paths upon students at young ages relies on various factors such as class and status to reinforce socioeconomic differences. Children tend to be placed on tracks guiding them towards socioeconomic occupations similar to that of their parents, without real considerations for their strengths and weaknesses. As students advance through the educational system, they follow along their tracks by completing the predetermined courses.Rosenbaum, James E. The Hidden Curriculum of High School Tracking. New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1976. For example, this is one of the main factors limiting social mobility in America today.  Literary references  John Dewey explored the hidden curriculum of education in his early 20th century works, particularly his classic, Democracy and Education. Dewey saw patterns evolving and trends developing in public schools which lent themselves to his pro-democratic perspectives. His work was quickly rebutted by educational theorist George Counts, whose 1929 book, Dare the School Build a New Social Order? challenged the presumptive nature of Dewey's works. Counts claimed that Dewey hypothesized a singular path through which all young people travelled in order to become adults, but Counts emphasized the reactive, adaptive, and multifaceted nature of learning. This nature caused many educators to slant their perspectives, practices, and assessments of student performance in particular directions which affected their students drastically. Counts' examinations were expanded on by Charles A. Beard, and later, Myles Horton as he created what became the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee. The phrase \\"hidden curriculum\\" was reportedly coined by Philip W. Jackson (Life In Classrooms, 1968). He argued that we need to understand \\"education\\" as a socialization process. Shortly after Jackson's coinage, MIT's Benson Snyder published The Hidden Curriculum, which addresses the question of why students --even or especially the most gifted--turn away from education. Snyder advocates the thesis that much of campus conflict and students' personal anxiety is caused by a mass of unstated academic and social norms, which thwart the students' ability to develop independently or think creatively. The hidden curriculum has been further explored by a number of educators. Starting with Pedagogy of the Oppressed, published in 1972, through the late 1990s, Brazilian educator Paulo Freire explored various effects of presumptive teaching on students, schools, and society as a whole. Freire's explorations were in sync with those of John Holt and Ivan Illich, each of whom were quickly identified as radical educators. Other theorists who have identified the insidious nature of hidden curricula and hidden agendas include Neil Postman, Paul Goodman, Joel Spring, John Taylor Gatto, and others. More recent definitions were given by Roland Meighan (\\"A Sociology of Education\\", 1981): > The hidden curriculum is taught by the school, not by any > teacher...something is coming across to the pupils which may never be spoken > in the English lesson or prayed about in assembly. They are picking-up an > approach to living and an attitude to learning. and Michael Haralambos (\\"Sociology: Themes and Perspectives\\", 1991): > The hidden curriculum consists of those things pupils learn through the > experience of attending school rather than the stated educational objectives > of such institutions. Educational critics Henry Giroux, bell hooks, and Jonathan Kozol also have examined the effects of hidden curriculum. Developmental psychologist Robert Kegan addressed the hidden curriculum of everyday life in his 1994 book In Over Our Heads, which focused on the relation between cognitive development and the \\"cognitive demands\\" of cultural expectations. Professor of communication Joseph Turow, in his 2017 book The Aisles Have Eyes, used the concept to describe acculturation to massive personal data collection; he wrote: > The very activities that dismay privacy and anti-discrimination advocates > are already beginning to become everyday habits in American lives, and part > of Americans' cultural routines. Retailing is at the leading edge of a new > hidden curriculum for American society‚Äîteaching people what they have to > give up in order to get along in the twenty-first century.

Shaffer set up the side-project band Fear and the Nervous System in 2008 and is also the founder of Emotional Syphon Recordings, who have signed acts like Monster in the Machine and Droid. Shaffer was ranked at No. 26 of Guitar World's 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time. Shaffer's work with Korn has resulted in over 35 million albums sold. Musical career Shaffer first took up guitar as part of rehabilitation when he severed the tip of one of his fingers on the chain of his dirt bike. He has since performed with several bands. =Korn (1993‚Äìpresent)= On February 22, 2005, Brian \\"Head\\" Welch left the band. Shaffer accepted his friend's choice and the two remained on good terms. When drummer David Silveria left the band, Munky said in an interview that he had a strong friendship with him and was very sad to hear that he had to leave. On an interview about Welch's departure, Shaffer said he felt pressure, because they were always working together, writing songs, and creating albums. But when Welch left, he had to write all the guitar parts into one part, so Korn could play live, and he continued to play like that until Korn got a backing guitarist. Welch officially returned to the band on May 2, 2013 to work on the album The Paradigm Shift that was released in October 2013. =Fear and the Nervous System (2008‚Äìpresent)= On March 4, 2008, it was announced that Shaffer would be releasing a solo record on August 8, 2008 with his solo band Fear and The Nervous System which would feature Munky doing vocals and guitars, Brooks Wackerman of Bad Religion (who also performed on Korn's 8th album) on drums, Leopold Ross on guitars and programming, Bill Gould of Faith No More fame, and Zac Baird (Korn's keyboardist) on keyboards and programming. The record would be produced by Munky and Ross Robinson. Guitarist and friend Wes Borland originally recorded guitars for two songs on the album but they would not make the final cut. Borland also created cover art which would still be used on the album. The band's debut album was originally due out August 8, 2008 but was pushed back multiple times until its release in 2011. On Modlife in October, 2009 (Korn.com), Shaffer explained that he would not be doing vocals on the Fear and the Nervous System album because he is not \\"very good at singing.\\" It was later announced that Steve Krolikowski of Repeater would be handling vocal duties. =Emotional Syphon Recordings (2006‚Äìpresent)= In 2006, Shaffer founded Emotional Syphon Records to give daring and diverse bands a chance to be heard. The first bands to be signed were Droid and Monster In The Machine, however Shaffer says he does not want to limit himself to only releasing metal acts but to create a multi-genre label. Personal life On January 15, 2000, Shaffer married Stephanie Roush. Together, they had a daughter, Carmella Star Shaffer (born on June 23, 2001). In 2004, Shaffer and Roush got divorced. Shaffer then started to date the Albanian American actress and model, Evis Xheneti in 2005. They were married on January 2, 2012, in Paris, France. They have three children together: D'Angelo DraXon Shaffer (born on November 7, 2012), Rocky Rebel Shaffer (born on August 20, 2015), and Heart Hera Shaffer (Born on August 7, 2019).

Each house is directly elected by the people of New South Wales at elections held approximately every four years. The Parliament derives its authority from the Queen of Australia, Queen Elizabeth II, represented by the Governor of New South Wales, who chairs the Executive Council of New South Wales. The parliament shares law making powers with the Australian Federal (or Commonwealth) Parliament. The New South Wales Parliament follows the Westminster parliamentary traditions of dress, Green‚ÄìRed chamber colours and protocol. It is located in Parliament House on Macquarie Street, Sydney. History The Parliament of New South Wales was the first of the Australian colonial legislatures being formed from the 1850s. At the time New South Wales was a British colony under the control of the Governor. A small, appointed Legislative Council began meeting in 1824 to advise the Governor on legislative matters. By 1843, this had been enlarged with two-thirds of its members elected by adult males who met certain property requirements. In 1856, under a new Constitution, the Parliament became bicameral with a fully elected Legislative Assembly and an appointed Legislative Council with a Government taking over most of the legislative powers of the Governor. The right to vote was extended in 1858 to all males over 21 years of age. In 1850 the Australian Colonies Government Act was passed by the Imperial Parliament, which expanded the New South Wales Legislative Council so that by 1851 there were 54 members ‚Äì again, with two-thirds elected. In 1853, a select committee chaired by William Wentworth began drawing up a Constitution for responsible self- government in the colony. The committee's proposed Constitution was placed before the Legislative Council in August that year and, for the most part, accepted. The Constitution, with an upper house whose members were appointed for life, was sent to the Imperial Parliament and was passed into law on 16 July 1855. The new Parliament of New South Wales was to be a bicameral legislature, similar to that of the United Kingdom. On 22 May 1856, the newly constituted New South Wales Parliament opened and sat for the first time. With the new 54-member Legislative Assembly taking over the council chamber, a second meeting chamber for the 21 member upper house had to be added to the Parliament building in Macquarie Street. In 1859 Queensland was made a colony separate from New South Wales. The Legislative Assembly was reduced from 80 to 72 members by the loss of the Queensland seats. In 1901, New South Wales became a state of the Commonwealth of Australia and many government functions were transferred to the new Commonwealth government. The current Constitution of New South Wales was adopted in 1902: the Constitution Act 1902 (NSW). Women gained the right to vote in Commonwealth elections in April 1902 and in New South Wales state elections in August 1902. In 1918, reforms permitted women to be Members of Parliament, although no woman was elected until 1925 when Millicent Preston-Stanley was elected to represent Eastern Suburbs. That same year, a proportional representation system was introduced for the Legislative Assembly with multiple representatives from each electorate; this system lasted until it was abolished in 1926. Women were not able to be appointed to the Legislative Council until 1926; Premier John Storey attempted to appoint Kate Dwyer to the Legislative Council in 1921, but the appointment was ruled out of order. The first two women appointed to the Legislative Council were both ALP members proposed on 23 November 1931: Catherine Green, who took her seat the following day, and Ellen Webster, who joined her two days later. In 1925, 1926 and 1929, Premier Jack Lang made attempts at abolishing the Legislative Council, following the example of the Queensland Legislative Council in 1922, but all were unsuccessful. The debate did, however, result in another round of reforms, and in 1933, the law was changed so that a quarter of the Legislative Council was elected every three years by members of the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council, rather than being appointed by the Governor. In 1962 Indigenous Australians gained the right to vote in all state elections. In 1978, the Council became a directly elected body in a program of electoral reform introduced by the Wran Labor government. The number of members was reduced to 45, although transitional arrangements meant that there were 43 members from 1978 to 1981, and 44 from 1981 to 1984. Further reform in 1991 by the Greiner Liberal-National government saw the size of the Legislative Council cut to 42 members, with half being elected every 4 years. In 1991, the Legislative Assembly was reduced from 109 to 99 Members and then to 93 members in 1999. =Parliament House= The Parliament building was originally built on the orders of Governor Lachlan Macquarie to be Sydney's second major hospital because, when he arrived in Sydney, he recognised the need for a new hospital. In 1810, he awarded the contract to Garnham Blaxcell, Alexander Riley and Dr. D'Arcy Wentworth. The contract gave the builders the right to import 45,000 gallons of rum, for which they paid a duty of 3 shillings a gallon. They were able to sell it for a huge profit and in turn the government refunded them the duty as a payment for their work, thereby gaining for their construction the title of the 'Rum Hospital'. Originally consisting of three buildings, the central main building was demolished in 1879 to make way for the new Sydney Hospital, which was completed in 1885. The first building, now known as the Sydney Mint, was given to the Royal Mint in 1851 to become the Australian branch of its operations; it remained a mint until 1927.Geoff Stuart, Secrets in Stone - Discover the History of Sydney (Brandname Properties Pty Ltd, 1993) pp 91-93, The second building, originally built as the Chief Surgeon's quarters, was given to the government in 1829 for the purposes of a Parliament chamber and is now known as Parliament House. This chamber was added to following the growth of the legislature in 1843, and again in 1856. The last major renovation to the building was from 1974 to 1985, which demolished the jumble of buildings that had become the parliamentary chambers and replaced them with a 12-story block linked by a fountain court to the original Parliament House restored to its 1908 appearance. Composition and powers First meeting of the NSW Legislative Council in Parliament House, 1843 (chamber now the Legislative Assembly). The legislative authority, the Crown-in-Parliament, has three separate elements: the Queen, represented by the Governor; the Legislative Assembly; and the Legislative Council. No individual may simultaneously be a member of both Houses. All 93 members of the Legislative Assembly are elected at each general election from single-member districts using optional preferential voting to terms of up to four years. The 42 Legislative Council members are elected for two terms (a maximum of eight years), with half elected at each general election. Elections for the Legislative Council are conducted on a statewide, at-large basis (meaning all members represent the entire state) using the single transferable vote system similar to that used for elections to the federal Senate. In the running of Parliament, the two presiding officers have a role that is similar to Ministers and their departments. The Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and the President of the Legislative Council are responsible for the employing of staff. In consultation with the parliamentary clerks, the presiding officers determine policy for the operation of their respective chambers and jointly for the Parliament. Royal Assent of the Queen is required for all bills to become law. The Crown also has executive powers which do not depend on Parliament, through prerogative powers, which include among others the ability to dissolve Parliament, make treaties, award honours, appoint officers and civil servants, and appoint and dismiss the Premier. In practice these are always exercised by the Governor on the advice of the Premier of New South Wales and the other ministers of HM Government. The Premier and Government are directly accountable to Parliament through its control of public finances and the need for its confidence, and to the public through Members of Parliament. The Governor chooses the Premier, usually depending on the results of the general election, who then forms a government from members of the houses of Parliament. This must be someone who can command the confidence of a majority in the Legislative Assembly. This is usually a straightforward decision, though occasionally the Governor has to make a judgment, as in August 1939 when the Governor, Lord Wakehurst, handled a major political crisis brought about when the former Deputy Leader of the governing United Australia Party, Eric Spooner brought down Premier Bertram Stevens in a motion of no confidence. Wakehurst asked the Treasurer, Alexander Mair, to form a government. The current Premier of New South Wales is Gladys Berejiklian of the Liberal Party. Government ministers (including the Premier) must regularly answer questions in the chambers and there are a number of select committees that scrutinise particular issues and the workings of the Government. There are also mechanisms that allow Members of Parliament to bring to the attention of the Government particular issues affecting their constituents. For a bill to become law, it must be passed by both the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly and be assented to by the Governor. Under Section 5A of the New South Wales Constitution Act (1902), a bill appropriating revenue for the ordinary annual services of the Government can be presented to the Governor for assent even if the upper house has not agreed to it. State Opening and traditions Queen Elizabeth II opening the NSW Parliament on 4 February 1954. The State Opening of Parliament is an annual event that marks the commencement of a session of the Parliament of the New South Wales. It is held in the Legislative Council Chamber, usually in November or December, or in a general election year, when the new Parliament first assembles. It is an occasion for much pomp and ceremony, usually with a guard of honour and with dignitaries of the state attending. The New South Wales Parliament maintains many of the traditions of the original Parliament of the United Kingdom, from which the New South Wales Parliament was founded. The Governor, or occasionally the monarch, reads a prepared speech, known as the Speech from the Throne, outlining the Government's agenda for the coming year. The speech is not written by the Governor, but rather by the Cabinet, and reflects the legislative agenda for which they seek the agreement of both Houses of Parliament. Queen Elizabeth II has opened the New South Wales Parliament on two occasions, on 4 February 1954, as part of her first visit to Australia, which was also the first occasion in which the monarch of Australia had opened a session of any Australian Parliament. The other occasion was on 20 February 1992, during her visit to Sydney to celebrate the sesquicentenary of the incorporation of the City of Sydney, on which occasion she stated: Emblem The official emblem of the Parliament is a crowned circlet featuring the Coat of Arms of New South Wales taking the form of a Scottish crest badge. Crest badges, much like clan tartans, do not have a long history, and owe much to Victorian era romanticism, having only been worn on the bonnet since the mid-19th century when the buckled strap device commonly used by the Order of the Garter was adopted as a popular design to encircle monogram escutcheons and heraldic crests. The crest badge came to be accepted in the mid-20th century as the emblem of both houses of Parliament. The emblem appears on official stationery, publications and papers, and is stamped on various items in use in the Parliament, such as cutlery, silverware and china.

This colorless gas is a derivative of ammonia, but with one hydrogen atom being replaced by a methyl group. It is the simplest primary amine. It is sold as a solution in methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, or water, or as the anhydrous gas in pressurized metal containers. Industrially, methylamine is transported in its anhydrous form in pressurized railcars and tank trailers. It has a strong odor similar to fish. Methylamine is used as a building block for the synthesis of many other commercially available compounds.  Industrial production  Methylamine is prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with methanol in the presence of an aluminosilicate catalyst. Dimethylamine and trimethylamine are co-produced; the reaction kinetics and reactant ratios determine the ratio of the three products. The product most favored by the reaction kinetics is trimethylamine. :CH3OH + NH3 ‚Üí CH3NH2 \\\\+ H2O In this way, an estimated 115,000 tons were produced in 2005. Laboratory methods Methylamine was first prepared in 1849 by Charles-Adolphe Wurtz via the hydrolysis of methyl isocyanate and related compounds.Karsten Eller, Erhard Henkes, Roland Rossbacher, Hartmut H√∂ke \\"Amines, Aliphatic\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. Charles- Adolphe Wurtz (1849) \\"Sur une s√©rie d'alcalis organiques homologues avec l'ammoniaque\\" (On a series of homologous organic alkalis containing ammonia), Comptes rendus ‚Ä¶ , 28 : 223-226. Note: Wurtz's empirical formula for methylamine is incorrect because chemists in that era used an incorrect atomic mass for carbon (6 instead of 12). An example of this process includes the use of the Hofmann rearrangement, to yield methylamine from acetamide and bromine gas. In the laboratory, methylamine hydrochloride is readily prepared by various other methods. One method entails treating formaldehyde with ammonium chloride. :NH4Cl + H2CO ‚Üí [CH2=NH2]Cl + H2O :[CH2=NH2]Cl + H2CO + H2O ‚Üí [CH3NH3]Cl + HCO2H The colorless hydrochloride salt can be converted to an amine by the addition of a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH): :[CH3NH3]Cl + NaOH ‚Üí CH3NH2 \\\\+ NaCl + H2O Another method entails reducing nitromethane with zinc and hydrochloric acid. Another method of methylamine production is spontaneous decarboxylation of glycine with a strong base in water.  Reactivity and applications  Methylamine is a good nucleophile as it is an unhindered amine. As an amine it is considered a weak base. Its use in organic chemistry is pervasive. Some reactions involving simple reagents include: with phosgene to methyl isocyanate, with carbon disulfide and sodium hydroxide to the sodium methyldithiocarbamate, with chloroform and base to methyl isocyanide and with ethylene oxide to methylethanolamines. Liquid methylamine has solvent properties analogous to those of liquid ammonia. Representative commercially significant chemicals produced from methylamine include the pharmaceuticals ephedrine and theophylline, the pesticides carbofuran, carbaryl, and metham sodium, and the solvents N-methylformamide and N-methylpyrrolidone. The preparation of some surfactants and photographic developers require methylamine as a building block.  Biological chemistry  Methylamine arises as a result of putrefaction and is a substrate for methanogenesis. Additionally, methylamine is produced during PADI4-dependent arginine demethylation.

The parliament consists of a lower house, the Legislative Assembly, an upper house, the Legislative Council and the Queen, represented by the Governor of Western Australia. The two Houses of Parliament sit in Parliament House in the state capital, Perth. For a bill to become law, it must be passed by both the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly, and receive royal assent from the Governor. The party or coalition commanding the support of a majority of the members of the Legislative Assembly is invited by the governor to form government. The head of government holds the office of Premier of Western Australia. Currently, the Legislative Council has 36 members elected for four-year terms from multi-member constituencies by proportional representation, and the Legislative Assembly has 59 members, elected for four-year terms from single-member constituencies, using preferential voting. As with all other Australian states and territories, enrolment to vote and voting for both Houses is compulsory for all resident Australian citizens--and eligible British citizens (i.e., those permanently resident and on the electoral roll prior to the passage of the Australia Act)--who are over the legal voting age of 18. History The Western Australian Legislative Council was created in 1832 as an appointed body. In 1870 the then colony was ruled by a governor and an advisory Legislative Council made up of appointed officials and elected members. The Western Australian Legislative Assembly was created in 1890 when the then colony attained self-government. The first premier was John Forrest, who held office until 1901. On 3 November 2011, the government introduced fixed four- year terms for Parliament, with elections being held every four years on the second Saturday in March. The 2013 state election was the first election under the fixed date system. The two Houses of the 39th Parliament were prorogued on 30 January 2017 by the Governor of Western Australia and the Legislative Assembly was dissolved on the same day. The term of the Legislative Council will expire on 21 May 2017.Election of the Legislative Council The electoral roll closed on Thursday, 9 March 2015. Elections for the 40th Parliament took place on Saturday, 11 March 2017. At the election, the Labor Party won a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly and its leader, Mark McGowan, was sworn in as the 30th Premier of Western Australia on 17 March 2017 by Governor Kerry Sanderson. Members of his new Ministry were similarly sworn in on this date.

It consists of the 47-seat House of Assembly (lower house) and the 22-seat Legislative Council (upper house). All of the lower house and half of the upper house is filled at each election. It follows a Westminster system of parliamentary government with the executive branch required to both sit in Parliament and hold the confidence of the House of Assembly. The Queen is represented in the State by the Governor of South Australia. According to the South Australian Constitution, unlike the Federal Parliament, and the parliaments of the other states of Australia, neither the Sovereign or the Governor is considered to be a part of the South Australian Parliament. However, the same role and powers are granted to them. History Old Parliament House in 1872 The Legislative Council was the first Parliament in South Australia, formed as a result of the South Australia Act 1842, and replaced the South Australian Colonisation Commission appointed in 1834 by means of the South Australia Act 1834. The 1842 Act gave the British Government, which was responsible for appointing a Governor and at least seven other officers to the council, full control of South Australia as a Crown Colony, after financial mismanagement by the first administration had nearly bankrupted the colony. The Act also made provision for a commission to initiate the establishment of democratic government, electoral districts, requirements for voting rights, and terms of office. The Australian Colonies Government Act 1850 was a landmark development which granted representative constitutions to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania and the colonies enthusiastically set about writing constitutions which produced democratically progressive parliaments with the British monarch as the symbolic head of state.The Right to Vote in Australia. Australian Electoral Commission. Retrieved 21 March 2012. In 1851 elections for the legislative council were held. Recreated lower and upper house booths, history, and voting procedures In 1855, limited self-government was granted by London to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. This was expressed in South Australia by the Constitution Act 1856 (headed \\"1855‚Äì6: No. 2\\" and followed by the long title \\"An Act to establish a Constitution for South Australia, and to grant a Civil List to Her Majesty\\") establishing the constitution of the Parliament of the Province of South Australia. It was the first Constitution in the Australian colonies to provide \\"manhood\\" suffrage. A painting of the House of Assembly meeting in Old Parliament House in 1867 This Act provided for a bicameral Parliament with full authority to enact laws, apart from a few Acts requiring the monarch's personal Royal Assent. The Legislative Council was elected by property owners only, while the 36-member House of Assembly was elected by a full male franchise. The Act also provided for a system of responsible government, where the members of the executive branch must sit in Parliament and, by convention, can only remain in office while they hold the confidence of a majority of the members of the House of Assembly. The adoption of the \\"one man, one vote\\" principle removed the ability of voters to vote in any electorate in which they owned property. The Act also defined the rules of tenure for the parliamentarians. Women gained the right to vote and stand for election in 1895, taking effect at the 1896 election. South Australia became a state of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, following a vote to federate with the other British colonies of Australia. The competed New Parliament House being opened in 1939 From 1857 to 1933, the House of Assembly was elected from multi-member districts, commonly known as \\"seats,\\" with each district returning between one and six members. The size of the Assembly varied during this time‚Äî36 members from 1857 to 1875, 46 members from 1875 to 1884, 52 members from 1884 to 1890, 54 members from 1890 to 1902, 42 members from 1902 to 1912, 40 members from 1912 to 1915, and 46 members from 1915 to 1938. In 1938, the Assembly was reduced to 39 members, elected from single-member districts. The House of Assembly has had 47 members since the 1970 election, elected from single-member districts: currently 34 in the Adelaide metropolitan area and 13 in rural areas. These seats are intended to represent approximately the same population in each electorate. Another distinctive aspect of the history of the South Australian Parliament was the \\"Playmander\\", a gerrymandering system that instituted a pro-rural electoral malapportionment introduced by the incumbent Liberal and Country League (LCL) government, and in place for 32 years from 1936 to 1968.Labor and Liberal Parties, SA, Dean Jaensch, \\"A 2:1 ratio of enrolments in favour of the rural areas was in force from 1936.\\" It consisted of 26 low-population rural seats holding up to a 10-to-1 advantage over the 13 high-population metropolitan seats in the state parliament, even though rural seats contained only a third of South Australia's population. At the peak of the malapportionment in 1968, the rural seat of Frome had 4,500 formal votes, while the metropolitan seat of Enfield had 42,000 formal votes. Labor managed to win enough parliamentary seats to form government just once during the Playmander against the odds ‚àí in 1965. Labor won comprehensive majorities of the statewide two-party vote whilst failing to form government in 1944, 1953, 1962 and 1968. More equitable boundaries were subsequently put in place following the 1968, 1975, and 1989 elections. The Legislative Council's numbers have also varied over time. From inception to 1882, it had 18 members elected by a single colony-wide district. From then until 1902 it had 24 members; until 1915, 18 members; and until 1975, 20 members. The electoral districts were drawn to favour regional areas with a 2:1 bias in place, with half of the council being elected each time. From 1975, the council was increased to 22 members, with half (11) to be elected at each election by the entire state. Although the lower house had universal suffrage from 1895, the upper house, the Legislative Council, remained the exclusive domain of property owners until the Labor government of Don Dunstan managed to achieve reform of the chamber in 1973. Property qualifications were removed and the Council became a body elected via proportional representation by a single state-wide electorate. Since the following 1975 South Australian state election, no one party has had control of the state's upper house with the balance of power controlled by a variety of minor parties and independents. Elections were held every 3 years until 1985, when the parliament switched to 4 year terms, meaning 8 year terms for the upper house. Beginning in 2006, election dates have been fixed at the third Saturday in March of every fourth year.History of Redistributions, South Australian Electoral Districts Boundaries Commission House of Assembly House of Assembly chamber The House of Assembly (or \\"lower house\\") is made up of 47 members who are each elected by the full-preference instant-runoff voting system in single-member electorates. Each of the 47 electoral districts (electorates) contains approximately the same number of voters. Casual vacancies, when a member retires or dies in office mid-term, are filled by a by-election in that member's district. Since 1975, the distribution of electoral boundaries has been set by the South Australian Electoral Districts Boundaries Commission, an independent body. Since a referendum in 1991, boundaries have been redistributed after each election. Previously they were redistributed after every third election. Government is formed in the House of Assembly by the leader of the party or coalition who can demonstrate they have the support of the majority of the House, and is called upon by the Governor to form government. The leader of the government becomes the Premier. While South Australia's total population is 1.7 million, Adelaide's population is 1.3 million ‚àí uniquely, over 75 percent of the state's population resides in the metropolitan area and has 72 percent of seats (34 of 47) alongside a lack of comparatively-sized rural population centres, therefore the metropolitan area tends to decide election outcomes. At the 2014 election for example, although the statewide two-party vote (2PP) was 47.0% Labor v 53.0% Liberal, the metropolitan area recorded a 2PP of 51.5% Labor v 48.5% Liberal.Metropolitan 2PP correctly calculated by adding raw metro 2PP vote numbers from the 34 metro seats, both Labor and Liberal, then dividing Labor's raw metro 2PP vote from the total, which revealed a Labor metropolitan 2PP of 51.54%. Obtained raw metro 2PP vote numbers from ECSA 2014 election statistics , ECSA 2014 Heysen election and ABC 2014 Fisher by-election. The term for the House of Assembly is a fixed 4-year term but the state Constitution does allow the Governor to dissolve the House early and call for a fresh general election under certain circumstances. These are: If the House passes a motion of no confidence in the government, the House defeats a motion of confidence in the government, or if a bill that has been designated by the House as a \\"bill of special importance\\" is passed by the House of Assembly but is rejected by the Legislative Council.South Australian Constitution Act 1934 Section 28A The House of Assembly can also be dissolved early together with the full Legislative Council in what is knows as a double dissolution in order to resolve deadlocks between the two Houses. The circumstances for such a double dissolution are outlined below. Legislative Council Legislative Council chamber The Legislative Council (or \\"upper house\\") is made up of 22 councillors (MLCs) who are elected for the entire state by the Proportional Representation single transferable voting system (with optional preferential voting) to serve for a term that is usually 8 years. Elections for the Legislative Council are staggered so that 11 seats are up for re-election every 4 years, at the same time as House of Assembly elections. Legislative Councillors may serve shorter or longer terms than the usual 8 years in the event of an early dissolution of the House of Assembly. If half the chamber has served at least 6 years at the time of a dissolution, then they go up for election, but if all Legislative Councillors have served less than 6 years, only the House of Assembly faces the people.South Australian Constitution Act 1934 Section 14 In the event of a casual vacancy, members of the Legislative Council are filled by an assembly of the members of both Houses of Parliament. If the member whose seat has become vacant was elected as a member of a political party, the assembly must, if possible, replace them with a nominated member of that party.South Australian Constitution Act 1934 Section 13 The Legislative Council has almost equal powers to the House of Assembly. The only difference is that the upper house does not have the ability to initiate or amend bills that appropriate money or levy taxes. The Council may still request amendments to these bills and retains the right to reject money bills that it disagrees with.South Australian Constitution Act 1934 Division 5 ‚Äî Money Bills The primary function of the Legislative Council is to review legislation which has been passed by the House of Assembly. This can cause tensions between the government and the Legislative Council, which may be viewed by the former as obstructionist if it rejects key legislation, as can happen at times when the electoral makeup of the two Houses are different. Another important function of the upper house is to scrutinise government activity, which it does both in the chamber and through committees. As Legislative Councillors have been elected using proportional representation since the mid 1970s, the chamber features a multitude of parties vying for power. A government or opposition majority in the upper house has been unachievable since the introduction of this system, with the balance of power being held by a number of minor parties and independents. Resolution of deadlocks between the Houses In the event that there is a conflict between the two Houses over legislation, the South Australian Constitution lays out a mechanism for how these deadlocks can be resolved. Under section 41 of the South Australian Constitution, if a bill is passed by the House of Assembly during a session of Parliament and in the following Parliament after a general election for the lower house is rejected by the Legislative Council on both occasions, it is permitted for the Governor of South Australia to either issue a writ for the election of 2 additional members of the Legislative Council or to dissolve both Houses at the same time to elect an entirely new Parliament.South Australian Constitution Act 1934 Section 41 This procedure is known as a double dissolution. As the upper house consists of 22 members, with 11 elected statewide at each general election for an 8-year term at a quota of 8.33%, this would result in an election for all 22 members at a quota of 4.35%. In the event of a double dissolution election, the 11 Legislative Councillors that would not have won their seats under an ordinary election go up for re-election at the first general election after only serving 3 years, rather than the usual 6 years.South Australian Constitution Act 1934 Section 15 Although it has been threatened, this South Australian double dissolution procedure has never been used. Location Parliament House A 50-minute tour of the South Australian Parliament House The seat of the Parliament of South Australia is Parliament House in the state capital of Adelaide. Parliament House sits on the North-Western corner of the intersection of King William Street and North Terrace. It was built to replace the adjacent and overcrowded Parliament House, now referred to as \\"Old Parliament House\\". Due to financial constraints, the current Parliament House was constructed in stages over 65 years from 1874 to 1939. Following the completion of the New Parliament House in 1939, The Old Parliament House has been used for a variety of functions including as a Royal Australian Air Force recruiting office, offices for government departments and as a \\"Constitutional Museum\\". In 1995, the building reverted to use by the parliament and has been used as offices and committee rooms ever since.

Overall charge neutral organic compounds containing the diazo group bound to a carbon atom are called diazo compounds or diazoalkanesThe term diazoalkane is used by some authors to refer to any substituted diazomethane (i.e., all diazo compounds). However, other authors use the term to refer exclusively to diazo compounds with alkyl substituents that do not contain other functional groups (which would exclude compounds like diphenyldiazomethane or ethyl diazoacetate). and are described by the general structural formula R2C=N+=N‚Äì. The simplest example of a diazo compound is diazomethane, CH2N2. Diazo compounds (R2C=N2) should not be confused with azo compounds of the type R-N=N-R or with diazonium compounds of the type R-N2+.  Structure  The electronic structure of diazo compounds is characterized by œÄ electron density delocalized over the Œ±-carbon and two nitrogen atoms, along with an orthogonal œÄ system with electron density delocalized over only the terminal nitrogen atoms. Because all octet rule- satisfying resonance forms of diazo compounds have formal charges, they are members of a class of compounds known as 1,3-dipoles. Some of the most stable diazo compounds are Œ±-diazo-Œ≤-diketones and Œ±-diazo-Œ≤-diesters, in which the electron density is further delocalized into an electron-withdrawing carbonyl group. In contrast, most diazoalkanes without electron-withdrawing substituents, including diazomethane itself, are explosive. A commercially relevant diazo compound is ethyl diazoacetate (N2CHCOOEt). A group of isomeric compounds with only few similar properties are the diazirines, where the carbon and two nitrogens are linked as a ring. Four resonance structures can be drawn:F.A. Carey R.J. Sundberg Advanced Organic Chemistry, 2nd Edition :Diazo resonance structures Compounds with the diazo moiety should be distinguished from diazonium compounds, which have the same terminal azo group but bear an overall positive charge, and azo compounds in which the azo group bridges two organic substituents.  History  Diazo compounds were first produced by Peter Griess who had discovered a versatile new chemical reaction, as detailed in his 1858 paper \\"Preliminary notice on the influence of nitrous acid on aminonitro- and aminodinitrophenol.\\"Trevor I. Williams, ‚ÄòGriess, (Johann) Peter (1829‚Äì1888)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004Peter Griess (1858) \\"Vorl√§ufige Notiz √ºber die Einwirkung von salpetriger S√§ure auf Amidinitro- und Aminitrophenyls√§ure,\\" (Preliminary notice of the reaction of nitrous acid with picramic acid and aminonitrophenol), Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie, 106 : 123-125. Synthesis Several methods exist for the preparation of diazo compounds.New Syntheses of Diazo Compounds Gerhard Maas Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2009, 48, 8186 ‚Äì 8195 =From amines= Alpha-acceptor-substituted primary aliphatic amines R-CH2-NH2 (R = COOR, CN, CHO, COR) react with nitrous acid to generate the diazo compound. =From diazomethyl compounds= An example of an electrophilic substitution using a diazomethyl compound is that of a reaction between an acyl halide and diazomethane,Example Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 3, p.119 (1955); Vol. 26, p.13 (1946).Link for example the first step in the Arndt-Eistert synthesis. =By diazo transfer= In diazo transfer certain carbon acids react with tosyl azide in the presence of a weak base like triethylamine or DBU. The byproduct is the corresponding tosylamide (p-toluenesulfonamide). This reaction is also called the Regitz diazo transfer.M. Regitz, Angew. Chem., 79, 786 (1967); Angew. Chem. Intern. Ed. Engl., 6, 733 (1967). Examples are the synthesis of tert-butyl diazoacetateOrganic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 5, p.179 (1973); Vol. 48, p.36 (1968). Link and diazomalonate.Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 6, p.414 (1988); Vol. 59, p.66 (1979). Link Methyl phenyldiazoacetate is generated in this way by treating methyl phenylacetate with p-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide in the presence of base. Solid state structure of the diazo compound t-BuO2CC(N2)C6H4NO2. Key distances: C-N = 1.329 √Ö, N-N = 1.121 √Ö. The mechanism involves attack of the enolate at the terminal nitrogen, proton transfer, and expulsion of the anion of the sulfonamide. Use of the Œ≤-carbonyl aldehyde leads to a deformylative variant of the Regitz transfer, which is useful for the preparation of diazo compounds stabilized by only one carbonyl group. alt= =From N-alkyl-N-nitroso compounds= Diazo compounds can be obtained in an elimination reaction of N-alkyl-N-nitroso compounds,Example: Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 6, p.981 (1988); Vol. 57, p.95 (1977). Link such as in the synthesis of diazomethane from Diazald or MNNG: :Diazo synthesis from N-alkyl-N-nitroso compounds : (The mechanism shown here is one possibility. For an alternative mechanism for the analogous formation of diazomethane from an N-nitrososulfonamide, see the page on Diazald.) =From hydrazones= Hydrazones are oxidized (dehydrogenation) for example with silver oxide or mercury oxide for example the synthesis of 2-diazopropane from acetone hydrazone.Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 6, p.392 (1988); Vol. 50, p.27 (1970). Link Other oxidizing reagents are lead tetraacetate, manganese dioxide and the Swern reagent.

These triazenes (ArN=NNH-CH2R) result from coupling of aromatic diazonium salts with primary amines but the reaction type is rare. =From azides= One method is described for the synthesis of diazo compounds from azides using phosphines:A Phosphine-Mediated Conversion of Azides into Diazo Compounds Eddie L. Myers and Ronald T. Raines Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2009, 48, 2359 ‚Äì2363 :Azide to diazo conversion Reactions =In cycloadditions= Diazo compounds react as 1,3-dipoles in diazoalkane 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions. =As carbene precursors= Diazo compounds are used as precursors to carbenes, which are generated by thermolysis or photolysis, for example in the Wolff rearrangement. As such they are used in cyclopropanation for example in the reaction of ethyl diazoacetate with styrene.Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 6, p.913 (1988); Vol. 50, p.94 (1970).Link Certain diazo compounds can couple to form alkenes in a formal carbene dimerization reaction. Diazo compounds are intermediates in the Bamford-Stevens reaction of tosylhydrazones to alkenes, again with a carbene intermediate: :Bamford-Stevens reaction In the Doyle-Kirmse reaction certain diazo compounds react with allyl sulfides to the homoallyl sulfide. Intramolecular reactions of diazocarbonyl compounds provide access to cyclopropanes. In the Buchner ring expansion diazo compounds react with aromatic rings with ring-expansion. =As nucleophile= The Buchner-Curtius- Schlotterbeck reaction yields ketones from aldehydes and aliphatic diazo compounds: :Buchner-Curtius-Schlotterbeck reaction The reaction type is nucleophilic addition. Occurrence in nature Two families of naturally occurring products feature the diazo group: kinamycin and lomaiviticin. These molecules are DNA-intercalators, with diazo functionality as their \\"warheads\\". Loss of N2, induced reductively, generates a DNA-cleaving fluorenyl radical.

It consists of the late-19th-century Leckhampton House, the George Thomson Building, dating from 1964, and several other nearby houses. In 2012, a new, purpose-built accommodation building was built to house additional students. The new building was opened on 14 September 2012 by the College Visitor and Chancellor of the University, David Sainsbury. The buildings are set off Grange Road in the west of Cambridge amidst large, attractive gardens adjacent to Corpus's sports grounds, about fifteen minutes' walk from the main college site in Trumpington Street. Leckhampton has its own library, dining hall and bar; it forms the social as well as residential centre of Corpus graduate life. It also houses a number of fellows, both visiting and of Corpus. Removed from the city centre, yet close to many academic buildings including the University Library and the Sidgwick Site, Leckhampton is in a convenient location for graduate students, and was a pioneering development among Cambridge colleges when it was established as a graduate centre. Prior to this, graduate students at Cambridge, long a tiny minority of the student body, had for the most part lived among undergraduates in colleges' main sites. Corpus's response to the rapidly growing number of graduate students in the 1960s was to establish in 1961 at Leckhampton a largely self-contained graduate community, a move which has since been emulated to some extent by many other colleges. Although at least one of these developments went much further than Leckhampton ‚Äì Clare College's graduate site became the independent college of Clare Hall in 1984. Since the separation of Clare and Clare Hall, it is once again unique among the colleges that admit both undergraduates and postgraduates in having a dedicated graduate site. The interests of Leckhampton are represented by the Warden of Leckhampton, a senior Fellow of the College. The Warden has rooms in Leckhampton House, and hosts a number of social functions at Leckhampton throughout the year. The current Warden is John David Rhodes, who lectures on European and American cinema in the Faculty of Modern and Medieval Languages. History Leckhampton House and garden Leckhampton House was designed by the architect William C. Marshall in 1881 for its first inhabitants, Frederic W. H. Myers and Eveleen Tennant. Frederic Myers was a classical scholar, poet, essayist and founder of the Society for Psychical Research. Eveleen Tennant Myers was a talented amateur photographer whose collection is displayed at the National Portrait Gallery, including many photographs of Leckhampton House.Eveleen Myers 1856-1937Eveleen Myers (n√©e Tennant) In contrast to Leckhampton House's suburban late-Victorianism, the George Thomson Building (named after the Nobel Prize-winning physicist George Paget Thomson, sometime master of the college) is Grade II listed example of postwar modernism, designed by Philip Dowson of Arup Associates. Like other buildings of its kind on University campuses, some have criticised it as unimaginative, boxy and out of place. Others, however, have hailed it as an outstanding example for the period. The other buildings of Leckhampton are late-nineteenth-century houses in the adjacent streets which have been bought by the college over the years and linked to the main buildings and gardens, and a new building opened in September 2012.

The department undertakes research and teaching devoted to understanding life online, with the aim of shaping Internet research, policy, and practice. Founded in 2001, the OII has tracked the Internet's development and use, aiming to shed light on individual, collective and institutional behaviour online. The department brings together academics from a wide range of disciplines including political science, sociology, geography, economics, philosophy, physics and psychology. The current director is Professor Philip N. Howard.  Research  Research at the OII covers a huge variety of topics, with faculty publishing journal articles and books on issues including privacy and security, e-government and e-democracy, virtual economies, smart cities, digital exclusion, digital humanities, online gaming, big data and Internet geography. The OII currently has the following research clusters reflecting the diverse expertise of faculty: * Digital Politics and Government * Information Governance and Security * Social Data Science * Connectivity, Inclusion and Inequality * Internet Economies * Digital Knowledge and Culture * Education, Digital Life and Wellbeing * Ethics and Philosophy of Information The faculty and students of the OII have made many advances to the study of technology and society. Director Helen Margetts' book Political Turbulence was the first book-length manuscript on the impact of social media on public life. Viktor Mayer-Sch√∂nberger's book Big Data was the first to define and explain the importance of big data in contemporary economics, culture, and politics. His 2018 work Reinventing Capitalism in the Age of Big Data focuses on the role of platforms for allocating demand and supply beyond the price mechanism. Professor Philip N. Howard was the first political scientist to define and study astroturfing and has been responsible for significant research on fake news, bots and trolls in international affairs. Luciano Floridi is the world's leading ethicist on AI and big data. =Studies of Wikipedia= OII has published several studies in Internet geography and Wikipedia. In November 2011, the Guardian Data Blog published maps of geotagged Wikipedia articles written in English, Arabic, Egyptian Arabic, French, Hebrew and Persian. OII Senior Research Fellow Mark Graham led the study and published the results on his blog, Zero Geography. Graham also leads an OII project focused on how new users are perceived, represented, and incorporated into the Wikipedia community. In 2013, OII researchers led by Taha Yasseri published a study of controversial topics in 10 different language versions of Wikipedia, using data related to \\"edit wars\\". As of late, the OII has, amongst other things, been involved in research on the effects of computational propaganda, the ethics of big data in different contexts and the political implications of the Internet and social media. It closely collaborates with other institutions of the University of Oxford such as the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, the department for computer science and the Oxford Martin School.  Teaching  Since 2006, the OII has offered a DPhil (doctoral) degree in \\"Information, Communication, and the Social Sciences.\\" Since 2009, it has offered a one-year Master of Science (MSc) degree in \\"Social Science of the Internet\\". From 2015, prospective students can apply to study the MSc degree part-time over two years. In addition, the department also runs an annual Summer Doctoral Programme which brings outstanding PhD students to study at the OII for two weeks each July. From 2018, prospective students also have the option to apply for a one-year Master of Science degree in Social Data Science with the related DPhil in Social Data Science available from 2020 onward. History The Oxford Internet Institute was made possible by a major donation from the Shirley Foundation of over ¬£10m, with public funding totalling over ¬£5m from the Higher Education Funding Council for England. The idea originated with Derek Wyatt MP and Andrew Graham, then Master-Elect of Balliol. Two Balliol Alumni, who knew Dame Stephanie from The Worshipful Company of Information Technologists, persuaded Dame Stephanie to meet Andrew Graham and it was following their meeting that she agreed to give the idea her support. A full account of the history of the OII is available at https://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/andrew_graham_origins_of_the_oii.pdf The Oxford Internet Institute is part of a small network of research centres that includes the centres like the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society and Information Society Project at Yale Law School.

He then became the drummer for Infinika, which was formed in 2012, but disbanded in 2015. As of 2019, David is now currently the drummer of a band called Breaking In A Sequence (B.I.A.S). Biography =1993 to 2006: Korn= Born in San Leandro, California, Silveria was raised in Bakersfield, California. He was one of the original five members of the nu metal band Korn. Bandmates Brian Welch, James Shaffer and Reginald Arvizu took up pseudonyms, while Silveria and singer Jonathan Davis remained using their real names. Korn proceeded to popularize the alternative metal subgenre in the music industry, selling over 40 million albums worldwide. Silveria sat out a part of the \\"Sick and Twisted 2000\\" and \\"Summer Sanitarium\\" tours due to injury, with Mike Bordin from Faith No More filling in on drums. Silveria then returned for the album recording of Untouchables, Silveria's own explanation for the issue was that he \\"hits too fucking hard\\". On December 13, 2006, after the tour in support of See You on the Other Side, it was announced that Silveria would be going on hiatus, and Jonathan Davis later said Silveria would \\"probably not\\" appear on their next album. Silveria has since started running his restaurants. In 2009, after working with several different temporary drummers, Ray Luzier was announced as the official replacement. =2006 to 2012: Leaving Korn and hiatus= For the first time in three years David appeared promoting Lil' Kim in Dancing with the Stars, he also introduced himself as \\"David Silveria from Korn\\". In May 2010, Silveria appeared as a model for Remetee clothing. Comments on Korn since leaving Since January 2012, Silveria has become vocal about his time in Korn, and has often spoken negatively about the band, its members and in some cases its outspoken fans, during conversations on Korn fansite Kornspace. Although David maintains no relationship with his former bandmates, he has stated that he has no hard feelings towards guitarist James Shaffer. However, Silveria has spoken less fondly of singer Jonathan Davis and bassist Reginald Arvizu, such as calling Arvizu a \\"cowardly little bitch\\". Silveria states that his relationship with Korn was flawed due to them not letting him back in the band after his long absence from music. Silveria mentioned during his conversation with fans on Kornspace.com that he had contacted then-former band member Brian Welch about a Korn reunion tour but Head refused the offer. David also confirmed his comments that he left Korn due to \\"negative attitudes\\" and that he \\"couldn't take it anymore\\". He mentioned at that point that he has not spoken with Jonathan Davis since November 2006. However, after it was announced that original guitarist Brian Head Welch would be returning to Korn for two shows at Rock am Ring and Rock im Park in 2013, David Silveria commented on his Facebook page that he would be open to a reunion if all five original members were involved. On January 7, 2013, David Silveria updated his status on his official Facebook page stating, 'Korn fans need to flood the Korn site telling them Korn isn't Korn without the original five!!!' He then went on to say in a later status that fans should 'Flood Jd's and Munkys twitter to bring the original 5 back together\\" and later commenting that he had 'made contact', after which fans began predicting that a full reunion would happen. On January 7, 2013, guitarist Brian Head Welch stated in an Interview that \\"David has really said some crazy things online about personal things and he's not in a place where people would really want him around. That happened before I talked with them but I guess the things he said were really crazy. Those guys were in a band together for so long so I don't know, but for now it's just not going to happen.\\" On August 11, 2013, Silveria took to his personal Facebook account to state that \\"[t]here are a lot of things I did for the band that they don't like to admit I did.\\" He then went on to say in a later post that he blamed the band's \\"cookie cutter\\" musical direction after Follow the Leader for his lack of interest from that point. On August 17, 2013 Silveria responded to the repeated misquoting of his post on Ray Luzier and Korn with \\"To be clear I am NOT talking bad about Ray. My posts have been about my work with Korn during our early years specifically during our first three records.\\" Silveria has claimed that he could restore Korn's original sound, and says that he would like to have a discussion with the band about their early days, the future of the band and Korn's original sound. However, Jonathan Davis stated on Twitter that \\"I will never never play with him again,\\" (which appears to be a reference to the title of Korn's first single 'Never Never' from the album The Paradigm Shift). On February 27, 2015, Silveria stated that he was suing his former bandmates in Korn for money owed after the band declined to allow him back in the group following a lengthy break. According to TMZ, Silveria is suing the other four original bandmembers in an effort to reclaim the money owed to him and his \\"ownership interest\\" in the band since his departure. If Silveria is repaid what he believes he is owed from the past 9 years, he will dissolve his partnership with the group. =2012‚Äì2015: Infinika= On January 24, it was announced on YouTube that Silveria is playing drums for the experimental rock band Infinika alongside the founding member of ANYONE (and film maker), Riz Story. On January 27, it was confirmed with an article on Blabbermouth. Silveria stated that he wished to expand his musical scope with Infinika adding that it was technically the most advanced drumming of his career. On January 30, fan site Kornspace.com confirmed that David Silveria had in fact joined the site, with a picture of Silveria holding a Kornspace banner. This confirmed previous comments that had supposedly been made by the drummer on the site earlier that week. David stated that he would be touring with Infinika and that he was looking forward to the release of the first full-length album by the band, \\"Echoes and Traces\\". On April 2, David Silveria's new band Infinika released their new single and music video via YouTube called Beautiful World. The video features footage of David recorded for the Infinika ‚Äì Promotional Clip. The album \\"Echoes and Traces\\" was released worldwide on September 1, 2014. The album features 14 tracks which vary widely from acoustic to psychedelic metal. Silveria stated that \\"the direction of the band would be defined by its rich mixture of sounds and unpredictable direction\\". Noting the mixed reviews from some Korn fans Silveria stated, \\"I have no interest in repeating myself. I want to keep expanding my drumming and Infinika allows me to explore the wide range of my drumming\\". On January 24, 2015, Infinika announced the band would be dissolved. =2016‚Äì2018: Leaving Core10 for Breaking In A Sequence (B.I.A.S.)= David Silveria stated he would be joining a band by the name of Core10 on his Facebook page. On May 22, 2018, it was announced that Silveria and everyone else in the band, aside from their two frontmen, had quit the band due to mixed reviews and creative differences. Silveria then helped form a new band called Breaking In A Sequence (B.I.A.S) with singer Rich Nguyen, guitarist and vocalist Joe Taback, guitarist Mike Martin, and bassist Chris Dorame.

Mechanical Flight Flight, 20 February 1909, p.108 was a pioneer era canard biplane designed and built by Brazilian aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont. In 1906 near Paris the 14-bis made a manned powered flight that was the first to be publicly witnessed by a crowd. Background In June 1905 Gabriel Voisin flew a glider which was towed by a fast boat on the River Seine, making a flight of over . The glider's wing and tail were made up of Hargrave cells, a box kite-like structure that provided a degree of inherent stability. This established the Hargrave cell as a configuration useful not only for kites but also for heavier-than-air aircraft.Gibbs-Smith 1974, p.160 Santos-Dumont was living in Paris at the time, and was one of the most active \\"aeronauts\\" in Europe, having developed a series of non-rigid airships that displayed unparalleled agility, speed, endurance, and ease of control. Santos- Dumont met Voisin at the end of 1905, and commissioned him to help him construct an aircraft with the intention of attempting to win one of the prizes for heavier-than-air flights offered by the A√©ro-Club de France to promote the development of heavier-than-air aviation in France.Wykeham 1962, pp.202-3 These included the Coupe Ernest Archdeacon prize of a silver trophy and 1500 francs for the first flight of and another prize of 1500 francs for the first flight of .Gibbs-Smith 1974, p.137 Design Santos-Dumont supervised construction of a Hargrave-cell (box kite-like) biplane powered by an Antoinette engine. The wings, each made up of three cells, were at the back and configured with pronounced dihedral to make the aircraft laterally stable. The Antoinette liquid-cooled, fuel-injected V8 engine was mounted at the extreme rear end of the fuselage, itself located almost vertically equidistant between the biplane wing panels' wing roots, with the rear-mount engine driving a pusher propeller, and the pilot stood in a balloon basket immediately in front of the engine. A movable boxkite-style cell at the nose, pivoted on a universal joint within it and controlled by cables was intended for yaw and pitch control. This layout would later come to be called a \\"canard configuration\\". It was constructed from bamboo and pine joined by aluminium sockets and was covered with Japanese silk.Gibbs-Smith 1974, p.212 Operational history The 14-bis at the Ch√¢teau de Bagatelle grounds, suspended from the envelope of Santos-Dumont's No.14 airship. The first trials of the aircraft were made on 22 July 1906 at Santos-Dumont's grounds at Neuilly, where it had been assembled. In order to simulate flight conditions, Santos-Dumont attached the aircraft under his latest non-rigid airship, the Number 14, which is why the aircraft came to be known as the \\"14-bis\\".Le A√©roplane Santos-Dumont l'A√©rophile, July 1906, p.167 The aircraft was then transported to the grounds of the Ch√¢teau de Bagatelle in the Bois de Boulogne, where there was more space. The forces imposed by the aircraft pulled dangerously at the airship's envelope, nearly tearing it and only allowing limited control. The danger of these tests caused Santos-Dumont and his team to quickly abandon them, although some useful information was obtained that led to adjustments in the balance and weight distribution of the aircraft. Further trials were made with the aircraft hung from a rope attached to pulleys running along a long steel cable slung between two posts, one high and the other high,Le A√©roplane Santos-Dumont l'A√©rophile, July 1906, pp.168‚Äì9 much like a zip-line or tyrolienne of today. The first free-flight trials of the 14-bis took place at the Polo Ground in the Bois de Boulogne on 21 August, but were halted by damage to the newly fitted aluminium-bladed propeller, which replaced one with silk-covered wooden blades.L'Essor de Santos-Dumont l'A√©rophile, September 1906, pp.191‚Äì4 After repairs another trial took place the following day; although the nosewheel left the ground, the aircraft had insufficient power to take off, and Santos-Dumont decided to replace the engine with a Antoinette. Trials resumed on 4 September without great success, and on 7 September, after the propeller was damaged, a new slightly larger one was fitted.Gibbs-Smith 1874, p.218 On 13 September 1906 A√©ro-Club de France observers gathered to witness an attempt to make a prize-winning flight. The aircraft failed to take off during a first attempt, but during the second it lifted and flew between at an altitude of about . The aircraft then landed in a nose-up attitude, breaking the propeller and bringing an end to the day's experiments. This brief flight did not qualify for any prize, but earned Santos-Dumont an ovation from the crowd. On 23 October, after a series of engine tests and high-speed ground runs (one of which ended as one wheel came loose, but this was quickly fixed), Santos-Dumont made a flight of over at an altitude of .La Deuxi√®me envol√©e de Santos-Dumont L'A√©rophile October 1906, p.245 This earned Santos-Dumont the first of the aviation prizes, 3,000 francs for a flight of or more. The 14-bis flying over the Ch√¢teau de Bagatelle grounds on 23 October. Monument at the Ch√¢teau's grounds, to Santos-Dumont's flight of 12 November and its first world record. This landing damaged the aircraft slightly, but Santos-Dumont announced that he should be ready to attempt the 100 meters prize on 12 November. The 14-bis was repaired, and octagonal ailerons were added to the middle of each outermost wing cell, with the surfaces pivoting between the outermost forward struts. These were operated by cables attached to the shoulders of the pilot's flightsuit, somewhat like the hip-movement wing-warping control of the Wright Flyer. On the morning of 12 November 1906 the aviation community of France assembled at the Chateau de Bagatelle's grounds to witness Santos Dumont's next attempt. As Santos-Dumont allowed the 14-bis to run down the field, a car drove alongside, from which Henry Farman dropped a plate each time he observed the wheels of the aircraft leave the ground or touch down again. The first attempt achieved a 5-second flight of about around 40 cm off the ground, and the second two brief flights of 40 and . A hurried landing due to the proximity of some trees after this second attempt damaged the wheel axles, and these were fixed during a lunch break. In the afternoon, further flights of 50 meters and then (achieving about 40 km/h), this one interrupted by the proximity of a polo barrier. As the sun set, Santos-Dumont attempted one more flight. In order to ensure he would not hit the spectators, who by this time were all over the field, he pulled up while flying over them. After 22 seconds, he cut the engine and glided in to land. He had flown for 220 meters (over 700 ft), qualifying for the second aviation prize offered for heavier-than-air- aircraft, 1,000 francs for a flight of 100 meters or more. This was the last recorded flight of the aircraft.Flight, 1909, p.12 The next notable Santos- Dumont flights were made a year later in November 1907, flying his No. 19 Demoiselle. 14-bis vs. Wright Flyer Some contend that the 14-bis rather than Wright Flyer was the first true airplane. For takeoff the 1903 Wright Flyer used a launch rail and a wheeled dolly which was left on the ground; the airplane landed on skids due to the sandy landing surface at Kitty Hawk. After 1903 the Wrights used a catapult to assist most takeoffs of their 1904 and 1905 airplanes. The Santos-Dumont 14-bis did not use a catapult and ran on wheels located at the back of the aircraft, with a skid under the front of the fuselage. The F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (F.A.I.) (\\"International Federation of Aeronautics\\"), founded in France in 1905 to \\"regulate the sport of flying\\" and to keep track of aviation records and other aeronautical activities, stated among its rules that an aircraft should be able to take off under its own power in order to qualify for a record. Many Brazilians therefore hold the 14-bis as the first airplane and Santos-Dumont is revered as Father of Aviation in the country. On October 5, 1905 Wilbur made a circling flight of 24 miles (38.9 km) in 39 minutes 23 seconds, over Huffman Prairie near Dayton, Ohio, a year before Santos-Dumont's flight earned him his first aviation award. Written and photographic documentation by the Wrights authenticated by historians shows that the 1903 Wright Flyer accomplished takeoffs in a strong headwind without a catapult and made controlled and sustained flight nearly three years before Santos Dumont made his first takeoff.

In the Western tradition, all these elements were thought of as properly different in poetry and prose up to the time of the Romantic revolution, when William Wordsworth challenged the distinction in his Romantic manifesto, the Preface to the second (1800) edition of Lyrical Ballads (1798). Wordsworth proposed that a \\"language near to the language of men\\" was as appropriate for poetry as it was for prose. This idea was very influential, though more in theory than practice: a special \\"poetic\\" vocabulary and mode of metaphor persisted in 19th century poetry. It was deplored by the Modernist poets of the 20th century, who again proposed that there is no such thing as a \\"prosaic\\" word unsuitable for poetry. Greece and Rome Aristotle: \\"A certain admixture... of unfamiliar terms is necessary\\". In some languages, \\"poetic diction\\" is quite a literal dialect use. In Classical Greek literature, for example, certain linguistic dialects were seen as appropriate for certain types of poetry. Thus, tragedy and history would employ different Greek dialects. In Latin, poetic diction involved not only a vocabulary somewhat uncommon in everyday speech, but syntax and inflections rarely seen elsewhere. Thus, the diction employed by Horace and Ovid will differ from that used by Julius Caesar, both in terms of word choice and in terms of word form. The first writer to discuss poetic diction in the Western tradition was Aristotle (384 BC‚Äî322 BC). In his Poetics, he stated that the perfect style for writing poetry was one that was clear without meanness. He went on to define meanness of style as the deliberate avoidance of unusual words. He also warned against over-reliance on strange words: :\\"The perfection of Diction is for it to be at once clear and not mean. The clearest indeed is that made up of the ordinary words for things, but it is mean... A certain admixture, accordingly, of unfamiliar terms is necessary. These, the strange word, the metaphor, the ornamental equivalent, etc., will save the language from seeming mean and prosaic, while the ordinary words in it will secure the requisite clearness. What helps most, however, to render the Diction at once clear and non-prosaic is the use of the lengthened, curtailed, and altered forms of words.\\"English translation by Ingram Bywater (1920). Germanic languages Germanic languages developed their own form of poetic diction. In Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse, poetry often involved exceptionally compressed metaphors called \\"kennings\\", such as whale- road for \\"the sea\\", or sword-weather for \\"battle\\". Also, poetry often contained riddles (e.g. the Gnomic Verses in Anglo-Saxon). Therefore, the order of words for poetry as well as the choice of words reflected a greater tendency to combine words to form metaphor. In Iceland, Snorri Sturluson wrote the Prose Edda, a.k.a. the Younger Edda around 1200 A.D., partially to explain the older Edda and poetic diction. Half of the Prose Edda, the Sk√°ldskaparm√°l (\\"language of poetry creation\\" or \\"creative language of poets\\"), is a manual of traditional Icelandic poetic diction, containing a list of kennings. The list is systematized so as to function as a practical thesaurus for the use of poets wishing to write in the genuine old manner, and structured as an FAQ. Snorri gives traditional examples and also opens the way for creating correct new kennings: :\\"How should man be periphrased? By his works, by that which he gives or receives or does; he may also be periphrased in terms of his property, those things which he possesses, and, if he be liberal, of his liberality; likewise in terms of the families from which he descended, as well as of those which have sprung from him. How is one to periphrase him in terms of these things? Thus, by calling him accomplisher or performer of his goings or his conduct, of his battles or sea-voyages or huntings or weapons or ships.... Woman should be periphrased with reference to all female garments, gold and jewels, ale or wine or any other drink, or to that which she dispenses or gives; likewise with reference to ale-vessels, and to all those things which it becomes her to perform or to give. It is correct to periphrase her thus: by calling her giver or user of that of which she partakes. But the words for 'giver' and 'user' are also names of trees; therefore woman is called in metaphorical speech by all feminine tree-names.\\"English translation by Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur (1916). In Britain the distinctively Germanic spirit of Anglo Saxon prosody placed particular emphasis on elaborate, decorative and controlled use of strongly ornate language, such as in consistent and sustained alliteration, as exemplified by the anonymous Pearl Poet of North-West England. In Scotland this spirit continued through to the renaissance so that in Middle Scots diction the 15th and 16th century Makars achieved a rich and varied blend of characteristically Germanic Anglic features with newer Latinate and aureate language and principles. Asia In Japanese poetry, the rules for writing traditional haiku require that each poem include a reference to a specific season. For the renga linked-verse form from which haiku derived, the rules specify that certain stanzas should have seasonal references. In both cases, such references are achieved by inclusion of a kigo (season word). Japanese poets regularly use a Saijiki, a kigo dictionary that contains lists of season words, organized by season, together with examples of haiku using those kigo. In English In English, poetic diction has taken multiple forms, but it generally mirrors the habits of Classical literature. Highly metaphoric adjective use, for example, can, through catachresis, become a common \\"poetic\\" word (e.g. the \\"rosy-fingered dawn\\" found in Homer, when translated into English, allows the \\"rose fingered\\" to be taken from its Homeric context and used generally to refer not to fingers, but to a person as being dawn-like). In the 16th century, Edmund Spenser (and, later, others) sought to find an appropriate language for the Epic in English, a language that would be as separate from commonplace English as Homeric Greek was from koine. Spenser found it in the intentional use of archaisms. (This approach was rejected by John Milton, who sought to make his epic out of blank verse, feeling that common language in blank verse was more majestic than difficult words in complex rhymes.) William Wordsworth also believed in using the language of the common man to portray a certain image and display his message. In the Preface to the Lyrical Ballads, Wordsworth says \\"I have proposed to myself to imitate, and as far as possible, to adopt, the very language of men.\\" \\"William Wordsworth, The Major Works\\", pg 600, Oxford World's Classics, 2000 In the 18th century, pastoral and lyric poetry both developed a somewhat specialized vocabulary and poetic diction. The common elision within words (\\"howe'er\\" and \\"howsome,\\" e.g.) were not merely graphical. As Paul Fussell and others have pointed out, these elisions were intended to be read aloud exactly as printed. Therefore, these elisions effectively created words that existed only in poetry. Further, the 18th century saw a renewed interest in Classical poetry, and thus poets began to test language for decorum. A word in a poem needed to be not merely accurate, but also fitting for the given poetic form. Pastoral, lyric, and philosophical poetry was scrutinized for the right type of vocabulary as well as the most meaningful. Joseph Addison and Richard Steele discussed poetic diction in The Spectator, and Alexander Pope satirized inappropriate poetic diction in his 1727 Peri Bathos. William Wordsworth: \\"There will also be found in these volumes little of what is usually called poetic diction\\". The Romantics explicitly rejected the use of poetic diction, a term which William Wordsworth uses pejoratively in the 1802 \\"Preface to Lyrical Ballads\\": :\\"There will also be found in these volumes little of what is usually called poetic diction; I have taken as much pains to avoid it as others ordinarily take to produce it; this I have done for the reason already alleged, to bring my language near to the language of men, and further, because the pleasure which I have proposed to myself to impart is of a kind very different from that which is supposed by many persons to be the proper object of poetry.\\" In an appendix, \\"By what is usually called poetic diction\\", Wordsworth goes on to define the poetic diction he rejects as above all characterized by heightened and unusual words and especially by \\"a mechanical adoption of... figures of speech, ... sometimes with propriety, but much more frequently applied... to feelings and ideas with which they had no natural connection whatsoever\\". The reason that a special poetic diction remote from prose usage gives pleasure to readers, suggests Wordsworth, is \\"its influence in impressing a notion of the peculiarity and exaltation of the Poet's character, and in flattering the Reader's self-love by bringing him nearer to a sympathy with that character.\\" As an extreme example of the mechanical use of conventionally \\"poetic\\" metaphors, Wordsworth quotes an 18th-century metrical paraphrase of a passage from the Old Testament: :How long, shall sloth usurp thy useless hours, :Unnerve thy vigour, and enchain thy powers? :While artful shades thy downy couch enclose, :And soft solicitation courts repose, :Amidst the drowsy charms of dull delight, :Year chases year with unremitted flight, :Till want now following, fraudulent and slow, :Shall spring to seize thee, like an ambushed foe.Wordsworth wrongly attributes the passage to Samuel Johnson; it is actually by Anna Williams (1706‚Äì1783), from her Miscellanies in Prose and Verse, 1766. \\"From this hubbub of words\\", comments Wordsworth, \\"pass to the original... 'How long wilt thou sleep, O Sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep. So shall thy poverty come as one that travaileth, and thy want as an armed man.'\\" (Proverbs, vii, 6) At the same time, Wordsworth with Coleridge had an interest in the archaisms found in the border regions of England and introduced dialect into their poetry. While such language was \\"unnatural\\" to the London readership, Wordsworth was careful to point out that he was using it not for an exotic or elevated effect, but as a sample of the contemporary \\"language of men\\", specifically the language of poor, uneducated country folk. On the other hand, the later Romantic poet John Keats had a new interest in the poetry of Spenser and in the \\"ancient English\\" bards, and so his language was often quite elevated and archaic. Modernism, on the other hand, rejected specialized poetic diction altogether and without reservation. Ezra Pound, in his Imagist essay/manifesto A Few Don'ts (1913) warned against using superfluous words, especially adjectives (compare the use of adjectives in the 18th-century poem quoted above) and also advised the avoidance of abstractions, stating his belief that 'the natural object is always the adequate symbol'. Since the Modernists, poetry has approached all words as inherently interesting, and some schools of poetry after the Modernists (Minimalism and Plain language, in particular) have insisted on making diction itself the subject of poetry.

It has about 6,900 inhabitants. The town gave its name to the Battle of Austerlitz which took place several kilometres to the west of the town. History At the beginning of the 13th century, the Teutonic Order built a monastery stronghold whose remains can still be seen today in the vaults of the Austerlitz Palace. The first written testimony about the place date from 1237. The Czech name Slavkov is first documented in 1361, the German name Austerlitz in 1633. After the defeat of the Order in the Battle of Grunwald, the town became the property of a number of noble owners until, in 1509, the local noble family of Kaunitz assumed control for more than 400 years. Sights * Baroque Slavkov Castle has 115 rooms and an impressive garden in the French style. The Palace was designed by Italian architect Domenico Martinelli. In its historic salon, an armistice was signed between Austria and France after the battle of Austerlitz on 2 December, 1805. There is a small historic museum (only in Czech) and a multimedia presentation about the battle. * On the main square is a late Renaissance town hall and mansion. Parts of the old town wall can also be seen. * Church of the Resurrection of the Lord (on the south side of the main square). The classicist building with three pulpits was designed from 1786‚Äì1789 by the Viennese architect Johann Ferdinand Hetzendorf von Hohenberg. * Church of St. John the Baptist (in the cemetery). Beneath the church is a vault which contains the tombs of the Kaunitz family. * Chapel of St. Urbanus (to the north on the Urbanus hill). The chapel of 1712 was badly damaged during the battle of Austerlitz and had to be rebuilt during 1858‚Äì1861. * Jewish Heritage. Only the synagogue (built in 1858) remains from the Jewish ghetto. There is also a Jewish cemetery a little bit outside the town. \\"Austerlitz\\" is a Jewish family name, of which the bearers are nowadays spread worldwide but which indicate and ultimate family origin in the town ‚Äì see Austerlitz (family). The dancer Fred Astaire was born Fred Austerlitz, and thus it could be assumed that his ancestors lived in this town. =Monuments of the Battle of Austerlitz= The Battle of Austerlitz actually took place several kilometers to the west of Slavkov u Brna. Public transport to the site is limited, and the landscape has preserved its bucolic aspect. Agriculture still dominates the hilly terrain which has not changed much (apart from the sprawl of the villages). A highway bisects the battlefield. * The Old Post (Star√° po≈°ta) in Kovalovice is an original building dating from 1785, which now serves as a hotel and restaurant. On 28 November 1805, the French cavalry general Murat set up his headquarters here. On the day of the battle, the Russian general Bagration had his headquarters here. After the battle, Napoleon slept in this house and held preliminary negotiations about an armistice. A small museum commemorates these events. * On Santon Hill to east of Tvaro≈æn√° is a small white chapel. The hill was a mainstay of the French position and allowed the French artillery to dominate the northern portion of the battlefield. Below the hill, the yearly historical reenactments take place. * On ≈Ωur√°≈à Hill Napoleon Bonaparte had his headquarters. A granite monument depicts the battlefield positions. * In ≈†lapanice there is a number of mass graves with a monument. * The Peace Memorial (Mohyla m√≠ru) on Prace Hill. The memorial near Prace was designed and built in the Art-Nouveau style by Josef Fanta, an architect from Prague, during 1910 to 1912. The World War I postponed the monument's dedication until 1923. It is 26 m high, square, with four female statues symbolizing France, Austria, Russia and Moravia. Within is a chapel with an ossuary. A small museum commemorates the battle. Every year, the events of the battle of Austerlitz are commemorated in a ceremony. * Near K≈ôenovice stands a weathered peace cross. * The Old Vineyards (Star√© vinohrady) near Bla≈æovice saw the bloody collision of the French and Russian guards. In 2005, a new Monument to the Three Emperors has been erected. Trivia Much in the same way that in London, the English have named Waterloo Station to commemorate their victory at Waterloo, the French gave the name of Austerlitz to one of the major Parisian train stations, the Gare d'Austerlitz. There is also a Quai d'Austerlitz in the 13th arrondissement of Paris. In the Netherlands a small village was founded in commemoration of the battle, see: Austerlitz (Netherlands).

Kuhn was born in Germantown, Province of Pennsylvania, son of German immigrant parents. He studied medicine under his father, Dr. Adam Simon Kuhn. Then he went to Sweden and studied medicine and natural history 1761‚Äì1764 at Uppsala University, where he was probably the only American student of Carl Linnaeus. He continued his studies at the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated as M.D. in June 1767, and published his thesis, De Lavatione frigida. Returning to America, he practiced as a physician in Philadelphia and was 1768‚Äì1789 professor of Materia medica and 1789‚Äì1797 of the Theory and Practice of Medicine at the Medical School of the College of Philadelphia (later the University of Pennsylvania), founded in 1765 as the first faculty of Medicine in the thirteen colonies.

He founded the Corcoran Gallery of Art. Early life William Corcoran in 1867 Corcoran was born on December 27, 1798 in Georgetown in the District of Columbia. He was one of 12 children (six boys and six girls), six of whom survived to maturity, born to Thomas Corcoran (1754‚Äì1830), a well-to-do merchant twice elected as mayor of Georgetown, and Hannah Lemmon (1765‚Äì1823). His father was born in Ireland, settled in Georgetown in 1788, and established a leather business. William Corcoran was raised in Georgetown where he studied classics and mathematics at local private schools run by Alexander Kirk and the Reverend Addison Belt, and also took classes for a year at Georgetown College, the predecessor of Georgetown University. Instead of finishing his education, he joined the family business and developed a successful business career. Career Corcoran entered business at the age of 17, working in dry goods store owned by two brothers, and opened his own branch store two years later. Corcoran brothers established a wholesale auction and commission business, but their ventures failed after the Panic of 1819. He worked in another family business, and in 1828, he took control of large amount of real estate from his father. Corcoran was employed as a clerk at the Bank of Columbia at Georgetown branch, and then as a real estate and loan manager at the Second Bank of the United States in Washington.Janet L. Coryell. Corcoran, William Wilson. American National Biography Online. February 2000. Retrieved December 27, 2015. He also participated in the domestic slave trade. In 1837, Corcoran established a brokerage firm on Pennsylvania Avenue at 15th Street. He was successful and in 1840 entered into a partnership with George Washington Riggs, a son of Elisha Riggs. The Corcoran and Riggs private banking firm enjoyed the patronage of Treasury Secretary Levi Woodbury and prospered after it re-sold to investors $5 million of U.S. Treasury notes in 1843.Chevy Chase Trust Company and Its Heritage ‚Äì Part 1: From Corcoran to Riggs In 1845, it purchased the former Second Bank of the United States building located on 15th Street at New York Avenue. In Spring 1847, the Corcoran and Riggs sold to investors at home and abroad the bulk of two issues of the U.S. Treasury Mexican War bonds; Corcoran's earnings were $1 million. In 1854, Corcoran retired from Corcoran and Riggs to focus on his investments in real estate, land grants, armaments, railroads, as well as pursue pleasure and philanthropic endeavors. =Philanthropy= In 1854, after his retirement, he devoted himself and his substantial fortune to art and philanthropy. In 1848, Corcoran had purchased 15 acres (6 ha) of land for Oak Hill Cemetery, which overlooks Rock Creek Park. He organized the Oak Hill Cemetery Company to oversee the cemetery, which was formally incorporated by Act of Congress on March 3, 1849. Corcoran paid for the construction of a Gothic Revival chapel in Oak Hill Cemetery, commonly known as the Renwick Chapel. Corcoran also established a $10,000 fund, administered by the Benevolent Society, to purchase firewood for the poor in Georgetown. Corcoran also gave many gifts to several universities, including The George Washington University, the Maryland Agricultural College, the College of William and Mary, and Washington and Lee University. Corcoran also contributed to a fund to purchase George Washington's Mount Vernon estate, after his family could no longer keep it up, and the federal government refused to purchase it. One of William Wilson Corcoran's longtime business associate and friend was the renowned George Peabody. =Art= Portrait by William Oliver Stone In contrast to many contemporary art patrons, Corcoran was not exclusively interested in European works, and he assembled one of the first important collections of American art. By the mid-1850s his pictures and sculpture were overflowing his mansion on Lafayette Square and he hired the foremost architect of the day, James Renwick, to build a picture gallery in the Second Empire style on Pennsylvania Avenue. Before it was ready, however, the Civil War began, and Corcoran, a Southern sympathizer, left Washington for Paris, where his son-in-law, George Eustis Jr., was a representative of the Confederacy. Architect James Renwick was commissioned in 1859 to a museum building to house William Wilson Corcoran‚Äôs growing art collection. Corcoran was a southern sympathizer and good friend of Robert E. Lee, and felt it opportune to leave for Europe during the Civil War. The half- finished building designed by Renwick was taken over by the U.S. Government and used as a supply depot. When the war was over, Corcoran returned to Washington; the building was finished in 1869 and the Corcoran Gallery of Art opened in 1874, but the structure was soon outgrown. A new building for the Corcoran Gallery of Art and its nascent school of art (now the Corcoran College of Art + Design) was designed by American architect Ernest Flagg in the Beaux-Arts Style and completed in 1897, nine years after Corcoran‚Äôs death. The fa√ßade of the building reflects the ‚ÄúNeo-Grec,‚Äù an offshoot of the Beaux- Arts style that attempted to reflect the functions of the building by revealing detailed and decorative accents on the exterior. The Corcoran‚Äôs first home is now the Renwick Gallery, a Smithsonian museum. Corcoran made many other important bequests to the people of Washington, among them the Louise Home for Women, several departments of the Columbian University (now the George Washington University), and the land and half the construction costs for what is now the Church of the Ascension and Saint Agnes. Corcoran was also the President of the Corporation of Columbian (George Washington) University. Early in 1883, Corcoran arranged to have the body of John Howard Payne returned to the United States, an expense he personally bore. Payne, actor, poet, and author of \\"Home! Sweet Home!\\" had been the United States Consul to the Bey of Tunis in 1852 and had died there. Payne had been good friends of Corcoran and his business partner, George W. Riggs in 1850, prior to Payne's second appointment as Consul to Tunis. Personal life In 1835, Corcoran eloped and married Louise Morris (1818‚Äì1840), who was the daughter of Commodore Charles Morris (1784‚Äì1856) and the older sister of Robert Murray Morris (1824‚Äì1896). Before his wife's early death on November 21, 1840, they had three children, however, only one survived into adulthood: * Harriet Louise Corcoran (1836‚Äì1837), who died in infancy. * Louise Morris Corcoran (1838‚Äì1867), who married George Eustis, Jr. (1828‚Äì1872) in 1859. * Charles Morris Corcoran (1840‚Äì1841), who also died in infancy. After his wife died in 1840, Corcoran chose not to marry again. He died on February 24, 1888 in Washington, DC and is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery. Corcoran joined the Potomac Lodge No. 5 of Free and Accepted Masons in Georgetown and was raised as a Master Mason on July 26, 1827.Potomac Lodge #5: The Gavel Today, The Masons of GergetownDistrict of Columbia list of historic sites , DC.gov =Descendants= Through his surviving daughter Louise, he was the grandfather of William Corcoran Eustis (1862‚Äì1921) and Louise Marie Eustis Hitchcock (1867‚Äì1934), who married Thomas Hitchcock (1860‚Äì1941), in 1891. =Legacy= The bank Corcoran co-founded in 1840 existed as Riggs Bank up until 2005, when it was taken over by PNC Bank. The Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. was one of the oldest American private museums focusing on American art until it was dissolved in 2014 with its holdings transferred to the National Gallery of Art. Corcoran has a street named after him in the Dupont Circle neighborhood in the District of Columbia between Q street and R street NW, one block away from Riggs Street. As well, the Corcoran neighborhood in Minneapolis, Minnesota which is bounded by East Lake Street to the north, East 36th Street to the south, Hiawatha Avenue to the east, and Cedar Avenue to the west, is named for William Corcoran.

Born in the town of Kola≈°in, he earned a doctorate degree in law and became the Minister of Justice and Finance in the Kingdom of Montenegro before the outbreak of World War I. During the interwar period, he was a leading member of the \\"Greens\\" (zelena≈°i), a Montenegrin separatist movement. A proponent of the theory that Montenegrins were an ethnic group distinct from Serbs, he also founded and became the leader of the Montenegrin Federalist Party. Following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Drljeviƒá began cooperating with the Italian authorities occupying Montenegro. In July, he proclaimed the reestablishment of the Kingdom of Montenegro, but his attempt to establish an Axis-aligned puppet state triggered an immediate uprising. That September, Italian authorities sent him to an internment camp in Italy after the outbreak of an anti-fascist revolt. Drljeviƒá escaped the camp several months later and made his way into the German-held half of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH). In the summer of 1944, he created the Montenegrin State Council in Zagreb. Drljeviƒá moved back to Montenegro in 1945 and agreed to the formation of the Montenegrin National Army with Chetnik commander Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá. ƒêuri≈°iƒá and several other Chetnik commanders were later ambushed and murdered on behalf of Drljeviƒá and the NDH. ƒêuri≈°iƒá's men later joined Drljeviƒá's Montenegrin National Army and withdrew with him towards the Austrian border. In mid-1945, Drljeviƒá crossed over into Austria with his wife, and the two ended up in a camp for displaced persons in Judenburg, where they were killed by Chetnik agents seeking to avenge ƒêuri≈°iƒá's death. Early life and political career Sekula Drljeviƒá, Drljeviƒá attempted to dissuade Stjepan Radiƒá from attending a session of the Yugoslav parliament prior to his assassination there in 1928 (pictured). Sekula Drljeviƒá was born on 7 September 1884 in the village of Ravno, near the town of Kola≈°in. Having finished law school in Zagreb and earned a doctorate degree, he became the Minister of Justice and Finance in the Kingdom of Montenegro in 1910. His brother Janko Drljeviƒá was at that time an MP from the loyalist True People's Party. Drljeviƒá also became an MP, and also served as a minister in King Nikola's cabinet during the Balkan Wars (1912‚Äì13), and was renowned for his rhetorical skills. During World War I, he was captured by Austro-Hungarian forces and interned at the Boldagason internment camp in Hungary, where he grew strongly opposed to King Nikola. He was released after the war and moved to Zemun and worked as a lawyer there. He became a leading member of the \\"Greens\\" (zelena≈°i), a Montenegrin separatist movement which sided with the Yugoslav Federalist Party. During this time, he cooperated frequently with Croatian politicians such as Stjepan Radiƒá, Vlatko Maƒçek, and Ante Paveliƒá, with whom he became good friends. In the mid-1920s, Drljeviƒá founded the Montenegrin Federalist Party. He quickly became the party's sole leader and foremost theoretician. He expressed support for the unity of Yugoslavia and stressed Montenegro's loyalty to Serbian nationhood, but argued that a nation did not necessarily need to be part of a single state and hinted that he would support the restoration of Montenegro's independence. Consequently, the \\"Greens\\" demanded that Yugoslavia's internal boundaries be organized to match the borders of the Balkan states as they were prior to 1918. Drljeviƒá and Mihailo Ivanoviƒá had first attempted to found the Montenegrin Party for the 1920 election of a Constitutional Assembly, but were unable to do so due to a lack of time and resistance by the authorities. Drljeviƒá ran unsuccessfully for the Montenegrin Federalist Party in the 1923 elections in both the counties of Nik≈°iƒá and Kola≈°in. He ran again in Kola≈°in in 1925 and was successfully elected to the National Assembly. In 1927, Drljeviƒá was elected representative of the Zemun District on the electoral list of the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS). Afterwards, he helped solve a political rift between Radiƒá and Serb politician Svetozar Pribiƒáeviƒá, resulting in the formation of an HSS‚ÄìDemocratic Party coalition. The following year, Drljeviƒá unsuccessfully attempted to dissuade Radiƒá from attending the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes prior to his assassination by Serb politician Puni≈°a Raƒçiƒá. World War II =Montenegrin leader= On 6 April 1941, Axis forces invaded Yugoslavia. Montenegro was invaded by the forces of Germany and Italy, with the Germans attacking from Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Italians from Albania. The Germans later withdrew, leaving the Italians to occupy the area. In the western portion of Yugoslavia, Paveliƒá, who had been in exile in Benito Mussolini's Italy, was appointed Poglavnik (leader) of an Usta≈°e-led Croatian state ‚Äì the Independent State of Croatia (, NDH). The NDH combined almost all of modern-day Croatia, all of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern-day Serbia into an \\"Italian-German quasi- protectorate\\". NDH authorities, led by the Usta≈°e Militia, subsequently implemented genocidal policies against the Serb, Jewish and Romani population living within the borders of the new state. The creation of an Axis puppet- state known as the Kingdom of Montenegro was proclaimed on 12 July 1941. The state was to be headed by an Italian regent and led by Drljeviƒá and his supporters. By 13 July, this proclamation prompted the outbreak of an anti- Italian uprising in Montenegro led by local communists (Partisans) and Serb nationalists (Chetniks). Having assumed power the previous day, Drljeviƒá established the Provisional Administrative Committee of Montenegro, a collaborationist entity which was a territorial component of the Italian Empire. He also organized his followers to fight against Montenegrin Chetniks and the Yugoslav Partisans. In September, he was dismissed from office by the Italians. Believing his life was endangered by the revolt, they sent him to an internment camp in Italy. The idea of an independent Montenegro was abandoned, and the Italians opted for a military governorate. Several months later, Drljeviƒá escaped and smuggled himself into the German-controlled area of the NDH. With the surrender of Italy in September 1943, he moved back to Zemun. In the summer of 1944 Drljeviƒá relocated to Zagreb, where he created a Montenegrin State Council in the NDH with the assistance of the Germans and Croats. He also published a pamphlet in Zagreb titled Who are the Serbs? (). In it, he blamed supposedly \\"aggressive\\" Serb policies for all past and modern problems in the Balkans, presented ethnic Serbs as a \\"degenerate race\\" and pointed out their similarities with Jews. Following the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, Drljeviƒá had become a proponent of the theory that Montenegrins were an ethnic group distinct from Serbs. As early as 1921, he had stated that Serbian and Montenegrin \\"mentalities\\" were diametrically opposed. He stated: \\"The mentalities of Serbians and Montenegrins are irreconcilable. The visage of the former was speckled with [Ottoman] slavery; liberty gave the latter a new visage.\\" It was not until 1941 that Drljeviƒá advanced the notion that Montenegrins were not Slavs at all, but Dinaric people descended from the ancient Illyrians. He wrote: > Races are communities of blood, whereas people are creatures of history. > With their language, the Montenegrin people belong to the Slavic linguistic > community. By their blood, however, they belong [to the Dinaric peoples]. > According to the contemporary science of European races, [Dinaric] peoples > are descended from the Illyrians. Hence, not just the kinship, but the > identity of certain cultural forms among the Dinaric peoples, all the way > from Albanians to South Tyroleans, who are Germanized Illyrians. =Retreat and death= In the spring of 1945, Drljeviƒá visited parts of Montenegro held by the Chetniks of Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá. It was here that ƒêuri≈°iƒá made a safe-conduct agreement with Drljeviƒá and with elements of the Armed Forces of the NDH. Although the details of the agreement are unknown, it appears to have been agreed that ƒêuri≈°iƒá and his men were to move into the NDH and cross the Sava River into Slavonia where they would be aligned with Drljeviƒá as the Montenegrin National Army, with ƒêuri≈°iƒá retaining operational command. Suspicious of Drljeviƒá's intentions, ƒêuri≈°iƒá tried to outsmart him and his forces by sending only his sick and wounded across the Sava, keeping his fit troops south of the river. Following his defeat at the Battle of Lijevƒçe Field, north of Banja Luka, and the defection of one of his sub-units to Drljeviƒá, ƒêuri≈°iƒá was forced to negotiate directly with the leaders of the NDH forces about the further movement of his units towards Slovenia. This appears to have been a trap, as he was attacked and captured by them on his way to the meeting. On 17 April 1945, after he returned to Zagreb, Drljeviƒá issued a proclamation with his political program and invited his \\"army\\" to fight both new Yugoslavia and Chetniks of Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá. On 20 April, ƒêuri≈°iƒá, Petar Baƒáoviƒá, Dragi≈°a Vasiƒá and Zaharije Ostojiƒá were taken to the Stara Gradi≈°ka prison, near Jasenovac. The Usta≈°e gathered them in a field alongside 5,000 other Chetnik prisoners and arranged for Drljeviƒá and his followers to select 150 Chetnik officers and non-combatant intellectuals for execution. ƒêuri≈°iƒá, Baƒáoviƒá, Vasiƒá and Ostojiƒá were amongst those selected. They and the others were loaded onto boats by the Usta≈°e and taken across the Sava River, where they were killed either in the Jasenovac concentration camp itself or in a nearby marsh. Both the NDH forces and Drljeviƒá had reasons for ensnaring ƒêuri≈°iƒá. The NDH forces were motivated by the mass terror committed by ƒêuri≈°iƒá on the Muslim population in Sand≈æak and southeastern Bosnia while Drljeviƒá was opposed to ƒêuri≈°iƒá's support of a union of Serbia and Montenegro which ran counter to Drljeviƒá's separatism. Left without a leader, the majority of ƒêuri≈°iƒá's men were integrated into Drljeviƒá's Montenegrin National Army and withdrew with him towards the Austrian border. In the second half of May, the troops of the Montenegrin National Army surrendered to the British and were quickly turned back into Yugoslavia and into the hands of the communists. Drljeviƒá managed to evade capture, and he and his wife sought refuge at a camp for displaced persons in the Austrian town of Judenburg. On 10 November 1945, three of ƒêuri≈°iƒá's followers discovered them there and murdered them by slitting their throats. Legacy In 1944, Drljeviƒá rearranged the lyrics of the Montenegrin patriotic song \\"Oj, svijetla majska zoro\\" to celebrate the creation of the Montenegrin puppet regime that had been established in July 1941. He was declared a war criminal at the Nuremberg Trials in 1946. When \\"Oj, svijetla majska zoro\\" was chosen as the national anthem of Montenegro in 2006 with Drljeviƒá's additions intact, many Montenegrin Serbs and unionists protested the selection due to its fascist connotations.

The film satirizes pornographic stories through the adventures of its naive heroine, Candy, played by Ewa Aulin. It stars Charles Aznavour, Marlon Brando, Richard Burton, James Coburn, John Huston, Walter Matthau, and Ringo Starr. Popular figures such as Sugar Ray Robinson, Anita Pallenberg, Florinda Bolkan, Maril√π Tolo, Nicoletta Machiavelli, Umberto Orsini, and Enrico Maria Salerno also appear in cameo roles. Plot High school student Candy Christian seemingly descends to Earth from space. Following a poetry recital at Candy's school, eccentric Welsh poet MacPhisto offers her a ride home in his limousine. En route, MacPhisto forces himself on her, but is unable to proceed after becoming too inebriated. With the help of her Mexican gardener, Emmanuel, Candy takes MacPhisto inside in order to help him out of his liquor-soaked clothes. In the basement, MacPhisto drunkenly recites poetry while humping a mannequin, inciting Emmanuel to sexually assault Candy. Scandalized upon walking in on the scene, Candy's uptight father (also her high school teacher) decides to send her away to live with his twin brother Jack and his wife Livia in New York City. At the airport, the family is accosted by Emmanuel's three vengeful sisters, who accuse Candy of corrupting their brother. During the scuffle, Candy's father is rendered unconscious due to a head injury. The Christians escape by boarding a military plane commanded by General Smight, who later orders Candy to undress while expressing a desire to impregnate her. Meanwhile, he accidentally pushes the button that signals his paratroopers to leap from the plane. When General Smight realizes this, he jumps as well, only to slip out of his parachute harness. Upon landing in New York, Dr. Krankheit meticulously performs surgery on Candy's father in front of an audience. When Uncle Jack attempts to seduce Candy during a post-operative cocktail party, the hospital's executive director, Dr. Dunlap, berates her for her perceived lewd behavior, causing her to faint. Dr. Krankheit takes Candy to another room and tricks her into sex by pretending to examine her. While searching for her father, Candy wanders back into the operating room to find that Dr. Krankeit has branded all the nurses with his initials, as he prepares to do so to Livia. When he attempts to have Candy captured so that she is next, she flees the hospital. After wandering aimlessly on the streets of New York, Candy ends up in a Sicilian bar, where she is beset by a group of mobsters, until an offbeat underground filmmaker, G3, shows up, taking her into the men's room and shooting her for a film. As the room floods due to broken pipes, two policemen arrive and assault G3, whereupon a drenched Candy escapes. In Central Park, she meets a hunchback who takes her into a deserted mansion later that night. A gang of thieves walks in and proceeds to ransack the place, while the hunchback rapes Candy on top of a grand piano. After arresting Candy, the two policemen maliciously plan to frisk her. However, they lose control of their squad car and crash into a club full of drag queens. As mayhem ensues, Candy escapes again. The next morning, Candy asks for a ride in the back of a semi-trailer truck, which turns out to be the sanctum of Grindl, a sham guru. He talks Candy into sex by taking her through the \\"seven stages\\" of enlightenment. After several days on the road, Grindl informs Candy that a different guru will guide her through the rest of her journey. Upon arrival in California, Candy is chased through the desert by the New York police officers, but she manages to outwit them. Shortly thereafter, Candy finds her new guru‚Äîa robed figure sporting a toucan on his shoulder, his face covered with white clay. She follows him into an underground Hindu temple, which then partially collapses due to a cataclysm. As the two proceed to have sex, Candy is shocked to discover the guru is actually her brain-damaged father, after his face is washed clean. As Candy wanders across a field‚Äîsurrounded by flapping banners and hippies playing music‚Äîshe revisits many of the characters she met throughout the film, before finally returning to outer space. Cast Production Coburn said \\"‚ÄòThat film could have been a lot more funny. Unfortunately, the director‚Äôs timing was of a European nature. The jokes were always a beat behind. They were often a beat off. When you do comedy, you‚Äôve got to be fast. I think (star) Ewa Aulin only did two films after CANDY. Then she married an Italian count or baron. That was also the only film that I made any money on. I had a percentage of the profits. Marlon Brando and Richard Burton had the same deal. It‚Äôs very unusual for an actor to see anything extra. Of course, that was before the studios set up their Chinese bookkeeping system (laughs).‚Äù Reception Candy was one of many psychedelic films that emerged as the 1960s ended, along with Yellow Submarine, The Trip, Psych-Out, and Head. The film opened to moderate box office, but later became a cult classic from the psychedelic years of film. It was the 18th highest-grossing film of 1968. According to Variety, the film earned North American rentals of $7.3 million, but because of costs (including over $1 million paid out in participation fees), recorded an overall loss of $25,000. It was the 12th most popular film at the UK box office in 1969. Reviews were generally positive with a few misgivings. In a review representative of most professional reviewers at the time, Roger Ebert found it \\"a lot better than you might expect\\" but missed the \\"anarchy, the abandon, of Terry Southern's novel\\". Renata Adler of The New York Times decried \\"its relentless, crawling, bloody lack of talent\\". In 1969, the film earned Aulin a nomination for New Star of the Year ‚Äì Actress at the 26th Golden Globe Awards. The film's soundtrack included \\"Rock Me\\", an original song from Steppenwolf which became a top-10 success for the band in the spring of 1969. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 57% based on 7 retrospectively collected reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. Home media Candy was released on DVD by Anchor Bay on April 10, 2001, as a region 1 widescreen DVD, and was released on Blu- ray by Kino Lorber on May 17, 2016, as a region A widescreen Blu-ray.

Halfdan Cleve born Halfdan Klewe (5 October 1879 ‚Äì 6 April 1951) was a Norwegian composer, and father or the pianist and composer Cissi Cleve.  Biography  Cleve was born and raised in Kongsberg, Norway. He lived some time in Germany. Some examples on his output as a composer are piano concertos, other piano works, and some chamber music. He was described as a child prodigy. He married pianist Berit Winderen (10 February 1878‚Äì23 September 1964) and they had four children. Throughout his early childhood he was tutored with a firm hand by his father, the organist Andreas Klewe. A child prodigy, he made his first appearances on the concert stage at the age of five. The strictness of his training is exemplified by the fact that he was not allowed to play anything other than the works of Johann Sebastian Bach until he was sixteen. For the next three years his musical training was undertaken by Otto Winter-Hjelm, after which he studied in Berlin under Professor Raif and the brothers Xaver and Philipp Scharwenka. In 1902 he married Berit Winderen, a student of Teresa Carre√±o, and made numerous concert appearances together, both in Norway and abroad. Cleve composed five piano concertos, a violin sonata, a piano quintet, songs with orchestral accompaniment and over one hundred piano pieces. In the last period of his life (1926-50), he worked as piano teacher at Music Conservatory in Oslo and died 1951 in Oslo.

These locomotives were in regular service on the Irish railway network until 2002, with the last two remaining in service until 2008.  History  The 121 Class locomotives were manufactured from December 1960 to January 1961 and numbered B121 to B135 inclusive. From the early 1970s onwards several locomotives of this class dropped the \\"B\\" prefix from their fleet number when re-liveried. The last two locomotives that survived in traffic (124 and B134) were both withdrawn from service on 3 May 2008. Prior to 1961, almost all Irish diesel locomotives were built in Great Britain, but from the 1960s onwards, GM became the sole supplier of locomotives to CI√â, which eventually also extended to Northern Ireland Railways locomotives at a later stage. These were EMD's first ever fully American-built locomotives delivered to Europe. The Class 121 locomotives were a typical American-style single cab ‚Äòroad switcher'. The layout of the cab was quite different from the other conventional CI√â diesel models of the time, with the controls to the side of the driver, rather than the front. Due to apparent driver complaints of reduced visibility when operating with cab trailing, it was ultimately decided that these locomotives should only operate in a cab-leading formation. Later conversion for multiple- unit working allowed two 121 class locomotives to be coupled hood-end to hood- end, removing the need to turn them around for their return journey. Although originally fitted with an EMD 8-567CR engine of , all were later fitted with 645 type \\"power packs\\" (piston & liner assemblies) for parts standardisation, while at the same time keeping their original power output for reliability reasons. They weighed and had a maximum speed of . Numbers B126-B129 were later rebuilt with an EMD 8-645E engine of ; as used in the 181 Class locomotives. The engine blocks were originally recycled from withdrawn rebuilt class B201s, but in their later years much swapping of engines occurred between classes 121, 141 and 181. All but three (B121, B125, and B135) were fitted with Train Door Control equipment for operation with the Inchicore- built, BR Mark 3 based, Push-Pull train units. The push-pull equipment of locomotive B132 was subsequently decommissioned. Entering service in 1989, these trains, consisting of a single 121 Class and up to six carriages, were mainly used on the Dublin northern suburban passenger railway service. These were to be the last regular passenger duties for the 121s within Greater Dublin. The Limerick shuttle continued to be worked by 121s for several years after this date. In 1994, a railcar \\"revolution\\" had begun, and the push pull carriages were later re-deployed to inter-city duties with the 201 Class locomotives.  Withdrawal  B126 on trial at Nesbitt Junction, near Enfield, County Meath on 24 February 1961 The first member of the class to be withdrawn was 125 in 1986 following an electrical fire, though it had been extensively damaged in an accident twelve years previously. However it was not scrapped until 2002. By 1995, the class 201 had replaced the class 121 on most passenger routes. Throughout the late 1990s the fleet dwindled, and by 2005 only numbers 124 and B134 remained in service, with number 123 in storage for five years until eventually being scrapped in 2008. The rest of the fleet was also scrapped, due to the decline in freight traffic that they were also used for. Their last official scheduled mainline passenger working was on 9 July 2005 on the Sligo line. The last known passenger working of this class was the 13:15 Waterford-Heuston service on 18 January 2007. Previously, these locomotives had filled in on the Manulla-Ballina service or the occasional service from Limerick. The very last use of them in public service was in the early months of 2008 on maintenance trains - by this stage 124 and B134 were the only survivors. Both were retired by degrees and officially withdrawn in July 2008, though at this stage neither had done much for many weeks.  Preservation  No. 134, preserved by the RPSI, At Dublin Connolly The Irish Traction Group has preserved locomotive 124. It is located at Moyasta Junction on the preserved West Clare Railway. The other surviving member of the class, locomotive B134, is owned by the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland (RPSI), and is undergoing restoration.The Irish Mail, Journal of The Irish Traction Group, May 2010. On 19 July 2016 it was hauled by 071 Class locomotive 071 from Inchicore to the RPSI's locomotive shed at Dublin Connolly. Later that year it was returned to Inchicore, and work is continuing to restore it for mainline railtour use. The cab of locomotive 133 is preserved at the Cavan & Leitrim Railway in Dromod, County Leitrim.  Livery  On delivery, the locomotives were painted in a Yellow and Grey livery. This was replaced within a year by a black / tan (‚Äúgolden brown‚Äù) colour scheme with a thick white band similar to the Cravens coaching stock, delivered in 1963. With time, the colour scheme changed to tan with a black band. Soon after CI√â Rail services became known as Irish Rail, the colour scheme was enhanced when two white bands (approx. 25 mm / 1\\") separating the colours were added. At the same time, as a safety aspect, self-adhesive high-visibility panels were added to the front of the Locomotives. Gort station on the Western Railway Corridor in 1986.

Together with Jos√© de Anchieta, he was very influential in the early history of Brazil and participated in the founding of several cities, such as Recife, Salvador, Rio de Janeiro, and S√£o Paulo, as well as many Jesuit colleges and seminaries. Early life N√≥brega was born on October 18, 1517, in Sanfins do Douro, Tr√°s-os-Montes e Alto Douro, Portugal, to an important family; his father was Baltasar da N√≥brega, a prominent judge of justice. Manuel da Nobrega studied humanities at Porto and Salamanca, Spain and at the University of Coimbra, where he obtained his baccalaureate in canon law and philosophy in 1541. He entered the Jesuit novitiate in 1544 and, after being ordained, carried out pastoral work in the regions of Entre-Douro-e-Minho and Beira. Missionary in Brazil In 1549, he joined the naval fleet of the first Portuguese Governor-General Tom√© de Sousa (1502‚Äì1579) following a request by King John III of Portugal to the Society of Jesus to start the missionary work of converting the Amerindians, who were in the eyes of the Catholic Church, of building churches and religious seminars, and of educating the colonists. N√≥brega arrived in the captaincy of Bahia on March 29, 1549, accompanied by five other Jesuits. The Governor-General's first actions were to found the colonial capital city of Salvador (The Savior, in Portuguese) and to celebrate its first Mass in 1549. N√≥brega and his colleagues tried to fulfill their mission but faced many difficulties because the colonists mistreated and tried to enslave the Indians. He soon was fiercely engaged in the defense of the Indians, which led to serious clashes with inhabitants and authorities of the new colony, alike, including the first Governor-General and the one who succeeded him, Duarte da Costa. To gain authority in his fight against the colonists, N√≥brega asked the King to establish an episcopacy in Brazil, which was granted on February 25, 1551. The first Bishop of Brazil, Dom Pedro Fernandes Sardinha took office on June 22, 1552. By then, N√≥brega had already created the Jesuit College of Salvador. N√≥brega was then nominated the first Provincial of the Society of Jesus in the New World, a post that he held until 1559. However, Dom Sardinha was killed and eaten by hostile Indians after a shipwreck, changing N√≥brega's mind about the Indian mission. Sensing the difficulties of converting adult Indians to Christianity, N√≥brega determined that the Jesuits' efforts should concentrate on the teaching of children, who were more pliable. The Jesuits started to create elementary schools for teaching Portuguese and Latin, basic literacy, and religion. The Jesuits discovered that singing was a very effective way of winning the attention of the students, and N√≥brega was one of the pioneers in using music in education in Brazil. To help the evangelization of children, N√≥brega had the idea of bringing in seven orphan children to Brazil and making them learn Tupi, the language of the Indians, so that they would be bilingual and act as translators. The children would often go with the Jesuits on foot to faraway places and were protected and cherished by the Indians. Several of the children became Jesuit priests, too. In 1552, N√≥brega accompanied again Tom√© de Sousa to the captaincy of S√£o Vicente, in the present-day southern state of S√£o Paulo. There, he was joined by another group of Jesuits, who had arrived with Jos√© de Anchieta, then a young novice, who travelled with Mem de S√°, the third Governor-General sent by the Crown. N√≥brega determined as the new mission of the small band of missionaries to found villages (aldeamentos) on the high plateau just above the coastline to better pursue their work of catechesis and education of the Indians. Thus, on January 25, 1554, N√≥brega and Anchieta celebrated the first mass in the new and modest Jesuit College of S√£o Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga, in honor of Saint Paul's day of conversion to Christianity. The tiny settlement around this Jesuit school was to become one of the largest metropoles of the world, S√£o Paulo. Missionary practice N√≥brega and his men began catechizing and baptizing the natives upon their arrival in Brazil. One of the early encounters with the heathens was when N√≥brega and his men tried to stop preparations for a cannibal feast and the natives rose against the Christians. The Governor's militia helped to defend the missionaries against the native uprising. Busy building chapels and schools, the missionaries boasted of the high rate of conversion of the natives. The Jesuits had begun teaching prayers to the natives as well as teaching them how to write and sing. According to a report written by N√≥brega, 500 natives had been baptized within the first five months of the arrival of the Jesuits, and many more were catechumens.Helen G. Dominian, Apostle of Brazil, New York: Exposition Press, 1958. Portuguese colonies in Brazil, like many other colonies in the Americas, had problems of slavery and concubinage being common among the new settlers. N√≥brega was concerned that the Portuguese settlers were not good examples. N√≥brega was unable to limit slavery among the Portuguese, so he chose separation instead. He moved toward the physical separation of the natives and the Portuguese to limit their contact with corrupt surroundings and focused on reducing the Jesuits‚Äô reliance on support from the Portuguese crown.Thomas Cohen, \\"'Who is My Neighbor?' The Missionary Ideals of Manuel da Nobrega\\", Jesuit Encounters in the New World: Jesuit Chroniclers, Geographers, Educators and Missionaries in the Americas, 1549-1767. Ed. Joseph A. Gagliano, and Charles E. Ronan, S.J., Instituto Storico S.I.: Roma, 1997. N√≥brega was encouraged that many natives had converted to Christianity despite being mistreated by the Europeans. The Brazilian sugar plantation colony, for example, was founded on the extensive use of Indian labor. Although this stage in the development of the Brazilian economy was temporary, the Portuguese eventually began using African slave labor, it had long-lasting effects on the morale of the native people. The Portuguese had created a society in which the natives had to live by Portuguese rules and conform to new modes of behavior, defined by European social and racial categories.Stuart B. Schwartz, Sugar Plantations in the Formation of Brazilian Society: Bahia, 1550-1835, New York: Cambridge University Press, 1985. Descriptions of natives Nobrega‚Äôs Di√°logo sobre a Convers√£o do Gentio uses the point of view of two Portuguese settlers to describe the native people of Brazil. The dialogue between the men provides insight into some of the characterizations of the native population. Gon√ßalo √Ålvares, a lay person preaching to the natives, describes them in the opening lines as \\"those beasts.\\" He dehumanizes the natives and, at the same time, questions their capacity to understand and accept Christianity. Mateus Nogueira, his companion, agrees and upholds that characterization by stating that those natives are worse than all others in the sense that they do not grasp Christianity. That description is a reflection of N√≥brega‚Äôs frustration with the native population. Later, the two characters discuss the role of a Christian among a native population. Gon√ßalo questions their goal, and Nogueira clearly states that it is charity and love of God and of neighbor. That last statement places the native peoples, as human beings, among the neighbors whom Christians, including the Portuguese settlers, must love. N√≥brega questions the importance of converting the natives. On one hand, he is unsure whether they are capable of fully grasping the concept of Christianity, especially with the language barrier. On the other hand, as a Christian and as a Jesuit, he understands his stance must be that of a kind, understanding teacher.Manuel da Nobrega, Dialogo sobre a Conversao do Gentio, Ed. Salvio M. Soares. Vol. MetaLibri2006, v1.0p. War and expansion The exploitation and massacres of Indian villages by the Portuguese colonists continued, despite the pacification efforts of N√≥brega. The Tamoio and Tupiniquim tribes, who lived along the Brazilian coast from the present-day states of Esp√≠rito Santo to Paran√°, were most affected. Rebelling, they formed a warring tribal alliance, which became the Tamoio Confederation (Confedera√ß√£o dos Tamoios, in Portuguese), and started attacks on the villages founded by the colonists. S√£o Paulo was attacked several times, but the Portuguese resisted. Hard pressed, N√≥brega tried to make a peace treaty with the Confederation, sensing that all their efforts and the Portuguese colonization were in great danger. Under considerable duress and several threats of being killed and eaten by the Indians, N√≥brega and Anchieta stayed for a time in Iperoig (present-day Ubatuba in the northern coast of S√£o Paulo), in conference with the tribal chieftains, until N√≥brega was able to achieve a temporary peace. Anchieta's command of Tupi, the language spoken by most of the Indians (of which he had compiled a vocabulary and a grammar, was extremely useful to N√≥brega, who had no such ability. The arrival of a French invasion force in 1555, in the Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro (the so-called France Antarctique episode), however, tipped the balance again since the Indians saw an opportunity to rally the Frenchmen's help to vanquish the Portuguese. Thus, N√≥brega had no alternative other than bless and support the punitive expeditions sent by the third Governor-General from Portugal, Mem de S√°, in 1560 and by his nephew, Est√°cio de S√°, in 1565. The French colonists were defeated and expelled, and their Indian allies were reduced to submission. After the expulsion of the French invaders, N√≥brega founded a new Jesuit College in Rio, the College of Saint Vincent, and was nominated its rector (dean). In 1570 he was again nominated Brazilian Provincial of the Jesuit Order, but he died before taking office, on October 18, 1570, the very day he was completing 53 years of age. Seven years later, the Jesuit Provincialship of Brazil was accepted by Anchieta, his great pupil and friend.

Early biography The old bridge at Aultgowrie Duncan MacKenzie was born on 17 May 1861 in the small, Gaelic-speaking village of Aultgowrie, in the highlands of eastern Scotland, 15 miles from the coastal town of Inverness, in Ross and Cromarty. Queen Victoria had been on the throne of the United Kingdom since 1837. As is indicated by his last name, Duncan's father, Alexander, was an offshoot of the Mackenzie clan, whose territory stretched in a band westward across Scotland. In the clan system, the chiefs, guardians of the clan, were generally well-to-do, holding clan lands in trust, but later appropriating them as private property. They resided in castles on estates. The rest of the clan members were not so, but tended to be poor families dependent in some way on the chiefs. Alexander held the position of gamekeeper of the Fairburn Estate, on which Aultgowrie was located. It was at the confluence of highland streams. The owners were the MacKenzies of Seaforth, a branch of the clan. They had a mill, and raised sheep. Duncan was the fourth of nine children of Alexander and his wife, Margaret Kennedy MacKenzie. He was named after his grandfather, Duncan. His mother was the eldest daughter of Murdoch Kennedy, a schoolteacher. The family spoke Gaelic at home. When they went to school they were required to learn English. Duncan was thus raised in a large-family, bilingual environment. He studied philosophy at the University of Edinburgh; and received his PhD from Vienna in classical archaeology. Professional career Appointed field supervisor of the excavation of Phylakopi by the British School at Athens, he worked closely with a team of professional archaeologists including Arthur Evans and David George Hogarth. They were investigating the provenance of Mycenaean pottery as defined by Heinrich Schliemann. After a few years they realised that Phylakopi was not going to yield that information. The evidence pointed toward Crete. Evans and Hogarth left Phylakopi, while MacKenzie stayed on to wind the excavation down. Within a few years the secession of Crete from the Ottoman Empire opened opportunities to excavate there. Hogarth was the first to discover it. He sent for Evans immediately, as the Phylakopi crew had been a very close-knit team. Purchasing the land at Knossos, Evans began excavation, sending for the third member of the team, MacKenzie, who took up his old position as supervisor of excavation. In her book on the Evans family (of which she was the latest member, being Arthur's half-sister), Time and Chance, Joan Evans gives this verbal portrait of MacKenzie in his prime: :Mackenzie was a Scot with an inaudible Highland voice, a brush of red hair, an uncertain temper, a great command of languages, and great experience in keeping the records of an excavation. Arthur Evans recognised his gifts, and endured his suspicious temper and his valetudinarian ways with exemplary patience. Hogarth left for other excavations and then other careers, but Evans and MacKenzie collaborated so closely on the excavation of Knossos and theorisation about it that the ideas of the two men are not distinguishable from each other. MacKenzie kept the day book, or log of daily discoveries and served as a middle man between Evans and the inhabitants of Crete. MacKenzie also wrote contributions of his own. The British connotation of \\"assistant\\" does not convey the true relationship. A PhD and professional archaeologist in his own right, MacKenzie was every bit the peer of Evans, His position as second-in-command was only a social convention. The two would work together for the next thirty years, long after the excavation was complete (1905). MacKenzie remained as curator of the site, taking up residence in the new Villa Ariadne constructed as headquarters in 1906 on the hill above the site. Prior to then the archaeologists resided and worked in a Turkish house below the site, which leaked apparently irreparably and provided difficult access to the site. Tales of the end According to Evans, Mackenzie came to suffer from severe alcoholism and could not only no longer function as curator, but was fast declining into a demented state. Evans placed him in an institution, where he died not long after. Joan Evans reports that Mackenzie had become very difficult to work with during the latter years of his curatorship because of \\"the gradual onset of his illness.\\" It has also been said that Evans found Mackenzie one night passed out on a table and fired him the next day. Friends of Mackenzie disputed this, saying he did not drink. Whether the problem was alcoholism, denied for some reason by his family, or one of the brain disorders often inflicting the elderly, which Duncan then was, or some combination, Joan adds that he died in 1935 in a state of \\"mental aberration.\\" Whatever they were, none of the final events can have been any surprise at all to Arthur, least of all any implication that Duncan was leading some sort of unknown alcoholic life until discovered suddenly one day lying in a stupor on a table. Long after the deaths of both men, after the decipherment of Linear B, attempts were made to insert an imaginary opposition and conflict between the two over the date of the Linear B tablets, which, in the slander, caused Arthur to discredit Duncan with malice aforethought and hustle him off the scene. During the lives of the two men is no indication at all in their writings of any such disagreement; moreover, Evans was of a highly charitable character, nor has the veracity of either man ever been questioned during his lifetime, as was Heinrich Schliemann's (from which he was vindicated). Post-mortem dispute After Mackenzie's death in Italy, some of Evans' system of Minoan dating came into question. Mackenzie's meticulous work was the key witness in defence of Evans' work. Though there was conflict between Evans and Mackenzie, Evans respected Mackenzie for his contributions to the excavation and paid tribute to his right-hand man in the last volume of The Palace of Minos.

Example For example, a GBPUSD contract could give the owner the right to sell ¬£1,000,000 and buy $2,000,000 on December 31. In this case the pre-agreed exchange rate, or strike price, is 2.0000 USD per GBP (or GBP/USD 2.00 as it is typically quoted) and the notional amounts (notionals) are ¬£1,000,000 and $2,000,000. This type of contract is both a call on dollars and a put on sterling, and is typically called a GBPUSD put, as it is a put on the exchange rate; although it could equally be called a USDGBP call. If the rate is lower than 2.0000 on December 31 (say 1.9000), meaning that the dollar is stronger and the pound is weaker, then the option is exercised, allowing the owner to sell GBP at 2.0000 and immediately buy it back in the spot market at 1.9000, making a profit of (2.0000 GBPUSD ‚àí 1.9000 GBPUSD) √ó 1,000,000 GBP = 100,000 USD in the process. If instead they take the profit in GBP (by selling the USD on the spot market) this amounts to 100,000 / 1.9000 = 52,632 GBP. Terms * Call option ‚Äì the right to buy an asset at a fixed date and price. * Put option ‚Äì the right to sell an asset at a fixed date and price. * Foreign exchange option ‚Äì the right to sell money in one currency and buy money in another currency at a fixed date and rate. * Strike price ‚Äì the asset price at which the investor can exercise an option. * Spot price ‚Äì the price of the asset at the time of the trade. * Forward price ‚Äì the price of the asset for delivery at a future time. * Notional ‚Äì the amount of each currency that the option allows the investor to sell or buy. * Ratio of notionals ‚Äì the strike, not the current spot or forward. * Num√©raire ‚Äì the currency in which an asset is valued. * Non-linear payoff ‚Äì the payoff for a straightforward FX option is linear in the underlying currency, denominating the payout in a given num√©raire. * Change of num√©raire ‚Äì the implied volatility of an FX option depends on the num√©raire of the purchaser, again because of the non-linearity of x \\\\mapsto 1/x. * In the money ‚Äì for a put option, this is when the current price is less than the strike price, and would thus generate a profit were it exercised; for a call option the situation is inverted. Trading The difference between FX options and traditional options is that in the latter case the trade is to give an amount of money and receive the right to buy or sell a commodity, stock or other non-money asset. In FX options, the asset in question is also money, denominated in another currency. For example, a call option on oil allows the investor to buy oil at a given price and date. The investor on the other side of the trade is in effect selling a put option on the currency. To eliminate residual risk, traders match the foreign currency notionals, not the local currency notionals, else the foreign currencies received and delivered do not offset. In the case of an FX option on a rate, as in the above example, an option on GBPUSD gives a USD value that is linear in GBPUSD using USD as the num√©raire (a move from 2.0000 to 1.9000 yields a .10 * $2,000,000 / $2.0000 = $100,000 profit), but has a non-linear GBP value. Conversely, the GBP value is linear in the USDGBP rate, while the USD value is non-linear. This is because inverting a rate has the effect of x \\\\mapsto 1/x, which is non-linear. Hedging Corporations primarily use FX options to hedge uncertain future cash flows in a foreign currency. The general rule is to hedge certain foreign currency cash flows with forwards, and uncertain foreign cash flows with options. Suppose a United Kingdom manufacturing firm expects to be paid US$100,000 for a piece of engineering equipment to be delivered in 90 days. If the GBP strengthens against the US$ over the next 90 days the UK firm loses money, as it will receive less GBP after converting the US$100,000 into GBP. However, if the GBP weakens against the US$, then the UK firm receives more GBP. This uncertainty exposes the firm to FX risk. Assuming that the cash flow is certain, the firm can enter into a forward contract to deliver the US$100,000 in 90 days time, in exchange for GBP at the current forward rate. This forward contract is free, and, presuming the expected cash arrives, exactly matches the firm's exposure, perfectly hedging their FX risk. If the cash flow is uncertain, a forward FX contract exposes the firm to FX risk in the opposite direction, in the case that the expected USD cash is not received, typically making an option a better choice. Using options, the UK firm can purchase a GBP call/USD put option (the right to sell part or all of their expected income for pounds sterling at a predetermined rate), which: * protects the GBP value that the firm expects in 90 days' time (presuming the cash is received) * costs at most the option premium (unlike a forward, which can have unlimited losses) * yields a profit if the expected cash is not received but FX rates move in its favor Valuation: the Garman‚ÄìKohlhagen model  As in the Black‚ÄìScholes model for stock options and the Black model for certain interest rate options, the value of a European option on an FX rate is typically calculated by assuming that the rate follows a log-normal process. The earliest currency options pricing model was published by Biger and Hull, (Financial Management, spring 1983). The model preceded the Garmam and Kolhagen's Model. In 1983 Garman and Kohlhagen extended the Black‚ÄìScholes model to cope with the presence of two interest rates (one for each currency). Suppose that r_d is the risk-free interest rate to expiry of the domestic currency and r_f is the foreign currency risk-free interest rate (where domestic currency is the currency in which we obtain the value of the option; the formula also requires that FX rates ‚Äì both strike and current spot be quoted in terms of \\"units of domestic currency per unit of foreign currency\\"). The results are also in the same units and to be meaningful need to be converted into one of the currencies. Then the domestic currency value of a call option into the foreign currency is :c = S_0e^{-r_f T}\\\\mathcal{N}(d_1) - Ke^{-r_d T}\\\\mathcal{N}(d_2) (proof?) The value of a put option has value :p = Ke^{-r_d T}\\\\mathcal{N}(-d_2) - S_0e^{-r_f T}\\\\mathcal{N}(-d_1) where : :d_1 = \\\\frac{\\\\ln(S_0/K) + (r_d - r_f + \\\\sigma^2/2)T}{\\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{T}} :d_2 = d_1 - \\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{T} :S_0 is the current spot rate :K is the strike price :\\\\mathcal{N}(x) is the cumulative normal distribution function :r_d is domestic risk free simple interest rate :r_f is foreign risk free simple interest rate :T is the time to maturity (calculated according to the appropriate day count convention) :and \\\\sigma is the volatility of the FX rate. Risk management An earlier pricing model was published by Biger and Hull, Financial Management, spring 1983. The model preceded Garmam and Kolhagen Model. A wide range of techniques are in use for calculating the options risk exposure, or Greeks (as for example the Vanna-Volga method). Although the option prices produced by every model agree (with Garman‚ÄìKohlhagen), risk numbers can vary significantly depending on the assumptions used for the properties of spot price movements, volatility surface and interest rate curves. After Garman‚ÄìKohlhagen, the most common models are SABR and local volatility, although when agreeing risk numbers with a counterparty (e.g. for exchanging delta, or calculating the strike on a 25 delta option) Garman‚ÄìKohlhagen is always used.

Biography The Zeki Velidi Togan National Library of the Republic of Bashkortostan in Ufa Monument to Zeki Velidi Togan in the yard of Saint Petersburg State University He was born in Kuzyanovo (Bashkir: –ö”©“ô”ô–Ω) village of Sterlitamak uyezd, Ufa Governorate (in present-day Ishimbaysky District, Bashkortostan). From 1912-1915 Velidi taught in the madrassa (school) in Kazan (Qas√≠mi√§), and from 1915 to 1917 he was a member of bureau, supporting Muslim deputies at the State Duma. In 1917 he was elected to the Mill√§t M√§clese, and with ≈ûerif Manatov he organized the Bashkir Shura (Council). During the Bashkir Congress in Orenburg from December 1917, he declared Bashkortostan's autonomy. However, he was arrested 3 February 1918 by the Soviet forces. In April 1918 he managed to escape and joined the forces confronting the Bolsheviks. In 1918 and 1919 Velidi's Bashkir troops first fought under Ataman Alexander Dutov, then under Admiral Kolchak against Bolshevik forces. After the RSFSR promised autonomy to Bashkirs, Velidi switched allegiance, fighting with the Bolsheviks. From February 1919 to June 1920, he was chairman of the Bashrevkom (Bashkir Revolutionary Committee). He attended the Congress of the Peoples of the East held in Baku in September 1920, where he became involved in drawing up the statutes of ERK, a Muslim Socialist organisation. However, feeling the Bolsheviks had broken their promises, he became more critical of them when he moved to Central Asia. In Turkistan, Velidi became a leader of the Basmachi Movement. From 1920 to 1923 he was chairman of the \\"National Union of Turkistan\\". In 1923 Validi emigrated, after discovering original manuscripts of Ahmad ibn Fadlan in Iran. From 1925 Velidi lived in Turkey and was appointed Chair of Turkish History at the Istanbul University in 1927. However, his controversial views criticizing the Turkish History Thesis forced him to seek refuge in Vienna,Late Ottoman and Early Republican Turkish Historical Writing, Cemal Kadafar and Hakan T. Karateke, The Oxford History of Historical Writing: Volume 4: 1800-1945, 574.where he gained a doctor of philosophy at the University of Vienna in 1935. Following he became a professor at Bonn University (1935‚Äì1937) and G√∂ttingen University (1938‚Äì1939). On the 3 May 1944 protests in support of Nihal Atsƒ±z occurred, who was on trial and on the 9 May he was detained together with other Pan-Turkists like Alparslan T√ºrke≈ü, Atsƒ±z and T√ºrkkan. In March 1945 he was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor. In 1947 a retrial ended with the release of all defendants. In 1953 he became organizer of the ƒ∞slam Tetkikleri Enstit√ºs√º (Institute for Islamic Studies) at Istanbul University. In 1967, he was given an honorary doctorate from the University of Manchester. At the same time he contributed to the Encyclopedia of Turkic Peoples. His articles about culture, language and history of Turkic peoples have been translated into many languages.

Common soft tissue injuries usually occur from a sprain, strain, a one off blow resulting in a contusion or overuse of a particular part of the body. Soft tissue injuries can result in pain, swelling, bruising and loss of function.Lovering, 2008  Signs and symptoms  = Sprains = A sprain is a type of acute injury which results from the stretching or tearing of a ligament. Depending on the severity of the sprain, the movement on the joint can be compromised since ligaments aid in the stability and support of joints. Sprains are commonly seen in vulnerable areas such as the wrists, knees and ankles. They can occur from movements such as falling on an outstretched hand or a twisting of the ankle or foot. The severity of a sprain can be classified: *Grade 1: Only some of the fibers in the ligament are torn, and the injured site is moderately painful and swollen. Function in the joint will be unaffected for the most part. *Grade 2: Many of the ligament fibers are torn, and pain and swelling is moderate. The functionality of the joint is compromised. *Grade 3: The soft tissue is completely torn, and functionality and strength on the joint is completely compromised. In most cases, surgery is needed to repair the damage. = Strains = A strain is a type of acute injury that occurs to the muscle or tendon. Similar to sprains, it can vary in severity, from a stretching of the muscle or tendon to a complete tear of the tendon from the muscle. Some of the most common places that strains occur are in the foot, back of the leg (hamstring), or back. = Bruising (contusion) = A contusion is the discoloration of the skin, which results from underlying muscle fibers and connective tissue being crushed.This can happen in a variety of ways such as a direct blow to the skin, or a fall taken against a hard surface. The discoloration in the skin is present when blood begins to pool around the injury. = Tendinitis = Tendinitis is a type of overuse injury to the tendons, which demonstrates signs of inflammation of tendons around a joint. Tendinitis is the most common cause of shoulder pain and also leg pain . Tendinitis occurs when there is repetitive stress on the subacromial bursa, which causes the bones to make contact with the tendons and irritate them. Diagnosis = Classifications =  Acute injuries  Bruising is a type of acute soft tissue injury Any type of injury that occurs to the body through sudden trauma, such as a fall, twist or blow to the body. A few examples of this type of injury would be sprains, strains and contusions.  Overuse injuries  An overuse injury occurs when a certain activity is repeated frequently and the body does not have enough time to recover between occurrences. Examples include bursitis and tendinitis. =Commonly injured tissues= With examples of each. Parentheses indicate location in body *Ligaments :Anterior cruciate ligament (knee), medial collateral ligament (knee), ulnar collateral ligaments (wrist/hand), interspinous ligaments (vertebrae) *Muscles :Biceps brachii (upper arm), rectus femoris (thigh), transverse abdominis (abdominals) *Tendons :Patellar tendon (knee), calcaneal/Achilles tendon (foot/lower leg), biceps tendon (shoulder/elbow) *Nerves :Brachial plexus (shoulder), ulnar nerve (elbow/hand), peroneal nerve (ankle/foot), cranial nerves I-XII(head) *Bones :Femur (leg), humerus (arm), ribs (torso), metatarsals I-VI (foot), metacarpals I-VI (hand) *Cartilage :Menisci (knee), intervertebral discs (spine), acetabulum (hip) Management = RICE method: (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) = The RICE method is an effective procedure used in the initial treatment of a soft tissue injury. :Rest: It is suggested that the patient take a break from the activity that caused the injury in order to give the injury time to heal. :Ice: The injury should be iced on and off in 20 minute intervals, avoiding direct contact of the ice with the skin. :Compression: Bandaging the injury will compress it, and prevent any further bleeding or swelling from occurring. :Elevation: Elevating the injury above the heart while resting will aid in the reduction of swelling. = No HARM Protocol: (Heat, Alcohol, Re-injury, Massage) = This method should not be used within the first 48‚Äì72 hours after the injury in order to speed up the recovery process. :Heat: Applying heat to the injured area can cause blood flow and swelling to increase. :Alcohol: Alcohol can inhibit the ability to feel if the injury is becoming more aggravated, as well as increasing blood flow and swelling. :Re-injury: Avoid any activities that could aggravate the injury and cause further damage. :Massage: Massaging an injured area can promote blood flow and swelling, and potentially cause more damage if done too early. =Treatment= If severe pain persists after the first 24hours it is recommended that an individual consult with a professional who can make a diagnosis and implement a treatment plan so the patient can return to everyday activities.Flegel, 2004 To make a full diagnosis, a professional may use nerve conduction studies to localize nerve dysfunction (e.g. carpal tunnel syndrome), assess severity, and help with prognosis. Electrodiagnosis also helps differentiate between myopathy and neuropathy. Ultimately, the best method of imaging soft tissue is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), though it is cost-prohibitive and carries a high false positive rate. References Sources *Flegel, Melinda J.

William Foote Whyte (June 27, 1914 ‚Äì July 16, 2000) was a sociologist chiefly known for his ethnographic study in urban sociology, Street Corner Society. A pioneer in participant observation, he lived for four years in an Italian community in Boston while a Junior Fellow at Harvard researching social relations of street gangs in Boston's North End. Early life Whyte, from an upper-middle-class background, showed an early interest in writing, economics and social reform. After graduating from Swarthmore College, he was selected for the Junior Fellows program, where his landmark research was done. After his research in Boston, he entered the sociology doctoral program at the University of Chicago. Street Corner Society was published by the University of Chicago Press in 1943. He spent a year teaching at the University of Oklahoma, but developed polio in 1943 and spent two years in physical therapy at the Warm Springs Foundation. Rehabilitation was only partially successful; Whyte walked with a cane for the rest of his life, and used two arm crutches in his later years. Professional career He briefly returned to the University of Chicago in 1944, then joined the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University in 1948, remaining at Cornell for the remainder of his career. At Cornell he supervised Chris Argyris with his doctorate. He worked for social reform and social change, directing his efforts toward \\"empowering the disenfranchized and narrowing the gap between rich and poor.\\" He studied industrial and agricultural workers and workers' cooperatives in Venezuela, Peru, Guatemala and in the Basque region of Spain, as well as in the United States. He authored hundreds of articles and 20 books including an autobiography. He is considered a pioneer in industrial sociology. Family At his death William F. Whyte was survived by his wife, Kathleen (King) Whyte, two sons and two daughters. Education Professor Whyte received his bachelor's degree in economics from Swarthmore College in 1936, and was selected for the Junior Fellows program at Harvard University, where his landmark research was done.

Influenced by such artists as Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, the group combined eastern themes, mysticism and vivid psychedelia with acid rock. The band consisted of Petri Walli (guitars, lead vocals), Jukka Jylli (bass, backing vocals) and Sami Kuoppam√§ki (drums, percussion). Walli took the most active role in the band. He formed the group, composed most of the songs and wrote all the lyrics. He was also Kingston Wall's producer and manager and ran the band's own Trinity record label. History =Early Days= Kingston Wall was formed in 1987, when Petri Walli asked Jukka Jylli to join his band. Petteri St√•hl and Jukka H√§iki√∂ later joined the band as drummer and lead singer, respectively. The band was named Moonshine Makers and they played their first shows in 1988. H√§iki√∂ soon quit the band after getting tired of waiting for Walli to finish his long guitar solos. The band became a trio, with Walli taking the role of lead singer despite doubting his skills. The band was renamed Kingston Wall, which was derived from Walli‚Äôs last name and the supposed name of a mental hospital in England, although Walli later gave varying explanations for the name. The capital of Jamaica, Kingston, allegedly had nothing to do with the name. The band‚Äôs first performance as Kingston Wall and as a trio, was in September 1988. This successful show spawned many others. During these early gigs, the band played their own songs, but also covers from bands such as the Beatles, Frank Zappa, The Who and Jimi Hendrix. They recorded a demo tape in early 1989, which included the song ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Not the One‚Äù, which would appear on their first full-length album. After touring extensively and gaining some followers in the Helsinki rock-scene, Walli was eager to take his music to another level. However, drummer St√•hl was not as talented a musician as Walli and Jylli, which held the band back. In Autumn 1989, St√•hl was asked to leave and he was replaced by the more technically capable Timo Joutsim√§ki. The new line- up recorded another demo, which included the songs ‚ÄúUsed to Feel Before‚Äù, ‚ÄúWaste of Time‚Äù and ‚ÄúI Wish I Had Seen You‚Äù. =Kingston Wall I= Kingston Wall released their first album, Kingston Wall (later referenced and re- released as I) in 1992 under the Trinity label. After deciding the time was ready for the band to record and release a full-length studio album, they sent their demos to labels that published music sung in English in Finland. Initially, no label was interested in signing the band, but after tireless persuasion, the label One Inch Rock signed Kingston Wall in 1990. Walli was given full control over the production of the album and he used his power to control every aspect of the recording, which led to confrontations between him and Joutsim√§ki. While recording the album, the band continued playing live. Ralf √ñrn, who was responsible for signing Kingston Wall to One Inch Rock, became interested in managing the band. His connections helped the band secure their first and only gig outside Finland in May 1990 in Tallinn, Estonia. The confrontations between Walli and Joutsim√§ki continued, and Joutsim√§ki began arriving to practise and gigs drunk and late. Eventually, the drummer stopped appearing to practise all together and reportedly sold his drums as redundant‚Äù. Walli started looking for a new drummer, and after a month of searching, heard of a promising young talent, Sami Kuoppam√§ki, who was studying in Los Angeles Musicians Institute. Walli sent him their demo tapes, and, impressed by their sound, Kuoppam√§ki decided to join. The band began hosting their own club night which they dubbed Freakout. During Freakout nights, Kingston Wall performed with various other local bands, often playing cover songs, alternative versions of their own songs and with various line- ups. Kuoppam√§ki now being a stable member of the band, the recording of the first album was restarted from scratch. The recording was finished, but One Inch Rock decided that they did not want to release the album after all, instead opting to give the distribution rights to EMI Finland. To produce the album, Walli founded Pedro Cucaracha Productions and the record label Trinity. The official release gig for the new album was 31 January 1992 at Tavastia Club. This was followed by a number of gigs throughout Finnish clubs and festivals. Their debut album consisted mainly of psychedelic hard rock along with a cover of Jimi Hendrix' song \\"Fire\\", which gained the group some popularity among the Finnish radio stations. The album culminated in the heavily progressive, 21-minute track, \\"Mushrooms\\". =Kingston Wall II= In the summer of 1992, Walli got interested in techno music and started going to techno raves, where LSD and magic mushrooms were commonplace. Walli brought his new found love for techno into the music of Kingston Wall, by covering ‚ÄúI Feel Love‚Äù by Donna Summer. The following Autumn, the band entered the studio to record their next studio album, II. Similar to the previous album, II was produced by Pedro Cucaracha Productions and distributed by EMI Finland. The recordings went smoothly and were finished in a few weeks and the release gig was held 29 January 1993 at Tavastia, followed by a 13 date Finnish tour. After playing at many major music festivals in Finland in the summer of 1993, Walli was desperate for the band to gain international success. However, large international record labels were not interested in signing the band. The band continued hosting their Freakout club nights, during which they now implemented more techno and house elements by having a DJ play with the band. The album evolved the sound of the band by introducing more acoustic and folk elements to their songs, like acoustic guitars and violins in \\"Istwan\\" (violin played by Ufo Mustonen) and saxophones in \\"Shine On Me\\" (saxophone played by Sakari Kukko). They also included a cross-genre cover version of the Donna Summer disco classic \\"I Feel Love\\". =III - Tri-Logy and Walli's death= In January 1994, Walli went on holiday to India, where he met Ior Bock, a Finnish mystic, who, during hashish fuelled nights, told listeners of the Bock saga, an eccentric explanation about the origins of the alphabets, words, and the whole human history. Inspired by the Bock saga, Walli wrote and rewrote new songs for their upcoming album, which was to be called III ‚Äì Tri-Logy. The music and lyrics were riddled with references to previous Kingston Wall releases and the Bock saga. Compared to the two weeks it took to record the previous album, this time the band had booked 13 weeks of studio time. Unlike on previous albums, each band member recorded their parts separately, and some of the songs the band had never practised before entering the studio. The album ended up being the most expensive self-published album in Finland at that time. The album was different in style and tone compared to the two previous ones as it included more hard rock sounds, at times combined with dub reggae, techno, and synthesizers arranged by Kimmo Kajasto (from Koneveljet and Rinneradio). The last song on the album, \\"The Real Thing\\", runs for 18 minutes and again features Sakari Kukko on saxophone, along with ambient synthesizer pads played by Kimmo Kajasto. After an eight month break from playing live, the band returned to the stage in August 1994, playing their first gig under the alias ‚ÄúSpirits of Istwan‚Äù. The official release gig was held 1 October 1994, once again at Tavastia and was followed by a Finnish tour. Meanwhile, Walli‚Äôs erratic behaviour and obsession with the Bock saga had grown to a level where people started avoiding him. Growing tensions and the harshness of life on tour took their toll on the morale of both the band and crew, and the band voted the stop the tour short, cancelling the final show of the tour. In December, Kingston Wall played three more gigs. They played their last public show in Lepakko, Helsinki on December 1994 and their last show ever was some days later in S√∂rn√§inen prison in Helsinki. After this, the band called it quits in a local cafeteria and each of the members went on their separate ways. Walli left for India and shortly after his return to Finland, on 28 June 1995, jumped to his death from the tower of T√∂√∂l√∂ church in central Helsinki. This marked the end for Kingston Wall. The suicide was apparently caused by several factors. Walli had lost his faith in Ior Bock's mythologies and felt ashamed for basing the band's third album on what he now perceived as deceptions. He had also broken up with his girlfriend some months earlier. Walli was later buried in the Hietaniemi Cemetery, about one kilometer away from his place of death. =Legacy= During their active time, Kingston Wall never achieved mainstream popularity. All their albums were printed in limited amounts and released on Walli's own independent label, Trinity. It was only after the group had disbanded that their popularity slowly grew through word-of-mouth. Kingston Wall was known for their energetic live performances. The band held their own Freak-Out Club three times in Helsinki. They started playing live from small local pubs but as their popularity grew they could sell out the biggest clubs in Helsinki. All the original Kingston Wall albums and singles under the Trinity label have been since sold out and are regarded collector's items. The III - Tri-Logy was re- issued by a Finnish record label Zen Garden in 1998. A limited amount of 1000 copies included a bonus CD along with each of the three original remastered albums. The limited re-issues sold out quickly. The bonus CDs contained single B-sides and previously unreleased live recordings. In 2000, a remix album titled Freakout Remixes was released. This tribute album included techno and psychedelic trance remixes of the original Kingston Wall songs, made by such Finnish artists as Accu, Squaremeat and Texas Faggott. Kingston Wall has also influenced many Finnish rock groups and received cover tributes from artists such as The Rasmus (\\"Used to Feel Before\\" on Madness-single) and Amorphis (\\"And I Hear You Call\\" on My Kantele-EP). Although Kingston Wall never played outside Finland apart from one gig in Tallinn, Estonia during their early days, the group is considered even by many Finns as one of the country's best hard rock groups. Their albums have appeared on the Finnish Top 40 album charts. The cult following status of Kingston Wall has also gained them a steadily growing fan base around the world, mostly thanks to the Internet. After a long period of silence, a live CD box set was released from Kingston Wall. The box set featured three CDs recorded from various gigs during the band's existence. The tracks were selected for this album by bass player Jukka Jylli. Jukka Jylli and Sami Kuoppam√§ki currently play in the Finnish rock outfit Zook. In October of 2018, the band announced on their Facebook page that they would be playing a gig at Tavastia Club in Helsinki to celebrate the 50th birthday of Petri Walli. Performing under the name Kingston Wall by JJylli, Kuoppis and Brothers von Hertzen, the outfit included Jylli on bass, Kuoppam√§ki on drums and the Von Hertzen Brothers on guitars, lead vocals and percussion. The Tavastia show was sold out in minutes, which prompted the band to embark on a full-fledged tour. =Biography of Petri Walli= In February 2014, Finnish rock journalist Viljami Puustinen published the book \\"Kingston Wall: Petri Wallin saaga\\" (Kingston Wall: The Saga of Petri Walli), a 325-page in-depth biography of Petri Walli that also explores the band's history in detail.

Over 250 people (mostly women and children, and almost exclusively ethnic Achi Maya) were abused and murdered by members of the armed forces and their paramilitary allies. The killings took place during one of the most violent phases of Guatemala's Civil War, which pitted various groups of left-wing insurgents against the government and the armed forces. After assuming power in March 1982, de facto President Gen. Efra√≠n R√≠os Montt embarked on a military campaign that largely succeeded in breaking the insurgency, but at a terrible cost in human lives and human rights violations. The massacre in Plan de S√°nchez was an element in the government's scorched earth strategy, and the village was targeted because of the authorities' suspicions that the inhabitants were harbouring or otherwise supporting guerrilla groups. After the massacre, the village was practically abandoned for a number of years, and the survivors were told that reprisals would follow if they spoke about the incident or revealed the location of the numerous mass graves they had helped to dig. With the gradual return to democracy that began in the late 1980s and early 1990s, some of the survivors felt they could start to talk about the killings without fearing for their lives. Accusations were filed with the authorities in 1992 and, in 1993, a criminal investigation was launched. However, faced with delays and other irregularities in the proceedings, and stonewalled by a National Reconciliation Law that granted amnesties to the suspected perpetrators, the survivors saw that Guatemala's domestic legal remedies were ineffective in this case. They consequently decided to lodge a complaint with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), the supranational human rights arm of the Organisation of American States, in 1996. The IACHR began processing the complaint, received a partial recognition of the state's institutional responsibility from the democratically elected president Alfonso Portillo in the first year of his term, and finally referred the case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights for judgement and settlement. In 2004, the Inter-American Court issued two judgements, in which it established Guatemala's liability in the case and ordered an extensive package of monetary, non-monetary and symbolic forms of compensation for the survivors and the next-of-kin of the deceased. National context :See also: History of Guatemala, Guatemalan Civil War. 1982 was one of the bloodiest years in Guatemala's 36-year-long history of internal conflict (1960‚Äì1996). On 23 March 1982, army troops commanded by junior officers staged a coup d'√©tat to prevent the assumption of power by Gen. √Ångel An√≠bal Guevara, the hand-picked successor of outgoing president Gen. Romeo Lucas Garc√≠a who had won a disputed election two weeks earlier. The coup leaders asked retired Gen. Efra√≠n R√≠os Montt to negotiate the departure of both Lucas and Guevara. R√≠os Montt, who had been the candidate of the Christian Democracy Party in the 1974 presidential election and was widely regarded as having been denied his victory through fraud, accepted the appointment. He formed a three-member military junta that annulled the 1965 constitution dissolved Congress, and suspended all political parties. After a few months, he dismissed his junta colleagues and assumed the de facto title of President of the Republic; in his inaugural address, R√≠os Montt ‚Äì a lay pastor in the evangelical Protestant Church of the Word ‚Äì stated that his presidency resulted from the will of God.\\"Background Note: Guatemala; April 2001 version, U.S. State Department. Via Internet Archive. The country's guerrilla forces and their leftist allies denounced R√≠os Montt, who sought to defeat the guerrilla insurgency with a combination of military action and economic reforms; in his words, \\"beans and rifles\\" (frijoles y fusiles). An army officer was quoted in the New York Times of 18 July 1982 (the exact day of the Plan de S√°nchez killings) as telling an audience of indigenous people in Cun√©n, in the department of El Quich√©, that: \\"If you are with us, we'll feed you; if not, we'll kill you.\\" \\"Guatemala Enlists Religion in Battle\\", Raymond Bonner, New York Times, 18 July 1982. For a number of years, the U.S. State Department, in its background notes on Guatemala, attributed this quotation to Gen. R√≠os Montt himself. See: Background Note: Guatemala; April 2001 version, via the Internet Archive. The government began to form local \\"civilian self-defence patrols\\" (the paramilitary forces known as patrullas de autodefensa civil or PACs). Participation was, in theory, voluntary, but in practice, many campesinos, especially in the north-west, had no choice but to join either the PACs or the guerrillas. The country's conscript army, supported by the PACs, recaptured practically all the guerrilla-held territory ‚Äì guerrilla activity lessened and was mostly limited to hit-and-run operations. However, this partial victory was won at an enormous cost in civilian deaths. R√≠os Montt's brief presidency was probably the most violent period of the 36-year internal conflict, which resulted in about 200,000 deaths of mostly unarmed, mostly indigenous civilians. Although leftist guerrillas and right-wing death squads also engaged in summary executions, forced disappearances, and torture of non-combatants, the vast majority of human rights violations were carried out by the military and the PACs they controlled. The internal conflict is described in great detail in the report of the Historical Clarification Commission (Comisi√≥n para el Esclarecimiento Hist√≥rico, or CEH), which estimates that government forces and their paramilitary confederates were responsible for 93% of the violations. CEH, Guatemala: Memory of Silence, Conclusions, ¬ß15. On 8 August 1983, R√≠os Montt was deposed by his own Minister of Defence, Gen. √ìscar Humberto Mej√≠a Victores, who succeeded him as de facto president of Guatemala. Victims of the period, organised in the Asociaci√≥n para Justicia y Reconciliaci√≥n (AJR) and their legal representatives the Centro para Acci√≥n Legal en Derechos Humanos (CALDH) brought a criminal case against R√≠os Montt in 2001. He was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in a national court in May 2013. The status of the conviction is unclear following intervention by the Constitutional Court.http://www.riosmontt-trial.org/2013/06/ixil-genocide- trial-on-hold-other-charges-against-rios-montt-continue/ Local context The central Guatemalan department of Baja Verapaz comprises eight municipalities, one of which is Rabinal (), some 70 km to the north of Guatemala City. In 1982, the municipality was made up of the municipal seat of Rabinal town, along with another 14 villages and 60 hamlets. Among the villages was Plan de S√°nchez, located in a hilly woodland area some 9 km from the town of Rabinal. The local inhabitants were overwhelmingly Achi Maya Native Americans. Achi is one of the 21 varieties of the Maya language recognised in Guatemala; according to a 2002 government census, it was spoken by some 105,000 people in the Baja Verapaz highlands. Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala, Comunidad Ling√º√≠stica Achi. Via the Internet Archive. The events of July 1982 Since early 1982, the inhabitants of the area had been facing increasing pressure from the authorities. Many of the local men had refused to participate in the self-defence patrols and, as a result, the military kept a strong presence in the area. Many men fled their homes for the mountains, leaving the womenfolk and children behind. Others had already, before the massacre, filed formal complaints ‚Äì reporting the armed forces' constant threatening behaviour and harassment ‚Äì with the justice of the peace in Rabinal, but these allegations were never investigated; on the contrary, the men who lodged the complaints were fined. In early July 1982, a military aircraft flew over the village and dropped a number of bombs on areas close to several homes. On 15 July, an army detachment set up camp in the village and began house-to-house inspections, asking after the menfolk and threatening the villagers. Sunday, 18 July, was market-day in Rabinal. The pathways and roads of the municipality were, from an early hour, crowded with people from local villages and farms taking their goods to market. The village of Plan de S√°nchez was one of several settlements crisscrossed by the network of routes leading to the municipal seat. At around 08:00 that Sunday morning, soldiers at the military detachment fired two 105-mm mortar shells at the village. One of these landed to the east of the main group of houses; the other to the west. Later that same day, between 14:00 and 15:00, a military detachment arrived in Plan de S√°nchez. This force of some 60 men ‚Äì comprising regular army (led by a captain and a lieutenant), PAC patrolmen, police, and civilians dressed in military fatigues and armed with assault rifles ‚Äì took up stations at the village's points of entry and exit, heading off people from other settlements returning from market. Others went from house to house, gathering the inhabitants together. At this point, some of the men succeeded in fleeing the round-up and took to the surrounding woods and hills. The younger women were sent to one house, with the men, children, and older women directed to another. A group of around twenty of the younger women (aged between 12 and 20) were separated from the main group and taken to another building; there, they were humiliated, accused of supporting the guerrillas, beaten, and raped. A handful of these women managed to escape and take refuge in the surrounding countryside, while the remainder were killed. The children were separated from the main group and beaten and kicked to death. Then, at around 17:00, the soldiers threw two hand grenades into the house where the adults were being held and began spraying the walls with automatic gunfire. Residents of nearby villages and those from Plan de S√°nchez who was observing the massacre from vantage points in the surrounding hills report that intense gunfire continued until about 20:00 when the army set fire to the buildings. The armed forces finally left the village at around 23:00. The next morning, some of those who had fled returned to the smoking ruins of their village. None of the bodies in the houses could be identified; many of the others who had fallen in the yards adjacent to the houses had bullet holes in their heads, chests, and backs, but identification of these victims was made difficult because dogs and other animals had partially devoured many of the charred corpses. At around 15:00 on that Monday, two military commissioners and a squad of PAC patrolmen arrived in Plan de S√°nchez and ordered the survivors to dig graves and bury the victims' remains, threatening them that the air force would bombard the village if they failed to comply. More than 20 clandestine communal graves were dug and filled. Meanwhile, the patrolmen ransacked the houses that had not been burned down, stealing personal property and livestock and destroying identification papers. =Witness testimony= Aftermath Over the ensuing months, because of regular visits by the army during which they were threatened, harassed, and intimidated, most of the survivors abandoned the village for the mountains, other towns and villages, or Guatemala City. In 1985, they began to trickle back and were allowed to resettle in Plan de S√°nchez and work their land, provided that they served in the PACs and remained subject at all times to military oversight. By 1987, some 20 families were again living in the village, albeit under strict orders from the military not to discuss the massacre. The harassment and threats from the military and paramilitaries continued, and the requirement that they patrol with the PACs was enforced until the peace accords were signed and the civilian self-defence patrols were dissolved in 1996. =Witness testimony= : > The militarisation of Plan de S√°nchez prevented them from continuing their > ancestral traditions.

I/A Court H.R., Case of the Plan de S√°nchez Massacre v. Guatemala. Reparations and Costs. Judgement of 19 November 2004; p. 12. Death toll Years later, the petition lodged with the Inter- American Commission on Human Rights by the survivors and next-of-kin set the death toll of the massacre at 268, IACHR, 1998 Annual Report, Case 11.763, ¬ß1. and the Guatemalan state, in the later supranational proceedings, admitted its responsibility in that number of killings. However, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights published a list of named victims that numbered only 170, I/A Court H.R., Case of the Plan de S√°nchez Massacre v. Guatemala. Merits. Judgement of 29 April 2004; ¬ß42.47. and various other reports on the incident quote figures of between 150 and 200. Forensic anthropologists working on the massacre site have exhumed fewer than 100 sets of remains. The discrepancies in the various figures can be attributed to several factors: first of all, entire families were killed, and many of the survivors were subsequently scattered across the country. The absence of relatives made tallying the dead more difficult, as did the severe warnings the villagers received in the immediately ensuing years about what would happen if they discussed the massacre. The fact that many of the victims were burnt alive in a single, small enclosure complicated the identification of remains and, to date, it is not certain that all the clandestine graves in the vicinity of Plan de S√°nchez have been found. Domestic legal proceedings On 10 December 1992, a group of villagers reported the existence of a clandestine grave in Plan de S√°nchez and, on 7 May 1993, Ramiro de Le√≥n Carpio, the country's human rights ombudsman (Procurador de los Derechos Humanos), lodged an official accusation with the public prosecution service, reporting the massacre that had taken place 11 years earlier. I/A Court H.R., Case of the Plan de S√°nchez Massacre v. Guatemala. Merits. Judgement of 29 April 2004; ¬ß42.31. A criminal investigation was begun by an investigating magistrate in Salam√°, Baja Verapaz, and, on 8 June 1994, the Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology Team (EAFG) began examining the clandestine graves in the community. Two months later, the forensic anthropologists had exhumed a total of 84 corpses from 21 graves. An additional grave site was identified during the field work and, once the legal formalities had been met, the EAFG was able to examine it, and exhume four sets of human remains, in August 1996. I/A Court H.R., Case of the Plan de S√°nchez Massacre v. Guatemala. Merits. Judgement of 29 April 2004; ¬ß42.33. On 2 September 1996, Ombudsman Jorge Mario Garc√≠a Laguardia issued a historic resolution in which he denounced the massacre of Plan de S√°nchez (and two others that took place in Rabinal the same year: Chichupac and R√≠o Negro) as crimes against humanity, laid the blame for them firmly at the feet of the government and the military, and said that they had been carried out as part of a premeditated state policy. Procurador de los Derechos Humanos, Resoluci√≥n sobre cementerios clandestinos , 2 September 1996. In May 1997, the villagers named as plaintiffs in the criminal investigation gave the authorities a list of names of soldiers and patrolmen who had been involved in the massacre. In June 1997, their legal representatives the Centro para Acci√≥n Legal en Derechos Humanos (CALDH) requested ballistic tests on the spent cartridges found in the graves; the ballistic material was reported as \\"lost\\" by the prosecution service and did not resurface until February 2000. Following sustained efforts by victims and CALDH, and the appointment of a new Attorney General in Guatemala, five direct perpetrators were convicted in domestic criminal proceedings and in October 2012 their conviction was upheld on appeal.http://www.prensalibre.com/noticias/justicia/audiencia-genocidio- militar_0_794920781.html Supranational legal proceedings In October 1996, faced with constant delays and other irregularities in the domestic proceedings, the survivors instructed their legal representatives in both national and supranational proceedings, the Centro para Acci√≥n Legal en Derechos Humanos (CALDH), to lodge a complaint with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR). The IACHR is the agency of the Organisation of American States charged with overseeing the American Convention on Human Rights, a continental human rights instrument that Guatemala ratified in 1978, and responsible for ensuring justice for victims of human rights abuses when domestic legal systems fail. In their filing, they accused the Guatemalan state of violating the victims' human rights by allowing its agents to kill civilian men, women, and children and by failing to respond to that situation with measures of judicial protection and guarantees. Guatemala replied to the petition by stating that during the armed conflict both parties committed abuses, and that events such as those in Plan de S√°nchez stand as testimony to that fact. It went on to say, however, that the villagers' petition was inadmissible since it had been presented extemporaneously and because the jurisdictional remedies offered by the domestic courts had not yet been exhausted. The petitioners countered that they had attempted to exhaust the domestic remedies, but had been prevented from so doing by excessive procedural delays on the part of the state's judicial officers. Finding for the petitioners, the Commission declared the case admissible on 11 March 1999. IACHR, 1998 Annual Report, Case 11.763, ¬ß32. On 9 August 2000, during (failed) negotiations between the state, the petitioners, and the Commission with a view to reaching a friendly settlement of this case and others, President Alfonso Portillo admitted the state's \\"institutional responsibility\\" for the massacre. IACHR, Press Release 12-00, 17 August 2000. On 28 February 2002, the IACHR issued a resolution recommending that the Guatemalan government: # Conduct a serious investigation to prosecute and punish those who perpetrated and masterminded the massacre. # Make reparations (including but not limited to financial compensation) to the survivors of the massacre, to the next-of-kin of the dead, and to the village as a community. # Take steps to ensure that similar incidents did not occur in the future. I/A Court H.R., Case of the Plan de S√°nchez Massacre v. Guatemala. Merits. Judgement of 29 April 2004; p. 2. Two months later, after consulting with the petitioners, the Inter-American Commission referred the case to the contentious jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. Guatemala first lodged three exceptions with the Court, arguing, inter alia, that the case was not admissible because the available domestic remedies had not been exhausted and that the scope of President Portillo's admission of responsibility had been misconstrued. At the Court's public hearing on 23 April 2004, however, the state withdrew those exceptions. It then repeated the admission of responsibility extended by Alfonso Portillo in August 2000 and admitted that it had violated the human rights enshrined in Articles 1, 5, 8, 11, 12, 13, 16, 21, 21, 24, and 25 of the American Convention on Human Rights. It asked the victims for their forgiveness and expressed its willingness to make full amends. Guatemala did not, however, address the charges of genocide levelled at it by the Commission in its application to the Court, since that particular crime against humanity was not covered by the Convention. The Court accepted the state's admission of guilt, issued a judgement to that effect on 29 April 2004, I/A Court H.R., Case of the Plan de S√°nchez Massacre v. Guatemala. Merits. Judgement of 29 April 2004. and proceeded with the reparations phase. On 19 November 2004, the Inter-American Court issued its reparations judgement. In order to make full redress to the survivors of the massacre and to the next-of-kin of those who were killed, Guatemala was ordered to make compensatory payments to those individuals totalling US$ $7,996,836 ‚Äì the highest award ever given by the Court. In addition to the monetary redress, the Court ordered the state to fulfill its legal duties, undertake various infrastructure projects in the locality, and realise various symbolic acts of reparation and reconciliation: * Conduct a proper investigation of the massacre, and identify and punish the guilty. * Organise a ceremony in Plan de S√°nchez at which high-ranking government officials would recognise the state's responsibility and honour the memory of the dead, to be covered by the media and conducted in both Spanish and Achi Maya. * Translate the American Convention on Human Rights and the Court's two judgements into Achi Maya. * Publish key sections of those judgements in its official gazette and in a major national newspaper (in both languages). * Pay USD $25,000 for the upkeep of the village's memorial chapel to the massacre victims. * Build houses in the village. * Provide the survivors with any medical and psychological care they might require ‚Äì free of charge, including medicines and supplies. * In addition to regular budgeted government spending: ** Promote the study and awareness of the Achi Maya language and culture in the affected communities. ** Improve the municipality's road network, drinking water supply, and sewerage systems. ** Provide the communities with qualified, bilingual schoolteachers. ** Set up a health clinic in Plan de S√°nchez and a health centre in the town of Rabinal. All these items were to be completed within five years of the Court's judgement, with the state submitting annual progress reports until completion. Guatemala was also ordered to pay USD $55,000 in costs. The public ceremony required by the judgement was held in Plan de S√°nchez on 18 July 2005, the 23rd anniversary of the massacre. It was attended by representatives of the government, led by Vice President Eduardo Stein, delegations from the IACHR and the International Centre for Human Rights Research (CIIDH), as well as survivors and relatives of the victims. During the ceremony, Stein apologised for the actions of the army, which had \\"unleashed bloodshed and fire to wipe out an entire community\\".

He was widely known for his books of musical analysis and for his radio programmes Talking About Music, broadcast by the BBC from 1954 for approaching 40 years, first on the Third Programme, later Radio 3, and then on Radio 4. Life and career Hopkins was born Ernest William Antony Reynolds in London. Following the death of Antony's father in 1925, the headmaster at Berkhamsted School, Major Thomas Hopkins, and his wife volunteered to take the five-year-old Antony under a joint guardianship agreement; seven years later they officially adopted him, and his surname was changed to Hopkins. In 1937 he went to a summer school for pianists in Schwaz on the Innthal in Austria, where, hearing a performance of Schubert's Op. 90 Impromptus, he was inspired with the desire to become a musician. Hopkins entered the Royal College of Music (RCM) in 1939, where he studied harmony with Harold Darke and composition with Gordon Jacob. After an unsatisfactory start in his piano studies, he left his teacher to study under Cyril Smith. He also studied organ (though he described himself as \\"the world's worst organist\\").Haddon, Elizabeth. Making Music in Britain. Ashgate, 2006. p. 92 He won several scholarships as well as the Chappell Gold Medal for piano and the Cobbett prize for composition.Haddon (2006). p. 90 While still studying at the RCM, he became involved with the choir at Morley College, conducted by Michael Tippett who also gave Hopkins informal lessons in composition.Haddon (2006). pp. 93‚Äì94 In 1944 Tippett passed to Hopkins the job of composing incidental music for a production of Doctor Faustus at the Liverpool Playhouse; following its success, Louis MacNeice asked Hopkins to write incidental music for a radio play. For the next 15 years, Hopkins earned his living mostly from composing. Hopkins's first opera, Lady Rohesia (1947), based on the Ingoldsby Legends of sixteenth-century England, was staged at Sadler's Wells Theatre in 1948. His other operas include The Man from Tuscany, Three's Company (1953), and Hands Across the Sky.Cooke, Richard. \\"Hopkins, Antony\\" Grove Music Online, accessed 29 June 2014 Other works include the ballet Caf√© des Sports; and Scena for soprano and strings (which was later arranged for three solo voices and full orchestra).Profile, grainger.de; accessed 6 May 2014. Hopkins also wrote extensively for films, including Here Come the Huggetts (1948), The Pickwick Papers (1952), The Angel Who Pawned Her Harp (1954), Child's Play (1954), Cast a Dark Shadow (1955), The Blue Peter (1955), Seven Thunders (1957), and Billy Budd (1962).Profile, imdb.com; accessed 6 March 2014. In November 1953, Hopkins gave a BBC radio talk in which he explained, using musical examples, the intricacies of a Bach fugue. Martin Armstrong in The Listener magazine described Hopkins' programme as \\"a pyrotechnic display, by which I mean not flashy but brilliant ‚Äì it did not seem to promise amusing entertainment, yet this was what Mr Hopkins's half- hour analysis was\\". A producer of the BBC Third Programme, Roger Fiske, subsequently offered Hopkins carte blanche to do whatever he wanted on the radio: Hopkins suggested a half-hour programme on talking about works to be broadcast in the coming week. The resulting series, Talking About Music, ran from 1954 to 1992, and was syndicated to 44 countries. In the 1970s, he revived the long forgotten oratorio Ruth (infamous as 'the Worst Oratorio in the World') by the English composer George Tolhurst; this was heard again in 2009 on the BBC Radio 3 programme The Choir. From 1952 he was Artistic Director of the Intimate Opera Company, being replaced by Stephen Manton in 1963 though remaining a director and as music adviser of the company.

At certain points in history, they held considerable power, obliging the imperial and military governments to collaborate. The prominence of the s≈çhei rose in parallel with the ascendancy of the Tendai school's influence between the 10th and 17th centuries. The warriors protected land and intimidated rival schools of Buddhism, becoming a significant factor in the spread of Buddhism and the development of different schools during the Kamakura period.Kamien Keown, A Dictionary of Buddhism: S≈çhei, encyclopedia.com, A Dictionary of Buddhism 2004, originally published by Oxford University Press 2004 The s≈çhei shared many similarities with the European lay brothers, members of a monastic order who might not have been ordained. Much like the Teutonic Order, the warrior monks of Germany, and the crusading orders, s≈çhei did not operate as individuals, or even as members of small, individual temples, but rather as warriors in a large extended brotherhood or monastic order. The home temple of a s≈çhei monastic order might have had several, if not dozens or a hundred, smaller monasteries, training halls, and subordinate temples connected to it. A famous s≈çhei monastery is the Enryaku-ji on Mount Hiei, just outside Kyoto. History =Founding and feuds= Warrior monks first appeared during the Heian period, when bitter political feuds began between different temples, different subsects of Buddhism, over imperial appointments to the top temple positions (abbot, or zasu). Much of the fighting over the next four centuries was over these sorts of political feuds, and centered around the temples of Kyoto, Nara, and ≈åmi, namely the T≈çdai-ji, K≈çfuku-ji, Enryaku-ji, and Mii-dera, the four largest temples in the country. The first armed conflict broke out in 949, when 56 monks from T≈çdai-ji staged a protest at the residence of a Kyoto official, over an appointment that displeased them. Protests of this sort continued through the 10th century, often breaking out into brawls in which some participants would be killed. In 970, following a dispute between Enryaku-ji and the Yasaka Shrine of Kyoto, the former established the first standing army of warrior monks. It is not entirely clear whether or not this standing army consisted of monks from Enryaku-ji, or were more like mercenaries, since Ry≈çgen, the abbot who established this army, also established a code of monastic conduct that prevented monks from leaving Mount Hiei during their twelve-year training, from covering their faces, and from carrying weapons. Beginning in 981, there were a number of armed conflicts between Enryaku-ji and Mii-dera, each the head temple of a different sub-sect of Tendai. These disputes were, as before, over political appointments, and dishonorable etiquette. More often than not, these were cases of members of one faction being chosen as the abbot of the other faction's temple, and the monks would protest. This continued, on and off, once stopping for as long as 40 years, through the eleventh and into the 12th century. The armies became larger, and the violence increased, until in 1121 and 1141 Mii-dera was burned to the ground by monks from Enryaku-ji. Other temples became embroiled in the conflicts as well, and Enryaku-ji and Mii-dera united against K≈çfuku-ji, and, another time, against Kiyomizu-dera. =Genpei War= At the end of the 12th century, Japan was plunged into the Genpei War and, while the feuds between the temples did not end, they became subsumed by larger events. The warring Minamoto and Taira clans both tried to obtain the aid of the warrior monks of Nara and Kyoto, adding the temples' forces to the clans' already mighty armies of samurai. Taira no Kiyomori sent generous gifts of rice and silk to Enryakuji, ensuring they would not help his enemies, the Minamoto, who had allied themselves with the monks of Mii-dera. In the Battle of Uji in 1180, one of the more famous battles in which s≈çhei participated, the monks of Mii- dera, along with a force of Minamoto samurai, tried to defend the bridge over the Uji River, and the By≈çd≈ç-in, a temple behind it, from an attacking Taira force. The monks pulled up the planks of the bridge to impair the ability of the horse mounted samurai to cross. The warrior monks stood their ground with bow and arrow, naginata, sword and dagger, but were ultimately defeated. Following his victory, Taira no Kiyomori ordered that revenge be taken upon the monks that opposed him. Mii-dera was burned to the ground once again, as were many of the temples of Nara. Only the Enryaku-ji escaped unscathed. Three years later, when Minamoto no Yoshinaka betrayed his clan by storming into Kyoto, setting the H≈çj≈çji Palace aflame and kidnapping Emperor Go-Shirakawa, he was opposed by many of the monks of Kyoto, including those from Mount Hiei. =13th‚Äì14th centuries and the rise of Zen= Following the Genpei War, the monasteries, to a large extent, turned their attention to rebuilding, first physically, and then politically. Their political influence grew stronger through peaceful means, and the warrior monks played only very minor roles in the wars of the 13th and 14th centuries. Violent conflict between the temples still occurred on occasion, once again over political and spiritual appointments, and related matters. During the wars of the Nanboku-ch≈ç period, Mount Hiei took in the rebel Emperor Go-Daigo, and offered him sanctuary. Emperor Go-Daigo, along with his son, and the help of the s≈çhei of Mount Hiei, launched a brief rebellion against the Kamakura shogunate. The Ashikaga shogunate took power shortly afterwards, and supported Zen over the other Buddhist sects, drawing the ire of the warrior monks. Over the course of the 1340s‚Äì1360s a number of conflicts erupted between the Tendai sect temples, and those of Zen, especially Nanzen-ji. =Sengoku-jidai and the rise of the Ikk≈ç- Ikki= The ≈ånin War, starting in 1467, was the prelude to over a century of civil war in Japan, and the stimulus for a reorganization of the warrior monks. Unlike the J≈çky≈´ War and Mongol invasions of the 13th century, the ≈ånin War was fought primarily in Kyoto, and thus the warrior monks could no longer remain non-violent and neutral. In addition, a new breed of warrior monks was forming in the countryside. Where the monks of Mount Hiei had subscribed to the teachings of the Tendai sect, these new groups, calling themselves Ikk≈ç- ikki, followed the dictates of the J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ sect of beliefs. They were essentially coalitions of religious fundamentalist priests, farmers, and families, who were willing to literally fight for their beliefs. Ikk≈ç-ikki translates to something like \\"devoted league\\", but also had the connotation of \\"single-minded riots\\". In 1488, their leader Rennyo, incited an uprising against samurai rule, and secured Kaga Province for the Ikk≈ç-ikki. From there they spread, establishing themselves in Nagashima, Ishiyama Hongan-ji, and Mikawa Province. Their growing power base was eventually to attract the attention of warlords like Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu, who recognized their opposition to samurai rule, their determination, their strength, and their numbers. Oda Nobunaga forces setting fire to Enryaku-ji and massacring the monks in the 1571 Siege of Mount Hiei (depiction in the Ehon taik≈çki) Tokugawa Ieyasu attacked the Ikk≈ç-ikki of Mikawa in 1564, in the Battle of Azukizaka, and failed to defeat them, but returned shortly afterwards with a contingent of warrior monks from his own religious sect, J≈çdo-sh≈´, and, after defeating the Ikk≈ç adherents in battle, burned all their temples to the ground. As Oda Nobunaga rose to power at the end of the 1560s, the monks of Enryaku-ji regained their military might, and fought a number of skirmishes in the streets of Kyoto against a new rival sect, Nichiren Buddhism. They eventually burned all of Kyoto's Nichiren temples to the ground, and then sought allies among the local lords (daimy≈ç). Unfortunately for them, the Azai and Asakura clans they allied with were enemies of Oda Nobunaga. Beginning on September 29, 1571, Nobunaga's army of 30,000 led the Siege of Mount Hiei, destroying Enryaku-ji and massacring thousands. Though it was rebuilt, the standing army of warrior monks would never be reconstituted after this devastation. Nobunaga then moved on to fighting the Ikk≈ç-ikki in their fortresses of Nagashima and Ishiyama Hongan-ji (see Sieges of Nagashima, Ishiyama Hongan-ji War). In the summer of 1574, with the help of former pirate Kuki Yoshitaka, Nobunaga essentially blockaded the Ikk≈ç fortresses and starved them into submission. The 20,000 inhabitants of the fortress went up in flames along with their home. Two years later, Nobunaga returned to the Ishiyama Hongan-ji, which he had failed to take earlier. At the two Battles of Kizugawaguchi, Nobunaga defeated his enemies, the M≈çri clan, who had naval control over the area. The Ikk≈ç were finally forced to surrender in 1580. In the 1580s and 1590s, various factions of warrior monks sided with either Tokugawa Ieyasu or his rival Toyotomi Hideyoshi, fighting in a number of battles and skirmishes. When Tokugawa Ieyasu finally defeated the last of his enemies and took control of the country in 1603, the time of the warrior monks finally came to an end. Weapons and dress S≈çhei were quite varied in their armament. The naginata is the weapon most often associated with them, though in legend as well as history many warrior monks are known to have been proficient with everything from yari, yumi, tachi, and tant≈ç. Many fought on horseback, and many with the ≈ç-yoroi armor of the samurai. Warrior monks, like most other Buddhist monks of related sects, wore a series of kimono-like robes in layers, one over the other, usually white underneath, and tan or saffron yellow on top; this style has changed very little since the introduction of Buddhism to Japan in the 7th century. Footwear traditionally consisted of tabi socks and geta (wooden clogs), or waraji (straw sandals). Warrior monks would often fold and tie the white headcowl to cover more of their head, or would substitute a hachimaki headband. Finally, many warrior monks would wear some form of samurai armor. The s≈çhei employed a variety of weapons. The obi, or belt, of the kimono would often be supplemented with a heavier sash, so a sword could be slung from it. The long tachi was probably the most common sword, though many monks may have carried tant≈ç as well. Many monks were also accomplished archers, and used bamboo-and-rattan bows, called daiky≈´, with bamboo arrows. The most traditional weapon of the monk, however, was the naginata, a weapon much like the Chinese guandao or podao European glaive or the Russian sovnya. The s≈çhei were also trained to use the heavy kanab≈ç, which was a large club forged of solid iron. Although deadly, this weapon was generally used to defeat an opponent without bloodshed. The Ikk≈ç-ikki monks of the 16th century, due largely to their origins as countryside mobs, were far more varied in their armor and armament. Many wore the more traditional monk robes, with varying degrees and types of armor. Many wore various sorts of helmets, while many others opted for the straw hat and cloak of a peasant. Naginata remained very common, along with a variety of swords and daggers, and a limited number of arquebuses (with the Saika Ikki being a notable exception, as they are mainly composed of musketeers and gunsmiths as per Suzuki Magoichi's standard of having an all-musketeer army). Finally, while not truly armor nor armament, a very common item wielded by the mobs of Ikk≈ç-ikki monk warriors was a banner with a Buddhist slogan written upon it. One of the more common slogans was the nenbutsu, \\"Hail AmitƒÅbha!\\" (Namu Amida Butsu).

It is a non-profit organization that is incorporated in both Canada and the United States, and is funded by close to 30,000 donors. The Foundation describes its goal as to: The mission of the foundation is to \\"protect nature's diversity and the well-being of all life, now and for the future\\" and their vision is that \\"we all act every day on the understanding that we are one with nature.\\" Its origins lie in a 1989 \\"think-tank\\" retreat on Pender Island, British Columbia that was organized by David Suzuki and Tara Cullis. A dozen concerned individuals were invited, and inspired by those discussions the Foundation was incorporated on September 14, 1990. It officially opened its doors on January 1, 1991. It is a federally registered Canadian charity supported entirely by Foundation grants and donations. It does not accept any government funding, except from the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada. It is also not a funding body for other organizations. Currently the Foundation employs roughly seventy-five staff members. Programs The Foundation has four main program departments ‚Äì Ontario and Northern Region, Quebec/Francophone, B.C. and Western Region, and Science and Policy. Together, they focus on the following areas: * Protecting our climate ‚Äì Ensure that Canada is doing its fair share to avoid dangerous climate change and is on track to achieve a safe level of greenhouse gas emissions. * Transforming the economy ‚Äì Make certain that Canadians can maintain a high quality of life within the finite limits of nature through efficient resource use. * Protecting nature ‚Äì Work to protect the diversity and health of Canada's marine, freshwater, and terrestrial creatures and ecosystems. * Reconnecting with nature ‚Äì Ensure that Canadians, especially youth, learn about their dependence on a healthy environment through outdoor education. * Building community ‚Äì Engage Canadians to live healthier, more fulfilled and just lives with tips on building Earth-friendly infrastructure, making smart energy choices, using efficient transportation, and being mindful of the products, food and water we use. As part of its work the Foundation publishes newsletters, scientific studies, research reports, books, information kits, brochures, and news releases. Some major project areas include: * Trottier Energy Futures Project ‚Äì includes scientific reviews of the full range of energy production and distribution opportunities available to Canada, taking into account economic, social and environmental concerns. * Healthy Oceans and Sustainable Seafood ‚Äì includes work with SeaChoice.org to rank seafood options based on Green (best choice), Yellow (some concerns) and Red (avoid) * The Saint Lawrence: Our Living River ‚Äì focuses on protecting the health of one of Canada's most important waterways * Natural Capital Evaluation ‚Äì evaluates and describes ecosystem services, and calculates the economic cost if we had to provide them ourselves * Habitat Protection and Endangered Species ‚Äì includes scientific work to protect species and habitat, including grizzly bears and caribou * Connecting Youth with Nature ‚Äì uses educational guides and outreach to encourage kids‚Äîand adults‚Äîto spend more time outdoors * Queen of Green ‚Äì offers useful tips and methods to reduce your personal environmental impact  David Suzuki's Nature Challenge  As a mechanism to promote public awareness and action with regard to the Foundation's four focuses, the Foundation created the Nature Challenge program. In consultation with the Union of Concerned Scientists the Foundation researched the most effective ways to help conserve nature and improve our quality of life, and invited the public to embrace them in their daily lives. Their list is: * Reduce home energy use by 10% * Choose energy-efficient homes & appliances * Don't use pesticides * Eat meat-free meals one day a week * Buy locally grown and produced food * Choose a fuel-efficient vehicle * Walk, bike, carpool or take transit * Choose a home close to work or school * Support alternative transportation * Learn more and share with others over 500 000 individuals had taken David Suzuki's Nature Challenge.

Boyd, environmental lawyer and coauthor of the forthcoming book David Suzuki's Guide to Helping the Planet,David Suzuki's Guide to Helping the Planet at Amazon.com examined 25 environmental indicators, ranks Canada 28th out of the 29 OECD nations. The foundation and Boyd created a separate report, \\"Sustainability within a Generation\\", that addresses Canada's capacities to improve sustainability and environmental conservation. The foundation believes this can be best accomplished by improving efficiency, eliminating waste and pollution, and building sustainable cities. In February 2004, Suzuki met with the Prime Minister of Canada, Paul Martin, to present the Foundation's report on how sustainability could be achieved within a generation.  La Rose et al. v. Her Majesty the Queen  In October 25, 2019 The David Suzuki Foundation along with the Our Children's Trust and 15 youth activists including Cecilia La Rose, Sierra Robinson and S√°j Gray-Starcevich, have launched a federal lawsuit against the Canadian government claiming that the government has violated the youth's Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The lawsuit asks the Canadian Government to immediately begin reducing Canada's green house gas emissions to mitigate the effects of climate change.

Today, Hauptman's direct methods, which he continued to improve and refine, are routinely used to solve complicated structures. It was the application of this mathematical method to a wide variety of chemical structures that led the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to name Hauptman and Jerome Karle recipients of the 1985 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Life He was born in to a Jewish family in New York City, the oldest child of a Leah (Rosenfeld) and Israel Hauptman. He was married to Edith Citrynell since November 10, 1940, with two daughters, Barbara (1947) and Carol (1950). He was interested in science and mathematics from an early age which he pursued at Townsend Harris High School, graduated from the City College of New York (1937) and obtained an M.A. degree in mathematics from Columbia University in 1939. After the war he started a collaboration with Jerome Karle at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C. and at the same time enrolled in the Ph.D. program at the University of Maryland, College Park. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Maryland in 1955 in physics, which is part of the University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences. This combination of mathematics and physical chemistry expertise enabled them to tackle head-on the phase problem of X-ray crystallography. His work on this problem was criticized because, at the time, the problem was believed unsolvable. By 1955 he had received his Ph.D. in mathematics, and they had laid the foundations of the direct methods in X-ray crystallography. Their 1953 monograph, \\"Solution of the Phase Problem I. The Centrosymmetric Crystal\\", contained the main ideas, the most important of which was the introduction of probabilistic methods through a development of the Sayre equation. In 1970 he joined the crystallographic group of the Medical Foundation of Buffalo of which he was Research Director in 1972. During the early years of this period he formulated the neighborhood principle and extension concept. These theories were further developed during the following decades. In 2003, as an atheist\\"Outside the field of scientific research, he was known for his outspoken atheism: belief in God, he once declared, is not only incompatible with good science, but is \\"damaging to the wellbeing of the human race.\\" \\" The Telegraph. and secular humanist, he was one of 22 Nobel laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto. Works Hauptman has authored over 170 publications, including journal articles, research papers, chapters and books. In 1970, Hauptman joined the crystallographic group of the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute (formerly the Medical Foundation of Buffalo) of which he became Research Director in 1972. Until his death, he served as President of the Hauptman- Woodward Medical Research Institute as well as Research Professor in the Department of Biophysical Sciences and Adjunct Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University at Buffalo. Prior to coming to Buffalo, he worked as a mathematician and supervisor in various departments at the Naval Research Laboratory from 1947. He received his B.S. from City College of New York, M.S. from Columbia University and Ph.D. from the University of Maryland, College Park.

After losing his seat at the December 2012 general election, his daughter Ayuko Kato regained the seat for the LDP at the following election. His father, , also sat in the House of Representatives for five terms between 1952 and 1965.  Political career  Kato was born in Tsuruoka, Yamagata Prefecture. After graduating from the University of Tokyo he joined the Foreign ministry in 1963, which led to stints at the Japanese embassies in Taipei and Washington, D.C. In 1967 he completed a Master's degree at Harvard University. After continuing his foreign service career in Hong Kong he returned to Japan as an aide in the China Affairs Bureau of the Foreign Ministry. His experience in foreign affairs resulted in fluent English and Chinese, and he remains deeply interested in relations with China. Kato was first elected to the Diet in 1972, representing his native Yamagata and has represented that area continuously until 2012, except for a 19-month period following his resignation due to a scandal in April 2002. He was aligned with the K≈çchikai (then called ≈åhira) faction of the LDP, which produced three Japanese Prime Ministers; Masayoshi ≈åhira, Zenk≈ç Suzuki, and Kiichi Miyazawa. The power of this faction provided Kato ample opportunity for promotion, and he served in several Cabinet Positions through the 1980s and early 1990s. From 1984 to 1986 he was Director General of the Japan Defense Agency. In 1992, he was elected Secretary-General of the LDP, a time when the traditional dominance of the party was being challenged.  YKK and the 2000 leadership challenge  Always seen as something of a maverick, during the Kaifu administration Kato formed a relationship with two other young LDP reformers, Taku Yamasaki and Jun'ichir≈ç Koizumi. The three together became known as YKK after the initials of their last names. Originally the trio had agreed to sway their factions towards the new generation of LDP leaders, and marginalize the old guard within the Diet. With the election of Miyazawa (then leader of Kato's own faction) in 1991, YKK gained greater prestige and power within the party. From the Miyazawa era onwards, YKK represented the power base of the anti-mainstream faction in the LDP. All three leaders made repeated tilts at the party leadership in the 1990s, but were unsuccessful. In 1998 Kato assumed leadership of the Kochikai Faction, taking over from Miyazawa. Upon the sudden illness and death of Keiz≈ç Obuchi in May 2000, Kato did not make a leadership challenge, believing that internal strife would not be healthy for a party in mourning. By November, however, displeased with the slow pace of reform and poor public image in the Mori administration, Kato made his move. After consulting with the opposition parties, Kato realized that with support of his and Yamasaki's factions, a vote of no-confidence in Mori would pass in the Diet. Initial public reaction to Kato's announcement of this vote was good, with Mori's approval ratings diving to 30%. Unfortunately for Kato, the LDP Secretary-General at this time, Hiromu Nonaka, was a strong supporter of Mori. Nonaka launched a harsh round of party discipline, threatening to expel any LDP members that voted against Mori. Nonaka's threats had the desired effect: even within his own faction Kato's support dried up. Knowing that he could not win, Kato and his remaining supporters abstained from the no-confidence vote as a face-saving measure. The damage had been done, however. Kato and Yamasaki were left to bear the full brunt of public humiliation. The aftermath of Kato's rebellion was disastrous. A large segment of his faction split off, weakening his influence in the Diet. Public opinion that had initially supported ousting Mori now blamed Kato for his failure. The opposition parties were frustrated with his unwillingness to break from the LDP. Both Kato and Yamasaki had been considered candidates for Prime Minister, but with the loss of prestige resulting from the Mori affair, they had lost their chance. With Nonaka's resignation shortly after Kato's rebellion, the path was clear for someone to replace Mori. Jun'ichir≈ç Koizumi, the only member of YKK undamaged by the events of November 2001, finally gained control of the LDP. While Kato and Yamasaki had failed, the reformist, anti-mainstream ideals of YKK had finally moved to the forefront of Japanese politics, providing validation for Kato and his views.  Kato and Ichir≈ç Ozawa  Kato has had a sometimes difficult relationship with fellow reformer Ichir≈ç Ozawa. Ozawa had been a strong advocate for reform within the mainstream Tanaka/Takeshita faction, but he had chosen to split from the party in 1993 and form the Japan Renewal Party, rather than continue within the LDP. This was seen as a serious betrayal by many, including Kato. When Kato was in a similar position in 2000, he chose party loyalty, despite his chances of considerable influence in the opposition had he crossed over. When the LDP was considering a merger with Ozawa's Liberal Party in the late 90s, Kato was strongly opposed to bringing Ozawa back to the LDP fold. Ozawa and Kato are often portrayed as arch-nemeses, despite their very similar views on economic and political reform (in foreign policy Kato is somewhat less hawkish than Ozawa, advocating a more cautious international role for Japan).  Scandals  Kato has been involved in several scandals. He was implicated in the Recruit scandal in the late 1980s, tarnishing his reputation for several years. In 2002 he was the centre of a major scandal involving tax evasion, bribery and misuse of political funds. His secretary Saburo Sato had been charging a \\"Kato Consumption Tax\\" to companies wanting access to Kato while seeking public contracts. Sato had also failed to declare Ôø•100 million in taxes. While Kato denied any knowledge of the affair, few believed that such widespread corruption could have occurred in his office without his approval. It was later revealed that he had been using funds earmarked for political use to pay the rent on his Tokyo apartment. Faced with this evidence, Kato acquiesced to demands for his resignation. In November 2003 he made his return to the Diet, having retreated from politics long enough for the scandal to die down.  House fire  In mid-August, 2006, Kato's adjoining house and office burned to the ground on the anniversary of the surrender of Japan in World War II. The attack was confirmed as arson and the lead suspect was expected to be charged some time in September 2006 .

He had an extensive stage and screen career. Career =Early years= Thomas Patrick McKenna was born at Mullagh, Co. Cavan, Ireland, in 1929 and educated at Mullagh School and St Patrick's College, Cavan. There he became a prot√©g√© of Fr. Vincent Kennedy who featured him in the annual productions of Gilbert & Sullivan operas. He was a noted treble and sang in Cavan Cathedral, but later would also become a keen member of the school's Gaelic Football squad representing St Patrick's in the final of the All Ireland colleges competition in 1948. After leaving school he joined the Ulster Bank in Granard, Co Longford, and worked in banking for the next five years. However, he remained set on becoming an actor and when he received a posting to Dublin he soon made a mark on the city's amateur scene appearing with the Rathmines & Rathgar Operatic Society, and the Dublin Shakespeare Society. His employers were not impressed by his extra curricular activities and in 1953 he was posted to the remote town of Killeshandra in County Cavan. McKenna refused to go and resigned his position. =Stage= McKenna made his stage debut at the Pike Theatre in Dublin in 1953 as John Buchanan in Tennessee Williams' Summer and Smoke. He played a season at the Gaiety Theatre with Anew McMaster's Shakespearean company, and was a member of The Gas Theatre Company directed by Godfrey Quigley. Through family contacts he sought an interview with the managing director of the Abbey Theatre, Ernest Blythe. Despite Blythe's concerns that \\"his nose was too long and he would grow fat\\". he eventually become a permanent member of the company in 1954 and would remain there for the next eight years performing over seventy roles. In 1963 he secured a short leave of absence to go to London (St. Martin's Theatre) with the Gate Theatre's production of Stephen D, an adaptation of Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by Hugh Leonard which had been a hit of the 1962 Dublin Theatre Festival. The play was well received by the London critics, leading to offers of further other stage work there including \\"O'Keefe\\" in J. P. Donleavy's The Ginger Man (Ashcroft, Croydon), Lindsay Anderson's revival of Julius Caesar (1964) for the English Stage Company and 1965 as the Burglar (Aubrey \\"Popsy\\" Bagot) in Shaw's Too True to be Good (Garrick) opposite Alistair Sim and George Cole. He had not left the Irish stage behind entirely however and would make regular appearances at the Dublin Theatre Festival in A Little Winter Love, Pull Down A Horseman, King of the Castle and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. He joined Stuart Burge's company at the Nottingham Playhouse in 1968 playing Trigorin in The Seagull and Sir Joseph Surface in Sheridan's The School For Scandal, both directed by Jonathan Miller. In 1969 he created the role of Fitzpatrick in David Storey's The Contractor directed by Lindsay Anderson at the Royal Court Theatre, London. The production later transferred to the Fortune Theatre and ran for over a year. In 1973 he took on the role of Andrew Wyke opposite his friend Donal Donnelly in the Irish premiere of Peter Shaffer's Sleuth. The production played to acclaim at the Opera House, Cork, and at the Olympia Theatre in Dublin where it broke box office records. Later that year he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company and took over the role of Robert Hand in James Joyce's only play, Exiles directed by Harold Pinter. In the same season he also appeared in a rare staging of Jean Genet's The Balcony directed by Terry Hands. He returned to the RSC in 1976 for Shaw's The Devil's Disciple, directed by Jack Gold in a production to mark the American bicentennial celebrations, as the revolutionary pastor Reverend Anthony Anderson. In the late 1980s and 1990s he returned to the Dublin stage when he was invited by director Michael Colgan to join the Gate Theatre on a number of occasions including admired productions of Uncle Vanya, The Cherry Orchard and No Man's Land. It was there he created the role of Dr Rice in Brian Friel's drama, Molly Sweeney (1994), and again at London's Almeida Theatre. Other Friel productions he appeared in were The Communication Cord (Hampstead Theatre, 1984) and Aristocrats (2004) at the RNT in his final stage appearance. McKenna directed on occasion, and had to his name productions of John Millington Synge's The Playboy of the Western World (Nottingham Playhouse, 1968), Thomas Kilroy's The Death and Resurrection of Mr Roche (Abbey Theatre, 1973) and Se√°n O'Casey's The Shadow of A Gunman (Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, 1980). =Film and television= During the 1960s and 1970s, McKenna appeared regularly in popular television dramas, including The Avengers (1964, 1965, 1968), Danger Man (1965), The Saint (1966, 1968), Adam Adamant Lives!

P. McKenna"},{"id":"1262940","text":"Sociological Abstraction refers to the varying levels at which theoretical concepts can be understood. This idea is very similar to the philosophical understanding of abstraction. There are two basic levels of sociological abstraction: sociological concepts and operationalized sociological concepts. A sociological concept is a mental construct that represents some part of the world in a simplified form. An example of a mental construct is the idea of class, or the distinguishing of two groups based on their income, culture, power, or some other defining characteristic(s). Concepts can remain abstract or can be operationalized. Operationalizing a sociological concept takes it to the concrete level by defining how one is going to measure it. Thus, with the concept of class one could operationalize it by actually measuring people's income. Once operationalized, you have a concrete representation of a sociological concept. In addition to the basic levels of sociological abstraction, sociological concepts are often understood at multiple levels as a result of sociological theorizing. Sociological theories postulate relationships between sociological concepts. It is generally understood that there are three levels of sociological theorizing: The most abstract level of sociological theory is often referred to as Grand Theory. Grand Theory attempts to explain the inter-relationships among numerous concepts and intends to be independent of time and space. In other words, it intends to be universally applicable. An example would be Talcott Parsons' Action Systems Theory, which attempted to explain the workings of society at a very abstract level. Another example would be Marx's Historical Materialism, which argued economic relations were the foundation of social structure. Middle-range theories are also explanations of human behavior that go beyond one particular observation but are limited in scope and do not attempt to explain all of society. A classic example (with Grand Theory implications) would be Durkheim's research on suicide. He proposed a relationship between the breakdown of social bonds found in religions (Protestantism vs. Catholicism) as the reason for higher rates of suicide in specific areas. Micro-level theories are limited to explanations of specific observations and are not intended to be universal. For instance, current work on religious activity in the U.S. seems to indicate that religious pluralism and marketforces have played a role in reducing the apparent amount of secularization (defined here as 'decreased levels of religiosity'). As the U.S. is one of few examples of a modernized country where levels of religiosity have remained relatively high over time (perhaps the only example), the theory seems applicable only to the U.S. and only during a specified time period.

History Easley McCain Recording began as Doug Easley's rudimentary, four-track studio in the woods near the Wolf River bottoms in Memphis in the late 1970s recording blues musicians like Mose Vinson, as well as local rock bands. In the early 1980s Easley operated \\"Easley Recording\\" out of a hand-built garage studio behind his home near University of Memphis. During this period, bands such as Tav Falco's Panther Burns came in to record; Alex Chilton produced an album for a Detroit group called The Gories the last year the studio was located in Easley's garage. By 1990, Easley, with new partner Davis McCain, had found a larger midtown Memphis facility for the studio and moved into it by the next year. McCain had been the sound man at a 1980s local alternative music nightspot called The Antenna Club. The new Easley studio site was originally built in 1967 as \\"the Onyx\\" for Don Crews, who had been a business partner at American Sound Studios with producer Chips Moman. Crews parted from Moman at that time to start his own studio at the Onyx location. Easley McCain Recording's business began to pick up more clients from outside Memphis in the early 1990s, after a local group called the Grifters grew in popularity and advertised the studio's phone number in their liner notes. Indie rock bands from around the country including Pavement, Sonic Youth, Come began recording there. By 2001 the White Stripes had become a client, which led in turn to a Jack White-produced album by Loretta Lynn to be mixed there. Others recording at this indie-oriented studio have included Townes Van Zandt, Pezz, Jeff Buckley, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Guided by Voices, Lydia Lunch, , Box Tops, Rufus Thomas, Wilco, Cat Power, Modest Mouse, Kim Deal with her band The Amps, The Bamboozlers (precursors to Ingram Hill), Custard, Grifters (band), and many more. On March 2, 2005, the studio's lobby and control room sustained serious damage in a fire. https://www.memphisflyer.com/memphis/fire-at-easley-mccain- studio/Content?oid=1121357 In 2009, after four years of inactivity, Easley McCain Recording reopened at a brand new location in Memphis, TN.

' was a Taira defensive position at Suma, to the west of present-day Kobe, Japan. It sat on a very narrow strip of shore, between mountains on the north, and the sea to the south. This made it quite defensible, but also made it difficult to maneuver troops inside the fortress. The Taira suffered a crucial defeat to the forces of Yoshitsune and Noriyori. Yoshitsune split his force in two. Noriyori's force attacked the Taira at Ikuta Shrine, in the woods a short distance to the east. A second detachment, no more than a hundred horsemen under Yoshitsune, attacked the Taira at Ichinotani from the mountain ridge to the north. At the chosen hour, the Minamoto forces attacked causing confusion amongst the Taira who neither deploy nor retreat. Only about 3000 Taira escaped to Yashima, while Tadanori was killed and Shigehira captured. Also killed from the Taira clan were Lord Michimori, Tsunemasa, Atsumori, Moromori, Tomoakira, Tsunetoshi, and Moritoshi. Ichi-no-Tani is one of the most famous battles of the Genpei War, in large part due to the individual combats that occurred here. Benkei, probably the most famous of all warrior monks, fought alongside the Minamoto Yoshitsune here, and many of the Taira's most important and powerful warriors were present as well. The death of Taira no Atsumori at the hand of Kumagai no Naozane is a particularly famous passage in Heike Monogatari. It has been dramatized in noh and kabuki, and in popular fiction, Oda Nobunaga is often portrayed as performing the noh at his own death (ningen goju nen geten no uchi wo kurabureba, yumemaboroshi no gotoku nari). The death of Atsumori is arguably among the most celebrated acts of single combat in all of Japanese history.

The IPCC was established in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the UN's World Meteorological Organization (WMO) \\"... to assess scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant for the understanding of climate change, its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation.\\"IPCC website& The Third Assessment Report is the third of a series of assessments; it has been superseded by the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), released in 2007. Statements of the IPCC or information from the TAR are often used as a reference showing a scientific consensus on the subject of global warming, although a small minority of scientists take issue with the UN assessments (see also Global warming controversy and Politics of global warming). Working groups The IPCC is organized as three working groups (WG) and a task force : * WGI: Scientific aspects of climate (see ). * WGII: Vulnerability, consequences, and options (see ). * WGIII: Limitation and mitigation options (see ). * Task Force: National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme WG I covers the same areas as the Second Assessment Report (SAR) of 1995, but WG II & III cover slightly different areas in the TAR. Conclusions =Working Group I= The key conclusions of Working Group I (The Scientific Basis, Summary for Policymakers, in ) were: #An increasing body of observations gives a collective picture of a warming world and other changes in the climate system (The global average surface temperature has increased over the 20th century by about 0.6 ¬∞C; Temperatures have risen during the past four decades in the lowest 8 kilometres of the atmosphere; Snow cover and ice extent have decreased) #Emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols due to human activities continue to alter the atmosphere in ways that are expected to affect the climate (Anthropogenic aerosols (i.e., human emitted aerosols) are short-lived and mostly produce negative radiative forcing; Natural factors have made small contributions to radiative forcing over the past century) #Confidence in the ability of models to project future climate has increased (Complex physically based climate models are required to provide detailed estimates of feedbacks and of regional features. Such models cannot yet simulate all aspects of climate (e.g., they still cannot account fully for the observed trend in the surface-troposphere temperature difference since 1979) and there are particular uncertainties associated with clouds and their interaction with radiation and aerosols. Nevertheless, confidence in the ability of these models to provide useful projections of future climate has improved due to their demonstrated performance on a range of space and time-scales .) #There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities #Human influences will continue to change atmospheric composition throughout the 21st century #Global average temperature and sea level are projected to rise under all IPCC SRES scenarios. The TAR estimate for the climate sensitivity is 1.5 to 4.5 ¬∞C; and the average surface temperature is projected to increase by 1.4 to 5.8 Celsius degrees over the period 1990 to 2100, and the sea level is projected to rise by 0.1 to 0.9 metres over the same period. The wide range in projections is based upon several different scenarios that assume different levels of future CO2 emissions (see the section below on Projections in the TAR). =Synthesis Report= The TAR Synthesis Report includes a summary of the TAR's main findings and uncertainties. , in \\"Robust findings\\" of the TAR include: *Observed warming of the Earth's surface, attribution of observed warming to human activities, projected increases in future global mean temperature, rising sea levels, and increased frequency of heat waves. *Future warming will have both beneficial and adverse effects, but for higher levels of warming, adverse effects will predominate. *Developing countries and poor persons are most vulnerable to climate change. \\"Key uncertainties\\" in the TAR include: *Estimated climate forcings of natural climatic factors and anthropogenic aerosols (e.g., sulfate, which is produced when sulfur-rich coal is burnt), future changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the role of climate feedbacks, which may amplify or reduce the magnitude of future climate change; *Assigning probabilities to projections of changes in sea level and temperature, as well as uncertainties related to regional projections of climate change. Projections Projections are used in the TAR as a guide to the possible future effects of climate change, e.g., changes in global mean temperature and sea level. , in In the TAR, the word \\"projection\\" is favoured over \\"prediction\\". , in This is because many future changes related to climate are highly uncertain. , in For example, climate change projections are affected by highly uncertain changes in future GHG emissions. , in The TAR projects impacts according to possible future changes in global mean temperature. , in Other projections are based on scenarios that the IPCC has developed. In 2000, , p.143 in the IPCC published 40 different scenarios , pp.143-144 in (the \\"SRES\\" scenarios) which contain estimates of future changes in anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols. The SRES scenarios project a wide range of possible changes in future social and economic development, and projected climate change impacts vary according to the scenario considered. , in The IPCC has not assigned probabilities to the 40 SRES scenarios. Some authors , in have argued that some SRES scenarios are more likely to occur than others. Scientific opinion The IPCC is backed by the scientific community. , in . This document is also available in PDF format For example, a joint statement of support was issued in May 2001 by the science academies of Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, the Caribbean, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, New Zealand, Sweden and the UK. It states: \\"We recognise the IPCC as the world's most reliable source of information on climate change and its causes, and we endorse its method of achieving consensus.\\" In 2001, the executive branch of the US federal government asked the US National Research Council (US NRC, 2001) , in to produce an assessment of climate change science. Part of the assessment by US NRC (2001) , in looks at the report produced by Working Group I (WG I) in the TAR. Working Group I's contribution to the TAR assesses the physical scientific aspects of the climate system and climate change. US NRC (2001) generally agrees with findings of the WG I report, for example, US NRC (2001) , in state that \\"[the] IPCC‚Äôs conclusion that most of the observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations accurately reflects the current thinking of the scientific community on this issue.\\" US NRC (2001) , in emphasise the need for governments to have a good understanding of uncertainties in climate change science. The example cited by US NRC (2001) is the uncertainty over future changes in GHG emissions, which may be less or more than that projected by the TAR. US NRC (2001) also state: > The most valuable contribution U.S. scientists can make is to continually > question basic assumptions and conclusions, promote clear and careful > appraisal and presentation of the uncertainties about climate change as well > as those areas in which science is leading to robust conclusions, and work > toward a significant improvement in the ability to project the future. =Criticism= The IPCC's work has been the subject of criticism,e.g., see: , in and there are a small number of climate scientists , in , in who disagree with aspects of the IPCC's work. Perhaps the best known is Richard Lindzen, professor of meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. IPCC process A report by the UK Parliament's House of Lords Economic Affairs Select Committee (EAC, 2005) contains criticisms of the IPCC's work, including the \\"SRES\\" greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, , in which are used in the TAR. The Economic Affairs Select Committee is made up of members of the House of Lords, which scrutinizes and votes on government legislation. One of the criticisms made by the EAC (2005) , in is an apparent inconsistency between the Working Group II Summary for Policymakers and a statement made in the full WGII report: \\"The IPCC Summary for policy makers says that economic studies underestimate damage, whereas the chapter says the direction of the bias is not known.\\" The UK Government issued a response to the report by EAC (2005). The UK Government acknowledged the discrepancy between the WGII SPM and full WGII report which was referred to by the EAC (2005), , in but remained generally supportive of the IPCC's procedures. The UK Government rebutted a number of other criticisms of the TAR which were made by the EAC (2005).e.g.: , in  See also  * Attribution of recent climate change * Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change, and an international conference on the topic. * Climate change * Carbon dioxide equivalent * Effects of global warming * Energy conservation * Energy policy * Global warming controversy * Global climate model * World energy resources and consumption Notes References The Third Assessment Report consists of the following reports from each of the three Working Groups, and a Synthesis Report.

It can also refer to the tendency to assume that there is a perfect solution to a particular problem. A closely related concept is the perfect solution fallacy. By creating a false dichotomy that presents one option which is obviously advantageous‚Äîwhile at the same time being completely implausible‚Äîa person using the nirvana fallacy can attack any opposing idea because it is imperfect. Under this fallacy, the choice is not between real world solutions; it is, rather, a choice between one realistic achievable possibility and another unrealistic solution that could in some way be \\"better\\". History In La B√©gueule (1772), Voltaire wrote Le mieux est l'ennemi du bien, which is often translated as \\"The perfect is the enemy of the good\\" (literally: \\"The best is the enemy of the good\\"). The nirvana fallacy was given its name by economist Harold Demsetz in 1969, who said:H. Demsetz, \\"Information and Efficiency: Another Viewpoint\\", Journal of Law and Economics 12 (April 1969): 1, quoted in  Perfect solution fallacy  The perfect solution fallacy is a related informal fallacy that occurs when an argument assumes that a perfect solution exists or that a solution should be rejected because some part of the problem would still exist after it were implemented.http://my.ilstu.edu/~jecox/FOI%20Materials/Logical%20Fallacies%20Definitions%20and%20Examples.htm This is an example of black and white thinking, in which a person fails to see the complex interplay between multiple component elements of a situation or problem, and, as a result, reduces complex problems to a pair of binary extremes. It is common for arguments which commit this fallacy to omit any specifics about exactly how, or how badly, a proposed solution is claimed to fall short of acceptability, expressing the rejection only in vague terms. Alternatively, it may be combined with the fallacy of misleading vividness, when a specific example of a solution's failure is described in emotionally powerful detail but base rates are ignored (see availability heuristic). The fallacy is a type of false dilemma. = Examples = ;Posit (fallacious) : These anti-drunk driving ad campaigns are not going to work.

Dubbed the \\"Girl with the Giggle in Her Voice\\", she was the highest paid British female entertainer of her era. Childhood and early musical career She was born on 19 May 1932 in Whitechapel, London, of Russian-Romanian Jewish descent. Her father's family, the Kogins, arrived in Britain from Russia, while her mother's family were refugees from Romania. Cogan's parents, Mark and Fay Cogan, had another daughter, the actress Sandra Caron,The \\"Tail Pieces by the Alley Cat\\" column in NME dated 14 September 1956 cites Sandra Caron's age as 19. who went on to play \\"Mumsey\\" in The Crystal Maze, and one son, Ivor Cogan. Mark's work as a haberdasher entailed frequent moves. One of Cogan's early homes was over his shop in Worthing, Sussex. Although Jewish, she attended St Joseph's Convent School in Reading. Her father was a singer, but it was Cogan's mother who had showbusiness aspirations for both her daughters (she had named Cogan after silent screen star Alma Taylor). Cogan first performed in public at a charity show at the Palace Theatre in Reading, and at the age of eleven, competed in the \\"Sussex Queen of Song\\" contest held at a Brighton hotel, winning a prize of ¬£5. Aged 14, she was recommended by Vera Lynn for a variety show at the Grand Theatre in Brighton. At 16 she was told by bandleader Ted Heath \\"You've got a good voice, but you're far too young for this business. Come back in five years' time.\\" Heath would later say: \\"'Letting her go was one of the biggest mistakes of my life.\\" Dead Link @ 04-2015 But Cogan found work singing at tea dances, while also studying dress design at Worthing Art College, and was soon appearing in the musical High Button Shoes and a revue, Sauce Tartare. She became resident singer at the Cumberland Hotel in 1949, where she was spotted by EMI producer Walter Ridley, who became her coach and signed her to HMV. \\"Girl with the giggle\\" Cogan's first release was \\"To Be Worthy of You\\" / \\"Would You\\", recorded on her 20th birthday. This led to her appearing regularly on comedian Dick Bentley's BBC's radio show Gently Bentley, and then becoming the vocalist for the BBC Radio comedy programme Take It From Here, replacing Joy Nichols, from 1953 to the end of its run in 1960. In 1953, whilst in the middle of recording \\"If I Had a Golden Umbrella\\", she broke into a giggle; she then played up the effect on later recordings. Soon enough, she was dubbed the \\"Girl with the giggle in her voice\\" (\\"Giggle\\" has sometimes been quoted as \\"chuckle\\".) Many of her recordings were covers of U.S. hits, especially those recorded by Rosemary Clooney, Teresa Brewer, Georgia Gibbs, Joni James and Dinah Shore. Her voice was often compared with Doris Day's. One of these covers, \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\", became her first hit, reaching no. 4 on 3 April 1954. Cogan would appear in the UK Singles Chart eighteen times in the 1950s, with \\"Dreamboat\\" reaching no. 1. Other hits from this period include \\"I Can't Tell a Waltz from a Tango\\", \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\", \\"Sugartime\\" and \\"The Story of My Life\\". Cogan's first album, I Love to Sing, was released in 1958. Cogan was one of the first UK recording artists to appear frequently on television, where her powerful voice could be showcased along with her bubbly personality and dramatic costumes. Her hooped skirts with sequins and figure- hugging tops were reputedly designed by herself and never worn twice. Cliff Richard recalls: \\"My first impression of her was definitely frocks ‚Äì I kept thinking, how many can this woman have? Almost every song had a different costume. The skirts seemed to be so wide ‚Äì I don't know where they hung them up!\\" Cogan topped the annual NME reader's poll as \\"Outstanding British Female Singer\\" four times between 1956 and 1960. Too square for the 1960s Cogan (right) with Israeli singer Ilana Rovina, Tel Aviv, 1963 The UK musical revolution of the 1960s, symbolised by the rise of the Beatles, suddenly made Cogan unfashionable; in the 1991 BBC documentary Alma Cogan: The Girl with the Giggle in Her Voice, Lionel Blair said she was perceived as \\"square\\". Her highest 1960s chart ranking in the UK was no. 26 with \\"We Got Love\\", and most of her successes at this time were abroad, notably in Sweden and Japan. She was especially disappointed that her 1963 cover of the Exciters' US hit \\"Tell Him\\" did not return her to the UK charts, according to singer Eddie Grassham. In 1964, Cogan recorded \\"Tennessee Waltz\\" in a rock-and-roll ballad style; this version was no. 1 in Sweden for five weeks and also reached the top 20 in Denmark, while a German language rendering reached no. 10 in Germany. She had another number one hit in Sweden in 1965, \\"The Birds and the Bees\\". Cogan also wrote some of her own songs. She co-wrote her 1963 record \\"Just Once More\\" (under the pseudonym of \\"Al Western\\") with her long-time pianist Stan Foster; her 1964 record \\"It's You\\" was also a Cogan-Foster collaboration, although this time she was credited under her own name. \\"Just Once More\\" peaked at no. 10 in the Swedish Voting Chart \\"Tio i Topp\\" in October 1963. She continued to be a popular figure on the UK showbusiness scene, being offered the part of Nancy in Oliver!, appearing on the teenage hit-show Ready Steady Go!, and headlining at the Talk of the Town. Personal life Cogan lived with her widowed mother in Kensington High Street (at 44 Stafford Court) in a lavishly decorated ground-floor flat where she frequently entertained other celebrities. Regular visitors included Princess Margaret, No√´l Coward, Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Michael Caine, Frankie Vaughan, Bruce Forsyth and Roger Moore. John Lennon once recalled that, when he was a teenager, he used to mimic her savagely during his time at the Liverpool College of Art. Lennon's wife Cynthia also recalled, \\"John and I had thought of Alma [as] out of date and unhip.\\" But after Lennon actually met Cogan on the TV pop show Ready Steady Go! in 1964, they became close friends, so much so that Cogan's sister Sandra later said that the pair had a serious romance that had to be kept secret because of Alma's family's strict Jewish faith. Cogan was close to the other Beatles as well, especially Paul McCartney, who first played the melody of \\"Yesterday\\" on her piano; he also played tambourine on her recording of \\"I Knew Right Away\\". Illness and death Cogan tried to update her image by recording some Beatles numbers and a spin-off from The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (\\"Love Ya Illya\\"). But by 1965 record producers were becoming dissatisfied with Cogan's work, and it was clear that her health was failing. Her friend and colleague Anne Shelton attributed this decline to some 'highly experimental' injections she took to lose weight, claiming that Cogan was never well again after that. Cogan embarked on a series of club dates in the North of England in early 1966, but collapsed after two performances and had to be treated for stomach cancer. She made her final TV appearance in August, on the guest-spot of International Cabaret. The following month she collapsed while touring Sweden to promote Hello Baby, recorded exclusively for the Swedish market. She died of ovarian cancer at London's Middlesex Hospital on 26 October, at the age of 34. In deference to family custom, her death was observed with traditional Jewish rites, with burial at the Jewish Cemetery in Bushey, Hertfordshire. Legacy The novel Alma Cogan by Gordon Burn presents an imaginary middle-aged Cogan looking back on life and fame in the 1980s. It claimed to be based on true events and real people, except for her early death, and won the Whitbread Book Award in 1991. Partly adapted from this novel was the BBC Radio 4 series Stage Mother, Sequinned Daughter (2002) by Annie Caulfield. Cogan's sister Sandra felt that it misrepresented both Cogan and her mother, and tried unsuccessfully to get it banned. Eventually the Broadcasting Standards Commission ruled that the BBC apologise to Sandra for failing to respect the feelings of the surviving family members. The romantic comedy In Love with Alma Cogan is a film starring Roger Lloyd-Pack. He is an aging manager of an old-fashioned Pier Theatre. It leads to a flashback to his encounter with Alma Cogan, who performed at the theatre in his youth. A blue plaque commemorating Cogan was installed by the entrance of 44 Stafford Court, her longtime residence, on 4 November 2001.

from a bottle of Ch√¢teau P√©desclaux wine. Ch√¢teau P√©desclaux is a winery in the Pauillac appellation of the Bordeaux region of France. The wine produced here was classified as one of eighteen Cinqui√®mes Crus (Fifth Growths) in the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855. History The Ch√¢teau was founded in 1810 by winebroker Pierre Urbain P√©desclaux, who passed it to his son Pierre-Edmond in 1849. After death of the latter his widow continued to run the Ch√¢teau until 1891, when the estate was sold to the Count de Gastebois.Chateau Website, History In 1930, Lucien Jugla became tenant, and eventually purchased the Ch√¢teau in 1950. In 1960, Lucien Jugla added Ch√¢teau Belle-Rose, a 13.7-hectare estate which he had been farming since 1943, to P√©desclaux. Belle-Rose‚Äôs bourgeois building became the home of the classified growth and appeared on the new labels. In 2009, the estate was purchased by Jacky Lorenzetti, who also owns Chateau Lilian Ladouys in Saint- Est√®phe and 50% of Ch√¢teau d'Issan in Margaux. retrieved 25 March 2014 Lorenzetti enlarged the vineyards with the purchase of 12 hectares of Medoc vines that are situated next to parcels owned by Chateau Lafite Rothschild and Chateau Mouton Rothschild. http://www.thewinecellarinsider.com/bordeaux-wine- producer-profiles/bordeaux/pauillac/pedesclaux/#ixzz2yovtnsT8 retrieved 13 April 2014 Vineyards and wines The vineyard covers an area of 46 hectares and produces about 8,000 cases of wine every year. The Ch√¢teau has 44 hectares in Pauillac, but also two hectares in the Haut-M√©doc area. Wines from P√©desclaux are composed of roughly 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 48% Merlot, 3% Petit Verdot and 2% Cabernet franc.Peppercorn, Wines of Bordeaux, p78 The estate produces three wines: the first wine, Ch√¢teau P√©desclaux, the second wine, Fleur de P√©desclaux and finally a third wine, Le Haut-M√©doc de P√©desclaux, sold under the Haut-M√©doc appellation.Chateau Website, Wines See also *Bordeaux wine *French wine  References  * Coates, Clive (2004).

Convertibility is an important factor in international trade, where instruments valued in different currencies must be exchanged. Currency trading Freely convertible currencies have immediate value on the foreign exchange market, and few restrictions on the manner and amount that can be traded for another currency. Free convertibility is a major feature of a hard currency. Some countries pass laws restricting the legal exchange rates of their currencies or requiring permits to exchange more than a certain amount. Some currencies, such as the North Korean won, the Transnistrian ruble, and the Cuban national peso, are officially nonconvertible and can only be exchanged on the black market. If an official exchange rate is set, its value on the black market is often lower. Convertibility controls may be introduced as part of an overall monetary policy. For example, restrictions on the Argentine peso were introduced during an economic crisis in the 1990s and scrapped in 2002 during a subsequent crisis. Commodity money Convertibility first became an issue of significance during the time banknotes began to replace commodity money in the money supply. Under the gold and silver standards, notes were redeemable for coin at face value, though often failing banks and governments would overextend their reserves. Historically, the banknote has followed a common or very similar pattern in the western nations. Originally decentralized and issued from various independent banks, it was gradually brought under state control and became a monopoly privilege of the central banks. In the process, the principle that the banknote was merely a substitute for the real commodity money (gold and silver) was gradually abandoned. Under the gold exchange standard, for example the Bretton Woods Institutions, banks of issue were obliged to redeem their currencies in gold bullion, or in United States dollars, which in turn were redeemable in gold bullion at an official rate of $35 per troy ounce. Due to limited growth in the supply of gold reserves, during a time of great inflation of the dollar supply, the United States eventually abandoned the gold exchange standard and thus bullion convertibility in 1974. Under the contemporary international currency regimes, all currencies' inherent value derives from fiat, thus there is no longer any thing (gold or other tangible store of value) for which paper notes can be redeemed.

History  The band originally formed in the late 1980s as A Band Called Bud, with vocalist/guitarist Scott Taylor, bassist Tripp Lamkins, and vocalist/drummer Dave Shouse who founded the band and became its leader. After being renamed Grifters (after the novel by Jim Thompson) by 1990, Shouse joined Taylor on guitar, with Stanley Gallimore taking over on the drums. Songwriting duties were shared between Shouse, Taylor and Lamkins. For several years in the 1990s they recorded primarily at Easley McCain Recording and were closely affiliated with Memphis's Shangri-La Records label. Jeff Buckley was a vocal supporter of The Grifters and was close friends with the band. The band released its last record, Full Blown Possession, before disbanding with members pursuing other projects.

In a given election, postal votes may be available on demand or limited to individuals meeting certain criteria, such as a proven inability to travel to a designated polling place. Most electors are required to apply for a postal vote, although some may receive one by default. In some elections postal voting is the only voting method allowed and is referred to as all-postal voting. With the exception of those elections, postal votes constitute a form of early voting and may be considered an absentee ballot. Typically postal votes must be mailed back before the scheduled election day. However, in some jurisdictions return methods may allow for dropping off the ballot in person via secure drop boxes or at voting centers. Postal votes may be processed by hand or scanned and counted electronically. The history of postal voting dates back to the 19th century, and modern-day procedures and availability vary by jurisdiction. Research, focused on the United States and using data from states where postal voting is widely available‚ÄîCalifornia, Oregon and Washington‚Äîshows that the availability of postal voting tends to increase voter turnout. Electoral laws typically stipulate a series of checks to protect against voter fraud and allow for the integrity and secrecy of the submitted ballot to be maintained. Known instances of fraud are very rare. Coordinated, large-scale fraud by postal voting is likely hard to pull off undetected because the large number of interested parties (such as officials, political operators, and journalists) as well as a large number of scholars and analysts who are capable of detecting statistical outliers in vote totals signifying large-scale fraud. Officials can confirm instances of fraud by checking signatures and conducting basic detective work. All-postal voting All-postal voting is the form of postal voting where all electors receive their ballot papers through the post, not just those who requested an absentee ballot. Depending on the system applied, electors may have to return their ballot papers by post, or there may be an opportunity to deliver them by hand to a specified location. There is some evidence that this method of voting leads to higher turnout than one where people vote in person or have to apply for a postal vote. Critics suggest that this is only a temporary impact, and that there are dangers in people using ballot papers intended for other electors. It has been tested by a large number of local authorities in the United Kingdom for their elections, and in 2004 it was used for elections to the European Parliament and local authorities in four of the English regions (see below for more details). In 2016, the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey was conducted via all-postal voting with a turnout of 79.5 percent. Experience of postal voting and all- postal voting by country =Australia= At the 2016 Australian federal election, there were 1.2 million postal votes cast, amounting to 8.5 percent of total votes. Postal voting in Australia was introduced for federal elections in 1902, and first used at the 1903 election. It was abolished by the Fisher Government in 1910, following claims that it was open to abuse and biased towards rural voters. The Cook Government's bill to restore postal voting was one of the \\"triggers\\" for the double dissolution prior to the 1914 election. Postal voting was eventually restored by the Hughes Government in 1918 and has not been challenged since, although the provisions and requirements have been amended on a number of occasions. Prior to Federation in 1901, Western Australia introduced a form of postal voting in 1877 with strict eligibility criteria. South Australia introduced postal voting for seamen in 1890, and a further act in 1896 gave postal votes to any elector who would be more than from home on election day, as well as for any woman unable to travel \\"by reason of her health\\". Victoria passed a similar law in 1899, and the first federal postal voting legislation was also modelled on the 1896 South Australian act. Procedure Postal voting at a federal level is governed by the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and administered by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). Postal votes are available to those who will be absent from their electoral division through travel, or who those are unable to attend a polling booth due to illness, infirmity, \\"approaching childbirth\\", caring responsibilities, reasonable fears for their safety, religious beliefs, imprisonment, status as a silent elector, or employment reasons.Schedule 2‚ÄîGrounds of application for postal or pre‚Äëpoll vote: Eligible voters may make a postal vote application (PVA) prior to each election, or apply for status as a \\"general postal voter\\" and receive a postal ballot automatically. Postal voters receive their ballot(s) and a prepaid envelope containing their name and address, as well as a predetermined security question from the PVA. Voters are required to sign the envelope and provide the correct answer to the security question. They are also required to have a witness sign and date the envelope. As of 2016, postal votes were able to be received and entered into the count up to 13 days after election day. Following the 2016 election, it was observed that the strict scrutiny process afforded to postal votes was a \\"significant contributor\\" to delays in declaring the results of close elections. =Austria= Austria enabled postal voting in 2007 by amending Article 26 of the Constitution of Austria. Electors request an electoral card that can be completed in person or in private and sent via post. In the 2017 election, roughly 780,000 postal ballots were cast representing 15% of all ballots. =Canada= The ability to vote when in- person voting is not possible was first introduced with the Military Voters Act in 1917, giving the right to vote to all Canadian soldiers. Public servants became eligible in 1970. The right was further extended to civilian support personnel on Canadian Forces bases in the 1977. In 1993, Bill C-114 extended the special ballot vote (Special Voting Rules) by mail to all Canadian citizens. Use of special voting rules including vote by mail has grown with each election. In the 42nd general election (2015), the number of voters increased by 117 percent over the previous election to roughly 619,000. This number grew to roughly 660,000 in the 43rd election (2019) representing 3.6 percent of electors. =Finland= Finland introduced vote by post in 2019 for eligible voters living permanently abroad and eligible voters staying abroad at the time of the elections. =France= In the March 2020 municipal elections, France allowed voting by \\"procuration\\" ‚Äì the equivalent of absentee voting ‚Äì for individuals who were sick, isolated or at risk due to the coronavirus pandemic. =Germany= Absentee voting has existed in Germany since 1957, originally in order to ensure that all German citizens, especially the old, sick, and disabled, and citizens living abroad, have the opportunity to participate in elections. At first, postal voters had to state why they could not cast their vote in person on Election Day; but this requirement has been dropped in 2008, allowing everyone to use postal voting. Like in many other countries, in more recent years, voting by mail has become increasingly popular among younger and non-disabled citizens residing within the country; as such, various tools are being developed to help citizens, both domestic and abroad, more easily apply for postal voting. =Hungary= Hungarian citizens living abroad who do not have an official address in Hungary are allowed to vote by mail. They are only allowed to vote for party lists, but not for local representatives. In the last parliamentary election in 2018, 267,233 votes (4.6% of all votes) were submitted via mail. 48% of all valid postal votes were submitted from Romania. =India= Postal voting in India is done only through the Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot Papers (ETPB) system of Election Commission of India, where ballot papers are distributed to the registered eligible voters and they return the votes by post. When the counting of votes commences, these postal votes are counted first before the counting of votes from the electronic voting machines of all other voters. Only certain categories of people are eligible to register as postal voters. People working in the union armed forces and state police as well as their wives, and employees working for the Government of India who are officially posted abroad can register for the postal vote, these are also called service voters. Additionally, people in preventive detention, disabled and those above the age of 65 years old can use postal vote. Prisoners can not vote at all.Maharashtra, Haryana Elections 2019: Can You Vote By Postal Ballot If You Aren't Living At Home?, Huffington Post, 26 September 2019. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has alleged that postal ballots \\"will adversely effect the verifiability of a large number of voters, thus, transparency and integrity of the process\\", and expressed concerns with \\"instances of manipulation and malpractice\\" with postal ballots. =Indonesia= Postal voting documents sent to an Indonesian voter in the United Kingdom during the 2019 Indonesian general election. Eligible Indonesians living abroad are able to vote by mail in national elections by registering at the Indonesian overseas election commission in their country of residence. Beside presidential elections, they are also able to vote in DPR elections. All overseas Indonesian voters are included in the Jakarta 2nd constituency, which also contains Central and South Jakarta. =Italy= Electoral package sent to an Italian voter in South America during the 2013 Italian general election. Since 2001 Italian citizens living abroad have the right to vote by mail in all referendums and national elections being held in Italy (provided they had registered their residence abroad with their relevant consulate). =Malaysia= In Malaysia, opposition leader and former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim alleged that postal votes have been used by the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition in securing seats in certain constituencies. He also said that in one particular constituency (Setiawangsa), he claimed that his Parti Keadilan Rakyat had actually won during the 2008 elections, before 14,000 postal votes came in awarding the incumbent BN parliamentarian the seat with a majority of 8,000 votes. In Malaysia, only teachers, military personnel, and policemen based away from their constituencies are eligible to submit postal votes. =Mexico= Postal ballot paper for Mexico federal election 2012 In Mexico, since the 2006 federal elections, postal voting for people living abroad has been permitted. A request can be made to the National Electoral Institute which then sends the ballots outside the country. =Philippines= Mail-in ballots are an option for Overseas Filipinos in select countries only. The general practise for local and overseas absentee voting in Philippine elections requires that ballots be cast in person at select polling places, such as a consulate office. =Spain= In Spain, for European, regional and municipal elections, voters who will be absent from their town on election day or are ill or disabled, may request a postal vote at a post office. The application must be submitted personally or through a representative in case of illness or disability certified by a medical certificate. =Switzerland= Swiss federal law allows postal voting in all federal elections and referenda, and all cantons also allow it for cantonal ballot issues. All voters receive their personal ballot by mail and may either cast it at a polling station or mail it back. As of 2019, approximately 90% of Swiss voters cast ballots using Remote Postal Voting. =United Kingdom= Absentee voting in the United Kingdom is allowed by proxy or post (known as postal voting on demand) for any elector. Postal voting does not require a reason, apart from in Northern Ireland, where postal voting is available only if it would be unreasonable to expect a voter to go to a polling station on polling day as a result of employment, disability or education restrictions. Proxy voting is allowed for people who will be away, working, or medically disabled. Anyone eligible to vote in the election may be a proxy for close relatives and two unrelated people. Postal voting has been subject to fraud, undue influence, theft and tampering, but no data has been cited which indicates this occurs at a level equal to or above any other form of voting. \\"[T]hese concerns need to be balanced by the fact that it is entirely legitimate for political parties to encourage electors to vote, be it in person or by post\\". =United States= California Governor Gavin Newsom speaks about the decision to sign an executive order requiring mail in voting in the 2020 November election. In the United States postal votings is commonly referred to as mail-in voting, vote- by-mail or vote from home with a ballot being mailed to the home of a registered voter, who fills it out and returns it via postal mail or drops off the ballot in-person into a secure drop box or at a voting center. The deadlines are set under state law. Vote-by-mail is available in both Republican and Democratic states, with research showing that the availability of postal voting increases voter turnout. It has been argued that postal voting has a greater risk of fraud than in-person voting though there are relatively few known instances of such fraud. Processing large numbers of ballots and signature verifications accurately has numerous challenges other than fraud. In the 2016 US Presidential election, approximately 33 million postal ballots were cast, about a quarter of all ballots cast. Some jurisdictions used only vote-by-mail and others used absentee voting by mail. In April 2020, during lockdowns for the coronavirus pandemic, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 58% of American voters would favor nationwide election reform to allow everyone to vote by mail. For the upcoming November 2020 presidential election, postal voting is expected to be the preferred voting method in many locations due to the coronavirus pandemic. Despite the long history of postal voting and a large number of postal votes in the 2016 election, President Donald Trump has cast doubt of the integrity of unsolicited mail-in voting for the 2020 election. There is little evidence to support Trump's claim that postal voting enables widespread election fraud.

During his tenure, Ervin issued a number of reports critical of mismanagement and security flaws at the newly formed Department. In December 2004, his recess appointment expired, and the White House declined to nominate him for confirmation by the United States Senate. The end of his term was controversial. Critics viewed the lack of White House support as retribution for Ervin's aggressive efforts to root out waste, fraud, and incompetence.

The group rehearsed new wave of British heavy metal covers and original material for a period of months in 1981. History Leather Charm was formed in June 1981 following the demise of Phantom Lord, a garage band featuring James Hetfield and guitarist Hugh Tanner. At the time, Hetfield was living with an older brother in Brea and attending Brea Olinda High School after the unforeseen death of his mother. In the new band, Hetfield and Tanner were joined by Hetfield's childhood friend and roommate Ron McGovney, and later drummer Jim Mulligan. While Hetfield had played guitar in Phantom Lord, he acted solely as lead vocalist in Leather Charm. Tanner was replaced several months later by guitarist Troy James. The group was influenced by the New Wave of British Heavy Metal and practiced covers of songs by such bands of the period, including Diamond Head and Sweet Savage. They were also influenced by Iron Maiden, and covered the song \\"Remember Tomorrow.\\" When Mulligan left the group in late 1981, Leather Charm disbanded and Hetfield began working with drummer Lars Ulrich on a new band, Metallica. Early the next year, McGovney and guitarist Dave Mustaine completed Metallica's first gigging lineup. The Leather Charm song \\"Hit the Lights\\" was integrated into the band's set among the first original compositions in the band's repertoire, and eventually became the opening track on their debut LP, Kill 'Em All.

They convey an impression of power - an old movie and TV clich√© starts with the outside view of a skyscraper with a voice-over conversation, continuing inside the luxurious office of a tycoon or crime boss. Skyscrapers' tight security and isolation from the rest of the city makes them ideal for dramatic crisis and trap situations including hostage- taking, heists and fire. Skyscrapers and other large landmarks also feature prominently in disaster films, where they are destroyed as a show of the power of nature or invaders. Real skyscrapers This is a list of actual skyscrapers that have a noticeable role as themselves in films, sorted by chronological building order. (See also: list of skyscrapers.) = Empire State Building (New York City 1931) = * Famously climbed by the giant ape King Kong in the eponymous movie (1933) and in its remake (2005). * Destroyed by an alien ship in Independence Day (1996). * The Empire State Building is also seen in James and the Giant Peach. * The Empire State Building's observation deck features prominently in Sleepless in Seattle. * Stars in the movie Empire (1964 film), where it is seen in a continuous eight-hour-five- minute shot of the building at night. = Etihad Towers (Abu Dhabi 2011) = * Portrayed in Furious 7, many action scenes are filmed here. = World Trade Center (New York City 1973) = * Used prominently in the 1973 film version of Godspell during the song \\"All For the Best.\\" * Climbed by King Kong in the 1976 remake of King Kong. * Exploded and collapsed after being hit by a fragment of the Meteor (1979). * Used as a makeshift runway by Snake Plissken in Escape from New York (1981). * Features in the opening and closing sequences of Oliver & Company (1988). * In the film Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992) Kevin McCallister stops at the building while sightseeing. * The towers are also seen in various scenes of the smash hit movie Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995) * Severely damaged by meteor shower in Armageddon (1998) and severely damaged by an ocean wave (from comet impact) in Deep Impact. * Leaped onto from a failing helicopter in Read or Die (May 2001). * The roof of the World Trade Center was also the original scene of the final climax in the film Men in Black II (2002), but after the September 11, 2001 attacks, the producers chose to reshoot the scene with an \\"ordinary\\" roof in New York City. * In Steven Spielberg's movie Munich (2005), there is a scene in the last minutes of the film where two men are walking with the New York City skyline in the background. Because the scene takes place before the World Trade Center fell, a digital version of the World Trade Center was added to the New York skyline. * In the 2006 film World Trade Center, the World Trade Center is seen, but is animated (or created with pictures from the time before 9/11). * The building was the setting of 2008's Academy Award-winning documentary, Man on Wire, about tightrope walker Philippe Petit's daring 1974 walk between the towers as well as in Robert Zemeckis' 2015 American 3D biographical drama film The Walk. * At the end of Gangs of New York (2002), the towers are visible in the background of the scene showing time passing from the 19th century to the present. * The towers play a significant role in the 2010 film Remember Me. = Chrysler Building (New York City 1930) = *Lair of the winged serpent Quetzalcoatl in Q (1982). *Prominently featured in The Caveman's Valentine. *Accidentally destroyed by U.S. military forces in Godzilla (1998). *Destroyed by a meteorite in Armageddon (1998). *Flown through by the Silver Surfer in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007). = MetLife Building (New York City 1963) = *Featured in its original guise as the Pan Am Building in the opening scenes of Only When I Larf (1968), and the helipad is also used in the characters' escape. *Destroyed first by Godzilla when it walked through the building leaving a massive gap in it in the film Godzilla (1998). *It was later destroyed in Knowing (2009) when a solar flare annihilates the Earth. = Capitol Records Building (Los Angeles 1956) = *A distinctive Hollywood landmark, frequently destroyed in blockbuster films including Earthquake, Independence Day, and The Day After Tomorrow. *In the film Hancock, the title character pierces the building's pinnacle with a car in the opening scene. = Sunset Vine Tower (Los Angeles 1966) = *Damaged by fire in 2001, the tower was recently remodeled and converted into condominiums. *The Sunset Vine Tower was prominently featured in 1974's Earthquake, earning it the affectionate moniker of \\"The Earthquake Tower\\".

Fictional skyscrapers This is a list of named fictional skyscrapers that have a noticeable role in films (including notable science-fiction and fantasy), sorted by chronological filming order. In some cases, an actual building stands for the fictional one; in others, they are created using elaborate miniature models. = New Tower of Babel (Metropolis) = *Chief among the gothic skyscrapers of Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927).

The building's name was a combination of \\"The Glass House\\" from The Glass Inferno and \\"The World Tower\\" from The Tower. = Tyrell Corporation Headquarters (Los Angeles) = *The immense truncated pyramid-shaped structure, flanked by inwardly-slanted towers, dominates the cityscape of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982). *The futuristic city has been described as a place where the height of the World Trade Center had become the norm, filled with buildings hundreds of stories tall, with Tyrell's pyramid being six or seven times the height of the WTC and at least a hundred times more massive . *Main protagonist Deckard himself lives on the 97th floor of a generic building. = Nakatomi Plaza (Los Angeles) = *A 31-floor building taken over by terrorists in the classic action film Die Hard (1988). *The building is actually the 34-story Fox Plaza, 20th Century Fox's Los Angeles headquarters. *The Japanese name of this and other fictional buildings (such as Nakamoto Tower in 1993's Rising Sun) provides an interesting window on the 1980s mindset that Japanese corporations would take over the world's economy and real estate, especially after the real-life acquisition of Rockefeller Center by a Mitsubishi subsidiary (completed in 1989). *In fact, there have been relatively few such takeovers, and few if any U.S. skyscrapers were ever actually named after Japanese corporations. = Art Land's Galaxy Hotel (Las Vegas) = *A fictional futuristic hotel/casino in Las Vegas, Nevada from the 1996 film Mars Attacks! *The hotel was destroyed by a UFO during a martian invasion. *In reality the building was the Landmark Hotel and Casino which was imploded in 1995. = Galactic Senate Building 500 Republica (Coruscant) = *One of the innumerable towers covering the fictional city-planet of Coruscant from the Star Wars universe, first seen on film in the Special Edition of Return of the Jedi (1997), then in the Star Wars prequels. *On Coruscant, buildings are used as the foundations for new buildings that actually pierce the cloud layer. *The fifty lower levels form a dangerous underworld where ordinary citizens never go. *The city-planet was inspired by Trantor in Isaac Asimov's Foundation saga. = Scolex Industries = *The corporate headquarters of the main villain Sanford Scolex (Doctor Claw) in the 1999 film Inspector Gadget. In reality, the building is the PPG Place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. = MNU Building (Johannesburg) = *A building used in the 2009 film District 9. = Fiddler's Green = *In Land of the Dead, is by far the most notable landmark in the \\"City of the Living\\" and serves as a metaphor for the disconnection between wealthy and poor classes in society. = Clamp Centre = *The setting of Gremlins 2: The New Batch. Exterior shots of the building are actually 101 Park Avenue in New York City. = The Zitex Building = *The titular tower of the 1996 film Skyscraper. = Stark Tower = *In The Avengers. Prior to the events of the film, Tony Stark purchased the Metlife Building and deconstructed the upper two-thirds of the skyscraper. *By the events of the film, construction of a new structure (built on top of the bottom third of the building) is nearly complete. *During the Battle of New York, the building sustains minor damage. *The skyscraper is subsequently repurposed as Avengers Tower, and appears in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Doctor Strange. = OCP Tower = *In RoboCop. The building was portrayed by the Dallas City Hall with the building's upper floors added in via special effects as the actual city hall building is only 7 stories tall. = Tower Sky = *A fictional 448m, 108-story high twin tower complex in Seoul, South Korea, in the 2012 disaster film The Tower. *As stated in the film, Tower A was called Riverview, and Tower B was called Cityview. *With over 5700 residents, it was South Korea's biggest residential complex. *In the film, the owner of the complex decided to hold a Christmas party and had 10 helicopters circling above the building, despite the warnings of the owner's employees. *On the Christmas Eve, one of the helicopters crashed into Tower A. The crash also damaged the structure of the bridge connecting the twin tower, making the characters unable to escape to Tower B. = The Pearl (Hong Kong) = *A 3,500 feet tall skyscraper from the 2018 movie Skyscraper. *It was ignited and set ablaze by terrorists led by a man named Kores Botha. The fire quickly spreads towards the top of the 3,500 ft. building but the fire was quickly extinguished after Sarah rebooted the entire system of The Pearl via Will's stolen tablet. = Beika City Building = *From the 1997 Japanese animated movie Detective Conan: The Time Bombed Skyscraper or Case Closed: The Time Bombed Skyscraper.

This narrowing of the renal artery can impede blood flow to the target kidney, resulting in renovascular hypertension ‚Äì a secondary type of high blood pressure. Possible complications of renal artery stenosis are chronic kidney disease and coronary artery disease. Signs and symptoms Most cases of renal artery stenosis are asymptomatic, and the main problem is high blood pressure that cannot be controlled with medication. Decreased kidney function may develop if both kidneys do not receive adequate blood flow, furthermore some people with renal artery stenosis present with episodes of flash pulmonary edema. Cause Renal artery stenosis is most often caused by atherosclerosis which causes the renal arteries to harden and narrow due to the build-up of plaque. This is known as atherosclerotic renovascular disease.This accounts for about 90% of cases with most of the rest due to fibromuscular dysplasia. Fibromuscular dysplasia is the predominant cause in young patients, usually females under 40 years of age. Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of renal artery stenosis leads to changes in the structure of the kidney that are most noticeable in the tubular tissue. If the stenosis is longstanding and severe, the glomerular filtration rate in the affected kidneys never recovers and (prerenal) kidney failure is the result. Changes include: * Fibrosis * Tubular cell size (decrease) * Thickening of Bowman capsule * Tubulosclerosis * Glomerular capillary tuft (atrophy) Diagnosis alt= The diagnosis of renal artery stenosis can use many techniques to determine if the condition is present, a clinical prediction rule is available to guide diagnosis. Among the diagnostic techniques are: * Doppler ultrasound study of the kidneys * Refractory hypertension * Auscultation (with stethoscope) - bruit (\\"rushing\\" sound) * Captopril challenge test * Captopril test dose effect on the differential renal function as measured by MAG3 scan. * Renal artery arteriogram. The specific criteria for renal artery stenosis on Doppler are an acceleration time of greater than 70 milliseconds, an acceleration index of less than 300 cm/sec¬≤ and a velocity ratio of the renal artery to aorta of greater than 3.5. Treatment A diuretic (Hydrochlorothiazide) =Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis= It is initially treated with medications, including diuretics, and medications for blood pressure control. When high-grade renal artery stenosis is documented and blood pressure cannot be controlled with medication, or if renal function deteriorates, surgery may be resorted to. The most commonly used procedure is a minimally-invasive angioplasty with or without stenting. It is unclear if this approach yields better results than the use of medications alone. It is a relatively safe procedure. If all else fails and the kidney is thought to be worsening hypertension and revascularization with angioplasty or surgery does not work, then surgical removal of the affected kidney (nephrectomy) may significantly improve high blood pressure. =Fibromuscular dysplasia= Angioplasty with or without stenting is the best option for the treatment of renal artery stenosis due to fibromuscular dysplasia.

Reflecto was mentioned as having been \\"killed in a duel with the Molecule Master.\\" Fictional character biography In the early 1970s, Dave Cockrum planned a Legion spin- off series called the Outsiders, which would have, among other characters, included Nightcrawler (who was later introduced in the Marvel Comics team the X-Men) and Reflecto, in his first appearance as a living character. This series, however, was not produced. Reflecto was first introduced as a character in Legion of Super-Heroes #277‚Äì280 (July 1981). His initial appearance suggested that he was Ultra Boy with amnesia, but he was soon revealed to be Superboy, (whose body was being possessed by the consciousness of the apparently dead Ultra Boy), who was suffering from a form of amnesia brought on by his inadvertent disobedience to a post-hypnotic command implanted in his mind by Saturn Girl. The post-hypnotic command forbade Superboy to ever return to the 30th century; it was given to prevent Superboy from altering history after learning the time and cause of the deaths of his adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent. After unknowingly arriving in the 30th century, Superboy found himself on a world with very high gravity. His superpowers were somewhat diminished, and he could not immediately leave the planet. He encountered a very powerful beast which attacked him repeatedly until Superboy discovered that it was attracted to the colors of his hair and uniform as everything on the planet was reddish-orange. To end the attacks, Superboy used his heat vision to fuse the planet's reddish sand to his hair and uniform, thereby changing their color. After some time, he was able to leave the planet, but he did not know where he was. He was also unaware that he had traveled through time. Upon discovering that he was in the 30th century, the conflict with the post-hypnotic command caused a form of extreme denial/amnesia. This, combined with his now unrecognizable appearance led to the formation of the Reflecto identity. In his mind, if he was not \\"Superboy\\", then he was not violating the post-hypnotic command. Reflecto was revealed to be Superboy when he threw himself in front of an energy discharge intended to kill Phantom Girl. The intense energy vaporized the fused sand from the indestructible Kryptonian fabric and revealed the \\"S\\"-symbol on his uniform. Saturn Girl then removed the command and restored his mind. Superboy returned to his own time and agreed not to return to the 30th century. The statue of the \\"dead\\" Ultra Boy in the Legion's hall of dead Legionnaires was changed into one of Reflecto, fulfilling the description seen on the statue in the \\"Adult Legion\\" story. In Legion of Super-Heroes (4th series) Annual #1, which happened after continuity changes erased Superboy from history, Reflecto was shown as an actual person in a one-panel flashback. The 2995 Legion of Superheroes Sourcebook, written by the writers of the Legion series but not considered canon by DC Comics, explained that this Reflecto was killed by the Molecule Master as mentioned on the statue featured in the \\"Adult Legion\\" story. A character appeared briefly in the March 2006 issue of Legion of Super-Heroes (5th series, #14) as a crazed fan overcome by the death of Dream Girl. Believing that he and Dream Girl were meant to be together, he lashed out at the Legion by reflecting their powers against them. He was subdued by Triplicate Girl as there was nothing to reflect against an \\"ordinary\\" girl. Shortly afterwards he was referred to as \\"Reflecto\\" by Shadow Lass.

His assassination in July 1936 by the bodyguard of Socialist party leader Indalecio Prieto was an immediate prelude to the triggering of the military coup plotted since February 1936, the partial failure of which marked the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. Biography = Early years = Calvo Sotelo was born on 6 May 1893 in Tui, Galicia to Pedro Calvo y Camina, a judge, and Elisa Sotelo Lafuente. He received a degree in Law and moved to the capital, Madrid. In 1913 he joined a maurist circle in the Ateneo where he socialised with other members of the Maurist Youth such as Melchor Fern√°ndez Almagro, P√≠o Zabala, Antonio Ballesteros Beretta, P√≠o Ballesteros √Ålava, Quintiliano Salda√±a, Manuel Palacios Olmedo, Rogerio S√°nchez and Fernando Su√°rez de Tangil. He became Secretary of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences of the Ateneo Mercantil de Madrid and a professor at the Universidad Central. He was a member of Antonio Maura's Conservative Party. In his first post he was an administrative officer in the Ministry of Grace and Justice. Calvo Sotelo dressed in the uniform of the Cuerpo de Abogados del Estado. In the 1919 election to the Congress of Deputies, despite Maura having in mind the plan of not putting forward a Maurista in the district of Carballino in exchange for a seat in another district, the 25 year-old Calvo Sotelo put himself forward as a candidate. Challenging mainstream conservative candidate Leopoldo Garc√≠a Dur√°n, a follower of Gabino Bugallal (Count of Bugallal), Calvo Sotelo won the seat in the election. In 1922, he was made Civil Governor of Valencia. = Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera = Following the 1923 coup d'√©tat by Miguel Primo de Rivera, Calvo Sotelo lent support to the dictatorship. Appointed Director General of Local Administration in 1923, he was the creator of the 1924 Municipal Statute that, inspired by previous projects of Antonio Maura, sought to reform the structure of the State at a local level and was cemented by the free election of mayors and the councillors. He also promulgated a Provincial Statute in 1925. Neither statute got to be enforced. Primo de Rivera then appointed Calvo Sotelo as finance minister of the Civil Directory of the dictatorship in 1925, and he served from December 1925 until January 1930. During his tenure as Minister of Finance, his programme to achieve economic growth featured protectionist, nationalist and interventionist policies. = Second Republic = Calvo Sotelo giving a speech in the Urumea Fronton of San Sebasti√°n (1935). After the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic on 14 April 1931, Calvo Sotelo, because of his prior collaboration with the dictatorship and his fear of being subject to trial, went into exile to Portugal and later France along with other politicians. He was welcomed the day after his arrival in Lisbon by Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar, then minister of Finance. Calvo Sotelo spent his time in Portugal studying the Ditadura Nacional regime. After being given a passport by the Portuguese authorities, he lived between February 1932 and May 1934 in Paris, where he became connected with the ideas of Charles Maurras. He also befriended L√©on Daudet, Jacques Bainville and Charles Benoist in France. Despite his exile he had been elected as member of the parliament for the district of Orense both in the 1931 and 1933 elections. After the passing of an amnesty law on 20 April 1934, he returned to Spain with the intention of leaving an imprint on the Alfonsine right, then represented by Renovaci√≥n Espa√±ola and led by Antonio Goicoechea. After his return, he had also tried to join the Fascist Falange Espa√±ola de las JONS, but, albeit endorsed by Ruiz de Alda and Ledesma, his application was vetoed by Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera, who understood his leadership was being challenged and deemed the Galician politician as \\"reactionary\\". By the 9 May Calvo Sotelo was in the Cortes. He stated that the \\"Restoration\\" of the prior liberal monarchy was not intended, but the \\"instauration\\" of an anti-liberal one. Sotelo had more personal charisma than Goicoechea and eventually eclipsed him. He became the leading figure of the Bloque Nacional ('National Block'), a newly created electoral project that sought to unite the anti-republican right. The foundational manifesto espoused a return to traditional values, through the means of an authoritarian monarchy and the role of the Armed Forces as counter- revolutionary agent. Neither the leader of the CEDA (Jos√© Mar√≠a Gil-Robles) nor the leader of the Falange Espa√±ola de las JONS (Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera) endorsed the initiative, which, aside from members of Renovaci√≥n Espa√±ola, drew most of its support from the ranks of the traditionalist carlists; it was also supported by the small group headed by the Doctor Albi√±ana, leader of the Spanish Nationalist Party. After the victory of the leftist Popular Front in the February 1936 election, Jos√© Calvo Sotelo became the leading speaker of the anti-republican forces in the Parliament, preparing the mood of anti-republican supporters for a coup d'√©tat. Sotelo was aware that there was a planned rebellion within the army and while he would welcome such a development, believing only an authoritarian regime would solve Spain's problems, he was not part of the conspiracy and was not sure when the planned rebellion would happen or if it even would, thus he continued his normal political and personal life.Payne, Stanley G. The collapse of the Spanish republic, 1933-1936: Origins of the civil war. Yale University Press, 2008, p.322 = Assassination = After the Guardia de Asalto leader Jos√© Castillo was killed by falangists at 10pm on 12 July, a group of Guardia de Asalto and other leftist militiamen led by Civil Guard Fernando Cond√©s went to Calvo Sotelo's house in a government's car in the early hours of 13 July on a revenge mission. While they also planned to kidnap Gil Robles as well, he was not in Madrid at the time.Payne, Stanley G. The collapse of the Spanish republic, 1933-1936: Origins of the civil war. Yale University Press, 2008, p.321 Sotelo was arrested and later shot dead in a police truck. His body was dumped at the entrance of one of the city's cemeteries. According to all later investigations, the perpetrator of the murder was a socialist gunman, Luis Cuenca, who was known as the bodyguard of PSOE leader Indalecio Prieto. Both Cond√©s and Cuenca would later die in the first few days of the civil war.Payne, Stanley G. The collapse of the Spanish republic, 1933-1936: Origins of the civil war. Yale University Press, 2008, p.325 Though the government denounced the murder and promised to investigate, it made no effort at conciliation. Censorship was immediately imposed to conceal the truth, nothing was done to apprehend those directly responsible and instead numerous Falangists and rightists were arrested (this was not unusual behaviour when members of the political right were murdered by Popular Front members). A judge, Ursicino G√≥mez Carbajo, did take up the case independently within hours but the case was abruptly taken off his hands by the Assault Guard, seemingly because he was an independent and honest judge.Payne, Stanley G. The collapse of the Spanish republic, 1933-1936: Origins of the civil war. Yale University Press, 2008, pp.324-325 The first political response was from the Communist Party, who decided the assassination represented a time to forward one of their legislative drafts to other Popular Front groups, which essentially called for the banning of numerous right-wing parties, including CEDA, Renovaci√≥n Espa√±ola and Falange, the confiscation of their property and the confiscation of several newspapers. While its presentation before parliament was impossible due parliament's postponement, its provisions would be carried out during the civil war in the Republican zone and the Popular Front government seemed to act in its spirit, announcing the decision to close down the centers of both Renovaci√≥n Espa√±ola and the CNT in Madrid, despite neither of these groups having anything to do with the killing.Payne, Stanley G. The collapse of the Spanish republic, 1933-1936: Origins of the civil war. Yale University Press, 2008, p.324-325 Sotelo was buried in a public funeral attended by thousands of rightists, many of whom gave the fascist salute, which infuriated the police. Several hundred rightists then marched to the city centre in a political demonstration. They were stopped by a police barricade and had to show they were unarmed before they were allowed to pass. As the unarmed protesters approached the centre, they were fired upon by the Assault Guard and police units, with a few protesters being killed. Three Assault Guards who protested this were temporarily arrested, while some police from Castillo's barracks felt their units honour had been stained by the assassination and demanded an investigation. Two Assault Guard units were seemingly on the verge of mutiny.Payne, Stanley G. The collapse of the Spanish republic, 1933-1936: Origins of the civil war. Yale University Press, 2008, p.326 The final session of the Cortes before the war on 15 July was dominated by the assassination. Monarchists and rightists accused the government of creating the atmosphere in which Sotelo's killing was made possible. Gil Robles presented a list of deaths and disorders of the past month. He said that every day he read calls in leftist newspapers for the right to be subject to \\"extermination\\" and warned that \\"the day will come when the violence you have unleashed will be turned against you.\\"Payne, Stanley G. The collapse of the Spanish republic, 1933-1936: Origins of the civil war. Yale University Press, 2008, p.326-327 Brian Crozier explains the significance of the killing:Arango, E.R. and Arango, E.R., 2019. The Spanish political system: Franco's legacy.

The cabal of anti-republican conspirators led by General Emilio Mola seized the moment, accelerating the military coup that had been plotted since the February election. According to Antony Beevor, Sotelo's assassination inadvertently caused many more people to support the coup than would otherwise have occurred.Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939. Hachette UK, 2012. In 1960, Franco stated that the revolt would never have developed the strength necessary if not for the assassination.Payne, Stanley G. The collapse of the Spanish republic, 1933-1936: Origins of the civil war. Yale University Press, 2008, p.332-333 The uprising of part of the Army, starting with the Army of Africa in Melilla on 17 July 1936, under the assumed command of Generals Emilio Mola, Francisco Franco, Gonzalo Queipo de Llano and Jos√© Sanjurjo, marked the beginning of the Spanish Civil War.

The field was discovered in 1998 and is located at the Green Canyon blocks 699, 700, 742, 743, and 744 in United States federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico about from the coast of Louisiana. The oil field lies in water depths ranging from . The subsea structure of Atlantis has long been the target of safety critics. Reserves The Atlantis oil field has estimated ultimate reserves of about . The supermajor BP owns a 56% interest in the field in conjunction with BHP Billiton Petroleum Deepwater which owns a 44% interest. History The oil field was discovered in 1998 by the Ocean America semi- submersible, mobile drilling rig operating in a water depth of . The discovery was later confirmed by wells drilled by GSF C.R. Luigs and Glomar Explorer. Production started in October 2007. Production The field is expected to produce about of oil and of gas. The Atlantis field has been developed with a semi-submersible production platform, Atlantis PQ, designed by GVA Consultants and built by Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME), South Korea. In addition to the semi-submersible platform, field development uses a network of wet-tree subsea wells. The subsea elements of the Atlantis field were designed and fabricated by PS Fabricators. It is one of the largest to undergo systems integration testing (SIT) on land, also at PS Fabricators SIT site. This includes positioning the components as they would be positioned subsea, pressure testing, pig testing, etc. The system itself is rigorously tested to ensure its safety subsea. Safety practices =Food and Water Watch lawsuit= On 17 May 2010, consumer group Food & Water Watch, with former BP contractor Kenneth Abbott, filed a complaint in the United States district court, seeking to stop production on the platform Atlantis PQ until safety documents are produced. The suit was dropped by the plaintiff and re-file naming BP plc as a defendant, as required once BP became involved. According to Food and Water Watch, BP failed to supplement its document production with new information regarding Atlantis's suspension the second quarter of 2012, which caused much of the company's $3.7 billion loss in profits that quarter. =US government scrutiny= The Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion has given new impetus to a number of Congressional Representatives to pressure the Minerals Management Service (MMS) to investigate safety practices on BP's Atlantis PQ offshore platform in the Atlantis Oil Field. A whistleblower report to the MMS in March 2009 stated, \\"over 85 percent of the Atlantis Project's Piping and Instrument drawings lacked final engineer-approval,\\" as legally required. The report further stated, \\"the project be immediately shut down until those documents could be accounted for and independently verified.\\" BP and other oil industry groups wrote letters objecting to a proposed MMS rule last year that would have required stricter safety measures. The MMS changed rules in April 2008 to exempt certain projects in the central Gulf region, allowing BP to operate in the Macondo Prospect without filing a blowout plan.

Applying the clipping path results in a hard (aliased) or soft (anti-aliased) edge, depending on the image editor's capabilitiesClipping path By convention, the inside of the path is defined by its direction. Reversing the direction of a path reverses what is considered inside or outside. An inclusive path is one where what is visually \\"inside\\" the path corresponds to what will be preserved; an exclusive path, of opposite direction, contains what is visually \\"outside\\" the path. By convention, a clockwise path that is non-self-intersecting is considered inclusive. A compound path results from the combination of multiple paths (inclusive and exclusive) and the Boolean operations that ultimately determine what the combined path contains. For instance, an inclusive path which contains a smaller exclusive path results in a shape with a \\"hole\\" (defined by the exclusive path). One common use of a clipping path is to cull objects that do not need to be rendered because they are outside the user's viewport or obscured by display elements (such as a HUD). In 3D graphics Clipping planes are used in 3D computer graphics in order to prevent the renderer from calculating surfaces at an extreme distance from the viewer. The plane is perpendicular to the camera, a set distance away (the threshold), and occupies the entire viewport. Used in real-time rendering, clipping planes can help preserve processing for objects within clear sight. The use of clipping planes can result in a detraction from the realism of a scene, as the viewer may notice that everything at the threshold is not rendered correctly or seems to (dis)appear spontaneously. The addition of fog‚Äîa variably transparent region of color or texture just before the clipping plane‚Äîcan help soften the transition between what should be in plain sight and opaque, and what should be beyond notice and fully transparent, and therefore does not need to be rendered.

Addressees of such services are primarily photography and graphic design studios, advertising agencies, web designers, as well as lithographers and printing companies. Clipping path service companies commonly reside in developing countries such as Bangladesh, Philippine, India, Pakistan and Nepal, which can provide their services at comparatively low cost to developed countries, fostering outsourcing of such activities.

After releasing two early EPs to critical acclaim, the group topped the UK Independent Chart with their debut album 69 (1988), with second album \\"i\\" (1989) also a top 10 hit. They also released the surprise dance hit \\"Pump Up the Volume\\" in 1987 as part of the one-off collaboration MARRS. Ayuli is believed to have coined \\"dream pop\\" to describe their sound in the late 1980s, which blended dub, guitar feedback, psychedelia, house, and free jazz. The group broke up in 1994. Though their work fell into relative obscurity in subsequent years, they have been characterised by critics as among the most innovative and underrated groups of their era. In 2012, One Little Indian released Complete Singles Collection, which compiled the group's single and EP releases. A version of the band lead by Tambala reformed in 2015 and is still active, having changed its name to J√ºbl in 2018. History =Origins= Ayuli and Tambala first met as school children in an East London primary school. Ayuli is of Nigerian descent, while Tambala was born to a Malawian father and English mother. Both were involved in formative and culturally diverse music communities as adolescents, with Aylui part of a dub soundsystem and Tambala part of a jazz-funk scene. In 1983, Ayuli became an advertising copywriter, one of few black creatives working in the London ad business. Attending a party in 1986, Tambala was asked how he and Ayuli knew each other; he lied that the two played together in a band, going on to describe their sound as \\"a bit Velvet Underground, a bit Cocteau Twins, a bit Miles Davis, a bit Joni Mitchell\\". A week later, the two were contacted by a label on the strength of Tambala's fabrication. The duo recorded their demo without a drummer, using a guitar and two cassette players. =1986‚Äì1994: Recordings= In 1986, A.R. Kane released their debut single \\"When You're Sad\\" on One Little Indian. The duo were initially grouped with other \\"noise pop\\" acts, and were hailed in the press as \\"the black Jesus and Mary Chain\\", despite claiming to have never heard the work of that band. The next year the group signed to 4AD to release the follow-up 1987 EP Lollita, which was produced by Robin Guthrie of Cocteau Twins and saw the duo melding dub production, guitar feedback, free jazz and studio experimentation. While at 4AD, label chief Ivo Watts-Russell suggested that Ayuli and Tambala team with roster mates Colourbox, champion mixer Chris \\"C.J.\\" Mackintosh, and London DJ Dave Dorrell to record a one-off single. Dubbing the collaboration M/A/R/R/S, the resulting single, \\"Pump Up the Volume\\" was a breakthrough effort heralding sampling's gradual absorption from hip-hop into dance music and ultimately the pop mainstream, reaching number 1 on the UK Singles Chart in September 1987. A.R. Kane followed with their highly anticipated debut album, 69 (1988), which topped the independent charts and received rave critical reviews from the UK music press. Writing for Melody Maker, critic Simon Reynolds described 69 as \\"the outstanding record of '88.\\" A.R Kane's next release was 1989's Love-Sick EP, followed later that year by their second studio album, \\"i\\", in which they engaged more overtly with pop, dance and electronic styles. The duo, dismissive of the wildly disparate attempts by journalists to categorize their unique sound, eventually began referring to their music as \\"dreampop\\"; the term was widely adopted by music critics thereafter. Like its predecessor, \\"i\\" was released to moderate sales figures and topped the independent charts. Also in 1989, Rough Trade released the Pop EP. In the early 1990s, the band went on hiatus. During this time, Ayuli and Tambala founded the label H.ark and released EPs by acts such as Papa Sprain and Butterfly Child. Rough Trade went bankrupt in 1991. In 1992, David Byrne's record label, Luaka Bop, released a 15-song US retrospective of the band's work, titled Americana. Greg Kot of The Chicago Times described the compilation as \\"a chronicle of sonic innovation in which the boundary between melody and noise, pop and the avant-garde, is blurred continually.\\" The duo ended their hiatus thereafter to record a follow-up album, New Clear Child (1994), and then dissolved following its release. =1994‚Äì2014: Post- breakup= Following the dissolution of A.R. Kane, Tambala made ambient- and dub-based music with his sister Maggie under the alias Sufi and released the 1995 album Life's Rising on Caroline Records. Tambala serves as head of new media for Ministry of Sound, and previously worked for Virgin Digital in non- musical roles. He has also recorded as MusicOne. Ayuli was known to be a museum curator in the US. He put out releases under the name Alex!. In 2006, Ayuli contributed vocals to two tracks (\\"Soulsong\\" and \\"Passage\\") on the album Primario by the Static Discos artist Fax, and also appeared on Fax's album Zig Zag. Ayuli appeared in Beautiful Noise, a documentary on the shoegazing music scene of the 1990s A.R. Kane's first two albums were reissued in the US by One Little Indian in 2004, and New Clear Child was reissued by 3rd Stone in 2000. Complete Singles Collection, a compilation of the group's EPs and singles, was released in 2012. =2015-present: Reformation and name change to J√ºbl= In 2015, it was announced by Tambala that a quasi-reformation of A.R. Kane, bringing together new and old collaborators, would be taking place that year under the name #A.R.Kane and without the involvement of Ayuli. In 2018, the revived band (featuring Rudi and Maggie Tambala plus guitarist Andy Taylor) renamed itself J√ºbl as part of a \\"forward-thinking rebrand\\". Rudi commented \\"I wanted to do something for the 30th anniversary _(of 69)_ , to give back to people some of the feeling they have shared with us, and to mark the moment. We discussed remasters, t-shirts, box-sets, re-recording some of the tracks, concerts, re-mixing the entire LP, and so on, but there were ownership and rights issues that became impenetrable barriers, so I just kinda gave up. Then one morning in May I just thought \\"Fuck it, it‚Äôs a month away, just get the fuck out of bed and do something.\\" Over coffee I realised that we could only move forward and be free from the nonsense by renaming the band, hence \\"J√ºbl\\". From that moment on everything just clicked into place. The three of us have been performing as A.R. Kane since 2016, and writing new songs too, so the material was there, we just had to make that final push.\\"'Song Premiere: \\"Thinking About You\\" by J√ºbl', The Big Takeover, 5 June 2018 Following the name change, J√ºbl issued two singles - \\"Thinking Sweet\\" (in June 2018)'Review: J√ºbl ‚Äì Thinking Sweet EP', 27 June 2018 on thinkinglyrically music blog and \\"Quiet Sun Slips Over\\" (in June 2019), both of which would later appear on their first album under the new name, DNA Cowboys, released independently on 1 September 2019.DNA Cowboys  J√ºbl, 1 September 2019 on Bandcamp Legacy and influence Critic Jason Ankeny described A.R. Kane as \\"arguably the most criminally under-recognized band of their era\\" and an important progenitor of such musical developments as shoegazing, trip hop, ambient dub and post-rock. The Guardian has called their work \\"some of the 80s' most extraordinary music\\" and noted their influence on subsequent artists such as My Bloody Valentine. The group have been recognized for breaking stereotypes about the styles accessible to black musicians at a time when most popular black artists were relegated to soul, reggae and hip hop. Critic Simon Reynolds tentatively referred to A.R. Kane as \\"the great lost group of the 80s,\\" while pointing out that the group in fact enjoyed fervent support in certain circles of the press and surrounding music scenes during the period.

After finishing her run on The New Mickey Mouse Club, a then fifteen-year-old Aguilera began recording the album with New Jersey-based producers Roberts Alleca and Michael Brown. The pair gave Aguilera the opportunity to use a recording studio and presented her with demo music with the understanding that they could use the material for their own purpose, but also claiming they would not commercially release the recordings. Musically, the album consisted of dance style tracks as well as ballads, and saw Aguilera performing in Spanish language songs. The record was conceived to showcase Aguilera's vocals in an effort to reach out to record labels, a venture which actually backfired after the recordings were not very well received among critics. Six years after the completion of the album and Aguilera had achieved mainstream success, Brown and Allecca released the record. Just Be Free has sold over 129,000 copies in the United States. Background After news that The New Mickey Mouse Club would be filming its final season, Aguilera sought out a record deal. She spent time in Philadelphia to record demo tracks with various producers, hoping to have an album released by the time she had finished high school. While taping the final season of the show, she began working with New Jersey based producers Roberts Alleca and Michael Brown. The pair eventually built a relationship with Aguilera and her family, offering her studio time. They told her that the demo recordings she would produce would be their property, but also that they would never commercially release the material. She recorded eleven \\"rough and unfinished\\" tracks which then went on to become the Just Be Free studio sessions. =Musical style= The early tapes were conceived as a way of introducing Aguilera to the music industry, described as a \\"foot in the door\\" attempt to build interest in her musical abilities. During the recording sessions, Aguilera experimented with different languages, recording songs such as the title track \\"Just Be Free\\" in Spanish. Although the rightful writers of the content have been disputed, the recording sessions have been described as influential on future recordings from Aguilera. Musically the album generally consisted of ballad material which was created in an effort to showcase Aguilera's vocal talents although in addition to the ballads recorded in these sessions, dance music became a prominent theme throughout the eleven tracks she recorded during this time. Lawsuit and release After discovery that Alleca and Brown would be releasing the album, Aguilera started developments to sue the pair in an effort to stop the release. Aguilera filed a suit against Warlock Records and the affiliates Platinum Recordings and JFB Music for \\"improper use of her name and license on the upcoming album Just Be Free\\". Carla Christofferson, her lawyer at the time, explained that \\"We're trying to stop them from releasing these early recordings which is not the quality she is associated with right now.\\" However, Warlock Records president Adam Levy felt that despite Aguilera disliking the material, he found it to be a look into her life at the time of recording. He stated \\"It's a great look at what she was doing, We're pleased [to be putting the record out]. I'm more pleased for the album's producers who wanted to get it out. I hope the fans can appreciate it.\\" Christofferson responded by alleging that Warlock Records tried to \\"boot strap\\" on Aguilera's success. In response to the lawsuit, Warlock Records filed their own lawsuit in an attempt to ensure the release of the record. During the proceedings, Aguilera agreed to let Warlock Records release Just Be Free after reaching a settlement with the company and its affiliates. She allowed the release under the condition that the label would have to include a letter written by Aguilera in each album released. Since November 13, 2015, the album is available to stream on Spotify and Deezer.Just Be Free. Spotify. Retrieved 2015-11-15Just Be Free by Christina Aguilera (not available in the US). Deezer. Retrieved 2015-11-15 Critical reception The album received generally negative reviews from critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic understood why Aguilera was dissatisfied with the release of the material, calling the songs \\"pre-professional\\" and \\"generic early-'90s dance-pop\\". He noted that Just Be Free did not match the quality of her self- titled debut album due to its \\"bland\\" production. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a D-rating, citing the album's production and describing the content as \\"teen-jailbait\\" due to lyrics such as \\"Why don't you stay with me tonight\\". Pier Dominguez, author of A Star is Made, commented that the sessions demonstrated \\"Christina's raw vocal agility\\" despite calling the content \\"dull\\", adding \\"Christina's hunger for success actually comes through in these songs, as she sings her heart out with strained emotion, trying to sound as if she's letting all her inhibitions run free. If she did in fact co-write the songs then they were also a demonstration of Christina's songwriting dexterity, because the album's lyrics could be called unoriginal and perhaps even cheesy, it could not be said that they were not catchy\\". Similarly, Stephanie McGrath from JAM! Music also saw why Aguilera would not want the album released. Although she recognized Aguilera's potential as a vocalist, she wrote \\"The songs themselves are terrible, dated club tracks, overwhelmed by poor effects and mundane beats.\\" Despite the negative critical reception, the album has sold over 129,000 copies in the United States and peaked at number 71 on the Billboard 200.

His main interests focus on social and political issues. By decontextualizing everyday objects, symbols or situations, Milunoviƒá provokes unease in the observer, a blend of alienation and curiosity. In 2018 obtained the prestigious Award from the French Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts for his painting work. His works are featured in prestigious museum collections including MUMOK, Vienna; Museum of Contemporary Art, Belgrade; Palazzo Forti, Verona; and Mus√©e d‚ÄôArt et d‚ÄôIndustrie, Saint-√âtienne, France. He participated in numerous individual and group exhibitions, among others: MUMOK Ludwig Museum Vienna; Galerie Nationale du Jeu de Paume, Paris; Mus√©e d'art moderne (Saint- √âtienne) ; Museum of Contemporary Art, Belgrade; The Stedelijk Museum, Aalst, Belgium; Esterhazy Foundation Schloss Esterh√°zy, Eisenstaedt; Musee d'Art Modeste, Sete; PAN Naples; The Kunsthalle Fridericianum, Kassel; The Biennials in Poznan and Valencia; Wiener Secessionsgeb√§ude, in Vienna, and others. In June 2017. Mihael Milunoviƒá's work \\"Vision/Blue Mountain\\" covered the highest building in Vienna over 4000m2, the Ringturm, seat of Vienna Insurance Group, marking the ten-year jubilee of this company's art project \\"Wrapping of Ringturm\\". The ceremony was opened with a speech of Sebastian Kurz, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Austria. Early life and education Milunoviƒá was born in Belgrade, then capital of Yugoslavia, to Nikola Kolja Milunoviƒá and Ana Viƒëen. His father is a well known Serbian sculptor and first son of Milo Milunoviƒá (August 6, 1897 ‚Äì February 11, 1967), a Montenegrin painter that dabbled in both Impressionism and Cubism and was one of the founders of Academy of Arts, Belgrade in 1937. His mother Ana Viƒëen was a sculptor of Croatian origin. Milunoviƒá studied painting at the University of Arts in Belgrade and at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France. In 1996 he was awarded Laureate of the prestigious Prix de la Fondation Renoir,https://web.archive.org/web/20141108051204/ Period 1999‚Äì2009 Soon after his return to Paris, in 2000 he exposed his works in Galerie Nationale du Jeu de Paume, within the exhibition \\"L'autre moiti√© de l'Europe\\", in a part curated by dr. Lorand Hegyi. Milunoviƒá met Lorand Hegyi during the show, and the long term collaboration was born. Milunoviƒá artworks were included the next year (2001) in MUMOK Museum Ludwig in Vienna, Austria and consequently in Collection Siemens AG in Vienna. He debuted with the Galerie Ernst Hilger, and continued working with him until 2004. Between 2001 and 2003, Milunoviƒá participated in the Biennale of Valencia in 2003, together with Roman Opalka, Dennis Oppenheim and Ilya Kabakov. During this period Milunoviƒá also collaborated on number of exhibition projects with Cit√© des Sciences in Paris. Milunoviƒá moved from Paris to Saint-Etienne in France's, central region, where he developed projects with the √âcole sup√©rieure d'art et design Saint-√âtienne, where he held an experimental class, and also many artistic and exhibition projects; he participated in several museum shows in Mus√©e d'art moderne (Saint-√âtienne) in 2004 (Passage d‚ÄôEurope together with Anri Sala, Dan Perjovschi, Simon Hantai) and 2005 (Domicile, with Jan Fabre and others). He traveled and exhibited in South Korea (2006) and Italy, notably in Palazzo d'Arte di Napoli (PAN), and started working with Gallery Changing Role in Naples, Italy and Galerie Georges Verney-Carron in Lyon, France. In 2006 he founded NGO ProArtOrg that organised the first Belgrade show of an important American artist since the war in Yugoslavia 1991‚Äì1995. It was the show of Dennis Oppenheim followed by a series of lectures given by Thommas Messer, director emeritus of Guggenheim Foundation and dr. Lorand Hegyi, then director of Mus√©e d'art moderne (Saint-√âtienne). In 2007 he opened a show \\"Uncomfortable Realities\\" in Galerie Piece Unique in Paris, France, showing new sculptural works and works on paper. The show gained great attention. In 2008 he started a collaboration with Galerie Guy Baertschi from Geneva. In 2009 he moves again to Paris, only to complete a large sculptural work entitled \\" Mothership\\", realised with a group of de-scolarised children in Saint-Etienne and with a help of NGO Paria and city of Saint-Etienne. Period 2009‚Äì2017 At the end of 2009 Milunoviƒá moves to Brussels. He started to paint large scale paintings that were shown in Museum of Contemporary Art Belgrade in 2014, and consequently became part of important art collections (Collecion Solo, Wiener st√§dtische, Esterhazy).

Indeed, the outer atmosphere of this star has expanded to around 48 times the radius of the Sun. Even though it has just 1.4 times the mass of the Sun, this wide envelope gives it a luminosity of roughly 468 times the Sun's. This energy is being radiated from a relatively cool outer atmosphere that has an effective temperature of nearly 4,000 K. It is this cool temperature that gives it the orange-red glow of an M-type star. The outer envelope of this star is undergoing a type of pulsation that occurs in a class of variable stars known as semiregular variables and its brightness varies from magnitude +3.32 to +3.40. Based upon frequency analysis of the observed light curve, the star's variability exhibits multiple periods of pulsation. The detected periods are 13.0, 17.2, 25.6, 110.1 and 125.8 days. This is a high-velocity star with a peculiar velocity of more than relative to the mean motion of other stars in the vicinity. Delta Virginis is a possible binary star, as an 11th magnitude star is located at an angular separation of 80 arcseconds. This K-type dwarf may have an orbital period of over 200,000 years, but this has not been confirmed.

He studied medicine, working as a field surgeon from 1916 to 1918. He was awarded the Swiss Gottfried Keller Prize in 1931, and the Goethe Prize in 1938.  Biography  =Carossa family= The Carossas were originally of North Italian stock; but by 1878, when Hans was born, they no longer spoke Italian and were considered simply Upper Bavarian Germans. Hans' father was a well-known lung specialist, who had published some significant research in his field. He had a calm humanitarian outlook which endeared him to the local Catholic population in spite of his cool relationship with the Church. Carossa explains in the first volume of his autobiography, Eine Kindheit: Carossa's mother, on the other hand, was a devoutly Catholic and quite sensitive person. The young couple had just settled in the south Bavarian resort town of Bad T√∂lz when Hans was born. They then lived in several Bavarian hamlets. These moves left a feeling of insecurity in the mind of their sensitive and introspective son. Although Hans had a younger sister, Stephanie, a close relationship with her is not evident. He attended the Volksschule in Pilsting, the Gymnasium in Landshut, and the Hochschule in Munich. Hans' interest in poetry began when he was quite young, but it was soon rivaled by the family tradition of medicine. The disparity between the impractical, otherworldly realm of the poet and the very down-to- earth life of a medical doctor haunted him for most of his life. He studied medicine at three universities, Munich, W√ºrzburg, and Leipzig. Practically all of his spare time, however, was spent in literary circles. Just after the turn of the century the twenty-four-year-old Carossa began medical practice in the south-east Bavarian border city of Passau. In 1907, the successful young doctor married a patient, Valerie Endlicher, and moved to the country. =Early career= Hans Carossa's first publication, the poem Stella Mystica, appeared in 1907. This work, which is faintly reminiscent of a thirteenth century Tagelied, contains a classic theme which continues throughout the rest of Carossa's writings: unshakable faith in the ultimate victory of the powers of light over darkness. But, as might be expected of a first publication, the poem lacks the polish and maturity so typical of the poet's later work. The year 1907 was a crucial one for a young Roman Catholic who longed to become a writer, especially one whose idols had been poets such as Richard Dehmel and Frank Wedekind; for it was in 1907 that Pope Pius X issued the encyclical Pascendi dominici gregis bitterly condemning modernism in the arts. As with later more serious threats to his freedom of expression, Carossa was not deeply moved by this order from his church. Other literary and political figures fought the encyclical vigorously; Carossa neither complied nor complained. It is evident from the Hofmannsthal-Carossa correspondence of the period that in the following year, 1908, Carossa all but quit medicine in favor of writing. Actually the literary career of young doctor Carossa only began three years later with a little forty-eight page collection of poems simply titled Gedichte. The publication of this book also marked the inauguration of Carossa's lifelong association with the Insel publishing house. The problem of the relationship between the doctor and his patient, especially the moribund patient, tore at the soul of the youthful physician. It was natural that Carossa should attempt, as his literary idol Goethe had done in Werther, to write his way out of his most perplexing problems. In fact, Carossa's Doktor B√ºrgers Ende of 1913 had too much in common with Werther, not only in its motivation, but also in form and plot, to be an original artistic creation. It represents, rather the culmination of the author's period of imitation which had started with the apery of contemporary modernists, and worked backwards in time, until in copying Goethe, Carossa discovered himself. As a guiding thought or Leitwort for Doktor B√ºrger Carossa splendidly epitomized his patient-doctor relationship in ideas borrowed from his father: Ja, meinem Herzen am n√§chsten sind jetzt die Verlorenen, die, von denen ich weiss, dass ich sie nicht retten werde. In the years just before World War I, literary interests were the chief concern in the young doctor's life. He took notes, planned works, and sought companionship and criticism of such literary figures as Rilke and Hofmannsthal. =World War I= In 1914 Carossa, who was a little too old to be called up immediately, volunteered as an army physician. While doing the inevitable waiting so common to all military service, Carossa collected childhood memories into what was to become Eine Kindheit, kept a record of his war experiences later published as Rum√§nisches Tagebuch, and also made notes which served as the basis for a large section of his Lebensgedankenbuch titled F√ºhrung und Geleit. Carossa served as battalion medical officer on both fronts: first a short period in France, then an extended stay in the southeastern theater (Rum√§nisches Tagebuch), where his unit was involved in the Second Battle of Oituz. In 1918 Carossa's unit was transferred back to northern France where he suffered a shoulder wound which ended his military career. =Weimar Republic= The gay Munich, which Carossa had remembered from before the war, greeted the convalescent veteran with somber, black-veiled women, limping men, and empty store windows. This was no time for poets of limited ability, as Carossa considered himself. At the time he felt earnestly: In den Jahren der Pr√ºfung und Erniedrigung, wenn das Volk trauernd zur Erde schaut, wird ihm der Dichter stets am allern√§chsten sein. But his own destiny was to be primarily that of a doctor. Ich werde wieder an Krankenbetten sitzen, √ºber fremde Leiden Buch f√ºhren, Diagnosen und Prognosen stellen, Heilmittel verordnen, Zeugnisse verfassen, √∂fters Nachts gerufen werden, und von Zeit zu Zeit eine Urlaubsreise antreten und hie und da einmal ein paar Verse oder eine Seite Prosa schreiben ... Dem √§rztlichen Wesen wollte ich verbunden bleiben und falls ich etwas schriebe, mit der Sprache kaum anders umgehen als mit den Heilgiften, auf deren genaue Dosierung ich einge√ºbt war. He considered it a good omen that while purchasing new medical instruments during his convalescence in Munich, he met Rilke who then turned out to be the first patient of his renewed practice. Upon his own recovery he returned to his Passau office. With renewed dedication, he read medical journals and went to lectures at the clinic to improve his abilities. The Passau practice grew and kept him quite busy. Nevertheless, in a later addition to his autobiographies, published posthumously, he concedes that when he moved to Munich, not long after reestablishing his Passau practice he fully intended to give up medicine for the life of a 'freier Schriftsteller': a wish which could not then become reality. Doctor Carossa did however, find a little time for the \\"Heilgifte\\" of literature. In 1922, the author of Doktor B√ºrger, which had been so glaringly modelled on Goethe's Werther, published the first volume of his autobiography, Eine Kindheit. The relationship between Carossa's four part autobiography (Eine Kindheit, Verwandlung einer Jugend, Das Jahr der sch√∂nen T√§uschungen, and Der Tag des jungen Arztes) and Goethe's Dichtung und Wahrheit is much more subtle than that between Werther and Doktor B√ºrger. Doctor Carossa had already by this time published three other works: Stella Mystica, Gedichte, and a fifteen-page lyrical pamphlet titled Ostern. The success of Eine Kindheit rekindled Doctor Carossa's enthusiasm. Again, as in 1908, a completely literary career hung temptingly before his eyes. His writings were as yet producing only a meager income, but each new word of praise by friends and critics made the switch in emphasis from a career as doctor-poet to one of poet-doctor a little more feasible. In 1923 he published a third edition of Gedichte, now twice as large as the original 1910 edition. Further heartened by the response to his newer poems, Carossa released later in the same year his third prose work, Rum√§nisches Tagebuch. This book was very well received and was remunerative enough that in the mid-twenties Carossa was relieved of financial dependence on his medical practice. The most obvious sign of Carossa's financial success and definite turn toward literature was his ability to fulfill his desire for a Goethean pilgrimage to classic Italy. Such a pilgrimage had meant much to Goethe' s classical development and could have perhaps done the same for Carossa, but Carossa had had to wait too long for his \\"Italienische Reise\\". The world of 1925 was being shaken by ominous political happenings which were soon to bar any possibility of Carossa's accomplishing the degree of classic detachment that Goethe had been able to enjoy. In 1922, three years before Carossa's Italian trip, Italy had become the second totalitarian state of Europe. It called itself Fascist, while the first had designated itself Communist; but in terms of freedom of expression for an individual citizen, Communism and Fascism were synonymous. Germany, at the time, was still a democratic republic, but already in 1924, a little-known party with the catch-all name of National Socialist German Workers' Party had won 6.5% of the votes in the Reichstag election. Classically oriented Carossa did not seem to be at all impressed by these events. By leaving his Munich practice for Italy, he made a major break with the medical profession; when he returned only old friends, those he wanted to treat, would visit his office, and he could spend most of his days at literary composition. Soon after coming back from the classic land, he published the second of his autobiographical series, Verwandlung einer Jugend (1926). This same year also brought sadness into Carossa's life when on 29 December his dear friend Rilke died. Autobiographical material from Carossa dealing with the period from the mid- twenties to the early thirties is scant; and, since Carossa's own writings are to an excessive degree the only source of information about the man, very little is known about those years. Letters to his wife's family indicate that he was very concerned with his wife's illness, which resulted in her dependency on morphine. During the 1920s he began a relationship with his later second wife, Hedwig Kerber, with a child born in 1930. The lack of literary production may indicate that problems of the German economy, primarily the disastrous inflation, had made it necessary for Carossa to return to practice. He did rework Doktor B√ºrger and republished it in 1929 as Schicksal Doktor B√ºrgers, and one year earlier his home city of Munich had honored him with its Dichterpreis. Perhaps these years of relative silence were filled with preparation for the two fine works in the offing, the first of which was to appear in 1931. On 25 May 1931 Thomas Mann's son Klaus Mann first considered emigrating from his native land because of the political situation. Two years later, he, the rest of the Mann family, and many others of Germany's finest minds did go into exile. In 1931 Carossa, outwardly at least, undisturbed by the \\"gathering storm\\" published Der Arzt Gion. Although still strongly autobiographical, this work was his first and only major work written in the third person. (The only other one was his short story Ein Tag im Sp√§tsommer 1947.) Der Arzt Gion reflects a maturity and optimism which had been becoming increasingly evident in Carossa's works, but which seems strangely out of place in the depression-scarred, dictator-threatened Europe of 1931. From now on, except for a short period toward the end of World War II, the poet-doctor Carossa gave up medical practice completely. Carossa's last book before the Nazi Regime began was F√ºhrung und Geleit (1932), an inner survey rather than a true autobiography of his life from early youth to the 1920. =Nazi Germany= After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Carossa chose the Inner emigration and rejected his appointment to the German Academy of Poetry,Ernst Klee: Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007. , p. 94. but in 1938 he accepted the Goethe Prize of the City of Frankfurt, and in 1941 at the European Poets' Meeting he was appointed President of the European Writers' League, which was founded by Joseph Goebbels in 1941/42, vice president was Giovanni Papini.Ernst Klee, Kulturlexikon, p. 94.\\"Dichte, Dichter, tage nicht!\\" - Die Europ√§ische Schriftsteller-Vereinigung in Weimar 1941-1948 by Frank-Rutger Hausmann, 2004, , p. 210 Carossa contributed a poem to an anthology that was published by August Friedrich Velmede and called \\"Dem F√ºhrer. Worte deutscher Dichter\\" (i.e. To the Leader. Words by German poets): :\\" ... Encouraged we return to our own task : and wish to the brave one, : to the fighter and leader who bears all our destiny : the best and good luck.\\" Frank-Rutger Hausmann: ‚ÄûDichte, Dichter, tage nicht!‚Äú Die Europ√§ische Schriftsteller-Vereinigung in Weimar 1941‚Äì1948. Klostermann, Frankfurt am Main 2004, , page 96: \\" ... Ermutigt kehrt er zu seinen Aufgaben zur√ºck / und w√ºnscht jenem k√ºhnen, / das allgemeine Schicksal tragenden K√§mpfer und F√ºhrer / Heil und Gl√ºck.\\" Next year he stayed away from the embarrassing event.Klaus Harpprecht: Die Trag√∂die vom einfachen Anstand. In: Die Zeit, Nr. 37/1993. Despite his distance from the Nazi regime, Carossa was one of the most promoted writers. In 1944, in the final phase of the Second World War, Carossa was included by Hitler on the Gottbegnadeten list, the list of the six most important German writers. Success and honors in the neutral and friendly (fascist) foreign countries (Premio San Remo 1939) and the financial rise ‚Äì quadrupling his income in 1941 ‚Äì met an internally distanced Carossa, who also knew how to use his position. So in 1941 he stood up for the writer Alfred Mombert, who was endangered because of his Jewish heritage, so that Mombert was allowed to leave Germany for Switzerland. Shortly before the capitulation in 1945, Carossa pleaded in a letter to the Lord Mayor of Passau to hand over the city without a fight and was sentenced to death in absentia. The rapid approach of the US Army saved him.Eintrag Carossa, Hans. In: Hans Sarkowics, Alf Mentzer: Literatur in Nazi-Deutschland. Ein biographisches Lexikon. Europa-Verlag: Hamburg/Vienna 2000. =After 1945= After the war, Carossa processed his role in the Nazi era. However, his book Ungleiche Welten (Unequal Worlds) of 1951 was criticized, it veiled and glossed over, presented the poet as apolitical and the National Socialists as a power of fate against which no resistance was possible. In West Germany he again achieved his popularity of the 1920s and 1930s. Federal President of Germany Theodor Heuss visited him at his home in 1954. Hans Carossa is the namesake of his former school Hans-Carossa-Gymnasium Landshut and the Hans-Carossa-Gymnasium in Berlin-Spandau, the elementary school in Pilsting (Lower Bavaria), the elementary school Passau-Heining ‚Äì near which his last residence as well as his grave is located ‚Äì , the Hans-Carossa-Hospital in St√ºhlingen as well as a multitude of streets all over Germany, among others in Passau, M√ºnster, Nuremberg and Berlin.

RV parks by region =Australia= In Australia there is generally no differentiation between an RV park and a trailer park. The term \\"caravan park\\" is used to refer to both. The term \\"holiday park\\" is becoming increasingly common, with many parks increasing their stock of on-site cabins, often accompanied by a reduction in the number of caravan sites, generally having higher quality facilities than the standard caravan park. =Europe= Caravan sites in Europe range in facilities depending on their age. Most new sites will be built to high environmentally friendly standards and have facilities compatible with the newest vehicles. The Caravan Club has 1 million members in Europe with around 200 self-owned campsites and over 2,500 third party certificated locations, more commonly known as CL sites. The Camping and Caravanning Club is a non-profit organisation which has been running for over a century and has over 400,000 members and 100 campsites in the United Kingdom. Beer, Devon, England. This caravan park is primarily made up of semi- movable static caravans. In France, Germany and Italy, to a lesser degree also in Norway and Netherlands, a large network of dedicated stopover sites for motorhomes has grown since about 1980. These sites are called Reisemobil- Stellplatz in German or Aire de Camping-car in French. While these sites can usually not be compared to North American RV sites regarding size and facilities, they still fulfill the same purpose. =New Zealand= In New Zealand, motor camp, caravan park or holiday park are all terms typically used to describe overnight or long term vehicle-based camping.

Some high-end resorts restrict the type of RV that can stay to motorhomes of a certain length or longer, and/or newer than a certain year. Most RV parks are open to allcomers and rent spaces on a nightly or weekly basis, much like a motel or hotel. A few parks operate on a time-share basis. Membership campground networks like Thousand Trails operate like clubs, with members paying an initial membership fee and annual dues. There are over 13,000 privately owned RV parks and over 1,600 state parks that cater to RVers in the USA. Many of these RV parks offer WiFi hotspot access on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis; occasionally, WiFi is included in the campsite fee. Most RV parks are independent or operated by a government entity. In the United States, Kampgrounds of America (KOA), is the largest and best-known chain of RV parks, with Yogi Bear's Jellystone Park Camp Resorts a distant second. Good Sam Parks are mostly independently owned RV campgrounds endorsed by the Good Sam Club, a large association of US RVers that is operated for profit by the Affinity Group, Inc.

San Isidro became the capital of the Philippines during the First Republic while President Emilio Aguinaldo was moving north to avoid being captured by American forces. History San Isidro was the capital of Nueva Ecija from 1852 to 1912. After the first cry against the Spanish colonial government was made in 1896, 2,000 revolutionary soldiers under General Mariano Llanera sieged San Isidro. On March 29, 1899, General Emilio Aguinaldo declared San Isidro as the capital of the Philippines after the revolutionary capital Malolos, Bulacan was captured by the Americans. However, this was short-lived. General Frederick Funston planned the capture of Aguinaldo to end the Philippine-American War, in San isidro. The Wright Institute, established in 1903 in San Isidro, was the first high school established outside Manila during the American period.

According to its website, POGO works with whistleblowers and government insiders to identify wrongdoing in the federal government, and works with government officials to implement policy changes based on its investigations. POGO is led by executive director Danielle Brian. History The Project on Military Procurement, an arm of the National Taxpayers Legal Fund, was founded by Dina Rasor in February 1981. The Project's mission was to make the public aware of 'waste, fraud, and fat\\" in U.S. defense spending, according to Rasor. In the organization's early days, Rasor worked with whistleblowers to expose design flaws in the M1 Abrams tank, which had undergone a \\"shocking (cost) increase\\" in 1980, according to Rasor. The Project first gained widespread attention in the early 1980s for publishing reports on \\"outrageously overpriced military spending\\", including a $7,600 coffee maker and a $436 hammer. These prices were actually an artifact of government accounting rules, and include not just the cost of the equipment but also a portion of the overhead cost of the entire project they were associated with.The myth of the $600 hammer The organization expanded its scope beyond military spending and changed its name to the Project On Government Oversight (POGO) in 1990. Danielle Brian joined POGO as its executive director in 1993. Other watchdog organizations have folded into POGO over the years. In 2012, the Straus Military Reform Project of the Center for Defense Information joined POGO. In 2016, the Center for Effective Government (known as OMB Watch until 2013) folded and became part of POGO.  Organization  POGO currently has a staff of about 28 people, according to its website. Its board of directors includes investigative reporter David Burnham, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace senior fellow Sarah Chayes, Harper's Magazine editor Andrew Cockburn, former Republican congressman Mickey Edwards, lawyer Pamela Gilbert, political scientist Norman Ornstein, and investigative reporter Morton Mintz. The organization is funded through grants from a variety of foundations, as well as private donations. In order to maintain its independence, POGO does not accept government grants or corporate funding, according to its website. The organization made $2,504,184 in revenue in 2016, according to its IRS public disclosure form. Selected work = Cancellation of the Superconducting Super Collider = POGO contributed to the successful effort to cancel Department of Energy's Superconducting Super Collider project, which had already lost a 1992 vote in the House of Representatives as its cost estimates ballooned from $4.4 billion to $12 billion. In June 1993, POGO publicized a Department of Energy Inspector General report it had received in draft form from a whistleblower. The Inspector General investigated $500,000 in questionable expenses over three years, including $12,000 for Christmas parties, $25,000 for catered lunches, and $21,000 for the purchase and maintenance of office plants. Super-Collider Perks Under Investigation : Science: Documents show costly parties and catered lunches. Officials say expenses are legal but some were inappropriate. The report also concluded that there was inadequate documentation for $203 million in project spending, or 40% of the money spent up to that point.Energy Chief Says Accounting Problems Snag Supercollider Project = Area 51 hazardous waste investigation = POGO reported that in 1995 it was contacted by a woman who claimed her husband had died as the result of being exposed to toxic waste while working at Area 51. At the time, the U.S. government denied the existence of the Area 51, but POGO turned to George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley to sue the government on behalf of the woman and six former Area 51 workers for illnesses and death as a result of toxic waste exposure at Area 51. POGO executive director Danielle Brian said that, during the litigation, the organization obtained an unclassified Area 51 security manual, which POGO gave to Turley and the plaintiffs so they could prove Area 51 existed. The Air Force then retroactively classified the manual, \\"threatened to prosecute anyone who had it in their possession, and demanded access to all of POGO's files to determine what other 'classified' information POGO possessed,\\" Brian wrote in a signed legal declaration. The court ruled that the plaintiffs' case could not be proved because it could not confirm the existence of Area 51, however Area 51 was thereafter required to comply with environmental laws. In 2013, the government confirmed that Area 51 exists. = Unpaid oil royalties investigation = POGO released a series of reports from 1995 to 1997 that said the U.S. federal government was owed billions of dollars in unpaid oil royalties from companies that drilled oil from public lands. The reports claimed that the Department of the Interior's Mineral Management Service had a \\"sweetheart\\" relationship with oil companies that prevented the agency from going after the industry for moneys due. = Federal Contractor Misconduct Database = In 2002, POGO launched the Federal Contractor Misconduct Database, a website that compiles instances of \\"misconduct and alleged misconduct\\" by the top government contractors since 1995, according to the website. POGO's database was the inspiration for a similar federal government database that was created by the 2009 National Defense Authorization Act. When POGO updated its database in 2010, it was reported that the organization had \\"found 642 instances since 1995 of misconduct by the top 100 firms, resulting in $18.7 billion in penalties.\\" = Lawsuit against John Ashcroft = In 2004, POGO filed a lawsuit against then-U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft for illegally retroactively classifying documents critical of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The classification came to light after Sibel Edmonds, an FBI translator, discovered that intercepted memos relevant to the September 11 terrorist attacks had been ignored due to poor translation. POGO won the lawsuit in 2005. = Congressional Oversight Initiative = In 2006, POGO launched a series of nonpartisan trainings to teach congressional staff how to conduct oversight and investigations. Since then, POGO has hosted monthly training, as well as specialized training upon request, according to the organization's website. = Ending the Royalty-In-Kind program = In 2008, POGO released a report that documented corruption and mismanagement in the Department of the Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) royalty-in-kind program. The investigation revealed inadequate royalty accounting, as well as the provision of sex, drugs, and other favors to MMS officials by oil company representatives in exchange for favorable business deals. Following this report and others by the federal Government Accountability Office, the royalty in-kind program was terminated, and MMS was split into three different bureaus.DePillis, Lydia (September 18, 2009). \\"No More Sex and Drugs in the Interior Department\\".

POGO uncovered and released documents, photos, and videos depicting drunken behavior, nudity, and hazing among the guards. POGO's investigation led to the dismissal of several managers and eight guards, the resignation of an additional two guards, and ultimately, the cancellation of the U.S. military's contract with ArmorGroup. = Nuclear facility safety investigations = POGO has conducted numerous investigations into the Los Alamos National Laboratory.Los Alamos National Laboratory Files .

The New Mexico Independent. 2009 also saw a scare in which 2.2 pounds of missing plutonium prompted a Department of Energy investigation into the plant. The investigation found that the \\"missing plutonium\\" was a result of miscalculation by LANL's statisticians and did not actually exist, but the investigation did lead to heavy criticism of the plant by the DOE for security flaws and weaknesses that the DOE claimed to have found.Vartabedian, Ralph.

NTI. = FDA conflicts of interest investigation = Starting in 2011, POGO conducted an investigation into conflicts of interest of an advisory committee at the Food and Drug Administration that was reviewing the Yaz and Yasmin birth control pills. POGO found that four members of the committee had ties to either the maker of the pills or the maker of a generic version, but did not announce the conflicts before endorsing the drugs. Both Yaz and Yasmin have been linked to fatal blood clots in some users. = Advocacy for Camp Lejeune victims = In 2012, POGO working with whistleblower retired Marine Corps Master Sgt. Jerry Ensminger, advocated for openness regarding toxic water contamination at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. From 1953 until at least 1985, U.S. Marines and their families living at Camp Lejeune had used tap water that contained carcinogens and other harmful chemicals leaking from a nearby dump site for radioactive material. POGO and other organizations claimed in 2012 that the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps hid information about the nature and extent of the contamination, citing a report released by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry that was redacted by the Navy. Later that year, the U.S. Senate voted to approve healthcare for those who lived at Camp Lejeune and suffered health problems. In 2017, the Department of Veterans' Affairs finalized rules to provide benefits for people who had been diagnosed with certain diseases as a result of living at Camp Lejeune. = Defense spending and Straus Military Reform Project = POGO has conducted many investigations into defense spending, particularly in cases where, \\"national security and needs of the troops have been compromised by greed, lack of oversight, and in many cases, sheer incompetence,\\" according to its website. Some of the weapons systems that POGO has been critical of include the littoral combat ship, the F/A-22 fighter aircraft, and the F-35 joint strike fighter aircraft. On the other hand, POGO has supported the production of the A-10 aircraft for its relative effectiveness and inexpensiveness compared to what POGO considers more wasteful weapons. In 2012, the Straus Military Reform Project of the Center for Defense Information moved to POGO with director and military analyst Winslow Wheeler. Wheeler retired in 2015. = Whistleblower protection = POGO, along with several other public interest groups, was involved in the investigation and trial of Scott Bloch, ex-head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC). Bloch was accused by former OSC employees of ignoring and dismissing hundreds of whistleblower complaints, removing language guaranteeing protection against sexual orientation discrimination from OSC's website and official documents, and \\"relocating\\" several of his own employees who came forward with these allegations. When these accusations led to a congressional investigation of Bloch, Bloch allegedly hired a technology company to wipe the memory of his computer and several other OSC laptops in order to hide key evidence from the investigators. Bloch initially claimed that he ordered this as protection against a virus that had infected his computer, but he later admitted he was trying to withhold information.Wilke, John (November 28, 2007). \\"Head of Rove Inquiry in Hot Seat Himself.\\" The Wall Street Journal Bloch ultimately resigned his position as head of the OSC and pleaded guilty to withholding information from Congress.Jordan, Lara Jakes (October 21, 2008). \\"U.S. Special Counsel Bloch to Resign\\" The Washington Post. POGO has worked to protect the rights of several specific whistleblowers‚Äîincluding Franz Gayl, who criticized military leaders' decision to not deliver protective armored vehicles called MRAPs to troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Davis, who challenged military leaders' depictions of the \\"rosy\\" situation on the ground in Afghanistan‚Äîby sending letters to Congress and the agencies involved.Ukman, Jason (November 17, 2011). \\"Whistleblower Franz Gayl gets his job back\\" The Washington Post.Davis, Lt.

Whistleblower award incident  In 1998, POGO, the Department of Justice, and other plaintiffs filed a lawsuit under the False Claims Act, suing the largest oil and gas companies operating in the United States. The lawsuit alleged that the companies had defrauded the government by underpaying royalties owed for drilling on federal lands. By 2002, 15 companies had settled, paying a total of almost $440 million. POGO was awarded about $1.2 million from the settlements in 1998. That year, POGO shared its settlement with two federal employee whistleblowers, saying the payment was a \\"Public Service Award\\" to the whistleblowers. Following the news of the award in 1999, U.S. Senator Frank Murkowski asked the General Accounting Office to investigate whether the payment represented \\"improper influence\\" on the Department of the Interior's new oil royalty valuation policy. The agency released a report in 2000 that said it appeared POGO paid the two employees to influence the Department of the Interior to take actions and make policies that benefited POGO. While calling the payments a \\"mistake\\" on POGO's part, U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman disputed the agency's report, saying that it did not provide any evidence that the payments were improper.Bingaman, Jeff (U.S. Sen) (September 5, 2000). Congressional Record, 106th Congress, Volume 145 Part 12. Pg. 16998 U.S. Government Printing Office. In 2000, U.S. Representative Don Young threatened bringing a Contempt of Congress charge against POGO, after the organization refused to comply with a House of Representatives subpoena for documents relating to the payments.House Panel Seeks Contempt of Congress Charges Against Watchdog Group - Organization exposed oil companies' underpayment of royalties to government. St. Louis Post-Dispatch (AP), July 20, 2000. Retrieved 2010-07-15. Young later withdrew the charge, lacking the votes for passage. The report, hearings, and contempt threat were described by Martin Lobel, an attorney involved in the case, as being driven by \\"oil company congressional lapdogs\\" bent on hounding oil industry enemies and derailing regulatory reform.Lobel, Martin (September 20, 2000). WITH A VENGEANCE: Big Oil Uses Its Congressional Lapdogs to Hound Its Enemies . TomPaine.com; Institute for America's Future In 2003, the Department of Justice filed a civil action against POGO and one of the federal employees, and a U.S. district judge ruled in favor of the agency. POGO appealed the case and went to trial in 2008, where a jury found POGO and the federal employee had violated the law. The judge ordered POGO to pay only $120,000 because he said the organization had acted \\"in good faith\\" when they made the payments. However, in 2010, the appeals court found the district judge had made a mistake in his directions to the jury. POGO and the agency went to trial again in 2012, but a mistrial was declared after jurors couldn't come to a unanimous verdict. A month later, in 2013, the Department of Justice said it would not litigate on the matter for a third time. Publications POGO's reports can be found online here. In 2002, POGO, Government Accountability Project, and Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, co-published the book The Art of Anonymous Activism: Serving the Public while Surviving Public Service. It is described as a \\"how-to guide\\" for government employees who wish to expose corruption or misconduct in their organization without endangering their careers.Your life may depend on a whistleblower, so protect him. Sun Herald p. E3. December 11, 2002. Retrieved 2010-08-03. (Payment required) In 2009, POGO published The Art of Congressional Oversight: A User's Guide to Doing It Right, which is a guide geared towards congressional staffers. POGO published a second edition in 2015.  Awards & External Reviews  In 2009, POGO received the Society of Professional Journalists' Sunshine Award for its work uncovering wasteful spending in the Air Force, investigating the Minerals Management Service at the Department of the Interior, and compiling the Federal Contractor Misconduct Database. In 2015, POGO received five awards from the Washington, DC, chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. POGO won the Non-breaking News Award for its coverage of issues at the Department of Veterans' Affairs; two Investigative Reporting Awards for its coverage of the revolving door in government and problems at the Department of Justice; the Series award also for its coverage of the revolving door; and the Robert D.G. Lewis Watchdog Award also for its coverage of the Department of Justice. POGO has been rated at four out of four stars by Charity Navigator, a nonprofits evaluator, since December 1, 2016.

He also wrote under the pseudonyms Jan Heger and N.A. Menlos. Early life Sperber was born on 12 December 1905 in Zab≈Çot√≥w near Kolomea, in the Austrian Galicia (today Zabolotiv, Ukraine). Sperber grew up in the shtetl of Zab≈Çot√≥w in a Hasidic family. He was the son of David Mechel SperberR' David Mechel Sperber and his patrilinear ancestors mentioned under the name Shfarber in Zab≈Çot√≥w's Yizkor Book . and the older brother of Milo Sperber born 1911, who was to become an actor in Britain. In the summer of 1916 the family fled from war to Vienna, where Sperber who, having lost faith, at 13 had refused to do his bar mitzvah, joined the Jewish Hashomer Hatzair youth movement. There he met Alfred Adler, the founder of individual psychology, and became a student and co-worker. Adler broke with him in 1932 because of differences in opinion about the connection of individual psychology and Marxism. In 1927 Sperber had moved to Berlin and joined the Communist Party. He lectured at the Berliner Gesellschaft f√ºr Individualpsychologie, an institute for individual psychology in Berlin. After Hitler had taken power Sperber was taken to jail, but was released after a few weeks on the grounds that he was an Austrian citizen. He emigrated first to Yugoslavia and then in 1934 to Paris where he worked for the Communist International with Willi M√ºnzenberg. In 1938 he left the party because of the Stalinist purges within the party. In his writing he started to deal with totalitarianism and the role of the individual within society (Zur Analyse der Tyrannis). In 1939 Sperber volunteered for the French Army. After the defeat, he took refuge in Cagnes, in the so-called \\"zone libre\\" (free zone) of France, and had to flee with his family to Switzerland in 1942, when the deportation of Jews started in that zone too. Career After the end of the war, in 1945, he returned to Paris, and worked as a writer and as a senior editor at the Calmann-L√©vy publishing house. Man√®s Sperber is the author of a novel trilogy: Like a Tear in the Ocean: A Trilogy, (1949‚Äì1955); of an autobiographical trilogy: All our Yesterdays (1974‚Äì1997), and numerous essays on philosophy, politics, literature, and psychology. Sperber was widely published and read in Germany, receiving the high-profile Friedenspreis des Deutschen Buchhandels in 1983. In awarding the prize, the association described Sperber as a \\"writer, who tracked the path of the ideological aberrations of the century, and freed himself from them entirely. Throughout his life he retained the independence of his own judgement, and incapable of indifference, summoned the courage, to get himself onto that non-existing bridge that only opens up in front of those who step out over the abyss.\\" The German writer Siegfried Lenz gave the speech highlighting Sperber's lifetime achievement. One of his closest friends was the novelist Constantine Fitzgibbon who translated much of his work into English. Personal life Man√®s Sperber is the father of Italian historian Vladimir Sperber and French anthropologist and cognitive scientist Dan Sperber. His first wife, Miriam Sperber, eventually emigrated to Champaign, Illinois, and became a counselor at the Psychological and Counseling Center there. His younger brother Milo was an English actor. Milo spent the last years of his life travelling around Britain reading from his brother's works. Death Man√®s Sperber died on 5 February 1984 in Paris. He was buried in the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris.

Modern Arabic is a pluricentric language with varying branches correlating with different regions where Arabic is spoken and the type of communities speaking it. The vernacular varieties of Arabic include: *Peninsular Arabic **Persian Gulf Arabic (spoken around the coasts of the Persian Gulf in Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, as well as parts of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, and Oman) **Yemeni Arabic, *Levantine Arabic (spoken in the Levant region) **Syrian Arabic **Jordanian Arabic **Lebanese Arabic **Palestinian Arabic, *Maghrebi Arabic (spoken in the Maghreb region) **Moroccan Arabic **Tunisian Arabic, *Mesopotamian Arabic **Baghdad Arabic, *Egyptian Arabic, *Sudanese Arabic, and many others. In addition, many speakers use Modern Standard Arabic in education and formal settings. Therefore, in Arabic- speaking communities, diglossia is frequent. = Aramaic = The Aramaic language is a pluricentric language, having many different literary standards, including *Old Aramaic **Biblical Aramaic (uses the Aramaic alphabet in place of Paleo-Hebrew alphabet) **Jewish Palestinian Aramaic (Hebrew alphabet) **Eastern Aramaic languages **Western Aramaic languages, *Middle Aramaic **Classical Syriac (Syriac script) **Mandaic language (Mandaic script) **Jewish Babylonian Aramaic **Jewish Palestinian Aramaic **Samaritan Aramaic language (Samaritan alphabet) **Christian Palestinian Aramaic, *Modern Aramaic **Northeastern Neo-Aramaic ***Assyrian Neo-Aramaic ***Chaldean Neo-Aramaic ***Judeo-Aramaic languages ****Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic ****Betanure Jewish Neo-Aramaic ****Hulaul√° ****Lish√°n Did√°n ****Lishana Deni ****Lishanid Noshan **Central Neo-Aramaic **Western Neo-Aramaic **Neo-Mandaic. = Armenian = The Armenian language is a pluricentric language with the liturgical Classical Armenian and two vernacular standards, Eastern Armenian and Western Armenian. Speakers outside of the former Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (including all Western Armenians as well as Eastern Armenians in Iran) use the Classical Armenian orthography, while others adopt the reformed Armenian alphabet. = Catalan‚ÄìValencian‚ÄìBalearic = The term \\"Catalan‚ÄìValencian‚ÄìBalearic\\" is seldom used (for example, in a dictionary by Antoni Maria Alcover i Sureda). This language is internationally known as Catalan, as in Ethnologue. This is also the most commonly used name in Catalonia, but also in Andorra and the Balearic Islands, probably due to the prestige of the Central Catalan dialect spoken in and around Barcelona. However, in the Valencian Community, the official name of this language is Valencian. One reason for this is political (see Serbo- Croatian for a similar situation), but this variant does have its own literary tradition that dates back to the Reconquista. Although mutually intelligible with other varieties of Catalan, Valencian has lexical peculiarities and its own spelling rules, which are set out by the Acad√®mia Valenciana de la Llengua, created in 1998. However, this institution recognizes that Catalan and Valencian are varieties of the same language. For their part, there are specific varieties in the two major Balearic islands, Mallorcan (mallorqu√≠) in Mallorca, Menorcan (menorqu√≠) in Menorca, Eivissenc in Eivissa. The University of the Balearic Islands is the language regulator for these varieties. = Chinese = Until the mid-20th century, most Chinese people spoke only their local varieties of Chinese. These varieties had diverged widely from the written form used by scholars, Literary Chinese, which was modelled on the language of the Chinese classics. As a practical measure, officials of the Ming and Qing dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on northern varieties, known as GuƒÅnhu√† (ÂÆòË©±, literally \\"speech of officials\\"), known as Mandarin in English after the officials. Knowledge of this language was thus essential for an official career, but it was never formally defined. In the early years of the 20th century, Literary Chinese was replaced as the written standard by written vernacular Chinese, which was based on northern dialects. In the 1930s, a standard national language Gu√≥y«î (ÂúãË™û, literally \\"national language\\") was adopted, with its pronunciation based on the Beijing dialect, but with vocabulary also drawn from other northern varieties. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the standard was known as P«ît≈çnghu√† (ÊôÆÈÄöËØù/ÊôÆÈÄöË©±, literally \\"common speech\\"), but was defined in the same way as Gu√≥y«î in the Republic of China now governing Taiwan. It also became one of the official languages of Singapore, under the name Hu√°y«î (ÂçéËØ≠/ËèØË™û, literally \\"Chinese language\\"). Although the three standards remain close, they have diverged to some extent. Most Chinese in Taiwan and Singapore came from the southeast coast of China, where the local dialects lack the retroflex initials /t Ç t Ç ∞  Ç/ found in northern dialects, so that many speakers in those places do not distinguish them from the apical sibilants /ts ts ∞ s/. Similarly, retroflex codas (erhua) are typically avoided in Taiwan and Singapore. There are also differences in vocabulary, with Taiwanese Mandarin absorbing loanwords from Min Chinese, Hakka Chinese, and Japanese, and Singaporean Mandarin borrowing words from English, Malay, and southern varieties of Chinese. = Coptic = The Coptic language was pluricentric with different written dialects like Sahidic and Bohairic. = English = English is a pluricentric language, with differences in pronunciation, vocabulary, spelling, etc., between each of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom, North America, the Caribbean, Ireland, English-speaking African countries, Singapore, India, and Oceania. Educated native English speakers using their version of one of the standard forms of English are almost completely mutually intelligible, but non-standard forms present significant dialectal variations, and are marked by reduced intelligibility. British and American English are the two most commonly taught varieties in the education systems where English is taught as a second language. British English tends to predominate in other parts of Europe and the former British colonies of the West Indies, Africa, and Asia, where English is not the first language of the majority of the population. In contrast, American English tends to dominate instruction in Latin America, Liberia, and East Asia.Yuko Goto Butler. \\"How Are Nonnative-English-Speaking Teachers Perceived by Young Learners?\\" TESOL Quarterly. Vol. 41, No. 4 (Dec., 2007), pp. 731-755.Timothy J. Riney, Naoyuki Takagi & Kumiko Inutsuka. \\"Phonetic Parameters and Perceptual Judgments of Accent in English by American and Japanese Listeners.\\" TESOL Quarterly Vol. 39, No. 3 (Sep., 2005), pp. 441-466 Statistically, American English speakers constitute more than 66% of native English speakers, with British English next with about 18% and other varieties such as Australian English and Canadian English having up to 7% each. Due to globalization and the resulting spread of the language in recent decades, English is becoming increasingly decentralized, with daily use and statewide study of the language in schools growing in most regions of the world. However, in the global context, the number of native speakers of English (a concept that is increasingly being challenged) is much smaller than the number of non-native speakers of English of reasonable competence. In 2018, it was estimated that for every native speaker of English, there are six non-native speakers of reasonable competence, raising the questions of English as a Lingua Franca as the most widely spoken form of the language. Philippine English (which is predominantly spoken as a second language) has been primarily influenced by American English. The rise of the call center industry in the Philippines has encouraged some Filipinos to \\"polish\\" or neutralize their accents to make them more closely resemble the accents of their client countries. Countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and Canada have their own well-established varieties of English which are the standard within those countries but are far more rarely taught overseas to second language learners. English was historically pluricentric when it was used across the independent kingdoms of England and Scotland prior to the Acts of Union in 1707. English English and Scottish English are now subsections of British English. = French = In the modern era, there are several major loci of the French language, including Standard French (also known as Parisian French), Canadian French (including Quebec French and Acadian French), American French (for instance, Louisiana French), Haitian French, and African French. Until the early 20th century, the French language was highly variable in pronunciation and vocabulary within France, with varying dialects and degrees of intelligibility, the langues d'o√Øl. However, government policy made it so that the dialect of Paris would be the method of instruction in schools, and other dialects, like Norman, which has influence from Scandinavian languages, were neglected. Controversy still remains in France over the fact that the government recognizes them as languages of France, but provides no monetary support for them nor has the Constitutional Council of France ratified the Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. North American French is the result of French colonization of the New World between the 17th and 18th centuries. In many cases, it contains vocabulary and dialectal quirks not found in Standard Parisian French owing to history: most of the original settlers of Quebec, Acadia, and later what would become Louisiana and northern New England came from Northern and Northwest France, and would have spoken dialects like Norman, Poitevin, and Angevin with far fewer speaking the dialect of Paris. This, plus isolation from developments in France, most notably the drive for standardization by L'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, make North American dialects of the language quite distinct. Acadian French, that which is spoken in New Brunswick, Canada, contains many vocabulary words that are much older than anything found in modern France, much of it having roots in the 17th century, and a distinct intonation. Qu√©b√©cois, the largest of the dialects, has a distinct pronunciation that is not found in Europe in any measure and a greater difference in vowel pronunciation, and syntax tends to vary greatly. Cajun French has some distinctions not found in Canada in that there is more vocabulary derived from both local Native American and African dialects and a pronunciation of the letter r that has disappeared in France entirely. It is rolled, and with heavier contact with the English language than any of the above the pronunciation has shifted to harder sounding consonants in the 20th century. Cajun French equally has been an oral language for generations and it is only recently that its syntax and features been adapted to French orthography. Minor standards can also be found in Belgium and Switzerland, with particular influence of Germanic languages on grammar and vocabulary, sometimes through the influence of local dialects. In Belgium, for example, various Germanic influences in spoken French are evident in Wallonia (for example, to blink in English, and blinken in German and Dutch, blinquer in Walloon and local French, cligner in standard French). Ring (rocade or p√©riph√©rique in standard French) is a common word in the three national languages for beltway or ring road. Also, in Belgium and Switzerland, there are noted differences in the number system when compared to standard Parisian or Canadian French, notably in the use of septante, octante/huitante and nonante for the numbers 70, 80 and 90. In other standards of French, these numbers are usually denoted soixante-dix (sixty-ten), quatre-vingts (four- twenties) and quatre-vingt-dix (four-twenties-and-ten). French varieties spoken in Oceania are also influenced by local languages. New Caledonian French is influenced by Kanak languages in its vocabulary and grammatical structure. African French is another variety. = German = Standard German is often considered an asymmetric pluricentric language; the standard used in Germany is often considered dominant, mostly because of the sheer number of its speakers and their frequent lack of awareness of the Austrian Standard German and Swiss Standard German varieties. Although there is a uniform stage pronunciation based on a manual by Theodor Siebs that is used in theatres, and, nowadays to a lesser extent, in radio and television news all across German-speaking countries, this is not true for the standards applied at public occasions in Austria, South Tyrol and Switzerland, which differ in pronunciation, vocabulary, and sometimes even grammar. In Switzerland, the letter √ü has been removed from the alphabet, with ss as its replacement. Sometimes this even applies to news broadcasts in Bavaria, a German state with a strong separate cultural identity. The varieties of Standard German used in those regions are to some degree influenced by the respective dialects (but by no means identical to them), by specific cultural traditions (e.g. in culinary vocabulary, which differs markedly across the German-speaking area of Europe), and by different terminology employed in law and administration. A list of Austrian terms for certain food items has even been incorporated into EU law, even though it is clearly incomplete. = Hindustani = The Hindi languages are a large dialect continuum defined as a unit culturally. Medieval Hindustani (then known as Hindi or HindaviShaban, Abdul. \\"Urdu and Urdu Medium Schools in Maharashtra.\\" Economic & Political Weekly 50.29 (2015): 47.) was based on a register of the Delhi dialect and has two modern literary forms, Standard Hindi and Standard Urdu. Additionally, there are historical literary standards, such as the closely related Braj Bhasha and the more distant Awadhi, as well as recently established standard languages based on what were once considered Hindi dialects: Maithili and Dogri. Other varieties, such as Rajasthani, are often considered distinct languages but have no standard form. Caribbean Hindi and Fijian Hindi also differ significantly from the Sanskritized standard Hindi spoken in India. = Malay = From a purely linguistic viewpoint, Malaysian and Indonesian are two normative varieties of the same language (Malay). Both lects have the same dialectal basis, and linguistic sources still tend to treat the standards as different forms of a single language.An example of equal treatment of Malaysian and Indonesian: the Pusat Rujukan Persuratan Melayu database from the Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka has a \\"Istilah MABBIM\\" section dedicated to documenting Malaysian, Indonesian and Bruneian official terminologies: see example In popular parlance, however, the two idioms are often thought of as distinct tongues in their own rights due to the growing divergence between them and for politically motivated reasons. Nevertheless, they retain a high degree of mutual intelligibility despite a number of differences in vocabulary and grammar. The Malay language itself has many local dialects and creolized versions, whereas the \\"Indonesian language\\", the standardized variety in Indonesia acting as a lingua franca of the country, has received a great number of international and local influences. = Malayalam = The Malayalam language is a pluricentric language with historically more than one written form. Malayalam script is officially recognized, but there are other standardized varieties such as Arabi Malayalam of Mappila Muslims, Karshoni of Saint Thomas Christians and Judeo-Malayalam of Cochin Jews. = Persian = The Persian language has three standard varieties with official status in Iran (locally known as Farsi), Afghanistan (officially known as Dari), and Tajikistan (officially known as Tajik). The standard forms of the three are based on the Tehrani, Kabuli, and Dushanbe varieties, respectively. The Persian alphabet is used for both Farsi (Iranian) and Dari (Afghan). Traditionally, Tajiki is also written with Perso-Arabic script. In order to increase literacy, a Latin alphabet (based on the Common Turkic Alphabet) was introduced in 1917. Later in the late 1930s, the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic promoted the use of Cyrillic alphabet, which remains the most widely used system today. Attempts to reintroduce the Perso-Arabic script were made.'Tajikistan to use Persian alphabet,' Iranian website says. Tajikistan News ASIA-Plus. Published 3 May 2008, retrieved 9 April 2019. The language spoken by Bukharan Jews is called Bukhori (or Bukharian), and is written in Hebrew alphabet. = Portuguese = Apart from the Galician question, Portuguese varies mainly between Brazilian Portuguese and European Portuguese (also known as \\"Lusitanian Portuguese\\", \\"Iberian Portuguese\\", \\"Standard Portuguese\\" or even \\"Portuguese Portuguese\\"). Both varieties have undergone significant and divergent developments in phonology and the grammar of their pronominal systems. The result is that communication between the two varieties of the language without previous exposure can be occasionally difficult, although speakers of European Portuguese tend to understand Brazilian Portuguese better than vice versa, due to the heavy exposure to music, soap operas etc. from Brazil. Word ordering can be dramatically different between European and Brazilian Portuguese. Brazilian and European Portuguese currently have two distinct, albeit similar, spelling standards. A unified orthography for the two varieties (including a limited number of words with dual spelling) has been approved by the national legislatures of Brazil and Portugal and is now official; see Spelling reforms of Portuguese for additional details. Formal written standards remain grammatically close to each other, despite some minor syntactic differences. African Portuguese and Asian Portuguese are based on the standard European dialect, but have undergone their own phonetic and grammatical developments, sometimes reminiscent of the spoken Brazilian variant. A number of creoles of Portuguese have developed in African countries, for example in Guinea-Bissau and on the island of S√£o Tom√©. = Serbo-Croatian = Serbo-Croatian is a pluricentric language with four standards (Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, and Serbian) promoted in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, and Serbia. (√ñNB). (NSK). (FFZG). These standards do differ slightly, but do not hinder mutual intelligibility. (√ñNB). (√ñNB). (√ñNB). (√ñNB). Rather, as all four standardised varieties are based on the prestige Shtokavian dialect, major differences in intelligibility are identified not on the basis of standardised varieties, but rather dialects, like Kajkavian and Chakavian.http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/475567.Jezik_i_nacionalizam.pdfhttps://www.portalnovosti.com/bez- tlake-na-jeziku Lexical and grammatical differences between the ethnic variants are reportedly limited, even when compared with those between closely related Slavic languages (such as standard Czech and Slovak, Bulgarian and Macedonian). The Montenegrin standard is largely based on the Serbian, while Bosnian is a compromise between Croatian and Serbian ones; Croatian and Serbian standards show 95% mutual intelligibility. Shtokavian is largely mutually unintelligible with Kajkavian (which is closer to Slovene) and only partially intelligible with Chakavian. = Spanish = Spanish has both national and regional linguistic norms, but all varieties are mutually intelligible (outside of minor vocabulary differences) and the same orthographic rules are shared throughout. In Spain, Standard Spanish is based upon the speech of educated speakers from Madrid. All varieties spoken in the Iberian Peninsula are grouped as Peninsular Spanish. Canarian Spanish (spoken in the Canary Islands), along with Spanish spoken in the Americas (including Spanish spoken in the United States, Central American Spanish, Mexican Spanish, Andean Spanish, and Caribbean Spanish), are particularly related to Andalusian Spanish. The United States is now the world's second-largest Spanish-speaking country after Mexico in total number of speakers (L1 and L2 speakers). A report said there are 41 million L1 Spanish speakers and another 11.6 million L2 speakers in the U.S. This puts the US ahead of Colombia (48 million) and Spain (46 million) and second only to Mexico (121 million).https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/29/us-second-biggest- spanish-speaking-country The Spanish of Latin Americans has a growing influence on the language across the globe through music, culture and television produced using the language of the largely bilingual speech community of US Latinos.Mar‚ÄêMolinero, C., & Paffey, D. (2011). Linguistic imperialism: who owns global Spanish?. The handbook of Hispanic sociolinguistics, 747-764.Mar-Molinero, Clare. \\"The European linguistic legacy in a global era: Linguistic imperialism, Spanish and the Instituto Cervantes.\\" In Language Ideologies, Policies and Practices, pp. 76-88. Palgrave Macmillan UK, 2006.Mar-Molinero, C. (2008). Subverting Cervantes: language authority in global Spanish. International Multilingual Research Journal, 2(1-2), 27-47. In Argentina and Uruguay the Spanish standard is based on the local dialects of Buenos Aires and Montevideo. This is known as Rioplatense Spanish, distinguishable from other standard Spanish dialects by voseo. In Colombia, Rolo (a name for the dialect of Bogot√°) is valued for its clear pronunciation.http://www.pri.org/stories/2010-06-21/clearest-spanish/ The Judeo-Spanish (also known as Ladino; not to be confused with Latino) spoken by Sephardi Jews can be found in Israel and elsewhere; it is usually considered a separate language. = Swedish = Two varieties exist, though only one written standard remains (regulated by the Swedish Academy of Sweden): Rikssvenska (literally \\"Realm Swedish\\"), the official language of Sweden, and Finlandssvenska (in Finland known as \\"H√∂gsvenska\\"), which, alongside Finnish, is the other official language of Finland. There are differences in vocabulary and grammar, with the variety used in Finland remaining a little more conservative. The most marked differences are in pronunciation and intonation: Whereas Swedish speakers usually pronounce before front vowels as , this sound is usually pronounced by a Swedo-Finn as ; in addition, the two tones that are characteristic of Swedish (and Norwegian) are absent from most Finnish dialects of Swedish, which have an intonation reminiscent of Finnish and thus sound more monotonous when compared to Rikssvenska. There are dialects that could be considered different languages due to long periods of isolation and geographical separation from the central dialects of Svealand and G√∂taland that came to constitute the base for the standard Rikssvenska. Dialects such as Elfdalian, Jamtlandic, Westrobothnian and Gutnish all differ as much, or more, from standard Swedish than the standard varieties of Danish. Some of them have a standardized orthography, but the Swedish government has not granted any of them official recognition as regional languages and continues to look upon them as dialects of Swedish. Most of them are severely endangered and spoken by elderly people in the countryside. In the case of Westrobothnian, the pejorative \\"bondska\\" is widespread, derived from the word for peasant and literally meaning \\"farmish\\", thus leading people to believe that it has something to do with peasantry or farming although the dialects have been spoken in all parts of society for over 1000 years. = Others = * Standard Irish (Gaeilge), Scottish Gaelic and possibly Manx can be viewed as three standards arisen through divergence from the Classical Gaelic norm via orthographic reforms. * Komi, a Uralic language spoken in northeastern European Russia, has official standards for its Komi-Zyrian and Komi-Permyak dialects. * Korean: North and South (to some extent‚Äîdifferences are growing; see North‚ÄìSouth differences in the Korean language and Korean dialects) * Kurdish language has two main literary norms: Kurmanji (Northern Kurdish) and Sorani (Central Kurdish). The Zaza‚ÄìGorani languages, spoken by some Kurds, are occasionally considered to be Kurdish as well, despite not being mutually intelligible. *For most of its history, Hebrew did not have a center. The grammar and lexicon were dominated by the canonical texts, but when the pronunciation was standardised for the first time, its users were already scattered. Therefore, three main forms of pronunciations developed, particularly for the purpose of prayer: Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Temani. When Hebrew was revived as a spoken language, there was a discussion about which pronunciation should be used. Ultimately, the Sephardi pronunciation was chosen even though most of the speakers at the time were of Ashkenazi background, because it was considered more authentic. The standard Israeli pronunciation of today is not Identical to the Sephardi, but is somewhat of a merger with Ashkenazi influences and interpretation. The Ashkenazi pronunciation is still used in Israel by Haredim in prayer and by Jewish communities outside of Israel. * Norwegian consists of a multitude of spoken dialects displaying a great deal of variation in pronunciation and (to a somewhat lesser extent) vocabulary, with no officially recognized \\"standard spoken Norwegian\\" (but see Urban East Norwegian). All Norwegian dialects are mutually intelligible to a certain extent. There are two written standards: Bokm√•l, \\"book language\\", based on Danish (Danish and Norwegian Bokm√•l are mutually intelligible languages with significant differences primarily in pronunciation rather than vocabulary or grammar), and Nynorsk, \\"New Norwegian\\", based primarily on rural Western and rural inland Norwegian dialects. *Pashto has three official standard varieties: Central Pashto, which is the most prestigious standard dialect (also used in Kabul), Northern Pashto, and Southern Pashto. * Romance languages ** Romanian in Romania (based on Wallachian dialect) and that in Moldova (based on Moldavian dialect) during the Soviet era, but nowadays Romania and Moldova use the same standard of Romanian. ** Romansh, with five written standards (from southwest to northeast: Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter, Vallader) as well as a \\"compromise\\" form. ** Sardinian consists of a conglomerate of spoken dialects, displaying a significant degree of variation in phonetics and sometimes vocabulary. The Spanish subdivision of Sardinia into two administrative areas led to the emergence of two separate ortographies, Logudorese and Campidanese, as standardized varieties of the same language. * Ukrainian and Rusyn (Pre≈°ov, Lemko, Pannonian) are either considered to be standardized varieties of the same language or separate languages. * Dutch is considered pluricentric with recognised varieties in Suriname, ABC Islands, Belgium and The Netherlands.

The medieval heritage includes Byzantine art, preserved in architecture, frescos and icons of the many Serbian Orthodox monasteries. In the Early modern period, Serbian visual arts began to be influenced by Western art, culminating in the Habsburg Monarchy in the late 18th century. The beginning of modern Serbian art is placed in the 19th century. Many Serbian monuments and works of art have been lost forever due to various wars and peacetime marginalizations. Prehistory Currently, Europe's oldest known civilization was discovered in Serbia, namely Lepinski Vir and Vinƒça culture. In Serbia, Archaeological Sites of Exceptional Importance (Serbia) are numerous and have the highest level of state protection under the Law on Cultural Heritage. See: Prehistoric sites in Serbia and Prehistory of Southeastern Europe for artifacts and sculpture found at the archeological sites of Lepinski Vir.

Slowly, however, we're beginning to learn. But in the course of centuries experience in painting frescoes, miniatures, icons and the iconostasis, there undoubtedly arose arts and crafts workshops where a younger generation of painters and skilled craftsmen could learn the techniques of the masters. Church architecture developed under the patronage of the medieval Serbian state. The most distinctive piece of medieval Serbian architecture was the Studenica monastery founded by Stefan Nemanja, the founder of medieval Serbia ca. 1190. This monastery also featured significant works of art including its Byzantine style fresco paintings. Its church also features extensive sculptures based on Psalms and the Dormition of the Theotokos. UNESCO added this monastery to its list of World Cultural Heritage sites in 1986. It was the model for other monasteries at Mile≈°eva, Sopoƒáani and the Visoki Deƒçani. The influence of Byzantine art became more influential after the capture of Constantinople in 1204 in the Fourth Crusade when many Greek artists fled to Serbia. Their influence can be seen at the Church of the Ascension at Mile≈°eva as well as in the wall paintings at the Church of the Holy Apostles at Peƒá and at the Sopoƒáani Monastery. Icons and frescoes also formed a significant part of church art. At that time in Ra≈°ka, Stefan Vladislav who founded at Mile≈°eva a monastery and a church where three of his court painters -- Demetrius, George and Theodore -- worked on wall painting free from the strict canon law tradition. The influence of Byzantine architecture reached its peak after 1300 including the rebuilding of the Our Lady of Ljevi≈° (ca. 1306‚Äì1307) and St. George at Staro Nagoriƒçane as well as the Graƒçanica monastery. Church decorative paintings and religious arts and crafts also developed further in the period. The most noteworthy painters at the time were Michael Astrapas and Eutychios (fl. 1294-1317) and before them, Deacon Jovan and Rufin. The Crucifixion, fresco in Studenica monastery Icon of the Holy Virgin Pelagonitissa, dating from 1421, is considered one of the last outstanding achievements of icon painting, a representation of the then still-living Byzantine iconography. Its author Makarije Zograf worked on the icon in the Church of Transfiguration in the monastery of the village Zrze, near Prilep, and many other Serbian monasteries during the fifteenth century. Makarije Zograf and his brother Metropolitan Jovan Zograf cared for the monastery endowment until it was transferred to Constantine, the village head (kmet). The Visoki Deƒçani monastery in Metohija was built between 1330 and 1350. Unlike other Serbian monasteries of the period, it was built with Romanesque features by master-builders under the monk Vitus of Kotor. Its frescoes feature 1000 portraits portraying all of the major themes of the New Testament. The cathedral features iconostasis, hegumen's throne and carved royal sarcophagus. In 2004, UNESCO listed the Deƒçani Monastery on the World Heritage List. There was a further spate of church building as the Serbian state contracted to the Morava basin in the late 14th century. Prince Stefan Lazareviƒá was a poet and patron of the arts who founded the church at Resava at Morava with the wall paintings having a theme of parables of Christ with the people portrayed wearing feudal Serbian costumes. Manuscripts were another significant feature of Serbian medieval art. Miroslav's Gospel features lavish calligraphy and miniatures and is a significant artwork as well as a notable work of literature. The Chludov Psalter dating from the 14th century is beautifully decorated and was probably owned by a high-ranking noble. Serbian princes were well known in the 15th century for supporting manuscripts employing scribes and artists to create manuscripts besides icons and frescoes. Lovro Dobriƒçeviƒá (1420-1478) of Kotor was a Venetian painter of Serbian origin, though Roman Catholic by confession, who first started to paint in the Serbian Orthodox Savina Monastery in Zeta and Serbian Despotate (now Montenegro) in the mid-15th century.https://www.visit- montenegro.com/montenegro/montenegro-museum-in-the-open/monastery-savina/ Later in 19th century, Serbian medieval art was used as inspiration for notable architect Andrey Damyanov who, between 1835 and 1878, along the Vardar and Morava Valleys and Bosnia, built around 40 churches and other buildings.Journal Balkanologie by Bernard Lory, December 2002, retrieved 3-4-2018 Adapting to the social demand of its Serbian sponsors, Damyanov combined simultaneously traditional elements of the 15th century Morava school with Occidental baroque elements found North of Sava river. Thanks are due to field scientist and academic Gabriel Millet who was the first to bring Serbian art to the attention of the West in 1919, along with Serbian-American scientist Michael Pupin, who gathered an international team of scholars and public figures to support the preservation of architectural heritage during and after the Great War. In 1918, Sir Thomas Graham Jackson, in Pupin's \\"Serbian Orthodox Church\\" on the medieval Serbian churches, refuted the notion that Serbian art was nothing more than a branch of Byzantine art and showed that Serbian art had an original character of its own. A large number of artistically worthy icons was made in this period. =Fresco paintings= The Dormition of the Virgin in Sopoƒáani monastery Orthodox fresco painting represents the peak of Serbian medieval art. Its birth went in line with the creation and development of medieval Serbian state, but unlike Serbian state it didn't cease to exist during the Ottoman occupation. While Serbian architecture has seen mixed influences of both Byzantine and medieval Italian states, fresco and icon painting remained deeply rooted in solely eastern byzantine tradition. Frescos were being painted under the patronage of Serbian rulers, as the highest form of religious decorative form. Following the political expansion and military growth, the 13th and 14th century are marked as the period when the biggest amount of newly built or existing sanctuaries have been decorated, mostly by unknown artists. Studenica monastery has been built in 1196 under the patronage of Stefan Nemanja, the founder of Nemanjiƒá dynasty, and ever since it enjoyed the care of Stefan's descendants as the archi-model. Its most representative fresco, The Crucifixion, was made twelve years later, in 1208, on the blue background brought into contrast with golden-yellow of Christ's bare crucified body. In the second half of 14th century an unknown artist painted monumental The Dormition of the Virgin in Sopoƒáani monastery, which remained the supreme achievement of byzantine painting tradition. However, the most famous Serbian medieval fresco is the Myrrhbearers (or the \\"White Angel\\") from the Mile≈°eva monastery, painted in 1235, on the southern wall of the church. It depicts Archangel Gabriel sitting on Christ's grave. The identity of its author is unknown. In the 16th century, the White Angel was over-painted with another fresco, and so was hidden until the 20th century when the fresco was restored. This fresco was sent as a message in the first satellite broadcast signal from Europe to America after the Cuban Missile Crisis, as a symbol of peace and civilization. Later, the same signal, containing the White Angel, was transmitted to space in an attempt to communicate with extraterrestrial life forms. Another notable mention is the fresco of Serbian queen Simonida, in Graƒçanica monastery, today located on the disputed territory of Kosovo. Born as Simonis Palaiologina, she was a daughter of the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282‚Äì1328) and Irene of Montferrat, and the fourth wife of Serbian king Stefan Milutin (r. 1282‚Äì1321). Two celebrated Serbian poems were inspired by the beauty of the fresco. Two dark stains on the places where queen's eyes were supposed to be have created a common belief that her eyes were being carved out by Albanians, hence the well-known strophe by Milan Rakiƒá: > Your eyes were gouged out, oh beautiful image, On a pilaster at approach of > night, Knowing that no one would witness the pillage, An Albanian‚Äôs knife > robbed you of your sight.Simonida, Kosara Gavriloviƒá translation. However, between 1971 and 1976, during the conservation works in the monastery, it was discovered that for centuries the queen's eyes were lying under what actually was (unsuccessfully intentionally damaged) grey layer. Once the patches were removed, Simonida was shown to media with light-blue eyes. 16th and 17th centuries Icon of Saint Nicholas, tempera on wood, by Andrija Raiƒçeviƒá, 1641 The Ottoman conquest of Serbia during the 15th century had a negative impact on the visual arts. The Serbs became part of the Rum Millet (Christian community), and were regarded as a lower class (rayah). The Serbian nobility was not integrated into the Ottoman state system, and the Ottoman government abolished the church. As the nobility and church were the main sources of patronage for architects and artists, the Early Modern period is considered an artistically less productive period in Serbian art. Despite the general trend, notable monuments were built. There was some resumption of artistic endeavor after the restoration of the Serbian Patriarchate in 1557. Zograf Longin (1530-1600) and Georgije Mitrofanoviƒá were the leading painters of the late 16th and early 17th century, along with Zograf Jovan, Andrija Raiƒçeviƒá, Zograf Radul, Sava Krabuleviƒá, Kozma Damjanoviƒá, Tripo Kokolja, Zograf Dimitrije, Strahinja of Budimlje, Kyr Georgije and Kyr Kozma. Mitrofanoviƒá's work on the church at the Moraƒça Monastery is considered one of his best. Among the icon painters working in the Byzantine tradition in Slavonia were Nikola Klisur (mid-17th century) and Ostoja Mrkojeviƒá in the late 17th century. Baroque (18th century) Saint Lazar, Serbian Great Prince, a copperplate by Zaharije Orfelin, 1773 Traditional Serbian art was beginning to show some Baroque influences at the end of the 18th century as shown in the works of Nikola Ne≈°koviƒá, Teodor Kraƒçun, and Jakov Orfelin. Painting of the Early Baroque did not create a homogeneous group of painters. It developed under the Russian-Ukrainian and Southern Balkan basis and the influences that had slowly arrived from Western European art centers. The first generation of Baroque painters nourished on the learnings of the Russian painters Vasilije Romanovich and Jov Vasilijevich, then the trainee of the Kiev Academy of painting, Dimitrije Baƒçeviƒá, Vasa Ostojiƒá, Joakim Markoviƒá, , Amvrosije Jankoviƒá, Dimitrije Popoviƒá, Teodor Stefanov Gologlavac, Had≈æi-Ruvim Nenadoviƒá, and Stefan Tenecki. The work of Balkan icon painters in the Habsburg Monarchy throughout the 18th century. Teodor Simonov (born in Moschopolis) worked for the Serbian Orthodox Metropolitanate of Karlovci during the eighth decade of the 18th century. Simonov painted the walls of the church monastery in Stolni Beograd, today's Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r in Hungary. The works of Jovan ƒåetireviƒá Grabovan who completed part of his education in Imperial Russia, and returned to the Habsburg Monarchy to settle in Osijek in Slavonia where he developed a rich icon-painting activity. The works of others who also came originally from southern parts of the Balkans (once known as Old Serbia) such as Hristofor ≈Ωefaroviƒá and Janko Halkozoviƒá, created in the spirit of the Levant Baroque, relying on the transferred experience of Italian Renaissance art and the Byzantine tradition, which resulted in a distinctive model of Baroque icons. The originator of the more direct rotation on Central European models was Joakim Markoviƒá, whose work is linked to the first portraits and Still lifes, and in church painting of historical compositions and heraldic depictions. High Baroque art was reflected in the firmer cultural orientation towards Vienna, as well as church and school reforms. The changes are visible in the works of Teodor Kraƒçun who in his work represents a significant step towards understanding the actual Central European art. The retrospective Orthodox heritage confronted the emphasized emotionality and the movement as a fundamental element of artistic expression. Scenes are placed in the real world, Christ and Mary are depicted according to the rules of the secular ruler iconography and rely on graphic templates from popular illustrated Bibles. The group of representatives of the High Baroque include Mojsije Subotiƒá, Grigorije Davidoviƒá-Ob≈°iƒá, Grigorije Jezdimiroviƒá and Lazar Serdanoviƒá. The emergence and development of Late Baroque painting had been determined by the cultural and political changes of the time of Joseph II. Conceptual changes in the era of enlightened and learned man - the Enlightenment - marked the last decade of the 18th century. The learned artist, traveling the European capitals of Art, accepts and implements the ideas of the Enlightenment reforms. Among the artists who took Serbian painting of Central European Late Baroque formulation, Jakov Orfelin and Teodor Iliƒá ƒåe≈°ljar stand out. They are joined by master woodcarvers Marko Gavriloviƒá and his sons, Arsenije and Aksentije Markoviƒá and Marko Vujatoviƒá. Neoclassicism as the style of the new era, based on the ideas of the Enlightenment, would not jeopardize the ruling Late Baroque conception in the first decades of the next century. Such a sequence is identified in the works of painters Stefan Gavriloviƒá, Jovan Isailoviƒá, Sr., Georgije Mi≈°koviƒá and Mihajlo ≈Ωivkoviƒá. Among the important painters were Nikola Ne≈°koviƒá, Teodor Kraƒçun, Teodor Iliƒá ƒåe≈°ljar, Pavel ƒêurkoviƒá, Dimitrije Baƒçeviƒá, Georgije Bakaloviƒá, Stefan Gavriloviƒá, Jovan ƒåetireviƒá Grabovan, Jovan Paƒçiƒá, Jovan Stergeviƒá and others. 19th century painting and drawing Pirot kilim & traditional Serbia costumes ;Religious art Printed magazines with engravings became a popular method of communicating through art, of both religious and irreligious themes. The printing of engravings of figures of prominent Serbian rulers fitted in the ideas of continuity of Serbian statehood. Monasteries on Fru≈°ka Gora and other ones in the Metropolitanate of Karlovci issued engraved magazines in which protector saints with monasteries were represented. Graphical arts of the 18th century were the first class documents of appearance and condition of monastery buildings before photographs. In the last decades of the 18th century, the written word suppressed visual arts as the main communication activity in religious magazines, with graphical arts becoming more and more used in illustrated books. ;Graphical arts Photography of Prince Mihailo Obrenoviƒá by Anastas Jovanoviƒá In the first decades of the 19th century a new graphic technique of lithography experience a real boom in the countries of Western Europe. Serbian artists gradually introduced it to the history of national arts in the 19th century. In contrast to modest attempts of scarce individuals, the lithography becomes an important branch of Serbian art only with the emergence of Anastas Jovanoviƒá. Independent printed magazines on religious themes which prevailed in the 18th century became scarcer in the 19th century, only accounting for a part of the graphic production. As a medium very suitable for spreading political ideas, lithography dominates with national-historical themes. Sketch portraits and templates for lithography were dealt with by many Serbian painters: Jovan Isailoviƒá, Jr., Jovan Popoviƒá, Uro≈° Kne≈æeviƒá, Pavle Simiƒá, Pavle ƒåortanoviƒá, Adam Stefanoviƒá, Steva Todoroviƒá, ƒêorƒëe Krstiƒá, while being technically performed in Pest and Vienna by various lithographers. At the end of the 19th century, popular oleographs appear, as the first reproduction of popular works, most often with motifs from folklife and depictions of historical figures and events. ;Neoclassicism Under the influence of the ides of Enlightenment and Rationalism, at the end of the 18th and beginning of 19th century, Serbian art came to leave baroque pictorial poetics and acceptance of the aesthetic ideals of the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, characterized by eclecticism of different stylistic expressions, of the late baroque to neo- classical. In addition to religious painting, which was still dominant, the portrait gains an increasing importance. Portraits complete the picture of the new society created in that time and point to the idea of a permanent memory of individuals within the family or the wider community. The gallery of characters, in addition to church prelates and priests, senior officers, significant places is taken by eminent members of civil society from the first decades of the 19th century: lawyers, university professors, writers, wealthy merchants, and their wives, the status shown by marked clothing and jewelry. Stylistic features of paintings of that era: a balanced composition, precise modeling, rigorous academic drawing, color of reduced register, expressed in the works of Arsenije Teodoroviƒá, Pavel ƒêurkoviƒá, Georgije Bakaloviƒá, Jeftimije Popoviƒá, Nikola Aleksiƒá, Konstantin Danil, Jovan Isailoviƒá, Jr., Katarina Ivanoviƒá, Dimitrije Avramoviƒá, and others. ;Biedermeier Self-portrait by Katarina Ivanoviƒá, National Museum of Serbia In the 1830s the Serbian art scene is added by a generation of painters who transferred Bidermeier and Nazarene art programs from Central Europe. As a stylistic expression that deeply permeated the Serbian art at that time, Biedermeir was most suitable for the wide layers of citizens that concerned about themselves, their family and home. In the changed social circumstance in which the middle class had become the bearer of social changes, the family becomes the basic unit of modern society and the main scene of private life. Awareness of family is confirmed and visualized in family portraits, in group or of some of its members. Family portraits depict the social status of the family, but at the same time they have a private character and are part of narrow family cult. In addition to portraits, Biedermeir painting is also focused on the Genre art and Still life. The most important representatives of the Biedermeier expression in Serbian painting are Konstantin Danil, Katarina Ivanoviƒá, Dimitrije Avramoviƒá and Nikola Aleksiƒá.http://www.galerijamaticesrpske.rs/en/biedermeier.html# ;Romanticism Uprising of the Montenegrins by ƒêura Jak≈°iƒá In the mid-19th century Serbian artistic creativity was marked with the reception of content and design of civil works (Biedermeier), but at the same time the development of a program of historicism. For the penetration of Romanticist conceptions, education and stays of Serbian painters in Vienna and Munich, as well as trips to Italy, were crucial. Social and political conditions contributed to the Romantic expression in Serbian art accomplishing its highest achievements in the late 1860s and beginning of 1870s. In stylistic and thematic view, Romanticism brought notable innovations: greater freedom of strokes and composition, warm colors complemented by the play of light and shadow. Most Serbian artists of that period reflected national-historical content in painting compositions, however, the client needs kept iconography and portrait painting popular. Some examples of notable Romanticist painters include Katarina Ivanoviƒá (1811‚Äì1882), ƒêura Jak≈°iƒá (1832‚Äì1878), Pavle Simiƒá (1818‚Äì1876), Novak Radoniƒá (1826‚Äì1890), Aksentije Marodiƒá, ƒêura Jak≈°iƒá and Steva Todoroviƒá (1832‚Äì1925). ;Historicism The Proclamation of Du≈°an's Law Codex by Paja Jovanoviƒá In accordance with the general ideas of Historicism, as the dominant characteristics of the culture of the 19th century in the European context, the top role in the process of constituting national identity was held by events and figures from national history. They represented a representative of the golden age of the nation, which in Serbian culture of the 19th century was equated with the period of the rule of the Nemanjiƒá dynasty. The idealization of a glorious past, regardless of whether it was based on real facts or myth, it was the main tool in the constitution and the homogenization of the nation. This idealized past was directly at the service of the glorification of the present, which emphasized the idea of rebuilding the former Serbian glory. These ideas are directly reflected in the visual art of the epoch - historical compositions, but also patriotic scenes that illustrate the events of the recent past are gaining more and more importance. They praise the nation through the idealization of events and personalities, becoming at the same time engaged means of communication with the aim to awaken national and patriotic feelings. Some examples of notable Historicist painters include ƒêura Jak≈°iƒá (1832‚Äì1878) and Pavle Simiƒá (1818‚Äì1876). ;Academicism In the last decades of the 19th century, Serbian painters began to stay at Munich as a center of education and its Academy of Fine Arts, which compared to the Viennese, was more avant garde and progressive. However, the larger number of them remained faithful to the Vienna Academy where the education system was still based on constitutional education, traditional practices, and technical skills. The highest level of Academicism in Serbian painting of the late 19th century are portraits of Paja Jovanoviƒá (1859‚Äì1957) and Uro≈° Prediƒá (1857‚Äì1953). ;Orientalism The Wounded Montenegrin by Paja Jovanoviƒá won the first-place prize at the Academy of Fine Arts' annual art exhibition in Vienna in 1882. Orientalism indicates interest in Oriental scenes in the visual arts of the 19th century. Napoleon's campaign in Egypt, the conquest of Algeria, as well as travel books and other literary descriptions, encouraged the enthusiasm and imagination of artists. Islamic countries of the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa had become the preferred travel destination for many artists. Scenes of squares, bazaars, harem and various folklore events entered European painting. Orientalism rarely had a purely documentary character and more often depicted the enthusiasm of Europeans for beauty, vividness, and allure of the unknown and exotic world. The wild nature and unusual customs, combined with gorgeous colors and light, had become a great inspiration to European artists. During a long period of education, Paja Jovanoviƒá,http://www.ebritic.com/?p=660281 along with classes at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, attended the School of historical painting of Leopold M√ºller, famous for its oriental motifs. There is no doubt that Miller's crucial lessons determined his painting preference. Noting the increased interest of Europe to the events in the Balkans, he traveled during the holidays to Albania, Montenegro, Dalmatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia gathering sketches and studies of the life of the Balkan peoples. Precisely these themes brought Paja Jovanoviƒá worldwide fame and popularity. ;Realism Happy Brothers by realist Uro≈° Prediƒá In the last decades of the 19th century, with Serbian painters attending the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, Realism entered the Serbian art scene. In stylistic view, Realists, succeeding the Romantic agitation, brought calm and order in painting. In Serbian painting Realism never took root in the true sense, in the symbiosis of thematics and techniques. Serbian painters, taught artistically to express in a new form, return to be faced with the difficult solvable problems of adapting the conditions of an economically, socially and culturally underdeveloped environment, which was unwilling to accept new social themes which European Realism advocated. Serbian painters, therefore, continue to paint portraits, religious and historical compositions. The transition to realism was also gradual and slow. Painting of nature and common folk were not only easily accepted and the painters had even more difficulties when they tried to introduce new elements into church art. Djordje Krstiƒá with his thematic and artistic solutions for the iconostasis in the Holy Trinity Cathedral Church in Ni≈°http://www.tour-montana-nis.com/?cid=165&NewsId;=222 gave the reason for an open struggle with the earlier beliefs. Others followed suit, including ≈Ωivko Jugoviƒá, Svetislav Jovanoviƒá, Uro≈° Prediƒá and Paja Jovanoviƒá, just to name a few. It is interesting to note that \\"with the realist disappears the long prevalence of Vojvodina in art and that Belgrade becomes not only the political but also the cultural and artistic center\\" so writes critic Dejan Medakoviƒá. ;Symbolism As a formulated artistic phenomenon on a European scale, Symbolism was also present at the Munich art scene, where some Serbian painters were formed. Representatives of Symbolism proclaimed turning of the indirect, associative and suggestive mode of expression. They used mythological symbols, dreams, and imagination as a visual language of the soul. Stevan Aleksiƒá is the most notable representative of the period. Modern visual arts Kosovo Peonies ‚Äì Gracanica (1913) by Nade≈æda Petroviƒá Battle of Kosovo (1953) by Petar Lubarda Kiril Kutl√≠k set up the first school of art in Serbia in 1895. Many of his students went to study in Western Europe, especially France and Germany and brought back avant-garde styles. Nade≈æda Petroviƒá was influenced by Fauvism while Sava ≈†umanoviƒá worked in Cubism. Other well-known artists of the Avant-Garde movement from 1900 to 1918 were: Anastas Bocariƒá, Steva Todoroviƒá, Paja Jovanoviƒá, Marko Murat, Beta Vukanoviƒá, ƒêorƒëe Krstiƒá, Pa≈°ko Vuƒçetiƒá, Leon Koen, Svetislav Jovanoviƒá, ≈Ωivko Jugoviƒá, Vasa Pomori≈°ac, Adam Stefanoviƒá and others. After World War I, the Belgrade School of Painting developed in the capital with some members such as Milan Konjoviƒá working in a Fauvist manner, while others such as Marko ƒåelebonoviƒá working in a style called Intimisme based on the use of colors. Some artists chose to emigrate from Yugoslavia. Yovan Radenkovitch (1901‚Äì1979) left Belgrade for Paris in the 1930s. He befriended Matisse and Vlaminck and adopted a style inspired by Fauvism, before eventually leaving Europe to work in New York and settled in Waterbury, Connecticut, where several of his paintings are still kept in Mattatuck Museum. Socrealism was the dominant school after World War II with the rise to power of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia under Josip Broz Tito. However, that period did not last long - during the 1960s, Serbian artists started to break free from the constraints of the Communists led by figures such as Petar Lubarda and Milo Milunoviƒá. The Mediala group featuring Vladimir Veliƒçkoviƒá was formed in the 1970s to promote Surrealist figurative painting. Serbian art was split between those basing their works on the traditions of Serbian work such as frescoes and iconography and those exploring international styles. Naive art became prominent in the second half of the 20th century, with many notable artists coming from Vojvodina province. The first part of 21st century, with young artists like Jovanka Sanijenovic or Simonida Rajƒçeviƒá, marks a predominance of a figurative art linked to realism ‚Äì a realism ¬´where everything is real and nothing is real ‚Äì considering contemporary time as needing a return to what is real and concrete, and at the same time social and existential.Gordana Biba Markoviƒá, XV Proleƒáni Anale. Dom Kulture ƒåaƒçak, 20 May 2011. The Human Rights Logo was created by Serbian graphic designer Predrag Stakiƒá. Applied art and design Pirot carpet with the ornament Ra≈°iƒáeva ploƒça In terms of periodization, monuments can be divided into those from the period of the Principality, period of the Kingdom of Serbia, the monuments from the period of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, as well as those built in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the present-day Republic of Serbia. Applied art and design through the centuries have evolved in Serbia through crafts. The wealth of forms, the variety of materials with powerful color schemes and ornamentation folk art represented a strong stimulus for the affirmation of applied art, which in the second half of the 19th century, gets its first artists in Serbia. End of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century were marked by the work of individual personalities, each of them made a significant contribution to the development and the history of applied art in Serbia. These were people of different professions and some of them include: Mihailo Valtroviƒá, Vladislav Titelbah, Dragi≈°a Milutinoviƒá, Dragutin Inkiostri Medenjak. Performance art Marina Abramoviƒá performed \\"The Artist Is Present\\" at the Museum of Modern Art, in 2010. Maga Magazinoviƒá, philosopher and choreographer, was one of the most important figures of contemporary physical practice in Serbia before the Second World War. The emancipation of the body in her work was realized through the application of gymnastics, dance and physical education. During the '60s and '70s history of the contemporary dance developed in the framework of performance art, body art and happenings. On the status of the body can meditate in the works of Marina Abramoviƒá and Katalin Ladik. The performance art of the eighties was marked by a specific attitude toward ideology. This attitude is manifested in the work within the context of using utopian socialist iconography. During the '90s performance art was focused on the fight against the regime.Drugost druge scene u Srbiji Marina Abramoviƒá is the most prominent Serbian performance artist. Active for over three decades, she has been described as the \\"grandmother of performance art.\\" She pioneered a new notion of identity by bringing in the participation of her observers. Her art focuses on the theme of ‚Äúconfronting pain, blood, and physical limits of the body,‚Äù while relying on the extent of these discomforts based on the actions of her audience members.

It was broadly well-received, although some reviewers commented on the stories not being new. Synopsis The Diamond Smugglers is the account of Ian Fleming's meeting with John Collard, a member of the International Diamond Security Organisation (IDSO). The book takes the form of background narrative by Fleming of where the two men met, interspersed with the interview between Fleming and Collard, who is introduced under the pseudonym of \\"John Blaize\\". Collard relates how he was recruited into the IDSO by Sir Percy Sillitoe, the ex-head of MI5, under whom Collard had worked. The book goes on to look at the activities of the IDSO from the end of 1954 until the operation was closed down in April 1957, when its job was complete. Collard explained that the IDSO was set up at the instigation of the Chairman of De Beers, Sir Philip Oppenheimer, after an Interpol report stated that ¬£10 million of diamonds were being smuggled out of South Africa each year, as well as additional amounts from Sierra Leone, Portuguese West Africa, the Gold Coast and Tanganyika. As well as providing a history of the IDSO's operations, Collard relates a number of illustrative vignettes concerning the diamond smuggling cases he and the organisation dealt with. Background Fleming became interested in diamond smuggling after reading an article in The Sunday Times in 1954 concerning the Sierra Leone diamond industry. Philip Brownrigg, an old friend from Eton and a senior exec of De Beers, arranged for Fleming to visit the London Diamond Club to see diamonds being sorted and polished. In 1955 Brownrigg also introduced Fleming to Sir Percy Sillitoe, former head of MI5, who was working for De Beers and investigating the illicit diamond trade through the International Diamond Security Organisation. Fleming met Sillitoe and used much of the research as background material for his fictional Bond novel, Diamonds Are Forever. Fleming retained an interest in the subject and when Sillitoe suggested to the editor of The Sunday Times, Denis Hamilton, that the paper may want to write a story on the International Diamond Security Organization, Hamilton offered the story to Fleming. Sillitoe also offered his deputy, retired MI5 officer John Collard, as liaison for Fleming to interview. During World War II, Collard had assisted in the planning of Operation Overlord as part of MI11 and had joined MI5 under Sillitoe at the war's end. Whilst in MI5 he played a major role in the capture and conviction of the atomic spy Klaus Fuchs, before Sillitoe had approached him in 1954 to work for the International Diamond Security Organisation. Fleming and Collard met in Tangiers on 13 April 1957; Fleming considered Collard to be a \\"reluctant hero, like all Britain's best secret agents\\". The pair spent two weeks discussing the issue of diamond smuggling, with Collard explaining what happened in South Africa and Sierra Leone. Fleming would then dictate an average of 5,000 words a day to a secretary. When the drafts of the books were shown to De Beers they objected to a number of areas and threatened an injunction against Fleming and The Sunday Times, which resulted in much material being removed. The Sunday Times serialised the book over six weeks, starting on 15 September 1957 and finishing on 20 October 1957. Release and reception The Diamond Smugglers was published in the UK in November 1957, by Jonathan Cape, was 160 pages long and cost 12 shillings 6d. The book was published in the US on 13 May 1958, by Macmillan and cost $3.50. =Reviews= The book received largely positive reviews. Michael Crampton, writing for The Sunday Times considered it an \\"exciting and richly fascinating account\\" and thought Fleming authored a book that \\"ringing true as fact, is at the same time as highly entertaining as any fiction.\\" The Times Literary Supplement obtained the services of the Earl of Cardigan to review the book. He noted that \\"the book is put together with a skill one would expect from Mr. Fleming\\", which leads to something that is \\"very entertaining reading\\". Reviewing for The Observer, Anthony Sampson thought the book had \\"sparkle\\", adding that \\"it is often difficult to remember that we are not listening to his old hero Mr. James Bond.\\" Sampson noted that the book included \\"several yarns which are worthy of the best spy-stories\\". The reviewer for The Economist enjoyed the book, but considered that while many of the stories \\"make good reading ... they are not new\\". For The New York Times, John Barkham thought that Fleming's foray into non-fiction produced \\"mixed results\\". Although he found the subject interesting, the basis in interview resulted in a \\"choppy book\\" that was \\"no more than an interim report\\". Attempted film adaptation Shortly after publication, The Rank Group offered ¬£13,500 (¬£ in pounds) for the film rights to the book, which Fleming accepted, telling them he would write a full story outline for an extra ¬£1,000. Several contemporary newspaper reports referred to the project as \\"The Diamond Spy\\". British producer George Willoughby subsequently obtained the rights for the book from Rank and tried to make a film with the actor Richard Todd, eventually commissioning a screenplay from Australian writer Jon Cleary, who finished a script in October 1964 that remained faithful in spirit to Fleming's book while also featuring elements familiar from the James Bond films. Kingsley Amis was also hired as a story consultant; in a letter to author Theo Richmond on 20 December 1965 Amis wrote he was having 'a horrible time' of writing an outline for Willoughby. W.H. \\"Bill\\" Canaway, co-author of the screenplay for The Ipcress File, was also hired to work on the script. At one point, film director John Boorman was involved. Despite interest from Anglo-Amalgamated Film Distributors and Anglo Embassy Productions in early 1966, the project was shelved later that year. Fleming's 1956 Bond novel, Diamonds Are Forever also dealt with the topic of diamond-smuggling, albeit from Sierra Leone rather than South Africa; however the 1971 film adaptation of the novel featured a diamond-smuggling operation shipping out of South Africa.

It is the largest training base and most diversified in Air Education and Training Command. The base is named in honor of Texas Senator John Morris Sheppard, a supporter of military preparations before World War II. The host unit at Sheppard is the 82d Training Wing (82 TRW), which provides specialized technical training and field training for officers, Airmen and civilians of all branches of the military, other DoD agencies and foreign nationals. The 80th Flying Training Wing (80 FTW), also at Sheppard, conducts the Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training (ENJJPT) program, a multi-nationally manned and managed flying training program chartered to produce combat pilots for both USAF and NATO. This internationally manned and managed flying training program is the only one in the world. As of March 2017, Brigadier General Ronald E. Jolly is the commander of the 82d Training Wing and he concurrently serves as the installation commander of Sheppard AFB. Colonel Russell Driggers is the commander of the 80th Flying Training Wing. Sheppard AFB shares one runway with Wichita Falls Municipal Airport under a joint civil-military arrangement. History Sheppard Air Force Base is named in honor of Senator John Morris Sheppard of Texas (1875‚Äì1941), chairman of the Senate Military Affairs Committee from 1933 until his death on 9 April 1941. Senator Sheppard helped lead the fight for military preparedness before the attack on Pearl Harbor. The base began as Sheppard Field on 300 acres (1.2 km¬≤) just south of Kell Field, named for the businessman Frank Kell. A Texas cattleman, oilman, and philanthropist, Joseph Sterling Bridwell, sold the land to the U.S. Army for one dollar. It was officially opened as a United States Army Air Corps training center on 17 October 1941, following the arrival of the first military members on 14 June. As the Army Air Corps became the Army Air Forces, facilities were completed sufficiently to allow the first class of 22 aviation mechanics to enter training that October; the class graduated 23 February 1942. During World War II, then-Sheppard Field conducted basic training, and it also trained glider mechanics, technical and flying training instructors and B-29 Superfortress flight engineers. In addition to the basic flying training, the base also provided advanced pilot training. Sheppard Field reached its peak strength of 46,340 people while serving as a separation center for troops being discharged following World War II from September through November 1945. Sheppard Field was deactivated 31 August 1946 and declared surplus to the War Department's needs. It was transferred to the jurisdiction of the United States Army Corps of Engineers 30 April 1947. Over the next two years the Texas National Guard used the base. =USAF Training Center= Emblem of the 3630th Pilot Training Wing (ATC) Control and accountability for Sheppard Field was transferred to the Department of the Air Force 1 August 1948 and was reactivated 15 August 1948 to supplement Lackland AFB, Texas, as a basic training center renamed as Sheppard AFB. Basic training was discontinued in June 1949, but was resumed from July 1950 to May 1952. Over the next three decades, three training schools were stationed at the base training students in aircraft maintenance, transportation, communication, civil engineering, aircrew life support and field training. The aircraft mechanics school was transferred to Sheppard from Keesler AFB, Mississippi in April 1949 to make room for expansion of electronic training at that base. The school was renamed the Department of Aircraft Maintenance Training within the 3750th Technical School. During the Korean War (1950‚Äì1953) several airmen from such places as Greece and Turkey were trained as mechanics. Sheppard AFB postcard from around 1953 Comptroller, transportation, and intelligence training moved to Sheppard from Lowry AFB, Colorado, in the fall of 1954. Communications, refrigeration, air conditioning, and power production operator and repairman training were transferred here from F.E. Warren AFB, Wyoming in 1959. Intelligence training returned to Lowry in February 1962. Training in certain missile systems began at Sheppard in 1957 and was conducted there through September 1985 when Titan II training operations were terminated following that weapon system's retirement. The 3950th Technical Training Wing was designated the Sheppard Technical Training Center 1 January 1959. It has had two subsequent name changes and is now the 82d Training Wing. Helicopter pilot training was transferred from Stead AFB, Nevada in October 1965, with H-19, H-43, Bell TH-1F, CH-3C and HH-3E helicopters used for training. Additional training in airborne firefighting was also conducted, given the role of the USAF HH-43 aircraft as a local rescue and aircraft firefighting asset at selected air force bases in the United States and at air bases overseas. The 3630th Flying Training Wing was activated in 1965, and it assumed the helicopter training program. It began providing undergraduate pilot training in the T-37 and Northrop T-38 Talon for the then-West German Air Force in August 1966. Helicopter training was discontinued in 1971 when the U.S. Army assumed responsibility for training Air Force helicopter pilots at Fort Rucker, Alabama. The 3630th Flying Training Wing also provided undergraduate pilot training for pilots of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force from 1971 to 1975. The Wing designation was changed to the 80th Flying Training Wing on 1 January 1973. The 80th Flying Training Wing began conducting the Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training Program in 1981. This one- of-a-kind program includes 13-NATO countries. They are: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. Approval to conduct the program was recently extended through the year 2005. The Air Force School of Health Care Sciences offered training in dentistry, medicine, nursing (to include flight nurse training), and health-services administration. The population of the base had declined to 3,825 in 1990. In February 1992, restructuring and downsizing of the Air Force caused a realignment and renumbering of units at Sheppard. Some of the training wings were redesignated as groups, and the technical training groups became squadrons. =Strategic Air Command= Between 1960 and 1966 the Strategic Air Command (SAC) had training units stationed at the base that conducted aerospace rescue schools and weather instruction. In addition, The 494th Bombardment Wing, a Strategic Air Command operational wing of B-52D Stratofortress bombers and KC-135A Stratotanker aircraft, previously designated as the 4245th Strategic Wing, was based at Sheppard from 1963 to 1966. In July 1969, Detachment 1, 2nd Bombardment Wing, with four B-52 aircraft, became a tenant organization at Sheppard and remained until 1975. These aircraft rotated as part of SAC's dispersal concept and utilized the SAC Alert Facility on the northwest end of the airfield. =BRAC 2005= The United States Department of Defense (DoD) proposed a major realignment of the base, as part of the Base Realignment and Closure, 2005 program announced on 13 May 2005. DoD recommended to relocating to Eglin AFB, Florida, front-line and instructor-qualified maintenance technicians and logistics support personnel to stand up the Air Force's portion of the F-35 Lightning II (Joint Strike Fighter) Initial Joint Training Site there. This recommendation would establish Eglin Air Force Base as the Initial Joint Training Site that would teach entry-level aviators and maintenance technicians how to safely operate and maintain the new F-35 Lightning II, also known as the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) aircraft. Assuming no economic recovery, this recommendation could result in a maximum potential reduction of 487 jobs (295 direct jobs and 192 indirect jobs) over 2006‚Äì2011 in the Wichita Falls, TX, Metropolitan Statistical Area (0.5 percent).Sheppard AFB, Texas at GlobalSecurity.org = Major commands to which assigned = *Army Air Forces Technical Training Command, 13 March 1942 ‚Äì 31 July 1943 *Army Air Forces Training Command, 31 July 1943 ‚Äì 1 July 1946 *Air Training Command, 1 July 1946 ‚Äì 31 August 1946, 1 August 1948 ‚Äì 1 July 1993 *Air Education and Training Command 1 July 1993‚Äìpresent = Major units assigned = *62d Base HQ and Air Base Sq, 4 August 1941 ‚Äì 1 May 1944 * 3706th AAF Base Unit, 1 May 1944 ‚Äì 30 September 1946 * 3706th AAF Base Unit, 15 August 1948 ‚Äì 28 August 1948 * 3750th Air Base Gp, 28 August 1948 ‚Äì 1 January 1973 * 80th Flying Training Wing, ‚Äì 1 January 1973‚Äìpresent Role and operations =82d Training Wing= 175pxThe host unit on Sheppard Air Force Base is the 82d Training Wing, whose mission makes it the most diversified training base within AETC. It is a non-flying wing that conducts all technical training at Sheppard. The 982d Training Group (982 TRG) provides instruction in a wide range of specialties at Sheppard and also at more than 60 Air Force installations worldwide. The 82d Mission Support Group (82 MSG) and the 82 Medical Group (82 MDG) support these organizations. Together with the 80th Flying Training Wing more than 7 million trained US and ally warriors have been trained. =80th Flying Training Wing= The 80th Flying Training Wing's mission is \\"To produce the world's finest NATO pilots with the skills and attitude to succeed in fighter aviation\\". It is home of the Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training (ENJJPT) Program. It is a uniquely manned multinational organization with a USAF wing commander and an Italian Air Force operations group commander in the top two leadership positions. Command and operations officers' positions in the flying training squadrons rotate among the participating nations, while the commander of the 80th Operations Support Squadron is always from the USAF. Officers from all 13 participating nations fill subordinate leadership positions throughout the wing. Nine nations-- Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, Spain and the United States‚Äîprovide instructor pilots based on their number of student pilots. Canada, Greece and Spain do not have student pilots in training, but do provide one instructor pilot. The current non-active signatory nations, the United Kingdom and Portugal, do not send student pilots nor do they provide instructor pilots, but retain the right to do so at any time. As an example of this totally integrated structure, an American student pilot may have a Belgian instructor pilot, a Dutch flight commander, a Turkish section commander, an Italian operations officer, and a German squadron commander.

It often combines fantasy with elements of horror or has a gloomy dark tone or a sense of horror and dread.Stableford, Brian, \\"Dark Fantasy\\", in The A to Z of Fantasy Literature,(p. 97), Scarecrow Press,Plymouth. 2005. Definition A strict definition for dark fantasy is difficult to pin down. Gertrude Barrows Bennett has been called \\"the woman who invented dark fantasy\\".\\"The Woman Who Invented Dark Fantasy\\" by Gary C. Hoppenstand from Nightmare and Other Tales of Dark Fantasy by Francis Stevens, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, page x. . Both Charles L. GrantThe Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders, Volume 1, edited by Gary Westfahl, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005. and Karl Edward Wagner are credited with having coined the term \\"dark fantasy\\"‚Äîalthough both authors were describing different styles of fiction. Brian Stableford argues \\"dark fantasy\\" can be usefully defined as subgenre of stories that attempt to \\"incorporate elements of horror fiction\\" into the standard formulae of fantasy stories. Stableford also suggests that supernatural horror set primarily in the real world is a form of \\"contemporary fantasy\\", whereas supernatural horror set partly or wholly in \\"secondary worlds\\" should be described as \\"dark fantasy\\". Additionally, other authors, critics, and publishers have adopted dark fantasy to describe various other works. However, these stories rarely share universal similarities beyond supernatural occurrences and a dark, often brooding, tone. As a result, dark fantasy cannot be solidly connected to a defining set of tropes. The term itself may refer collectively to tales that are either horror-based or fantasy-based. Some writers also use \\"dark fantasy\\" (or \\"Gothic fantasy\\") as an alternative description to \\"horror\\", because they feel the latter term is too lurid or vivid.Stableford, Brian, \\"Horror\\", in The A to Z of Fantasy Literature,(p. 204), Scarecrow Press, Plymouth. 2005. Concept and history Charles L. Grant is often cited as having coined the term \\"dark fantasy\\". Grant defined his brand of dark fantasy as \\"a type of horror story in which humanity is threatened by forces beyond human understanding\\". He often used dark fantasy as an alternative to horror, as horror was increasingly associated with more visceral works. Dark fantasy is sometimes also used to describe stories told from a monster's point of view, or that present a more sympathetic view of supernatural beings usually associated with horror. Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's Saint-Germain, and Neil Gaiman's The Sandman are early examples of this style of dark fantasy. This is in contrast to the traditional horror model, which focuses more on the victims and survivors. In a more general sense, dark fantasy is occasionally used as a synonym for supernatural horror, to distinguish horror stories that contain elements of the supernatural from those that do not. For example, a story about a werewolf or vampire could be described as dark fantasy, while a story about a serial killer would simply be horror. Stableford suggests that the type of horror conveyed by fantasy stories such as William Beckford's Vathek and Edgar Allan Poe's The Masque of the Red Death \\"is more aesthetic than visceral or existential\\", and that such stories should be considered \\"dark fantasies\\" rather than the \\"supernaturalized thrillers\\" of conventional horror fiction. Karl Edward Wagner is often credited for creating the term \\"dark fantasy\\" when used in a more fantasy-based context. Wagner used it to describe his fiction about the Gothic warrior Kane. Since then, \\"dark fantasy\\" has sometimes been applied to sword and sorcery and high fantasy fiction that features anti-heroic or morally ambiguous protagonists. Another good example under this definition of dark fantasy is Michael Moorcock's saga of the albino swordsman Elric. The fantasy work of H. P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith and their emulators have been specified as \\"dark fantasy\\", since the imaginary worlds they depicted contain many horror elements. This horror element is prevalent in some sub-genres of anime. Dark fantasy is occasionally used to describe fantasy works by authors whom the public primarily associates with the horror genre.

Summary Russell gives an account of his philosophical development. He describes his Hegelian period and includes hitherto unpublished notes for a Hegelian philosophy of science. He deals next with the two-fold revolution involved with his abandonment of idealism and adoption of a mathematical logic founded upon that of Giuseppe Peano. After two chapters on Principia Mathematica (1910-1913), he passes to the problems of perception as dealt with in Our Knowledge of the External World (1914). In a chapter on ‚ÄòThe Impact of Wittgenstein‚Äô, Russell examines what he now thinks must be accepted and what rejected in that philosopher's work. He notes the changes from earlier theories required by the adoption of William James's view that sensation is not essentially relational and is not per se a form of knowledge. In an explanatory chapter, he endeavours to remove misconceptions of and objections to his theories as to the relation of perception to scientific knowledge. Russell concludes with a reprint of some articles on modern Oxford philosophy.

Code, sec. 5000 et seq.) regulates involuntary civil commitment to a mental health institution in the state of California. The act set the precedent for modern mental health commitment procedures in the United States. The bipartisan bill was co- authored by California State Assemblyman Frank D. Lanterman (R) and California State Senators Nicholas C. Petris (D) and Alan Short (D), and signed into law in 1967 by Governor Ronald Reagan. The Act went into full effect on July 1, 1972. It cited seven articles of intent: *To end the inappropriate, indefinite, and involuntary commitment of mentally disordered persons, people with developmental disabilities, and persons impaired by chronic alcoholism, and to eliminate legal disabilities; *To provide prompt evaluation and treatment of persons with serious mental disorders or impaired by chronic alcoholism; *To guarantee and protect public safety; *To safeguard individual rights through judicial review; *To provide individualized treatment, supervision, and placement services by a conservatorship program for gravely disabled persons; *To encourage the full use of all existing agencies, professional personnel and public funds to accomplish these objectives and to prevent duplication of services and unnecessary expenditures; *To protect mentally disordered persons and developmentally disabled persons from criminal acts. The Act in effect ended all hospital commitments by the judiciary system, except in the case of criminal sentencing, e.g., convicted sexual offenders, and those who were \\"gravely disabled\\", defined as unable to obtain food, clothing, or housing. It did not, however, impede the right of voluntary commitments. It expanded the evaluative power of psychiatrists and created provisions and criteria for holds. Prior to 1987 it was assumed that the Act allowed involuntary treatment for those who were detained under an initial three-day hold (for evaluation and treatment) and a subsequent fourteen-day hospitalization (for those people declared after the three-day hold to be dangerous to themselves or others or gravely disabled). However, in the 1987 case of Riese v. St. Mary‚Äôs Hospital and Medical Center, the California Court of Appeal declared that these people had the right to exercise informed consent regarding the use of antipsychotic drugs, except in an emergency, and if they rejected medication \\"a judicial determination of their incapacity to make treatment decisions\\" was required before they could be involuntarily treated. This case was a class action suit brought in the name of person Eleanor Riese by the California ACLU. Eleanor Riese's story is depicted in the movie 55 Steps.  LPS evaluation, detention and Conservatorship process  Under the LPS Act, individuals can be detained into a locked psychiatric facility in the following process. = 5150 Hold = Under California Welfare and Institutions Code (WIC) 5150, an individual can be placed (involuntary) to a locked psychiatric facility, for an evaluation for up to 72 hours. Any peace officer or specific individuals authorized by a county government may place the hold. Three criteria apply ‚Äì the individual is assessed to be: a danger to themselves, a danger to others, or \\"gravely disabled\\". Per WIC 5008, grave disability is defined as an individual's lack of ability, due to their mental illness, to provide for their food, clothing, or shelter. In the case of children, it is the inability to use food, clothing, or shelter even if it is supplied. As the individual in question is likely in a state of distress (highly symptomatic), and likely also causing a disturbance in the community, it is not uncommon for police to be the party who places them on the 5150 hold and then takes the individual to the hospital for further assessment. Over the next 72 hours, the hospital / psychiatrist must determine the individuals need for further locked psychiatric detainment. If the individual's condition clears up and they are no longer a danger to others or themselves or gravely disabled, they are released from the hospital. If, however, they remain a danger to others or themselves or continue to be gravely disabled, the hospital/psychiatrist may then request a 5250 hold to thereby keep the individual in the hospital beyond the 72-hour limit of the 5150 hold.  In popular culture  Largely because the production of many American movies and television programs are based in California, usage of the term \\"5150\\" has spread beyond its original location and user population. An album of the same name by the California hard rock band Van Halen was named directly for the code section, and several derivative uses followed. = 5250 Hold = If, after a 72-hour hold, an individual is deemed to still be a danger to others or themselves, or is gravely disabled, WIC 5250 permits for an individual to be involuntarily held (in a locked psychiatric hospital) for another 14 days. Unlike a 5150 hold a 5250 hold requires that the individual served receive a court hearing within 4 days of being served to ascertain the validity of the hold. Court hearings are often held in hospital. Individuals are provided an attorney and a county court officer reviews the evidence for the hold presented by the hospital, hears the argument of the client and their attorney, and decides whether or not to uphold the 5250. Just as with the 5150 hold, during the 5250 hold, the individual is continually being assessed by psychiatric staff. Again, if the individual is (at any time) deemed to be no longer a danger or gravely disabled, they are then released from the hospital. According to section 5257 of the act, the individual must be released after 14 days, unless, they agree to further treatment on a voluntary basis; they are certified for an additional 14 days of intensive treatment; they are certified for an additional 30 days of intensive treatment; they are the subject of a conservatorship (commonly known as a Temporary LPS Conservatorship) petition or they are the subject of a petition for post-certification treatment of a dangerous person. = 5350 hold / Temporary LPS Conservatorship = A 5350 hold, otherwise known as a Temporary LPS Conservatorship (under W&I; Code ¬ß 5352.1), is initiated at the end of 5250 / 14-day hold. Such is initiated by the individual's treating psychiatrist and co-signed by the medical director of the psychiatric facility to the Public Guardian Office in the individuals county of residence. The basis for the LPS Temporary Conservatorship is that the individual (due to their mental illness, even after ~17 days of involuntary psychiatric detention) remains \\"gravely disabled.\\" There are 58 counties in California, each with its own independent Public Guardian Offices. Unlike other conservatorship processes in California (Probate / Older adult or Limited / Developmentally disabled) - a LPS Conservatorship cannot be initiated by the public at large. Codified in the WIC - the individual must go through the 5150 - 5250 process and from there the county Public Guardian is the only authorized party to be able to request for a LPS Conservatorship. The legislative intent for such was that prior to the LPS act, it was felt individuals were often psychiatrically committed for subjective (if not outright punitive) reasons. To combat such potential abuses, the county Public Guardian, seen as an impartial, third party was designated as sole party. Once the individual is on a LPS Temporary Conservatorship, they are no longer legally on a \\"hold,\\" but now, legal consent to treat and continue to detain the individual (now known as the \\"conservatee\\") lies with the Public Guardian office. A Temporary LPS Conservatorship can last a maximum of 180 days. As the county superior court has direct oversight of LPS Conservatorship matters, typically the conservatee is afforded court hearings (for status) every 30 days. Unlike other conservatorship hearing, LPS Conservatorship matters / records are NOT open to the public. With 58 counties, the Public Guardian Office and Superior Courts may interpret and practice differing ways legal administration of LPS Conservatorship. In general, all conservatees are appointed legal counsel (typically the public defender office) and during the course of their LPS Conservatorship they can ask for a series of writs and hearing or even a full jury trial to contest their detention and overall LPS Conservatorship. It is not uncommon for a psychiatrist to conversely declare the conservatee is no longer gravely disabled. During the course of the LPS Conservatorship if the conservatee stabilizes and can thereby be discharged to the community, a psychiatrist can request that the LPS Conservatorship be dismissed (for lack of legal support). As of the Public Guardian office, during a Temporary LPS Conservatorship, it is their general duty to ensure the conservatee is properly cared for and that all reason efforts are ruled out, that the conservatee continues to require locked psychiatric care. During the LPS Temporary Conservatorship, it is indeed the Public Guardian, not the conservatee, who consents to treatment and placement. A common way to understand such is parent to child - in that a minor child cannot consent to medical care. The same goes for the conservatee - in that the Public Guardian consents to their psychiatric treatment and placement. If during the LPS Temporary Conservatorship, the Public Guardian feels the conservatee will (for the foreseeable future) need to remain in locked psychiatric care - they can then seek to have the LPS Conservatorship changed from Temporary to General (also referred to a \\"Permanent\\" but this can be a misnomer as it is not permanent / indefinite). With the appointment of a Permanent LPS Conservatorship (approved by the court) - the conservatee is now under the auspice / authority of the LPS Conservator for exactly 1 year. It is with a Permanent LPS Conservatorship that then the public (family / friends) can now become involved. If family / friends request and with court approval, (unlike the Temporary LPS Conservatorship) they can be appointed as the General / Permanent LPS Conservator for the conservatee. The 1-year duration for a General / Permanent LPS Conservatorship was again codified into the LPS act as to combat past abuses. This ensures that no individual is indefinitely detained in locked psychiatric care and that every year justification to continue the LPS Conservatorship is brought before the court. This too is another difference between LPS conservatorship and Probate or Limited Conservatorship - both which have no implicit expiration date. Indeed, if the LPS Conservator does not submit a request (to the court) to renew the LPS Conservatorship, by default it expires. Renewal of the LPS Conservatorship requires that 2 MD / Psychiatrists / Psychologist formally declare that the LPS Conservatorship still remains appropriate. During the course of a General / Permanent LPS Conservatorship, the conservatee is most likely held in long- term, locked psychiatric care. Although California State Hospital still exist and are in use, a most LPS Conservatees are placed at local (county level) locked psychiatric hospitals. Nothing though in the LPS act precludes a conservatee being under a LPS Conservatorship and living in the community. No time frame is quantified in the LPS act (as matters vary from conservatee to conservatee), but it is generally practiced (amongst the 58 county Public Guardian Offices) that if a conservatee has been living in the community for an extended period of time ‚Äì the legal justification to thereby continue the LPS equally diminishes and from there they are bound to dismiss the LPS Conservatorship. As such there is no common duration for a LPS Conservatorship. It can indeed vary from a conservatee being under a single LPS conservatorship continuously for 30 years to others undergoing multiple Temporary LPS Conservatorship over the course of a single year. A common growing theme, especially among family of mentally ill individuals is the LPS act favors the individual's civil rights too much when weighed against their self-evident need for treatment. It can be very difficult for their family member to be placed on a 5150 hold or on a LPS Conservatorship. Again per the LPS act - \\"grave disability\\" is primarily codified with food, clothing, or shelter. Thus an individual may indeed be highly symptomatic - displaying paranoia, delusions, mania, etc. but if they can present a cogent plan to care for their food, clothing, or shelter - they may very well be released from psychiatric care. Many have argued that revisions should be made to thereby make it easier for individuals to be detained, lessening the restrictions made under the LPS act. In 2018 SB 1045 was signed into CA Law - establishing a pilot program in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego counties if the counties approve, creating a conservatorship for a person who is unable to care for their own health and well-being due to serious mental illness and substance use disorder. SB 1045 would provide the least restrictive and most clinically appropriate alternative needed for the protection of the person who is incapable of caring for the person's own health.

Symptoms may include shoulder pain, which is often worse with movement, or weakness. This may limit people‚Äôs ability to brush their hair or put on clothing. Clicking may also occur with movement of the arm. Tears may occur as the result of a sudden force or gradually over time. Risk factors include certain repetitive activities, smoking, and a family history of the condition. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, examination, and medical imaging. The rotator cuff is made up of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. The supraspinatus is the most commonly affected. Treatment may include pain medication such as NSAIDs and specific exercises. It is recommended that people who are unable to raise their arm above 90 degrees after 2 weeks should be further assessed. In severe cases surgery may be tried, however benefits of surgery are unclear as of 2019. Rotator cuff tears are common. Those over the age of 40 are most often affected. The condition has been described since at least the early 1800s. Signs and symptoms Location of the pain Many rotator cuff tears have no symptoms. Both partial and full thickness tears have been found on post mortem and MRI studies in those without any history of shoulder pain or symptoms. However, the most common presentation is shoulder pain or discomfort. This may occur with activity, particularly shoulder activity above the horizontal position, but may also be present at rest in bed. Pain-restricted movement above the horizontal position may be present, as well as weakness with shoulder flexion and abduction. Abnormal mobility or function of the scapula (scapular dyskinesia) may be present and is related to lower functional scores; it unclear whether scapular dyskinesia is a cause, effect or compensation for rotator cuff pathology. Risk factors Claims of rotator cuff tears by industry Epidemiological studies strongly support a relationship between age and cuff tear prevalence. Those most prone to failed rotator cuff syndrome are people 65 years of age or older; and those with large, sustained tears. Smokers, diabetes sufferers, individuals with muscle atrophy and/or fatty infiltration, and those who do not follow postoperative- care recommendations also are at greater risk. In a recent study the frequency of such tears increased from 13% in the youngest group (aged 50‚Äì59 y) to 20% (aged 60‚Äì69 y), 31% (aged 70‚Äì79 y), and 51% in the oldest group (aged 80‚Äì89 y). This high rate of tear prevalence in asymptomatic individuals suggests that rotator cuff tears could be considered a \\"normal\\" process of aging rather than a result of an apparent pathological process. They are known to increase in frequency with age and the most common cause is age-related degeneration and, less frequently, sports injuries or trauma. Some risk factors such as increased age and height cannot be changed. Increased body mass index is also associated with tearing. Recurrent lifting and overhead motions are at risk for rotator cuff injury as well. This includes jobs that involve repetitive overhead work, such as carpenters, painters, custodians, and servers. People who play sports that involve overhead motions, such as swimming, water polo, volleyball, baseball, tennis, and American football quarterbacks, are at a greater risk of experiencing a rotator cuff tear. Striking-based combat sports, such as boxing, also account for severe rotator cuff injuries of competitors,\\"Manual of Sports Medicine\\", p. 548. typically when their punches miss the target, or overusing the shoulder by throwing excessively large amounts of punches.Joseph J. Estwanik, \\"Injuries to the Extremities, Trunk, and Head\\" in the Boxing and Medicine, Robert C. Cantu (ed.,) 1995, p. 83. Certain track-and-field activities, such as shot put, javelin throw are also of considerable risk, especially when performing outdoors under cold weather conditions or neglecting warming-up procedures, for proper warm-up of the throwing and/or swinging arm can help reduce the stress on the musculature of the shoulder girdle.Ronald P. Pfeiffer, Brent C. Mangus, \\"Concepts of Athletic Training\\", 2008, p. 161. Generally, the rates of rotator cuff injuries increases with age while corticosteroid injections around the tendons increases the risk of tendon tear and delay tendon healing. Mechanisms of injury The shoulder joint is made up of three bones: the shoulder blade (scapula), the collarbone (clavicle) and the upper arm bone (humerus). The shoulder is a complex mechanism involving bones, ligaments, joints, muscles, and tendons. The two main causes are acute injury or chronic and cumulative degeneration of the shoulder joint. Mechanisms can be extrinsic, intrinsic or a combination of both. The cuff is responsible for stabilizing the glenohumeral joint to allow abduction and rotation of the humerus. When trauma occurs, these functions can be compromised. Because individuals are dependent on the shoulder for many activities, overuse can lead to tears, with the vast majority being in the supraspinatus tendon. The role of the supraspinatus is to resist downward motion, both while the shoulder is relaxed and carrying weight.Saladin, Kenneth S. \\"Anatomy & Physiology.\\" McGraw Hill, n.d. Web. 4 October 2016. Supraspinatus tears usually occurs at its insertion on the humeral head at the greater tubercle. Though the supraspinatus is the most commonly injured tendon in the rotator cuff, the other three can also be injured at the same time. =Acute tears= The amount of stress needed to acutely tear a rotator cuff tendon will depend on the underlying condition of the tendon. If healthy, the stress needed will be high, such as with a fall on the outstretched arm. This stress may occur coincidentally with other injuries such as a dislocation of the shoulder or separation of the acromioclavicular joint. In the case of a tendon with pre-existing degeneration, the force may be more modest, such as with a sudden lift, particularly with the arm above the horizontal position. The type of loading involved with injury is usually eccentric, such as when two people are carrying a load and one lets go, forcing the other to maintain force while the muscle elongates. =Chronic tears= Chronic tears are indicative of extended use in conjunction with other factors such as poor biomechanics or muscular imbalance. Ultimately, most are the result of wear that occurs slowly over time as a natural part of aging. They are more common in the dominant arm, but a tear in one shoulder signals an increased risk of a tear in the opposing shoulder. Several factors contribute to degenerative, or chronic, rotator cuff tears of which repetitive stress is the most significant. This stress consists of repeating the same shoulder motions frequently, such as overhead throwing, rowing, and weightlifting. Many jobs that require frequent shoulder movement such as lifting and overhead movements also contribute. In older populations impairment of blood supply can also be an issue. With age, circulation to the rotator cuff tendons decreases, impairing natural ability to repair, increasing risk for tear. Another potential contributing cause is impingement syndrome, the most common non-sports related injury and which occurs when the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles become irritated and inflamed while passing through the subacromial space beneath the acromion. This relatively small space becomes even smaller when the arm is raised in a forward or upward position. Repetitive impingement can inflame the tendons and bursa, resulting in the syndrome. =Extrinsic factors= A flattened or hooked acromion can predispose a shoulder to rotator cuff impingement and tearing. Well-documented anatomic factors include the morphologic characteristics of the acromion, a bony projection from the scapula that curves over the shoulder joint. Hooked, curved, and laterally sloping acromia are strongly associated with cuff tears and may cause damage through direct traction on the tendon. Conversely, flat acromia may have an insignificant involvement in cuff disease and consequently may be best treated conservatively. The development of these different acromial shapes is likely both genetic and acquired. In the latter case, there can be a progression from flat to curved or hooked with increasing age. Repetitive mechanical activities such as sports and exercise may contribute to flattening and hooking of the acromion. Cricket bowling, swimming, tennis, baseball, and kayaking are often implicated. Progression to a hooked acromion could be an adaptation to an already damaged, poorly balanced rotator cuff with resultant stress on the coracoacromial arch. Other anatomical factors include an os acromiale and acromial spurs. Environmental factors include age, shoulder overuse, smoking, and medical conditions that affect circulation or impair the inflammatory and healing response, such as diabetes mellitus. =Intrinsic factors= Intrinsic factors refer to injury mechanisms that occur within the rotator cuff itself. The principal is a degenerative- microtrauma model, which supposes that age-related tendon damage compounded by chronic microtrauma results in partial tendon tears that then develop into full rotator cuff tears. As a result of repetitive microtrauma in the setting of a degenerative rotator cuff tendon, inflammatory mediators alter the local environment, and oxidative stress induces tenocyte apoptosis causing further rotator cuff tendon degeneration. A neural theory also exists that suggests neural overstimulation leads to the recruitment of inflammatory cells and may also contribute to tendon degeneration. =Surgical considerations= Depending upon the diagnosis, several treatment alternatives are available. They include revision repair, non-anatomic repair, tendon transfer and arthroplasty. When possible, surgeons make tension-free repairs in which they use grafted tissues rather than stitching to reconnect tendon segments. This can result in a complete repair. Other options are a partial repair, and reconstruction involving a bridge of biologic or synthetic substances. Partial repairs typically are performed on retracted cuff tears. Tendon transfers are prescribed for young, active cuff-tear individual who experience weakness and decreased range of motion, but little pain. The technique is not considered appropriate for older people, or those with pre-operative stiffness or nerve injuries. People diagnosed with glenohumeral arthritis and rotator cuff anthropathy have the alternative of total shoulder arthroplasty, if the cuff is largely intact or repairable. If the cuff is incompetent then a reverse shoulder arthroplasty is available and, although not as robust a prosthesis, does not require an intact cuff to maintain a stable joint. Diagnosis A complete tear of the supraspinatus resulting in a shift upwards of the head of the humerus Diagnosis is based upon physical assessment and history, including description of previous activities and acute or chronic symptoms. A systematic, physical examination of the shoulder comprises inspection, palpation, range of motion, provocative tests to reproduce the symptoms, neurological examination, and strength testing. The shoulder should also be examined for tenderness and deformity. Since pain arising from the neck is frequently 'referred' to the shoulder, the examination should include an assessment of the cervical spine looking for evidence suggestive of a pinched nerve, osteoarthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis. Neer promoted the concept of three stages of rotator cuff disease. Stage I, according to Neer, occurred in those younger than 25 years and involved edema and hemorrhage of the tendon and bursa. Stage II involved tendinitis and fibrosis of the rotator cuff in 25- to 40-year-olds. Stage III involved tearing of the rotator cuff (partial or full thickness) and occurred in those older than 40 years. For surgical purposes, tears are also described by location, size or area, and depth. Further subclasses include the acromiohumeral distance, acromial shape, fatty infiltration or degeneration of muscles, muscle atrophy, tendon retraction, vascular proliferation, chondroid metaplasia, and calcification. Again, in surgical planning, age-related degeneration of thinning and disorientation of the collagen fibers, myxoid degeneration, and hyaline degeneration are considered. Diagnostic modalities, dependent on circumstances, include X-ray, MRI, MR arthrography, double-contrast arthrography, and ultrasound. Although MR arthrography is currently considered the gold standard, ultrasound may be most cost-effective.Arend CF. Ultrasound of the Shoulder. Master Medical Books, 2013. Free chapter on ultrasound evaluation of rotator cuff disorders available at ShoulderUS.com Usually, a tear will be undetected by X-ray, although bone spurs, which can impinge upon the rotator cuff tendons, may be visible. Such spurs suggest chronic severe rotator cuff disease. Double- contrast arthrography involves injecting contrast dye into the shoulder joint to detect leakage out of the injured rotator cuff and its value is influenced by the experience of the operator. The most common diagnostic tool is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which can sometimes indicate the size of the tear, as well as its location within the tendon. Furthermore, MRI enables the detection or exclusion of complete rotator cuff tears with reasonable accuracy and is also suitable to diagnose other pathologies of the shoulder joint. The logical use of diagnostic tests is an important component of effective clinical practice. Clinical judgement, rather than over reliance on MRI or any other modality, is strongly advised in determining the cause of shoulder pain, or planning its treatment, since rotator cuff tears are also found in some without pain or symptoms. The role of X-ray, MRI, and ultrasound, is adjunctive to clinical assessment and serves to confirm a diagnosis provisionally made by a thorough history and physical examination. Over- reliance on imaging may lead to overtreatment or distract from the true dysfunction causing symptoms. =Symptoms= Symptoms may occur immediately after trauma (acute) or develop over time (chronic). Acute injury is less frequent than chronic disease, but may follow bouts of forcefully raising the arm against resistance, as occurs in weightlifting, for example. In addition, falling forcefully on the shoulder can cause acute symptoms. These traumatic tears predominantly affect the supraspinatus tendon or the rotator interval and symptoms include severe pain that radiates through the arm, and limited range of motion, specifically during abduction of the shoulder. Chronic tears occur among individuals who constantly participate in overhead activities, such as pitching or swimming, but can also develop from shoulder tendinitis or rotator cuff disease. Symptoms arising from chronic tears include sporadic worsening of pain, debilitation, and atrophy of the muscles, noticeable pain during rest, crackling sensations (crepitus) when moving the shoulder, and inability to move or lift the arm sufficiently, especially during abduction and flexion motions. Pain in the anterolateral aspect of the shoulder is not specific to the shoulder, and may arise from, and be referred from, the neck, heart or gut. Symptoms will often include pain or ache over the front and outer aspect of the shoulder, pain aggravated by leaning on the elbow and pushing upwards on the shoulder (such as leaning on the armrest of a reclining chair), intolerance of overhead activity, pain at night when lying directly on the affected shoulder, pain when reaching forward (e.g. unable to lift a gallon of milk from the refrigerator). Weakness may be reported, but is often masked by pain and is usually found only through examination. With longer- standing pain, the shoulder is favored and gradually loss of motion and weakness may develop, which, due to pain and guarding, are often unrecognized and only brought to attention during the physical exam. Primary shoulder problems may cause pain over the deltoid muscle intensified by abduction against resistance ‚Äì the impingement sign. This signifies pain arising from the rotator cuff, but cannot distinguish between inflammation, strain, or tear. Individuals may report that they are unable to reach upwards to brush their hair or to lift a food can from an overhead shelf. =Signs= No single physical examination test distinguishes reliably between bursitis, partial- thickness, and full-thickness tears. The most useful single test for infraspinatous tendon tears is the drop sign (the examiner lifts the arm straight out from the body with the palm up, the person then needs to hold it there for 10 seconds) and the external rotation lag sign (with the arm by the side and the elbow bent to 90 degrees the person tries to rotate outwards against resistance). A combination of tests seems to provide the most accurate diagnosis. For impingement, these tests include the Hawkins-Kennedy impingement sign in which an examiner medially rotates the injured individual's flexed arm, forcing the supraspinatus tendon against the coracoacromial ligament and so producing pain if the test is positive a positive painful arc sign, and weakness in external rotation with the arm at the side. For the diagnosis of full-thickness rotator cuff tear, the best combination appears to include once more the painful arc and weakness in external rotation, and in addition, the drop arm sign. This test is also known as Codman's test. The arm is raised to the side to 90¬∞ by the examiner. The injured individual then attempts to look to lower the arm back to neutral, palm down. If the arm drops suddenly or pain is experienced, the test is considered positive. =MRI= MRI of normal shoulder intratendinous signal MRI of rotator cuff full-thickness tear Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound are comparable in efficacy and helpful in diagnosis although both have a false positive rate of 15 - 20%. MRI can reliably detect most full- thickness tears although very small pinpoint tears may be missed. In such situations, an MRI combined with an injection of contrast material, an MR- arthrogram, may help to confirm the diagnosis. It should be realized that a normal MRI cannot fully rule out a small tear (a false negative) while partial-thickness tears are not as reliably detected. While MRI is sensitive in identifying tendon degeneration (tendinopathy), it may not reliably distinguish between a degenerative tendon and a partially torn tendon. Again, magnetic resonance arthrography can improve the differentiation. An overall sensitivity of 91% (9% false negative rate) has been reported indicating that magnetic resonance arthrography is reliable in the detection of partial- thickness rotator cuff tears. However, its routine use is not advised, since it involves entering the joint with a needle with potential risk of infection. Consequently, the test is reserved for cases in which the diagnosis remains unclear. =Ultrasound= Musculoskeletal ultrasound has been advocated by experienced practitioners, avoiding the radiation of X-ray and the expense of MRI while demonstrating comparable accuracy to MRI for identifying and measuring the size of full-thickness and partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. This modality can also reveal the presence of other conditions that may mimic rotator cuff tear at clinical examination, including tendinosis, calcific tendinitis, subacromial subdeltoid bursitis, greater tuberosity fracture, and adhesive capsulitis. However, MRI provides more information about adjacent structures in the shoulder such as the capsule, glenoid labrum muscles and bone and these factors should be considered in each case when selecting the appropriate study. =Xray= Projectional radiograph of normal glenohumeral position. High-riding humeral head in a rotator cuff tear. X-ray projectional radiography cannot directly reveal tears of the rotator cuff, a 'soft tissue', and consequently, normal X-rays cannot exclude a damaged cuff. However, indirect evidence of pathology may be seen in instances where one or more of the tendons have undergone degenerative calcification (calcific tendinitis). The humeral head may migrate upwards (high-riding humeral head) secondary to tears of the infraspinatus, or combined tears of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The migration can be measured by the distance between: *A line crossing the center of a line between the superior and inferior rims of the glenoid articular surface (blue in image). *The center of a \\"best-fit\\" circle positioned over the humeral articular surface (green in image) Normally, the former is positioned inferiorly to the latter, and a reversal is therefore indicating a rotator cuff tear. Prolonged contact between a high-riding humeral head and the acromion above it, may lead to X-rays findings of wear on the humeral head and acromion and secondary degenerative arthritis of the glenohumeral joint (the ball and socket joint of the shoulder), called cuff arthropathy, may follow. Incidental X-ray findings of bone spurs at the adjacent acromioclavicular joint may show a bone spur growing from the outer edge of the clavicle downwards towards the rotator cuff. Spurs may also be seen on the underside of the acromion, once thought to cause direct fraying of the rotator cuff from contact friction, a concept currently regarded as controversial. =In-office testing= As part of clinical decision-making, a simple, minimally invasive, in-office procedure may be performed, the rotator cuff impingement test. A small amount of a local anesthetic and an injectable corticosteroid are injected into the subacromial space to block pain and to provide anti-inflammatory relief. If pain disappears and shoulder function remains good, no further testing is pursued. The test helps to confirm that the pain arises from the shoulder primarily rather than referred from the neck, heart, or gut. If pain is relieved, the test is considered positive for rotator-cuff impingement, of which tendinitis and bursitis are major causes. However, partial rotator-cuff tears may also demonstrate good pain relief, so a positive response cannot rule out a partial rotator-cuff tear. However, with demonstration of good, pain-free function, treatment will not change, so the test is useful in helping to avoid overtesting or unnecessary surgery. =Classification= Tears of the rotator cuff tendon are described as partial or full thickness, and full thickness with complete detachment of the tendons from bone. * Partial-thickness tears often appear as fraying of an intact tendon. * Full-thickness tears are \\"through-and-through\\". These tears can be small pinpoint, larger buttonhole, or involve the majority of the tendon where it still remains substantially attached to the humeral head and thus maintains function. * Full-thickness tears may also involve complete detachment of the tendon(s) from the humeral head and may result in significantly impaired shoulder motion and function. Shoulder pain is variable and may not be proportional to the size of the tear. Tears are also sometimes classified based on the trauma that caused the injury: *Acute, as a result of a sudden, powerful movement which might include falling onto an outstretched hand at speed, making a sudden thrust with a paddle in kayaking, or following a powerful pitch/throw *Subacute, arising in similar situations but occurring in one of the five layers of the shoulder anatomy *Chronic, developing over time, and usually occurring at or near the tendon (as a result of the tendon rubbing against the overlying bone), and usually associated with an impingement syndrome Prevention Long-term overuse/abuse of the shoulder joint is generally thought to limit range of motion and productivity due to daily wear and tear of the muscles, and many public web sites offer preventive advice. (See external links) The recommendations usually include: * regular shoulder exercises to maintain strength and flexibility * using proper form when lifting or moving heavy weights * resting the shoulder when experiencing pain * application of cold packs and heat pads to a painful, inflamed shoulder * strengthening program to include the back and shoulder girdle muscles as well as the chest, shoulder and upper arm * adequate rest periods in occupations that require repetitive lifting and reaching =Size= According to a study which measured tendon length against the size of the injured rotator cuff, researchers learned that as rotator cuff tendons decrease in length, the average rotator cuff tear severity is proportionally decreased, as well. This shows that larger individuals are more likely to suffer from a severe rotator cuff tear if they do not \\"tighten the shoulder muscles around the joint\\". =Position= Another study observed 12 different positions of movements and their relative correlation with injuries occurred during those movements. The evidence shows that putting the arm in a neutral position relieves tension on all ligaments and tendons. =Stretching= One article observed the influence of stretching techniques on preventive methods of shoulder injuries. Increased velocity of exercise increases injury, but beginning a fast-movement exercise with a slow stretch may cause muscle/tendon attachment to become more resistant to tearing. =Muscle groups= When exercising, exercising the shoulder as a whole and not one or two muscle groups is also found to be imperative. When the shoulder muscle is exercised in all directions, such as external rotation, flexion, and extension, or vertical abduction, it is less likely to suffer from a tear of the tendon. Treatment A rotator cuff tear can be treated operatively or non-operatively. No benefit is seen from early rather than delayed surgery, and many with partial tears and some with complete tears will respond to nonoperative management. Consequently, an individual may begin with nonsurgical management. However, early surgical treatment may be considered in significant (>1 cm ‚Äì 1.5 cm) acute tears, or in young individuals with full- thickness tears who have a significant risk for the development of irreparable rotator cuff damage. Rotator-cuff surgery appears to result in similar benefits as nonoperative management. As a conservative approach has less complications and is less expensive it is recommended as initial treatment. =Non-operative treatment= Those with pain but reasonably maintained function are suitable for nonoperative management. This includes medications that provide pain relief such as anti-inflammatory agents, topical pain relievers such as cold packs, and if warranted, subacromial corticosteroid or local anesthetic injection. Topical glyceryl trinitrate appears effective at relieving acute symptoms however, headaches were reported as a side effect. A sling may be offered for short-term comfort, with the understanding that undesirable shoulder stiffness can develop with prolonged immobilization. Early physical therapy may afford pain relief with modalities (e.g. iontophoresis) and help to maintain motion. Ultrasound treatment is not efficacious. As pain decreases, strength deficiencies and biomechanical errors can be corrected. A conservative physical therapy program begins with preliminary rest and restriction from engaging in activities which gave rise to symptoms. Normally, inflammation can usually be controlled within one to two weeks, using a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and subacromial steroid injections to decrease inflammation, to the point that pain has been significantly decreased to make stretching tolerable. After this short period, rapid stiffening and an increase in pain can result if sufficient stretching has not been implemented. A gentle, passive range-of-motion program should be started to help prevent stiffness and maintain range of motion during this resting period. Exercises, for the anterior, inferior, and posterior shoulder, should be part of this program. Codman exercises (giant, pudding-stirring), to \\"permit the patient to abduct the arm by gravity, the supraspinatus remains relaxed, and no fulcrum is required\\" are widely used. The use of NSAIDs, hot and cold packs, and physical therapy modalities, such as ultrasound, phonophoresis, or iontophoresis, can be instituted during this stretching period, if effective. Corticosteroid injections are recommended two to three months apart with a maximum of three injections. Multiple injections (four or more) have been shown to compromise the results of rotator cuff surgery which result in weakening of the tendon. However, before any rotator cuff strengthening can be started, the shoulder must have a full range of motion. After a full, painless range of motion is achieved, an individual may advance to a gentle strengthening program. Rockwood coined the term orthotherapy to describe this program which is aimed at creating an exercise regimen that initially gently improves motion, then gradually improves strength in the shoulder girdle. This program involves a home therapy kit which includes elastic bands of six different colors and strengths, a pulley set, and a three-piece, one-meter-long stick. The program is individually customized. Participants are asked to use their exercise program whether at home, work, or traveling. =Surgery= Rotator cuff tear and surgical repair Benefits of surgery are unclear as of 2019. Several instances when surgery may be recommended include: * 20 to 30-year-old active person with an acute tear and severe functional deficit from a specific event * 30 to 50-year-old person with an acute rotator cuff tear secondary to a specific event * a highly competitive athlete who is primarily involved in overhead or throwing sports These individuals more often benefit from operative treatment because they are willing to tolerate the risks of surgery to return to their preoperative level of function, and have higher likelihood of a successful outcome. Those who do not respond to, or are unsatisfied with, conservative treatment can seek a surgical opinion. The three general surgical approaches are arthroscopic, mini open, and open-surgical repair. In the past, small tears were treated arthroscopically, while larger tears would usually require an open procedure. Advances in arthroscopy now allow arthroscopic repair of even the largest tears, and arthroscopic techniques are now required to mobilize many retracted tears. The results match open surgical techniques, while permitting a more thorough evaluation of the shoulder at time of surgery, increasing the diagnostic value of the procedure, as other conditions may simultaneously cause shoulder pain. Arthroscopic surgery also allows for shorter recovery time although differences in postoperative pain or pain medication use are not seen between arthroscopic- and open-surgery. A 2019 review found that the evidence does not support decompression surgery in those with more than 3 months of shoulder pain without a history of trauma. Even for full-thickness rotator cuff tears, conservative care (i.e., nonsurgical treatment) outcomes are usually reasonably good. If a significant bone spur is present, any of the approaches may include an acromioplasty, a subacromial decompression, as part of the procedure. Subacromial decompression, removal of a small portion of the acromion that overlies the rotator cuff, aims to relieve pressure on the rotator cuff in certain conditions and promote healing and recovery. Although subacromial decompression may be beneficial in the management of partial and full-thickness tear repair, it does not repair the tear itself and arthroscopic decompression has more recently been combined with \\"mini-open\\" repair of the rotator cuff, allowing for the repair of the cuff without disruption of the deltoid origin. The results of decompression alone tend to degrade with time, but the combination of repair and decompression appears to be more enduring. Subacromial decompression may not improve pain, function, or quality of life. Repair of a complete, full-thickness tear involves tissue suture. The method currently in favor is to place an anchor in the bone at the natural attachment site, with resuture of torn tendon to the anchor. If tissue quality is poor, mesh (collagen, Artelon, or other degradable material) may be used to reinforce the repair. Repair can be performed through an open incision, again requiring detachment of a portion of the deltoid, while a mini-open technique approaches the tear through a deltoid-splitting approach. The latter may cause less injury to muscle and produce better results. Contemporary techniques now use an all arthroscopic approach. Recovery can take as long as three‚Äìsix months, with a sling being worn for the first one‚Äìsix weeks. In the case of partial thickness tears, if surgery is undertaken, tear completion (converting the partial tear to a full tear) and then repair, is associated with better early outcomes than transtendinous repairs (where the intact fibres are preserved) and no difference in failure rates. Biceps tenotomy and tenodesis are often performed concomitantly with rotator cuff repair or as separate procedures, and can also cause shoulder pain. Tenodesis, which may be performed as an arthroscopic or open procedure, generally restores pain free motion it the biceps tendon, or attached portion of the labrum, but can cause pain. Tenotomy is a shorter surgery requiring less rehabilitation, that is more often performed in older patients, though after surgery there can be a cosmetic 'popeye sign' visible in thin arms. In a small minority of cases where extensive arthritis has developed, an option is shoulder joint replacement (arthroplasty). Specifically, this is a reverse shoulder replacement, a more constrained form of shoulder arthroplasty that allows the shoulder to function well even in the presence of large full thickness rotator cuff tears. =Biologics= The main goal in biological augmentation is to enhance healing. There are a number of potential options. These include injecting an individual's own stem cells, growth factors or platelet rich plasma (PRP) into the repair site, and installing scaffolds as biological or synthetic supports to maintain tissue contour. A 2013 Cochrane review evaluated PRP and found insufficient evidence to make recommendations. Mesenchymal stem cells have no convincing evidence for their use overall, with quality human trials lacking. The greater tuberosity can also be microfractured to create a small blood clot just lateral to the repair site. =Rehabilitation= Rehabilitation after surgery consists of three stages. First, the arm is immobilized so that the muscle can heal. Second, when appropriate, a therapist assists with passive exercises to regain range of motion. Third, the arm is gradually exercised actively, with a goal of regaining and enhancing strength. The empty can and full can exercises are amongst the most effective at isolating and strengthening the supraspinatus. Following arthroscopic rotator-cuff repair surgery, individuals need rehabilitation and physical therapy. Exercise decreases shoulder pain, strengthens the joint, and improves range of motion. Therapists, in conjunction with the surgeon, design exercise regimens specific to the individual and their injury. Traditionally, after injury the shoulder is immobilized for six weeks before rehabilitation. However, the appropriate timing and intensity of therapy are subject to debate. Most surgeons advocate using the sling for at least six weeks, though others advocate early, aggressive rehabilitation. The latter group favors the use of passive motion, which allows an individual to move the shoulder without physical effort. Alternatively, some authorities argue that therapy should be started later and carried out more cautiously. Theoretically, that gives tissues time to heal; though there is conflicting data regarding the benefits of early immobilization. A study of rats suggested that it improved the strength of surgical repairs, while research on rabbits produced contrary evidence. Individuals with a history of rotator cuff injury, particularly those recovering from tears, are prone to reinjury. Rehabbing too soon or too strenuously might increase the risk of retear or failure to heal. However, no research has proven a link between early therapy and the incidence of re- tears. In some studies, those who received earlier and more aggressive therapy reported reduced shoulder pain, less stiffness and better range of motion. Other research has shown that accelerated rehab results in better shoulder function. There is consensus amongst orthopaedic surgeons and physical therapists regarding rotator cuff repair rehabilitation protocols. The timing and duration of treatments and exercises are based on biologic and biomedical factors involving the rotator cuff. For approximately two to three weeks following surgery, an individual experiences shoulder pain and swelling; no major therapeutic measures are instituted in this window other than oral pain medicine and ice. Those at risk of failure should usually be more conservative with rehabilitations. That is followed by the \\"proliferative\\" and \\"maturation and remodeling\\" phases of healing, which ensues for the following six to ten weeks. The effect of active or passive motion during any of the phases is unclear, due to conflicting information and a shortage of clinical evidence. Gentle physical therapy guided motion is instituted at this phase, only to prevent stiffness of the shoulder; the rotator cuff remains fragile. At three months after surgery, physical therapy intervention changes substantially to focus on scapular mobilization and stretching of the glenohumeral joint. Once full passive motion is regained (at usually about four to four and a half months after surgery) strengthening exercises are the focus. The strengthening focuses on the rotator cuff and the upper back/scapular stabilizers. Typically at about six months after surgery, most have made a majority of their expected gains. The objective in repairing a rotator cuff is to enable an individual to regain full function. Surgeons and therapists analyze outcomes in several ways. Based on examinations, they compile scores on tests; some examples are those created by the University of California at Los Angeles and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons. Other outcome measures include the Constant score; the Simple Shoulder Test; and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score. The tests assess range of motion and the degree of shoulder function. Due to the conflicting information about the relative benefits of rehab conducted early or later, an individualized approach is necessary. The timing and nature of therapeutic activities are adjusted according to age and tissue integrity of the repair. Management is more complex in those who have suffered multiple tears. Prognosis While people with rotator cuff tears may not have any noticeable symptoms, studies have shown that, those with age related tears, over time 40% will have enlargement of the tear over a five- year period. Of those whose tears enlarge, 20% have no symptoms while 80% eventually develop symptoms. Most usually regain function and experience less pain following surgery. For some, however, the joint continues to hurt. Weakness and a limited range of motion also may persist. Those who report such symptoms frequently are diagnosed with failed rotator cuff syndrome. There is no irrefutable evidence that rotator cuff surgery benefits more than non- surgical management and a percentage of individuals never regain full range of motion after surgery. Arthroscopic procedures produce \\"satisfactory results\\" more than 90 percent of the time. However, 6-8 percent of patients have \\"incompetent\\" rotator cuffs because their repaired tendons either fail to heal or develop additional tears. In some cases, persistent rotator cuff type pain after surgery can be due to disease elsewhere. For example, cervical spine disease and can involve neck pain radiating into the shoulder. Suprascapular neuropathy, shoulder impingement, superior labral anterior-posterior (SLAP) tears and arthritis can all mimic rotator cuff disease and cause persistent pain that does not respond to rotator cuff surgery. Epidemiology Rates of rotator cuff tears by age and sex Rotator cuff tears are among the most common conditions affecting the shoulder. A rotator cuff tear can be caused by the weakening of the rotator cuff tendons. This weakening can be caused by age or how often the rotator cuff is used. Adults over the age of 60 are more susceptible to a rotator cuff tear, with the overall frequency of tears increasing with age. By the age of 50 10% of people with normal shoulders have a rotator cuff tear. In an autopsy study of rotator cuff tears, the incidence of partial tears was 28%, and of complete rupture 30%. Frequently, tears occurred on both sides and occurred more often with females and with increasing age. Other cadaver studies have noted intratendinous tears to be more frequent (7.2%) than bursal-sided (2.4%) or articular-sided tears (3.6%). However, clinically, articular-sided tears are found to be 2 to 3 times more common than bursal-sided tears and among a population of young athletes, articular-sided tears constituted 91% of all partial-thickness tears. Rotator cuff tears may be more common in men between the ages of 50‚Äì60, though between 70‚Äì80 there is minimal difference across genders.

Its channels broadcast in French, English, Arabic, and Spanish and are aimed at the overseas market, similar to BBC World News, DW, RT and VOA. Based in the Paris suburb of Issy-les-Moulineaux, the service started on 6 December 2006. It is aimed at a worldwide market and is generally broadcast by pay television providers around the world, but additionally, in 2010, France 24 began broadcasting online through its own iPhone and Android apps. It is a provider of live streaming world news which can be viewed via its website, YouTube, and various mobile devices and digital media players. The stated mission of the channels is to \\"provide a global public service and a common editorial stance\\". Since 2008 the channel has been wholly owned by the French government, via its holding company France M√©dias Monde, having bought out the minority share of the former partners: Groupe TF1 and France T√©l√©visions. The budget is approximately ‚Ç¨100 million per year. Branchville that big around}  Programming  France 24 is broadcast on four channels: in Arabic, in English, in French and in Spanish. France 24's programming is divided more or less equally between news coverage and news magazines or special reports. Along with 260 journalists of its own, France 24 can call on the resources of the two main French broadcasters (Groupe TF1 and France T√©l√©visions) as well as partners such as AFP and RFI. The CEO of France 24 is Alain de Pouzilhac. From 19 May 2010 and the Director of France 24 since 2012 is Marc Saikali, France 24 unveiled a new schedule that prioritizes the morning and evening slots, anchored live by the network's editorial staff. More programming space than ever before goes to business, sport, culture, and studio discussion. In 2016, France 24 started sharing its French-language night-time programming with the France-based France Info. According to Marie-Christine Saragosse, president and CEO of France M√©dias Monde, \\"part of the value added of this public channel\\" would be the fact that \\"[France 24 journalists] will be wide awake while others would be sleeping\\". History =Channel inception= The media's perception was that the channel was a brainchild of former president Jacques Chirac, famous for defending the position of the French language in the world, specifically versus the English domination in this media category. =First project (1987‚Äì1997)= In 1987, then French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac expressed his desire for an international television news channel in French and had requested a report into the activities of current international broadcasts from France (Radio France Internationale, TV5, and to a certain extent R√©seau France Outre-Mer) and noted the collective offering was \\"fragmented, disorganised and ineffective.\\" With the arrival of Fran√ßois Mitterrand as President in 1981 and the naming of Michel Rocard as Prime Minister in 1988, the government launched a new project, (CFI), a package of programmes aimed at making programmes in French for foreign audiences, particularly in Africa, to be developed in parallel as a television channel. The First Gulf War of 1990, relayed across the world by CNN International in particular, revealed the power of international news channels and their role in the formation of opinion. A parliamentary minister, Philippe S√©guin, wished to create a French-language equivalent. In 1996, after nineteen governmental reports in ten years, Prime Minister Alain Jupp√© asked Radio France Internationale president Jean-Paul Cluzel (who was also General Inspector of Finances) to create a French international news channel. Cluzel proposed in 1997 to group TV5, RFI, and CFI within a corporation entitled T√©l√©fi. The UMP- led government decided to follow that recommendation but, with the return of the Socialist Party to government and the nomination of Hubert V√©drine, the new Minister of Foreign Affairs, favoured the augmentation of existing outlets such as TV5, which started to produce its own programming, notably its news bulletins, which in turn created its own news team. Additionally with the creation of EuroNews in 1993 (with French-language commentary), the media presence of France overseas became more complex, more fragmented, and costlier, without being able to rely on a true round-the-clock international news channel. =Relaunched project (2002‚Äì2003)= In 2002, President Jacques Chirac relaunched the project to create a French international news channel: On 7 March, speaking in the French Senate in front of foreign delegates to France, and as part of his presidential campaign, Chirac said: \\"We must have the ambition of a big, round-the-clock news channel in French, equal to the BBC or CNN for the English-speaking world. It is essential for the influence of our country. For our expatriates, it would be a live and an immediate link to the mainland\\"Speech given by Jacques Chirac in front of foreign representatives of the French state , (French), 7 March 2002. After his reelection, the first reflections were engaged at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, headed by Dominique de Villepin. Various technical options were examined at the time, in an unreleased report: * Purchase of EuroNews by the French State * Creation of an external channel, proposed by then-France T√©l√©visions President Marc Tessier, approved by the previous government. * An international version of LCI, proposed by Groupe TF1, which asked for a state subvention for the service. * Strengthening of TV5's news service, as suggested by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq reassured the authorities about the project, especially in February 2003, when the American broadcasters CNN, FOX News, and MSNBC opted not to broadcast the long applause given by the members of the United Nations Security Council after Dominique de Villepin gave his address on the Iraq conflict.Statement by Dominique de Villepin to the United Nations Security Council. Foreign Policy. 14 February 2003. Retrieved 5 November 2010. On 19 March 2003, Matignon opened offers to: > Elicit the development of an international news channel.

The international news channel must contribute to a long-lasting > strategy of influence of France in the world.Consultation guide, Direction > and Developemt of Media (Archive) (French) By the application deadline on 22 April 2003, three candidates replied: * France T√©l√©visions & RFI: to operate a channel entirely run by the public service sector; * Groupe TF1 : proposed an international version of its LCI channel; * Groupe Canal+ : proposed a news \\"factory\\" to reinforce its i>T√©l√© channel, already seen in 47 countries but running at a financial loss. One month later, a parliamentary commission gave its conclusion, voted with a unanimous decision by its members in the National Assembly, to form a public- owned corporation (groupement d'int√©r√™t public) grouping all of the public broadcasters (France T√©l√©visions, RFO, RFI, TV5 and AFP) with the goal of launching the channel at the end of 2004. Ignoring the work of the parliamentary commission, the government asked a member of the assembly, Bernard Brochand, to form a partnership between the applying candidates for the international channel, something which the parliamentary commission did not demand. Brochard attempted to group both Groupe TF1 and Groupe Canal+, with no success. He then proposed a 50/50 partnership between France T√©l√©visions and Groupe TF1 (whilst at the same time rejecting RFI), both groups possessing the technical means and experience of broadcasting externally: TF1 with its LCI channel and France T√©l√©visions' editorial teams at France 2 and France 3. =Preparing for launch (2004‚Äì2006)= Defying parliament After a press conference in January 2004, President Chirac wished for a launch of the channel towards the end of the year. However, various disputes began to surface. The ministers of the assembly that voted were angry that the recommendations voted for in the parliamentary commission were thrown out in favour of one prepared outside the parliamentary framework. Unionised journalists working for France T√©l√©visions denounced the potential alliance with the private sector, calling it \\"the marriage of the snake and the rabbit\\"; Radio France International was angry that it would not be associated with the project. A headline published in Le Monde described the partnership having a \\"public channel, private owner\\", while other sections of the press criticised its modest budget of 80 million euro (compared with 600 million euro for BBC World). Finally the Minister for Foreign Affairs had worried that the budget would take away from existing funded channels such as TV5. Facing discontentment, the cabinet of Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin delayed all discussion of the project in 2004. Then Foreign Minister Michel Barnier announced on 21 July that the channel would not be funded before 2007, which was confirmed by a vote in parliament on the Finance Bill. However, the Prime Minister acceded to pressure from the √âlys√©e; a press conference by Raffarin on 9 December confirmed the launch of the new news channel in 2005. \\"I have decided to accept the proposed joint venture proposed by France T√©l√©visions and TF1. As desired by the President, the new channel will draw on the talents of major French television companies, and will promote the expression of a French vision, more necessary than ever in the world today. The Government will present an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the start of the channel, to a total of 30 million euro.\\"Press conference, 9 December 2005. The amendment was carried the same day in the National Assembly. Public-private angst The start of 2005 concerned obtaining the authorisation necessary from the European Union and the relevant competition commissions. Trade union members working for France T√©l√©visions continued to voice opposition to the project and circulated a petition in March 2005. The newly elected president of the public corporation, Patrick de Carolis, who assumed his position in the summer (and who had been accused of being too close to the President), expressed doubts about an alliance with TF1: \\"To be effective, you need a single driver in a car\\".Delesalle, Nicolas (11 January 2006). \\"La voix de la France, en l√©ger diff√©r√©‚Ä¶\\", T√©l√©rama, n¬∞2922. He insisted that the channel be made available within France, which the members of parliament required, and which TF1, wanting to protect its own news channel LCI, could object to. Patrick Le Lay, president of TF1, gave his blessing for the channel to be broadcast domestically and wished the direction of the channel to alternate every six months between the two parties, and eventually a Supervisory Board devolved to France T√©l√©visions. These few amendments needed new authorisation from the French and European authorities, obtained this time round without difficulty. =Birth (2006‚Äì2008)= The launch of the channel was made official after a statement to the cabinet of the Ministry of Culture and Communication, headed by Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres on 30 November 2005: \\" The project of the International French News Channel (abbreviated in French to CFII)[...] will allow us to propose our own country's vision of world events and to reinforce its presence in the world.\\" Alain de Pouzilhac, former CEO of Havas, was named President, along with two deputies, one each from group partners TF1 and France T√©l√©visions. Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin declared that CFII, against the wishes of TF1, would be broadcast within mainland France.\\"Financ√©e par l'argent public, il est l√©gitime qu'elle soit diffus√©e en France\\". Radio France International. 9 November 2005. (French) However, TF1 wished to launch its news channel LCI onto the digital terrestrial platform. In order to placate TF1, CFII was due to be broadcast via satellite and cable. On 22 April 2006, Le Monde announced that the managers of the forthcoming channel found its initial name difficult to pronounce (CFII, in French pronounced as C-F-I-I or C-F-2-I).Article published online, Le Monde (Paris). (Paid article) (Archive) (French), 23 February 2008 A new name was announced on 30 June 2006; France 24 (pronounced France vingt-quatre). This decision was taken by the Supervisory Board, chaired by France T√©l√©vision president Patrick de Carolis, who made the choice from a list of five potential names. France 24 launched on 6 December 2006, initially available online as a web stream, followed by satellite distribution a day later, covering France and the rest of Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the United States (specifically airing in New York State and the District of Columbia using two channels: one in English and the other in French). Since April 2007 the channel increased its reach, airing programmes in Arabic for viewers in the Maghreb, North Africa and the Middle East. Two months after launch, a survey conducted by TNS Sofres indicated that 75% of respondents in France questioned thought France 24 was \\"useful and essential\\",Survey published in M√©tro, 16 February 2007. but questions have arisen concerning the France 24 name being too Franco-centric for an international news channel.\\"France24, ou le splendide isolement audiovisuel de la France\\", Marc Chevrier, Professor of Political Science, Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al. Encyclop√©die de la Francophonie. Retrieved 16 October 2007. State takes over In 2008 Groupe TF1 ceded its share in the channel to a government- owned holding company, Soci√©t√© de l'audiovisuel ext√©rieur de la France (AEF), whilst conversely committing to producing programmes for the channel until 2015. Despite the launch of France 24, the fragmentation of public broadcasting overseas continues. The total budget for external broadcasting from France totalled 300 million euro each year. Following the election of Nicolas Sarkozy as President in May 2007, a \\"steering committee\\" of twenty members was called in with view to reform in June 2007. President Sarkozy called on Bernard Kouchner and Christine Albanel, respectively Foreign Minister and Culture Minister to reform the current system. The proposition of reform was met with concern from Belgium, Switzerland and Canada/Qu√©bec, as the public broadcasters involved in TV5 (of which the French government holds a 49% share whilst the three aforementioned countries hold 11% each) consider TV5 to be a promoter of the wider French-language world.\\"Audiovisuel ext√©rieur. Une r√©forme au forceps\\", Daniel Psenny, Le Monde (Paris). 11 October 2007, p. 23. Just one month after France 24's launch, TV5 renamed itself TV5Monde. As published in the Journal Officiel de la R√©publique Fran√ßaise of 23 January 2009, a Decree for 23 January 2009 appeared, authorising the company France T√©l√©visions to cede its share in the capital of the France 24 company.Legifrance.gouv.fr. 9 April 2009. The same Decree transferred its share to the Soci√©t√© de l'audiovisuel ext√©rieur de la France (AEF), which made AEF sole shareholder of France 24, for the sum of 4 million euro.Legifrance.gouv.fr. 9 April 2009. =Under one maison (2008‚Äìpresent)= President Nicolas Sarkozy announced on 8 January 2008 that he was in favour of reducing France 24's programming to French only.\\"La cha√Æne France 24 dans l'incertitude\\" . Le Monde (Paris). In January 2012 AEF announced a merger between France 24 and Radio France International, a procedure finalised on 13 February 2012. It is expected that staff from Radio France International (which includes Arabic sister station Monte Carlo Doualiya) will move to premises currently home to France 24. Alain de Pouzilhac, president of AEF stated in Le Monde: 102 posts, of which 85 from RFI, were cut preceding the official merger. Editorial teams, technical and distribution, financial and human resources departments of both France 24 and RFI were involved. On 13 February 2012 the merger of France 24 and RFI was made official. =Long-term goals= France 24 aims to compete with leading English-language international news channels BBC World News and CNN International. Its intention is to put more emphasis on debate, dialogue and the role of cultural differences. It also competes with Deutsche Welle, Al Jazeera English, and NHK World news channels. The Arabic programming competes with Al Jazeera's Arabic service, RT Arabic, BBC Arabic and Sky News Arabia. The new Spanish channel for the Latin American market is expected to start in September 2017. It will compete with CNN en Espa√±ol, DW (Latinoam√©rica), NTN24, TeleSUR, RT en espa√±ol and CCTV-E The French government allocated around ‚Ç¨100 million for the project. The European Commission gave the green light to France 24 in June 2006, saying it did not breach European Union state aid rules. = Overnight simulcast = From 2 September 2016, France's new news channel, France Info, started simulcasting France 24 from midnight to 6am daily, when the channel doesn't broadcast live except for newscasts every half hour. However, from 20 March 2017, on weekdays, France Info started simulcasting France 24 until 6:30 am, due to the main presenter Laurent Bignolas anchoring the early newscast on France 2 Le 6h Info, which isn't simulcast on France Info. Organisation From its creation in 2006 to 2008, France 24 is managed by a management board and a supervisory board. In 2008, the French State bought the shares of the two shareholders for an amount of 2 million euros each. Since then, France 24 has been a chain of the national program company France M√©dias Monde (formerly Exterior Audiovisual of France), 100% owned by the French State through the State Participation Agency (APE). France 24 has two main sources of funding : the audiovisual license fee, paid by each household equipped with a television, and the state subsidy.

Career O'Hare was brought up in Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire and studied at St Aloysius' College, Glasgow. He joined Teenage Fanclub in 1989, in time to play on about half of their debut album, A Catholic Education. He co-wrote with Teenage Fanclub on all albums during his tenure, he split from the group after completing the tour for the Thirteen album, cited as musical differences at the time and went on to join Telstar Ponies, for which he worked on two albums. He was an early member of Mogwai for approximately a year. He was described by the NME as Teenage Fanclub's \\"Monkey Without Portfolio\\", known for his humour and upbeat personality at the time. This prompted the track \\"With Portfolio\\" on Mogwai's debut album, Young Team. O'Hare was allegedly kicked out of Mogwai for talking during a performance by Arab Strap leading to a fight with other members of the band. Despite this, there appears to have been no hard feelings between O'Hare and Arab Strap as O'Hare later featured on their double A-side 1998 release, \\"Here We Go\\"/\\"Trippy\\", contributing to the twelve-minute song, \\"Trippy\\". In addition to his work with Macrocosmica and as Fiend, he worked closely with Dave Barker (formerly of Glass Records, Paperhouse and Creation) who ran the God Bless record label (issuing the sole album by Thurston Moore's 'Foot' project) and was part of the electro-based band, Liminal. Brendan was in charge of bookings and sound engineering at the Glasgow venue The 13th Note before moving to Edinburgh and continuing as engineer at Liquid rooms and Voodoo Lounge. In 2006, he rejoined Teenage Fanclub for shows in London, Glasgow and Barcelona at which the band played their Bandwagonesque album in its entirety. He is also an honorary member and producer of Glasgow-based pranksters The Plimptons, and plays guitar on their second album Pomp.

He was also a poker player, winning titles at the World Series of Poker and the Super Bowl of Poker. He also competed on the World Poker Tour, and various other tournaments, as well as cash games, including High Stakes Poker on GSN. He once played a computer for half a million dollars and won. Early life Bob Stupak was the son of Chester and Florence Stupak. He was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Chester Stupak ran a dice game called the Lotus Club in Pittsburgh for over 50 years. Stupak as a teenager was mainly interested in motorcycle racing, and once ranked third in the world after breaking a speed record. As a young adult, Stupak first moved to Las Vegas and ran a coupon book scam making a tidy profit. He then left Las Vegas and moved to Australia to try and run the same coupon book scam he had run in Las Vegas and was caught by authorities and forced to return to US. At 21, Stupak lived in Melbourne and worked scamming people with a bogus coupon book scam. Gambling career Stupak moved back to Las Vegas in 1971. He bought the Vault casino in downtown and changed its name to Glitter Gulch. He created a cowgirl sign named Vegas Vicki to match the Vegas Vic sign at the Pioneer Club. Stupak bought a parcel north of Sahara Avenue at Las Vegas Boulevard South. On March 31, 1974, Bob Stupak's World Famous Historic Gambling Museum opened. \\"The name was about longer than the casino,\\" Stupak recalled years later. On May 21, an air conditioner caught fire and the building burned down. Two years later, Valley Bank's Perry Thomas loaned Stupak a million dollars to build the original Vegas World on the site of the former gambling museum. In 1979. Stupak opened Bob Stupak's Vegas World hotel and casino known for its promotions and the world's largest sign (which later blew down in a wind storm), and new twists on games, including the world's first quarter million and million dollar jackpot. At its peak in the mid-1980s, Vegas World grossed in excess of $100 million per year. In the meantime, Stupak donated $100,000 to the United Negro College Fund in exchange for a chance to play with the Harlem Globetrotters. He got his wish, and his appearance on the court in a Globetrotters uniform during one of their games shooting hoops made international news. Then, taking a page from Donald Trump with his Trump board game, Stupak came up with his own board game he called Stupak after Trump declined his million dollar challenge for charity playing Trump: The Game. In the mid-1990s, Bob Stupak was inducted into the Gambling Hall of Fame. Stupak's unique promotions included the world's first one quarter million dollar jackpot followed shortly thereafter by the world's first million dollar jackpot. He also was wildly successful with his direct- mail marketing called the \\"Vegas Vacation Club\\" that enticed vacationers to Vegas World with what was almost a cost-free vacation package including room, meals, and vouchers for casino play. Participants returned year after year and spread the word until hotel occupancy was 100% year round. In 1987, Stupak was considering the purchase of a local television station, as well as starting a weekly newspaper. In 1988, Stupak was the chairman of the newly formed Committee for Olympics in Nevada, and advocated for the Summer Olympic Games to be held in Las Vegas in 1996 or in 2000. In 1989, Stupak won a widely publicized million-dollar wager on Super Bowl XXIII. Later that year, he won the Deuce to Seven Lowball championship bracelet at the World Series of Poker and the Super Bowl of poker at Caesars Palace, both times edging out world- renowned lowball poker legend Billy Baxter for the championship. One of Stupak's most talked about promotions came when he paid a daredevil one million dollars to jump off the top of Vegas World, then charged him a $990,000 landing fee. In 1990, Stupak approached the mayor and city council with a plan to build the largest free-standing sign in the world. His plan was for an 1,800-foot-tall neon sign that would tower over Las Vegas. Then- Councilman Steve Miller, an airline instructor pilot, convinced Stupak to redesign the structure to include an observation deck. Miller took Stupak for a flight over Vegas World in Miller's private plane. There they circled for over an hour at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 feet watching the sun set. Stupak told Miller that to not share such a beautiful sight would be a sin, and he immediately went to work revising his plans to include a restaurant and amusement rides at the top of what was then to be called the \\"Stupak Tower.\\" Stupak held a press conference and announced his plan with the caveat that his tower would be the icon of Las Vegas, and Steve Wynn's Mirage would be two miles from him, not the other way around. Within a year of Stupak's announcement, the construction on the tower began. In 1995, Stupak suffered a motorcycle accident, breaking every bone in his face and going into a coma. Although the initial prognosis was that he would not survive, Stupak's next of kin, son Nevada Stupak, approved a non-FDA-approved experimental drug to reduce the swelling to his head and brain. Stupak recovered, although with lingering health problems. At the time of his motorcycle crash, Stupak was developing what had become known as Stratosphere Las Vegas, the largest structure west of the Mississippi and top 10 tallest structure in the world. The accident was only three weeks after Stupak agreed to bring in fellow poker player buddy Lyle Berman and his company Grand Casinos in as investors in the project, in large part due to the $550 million in capital they agreed to invest. This was Grand Casinos' big opportunity to enter the Las Vegas market due in large part to the overwhelming success in the Indian gaming market. Stupak called this the most difficult decision of his life as he had never had a partner and was always sole owner. The tower opened in late April 1996, making it the third most expensive casino development in history at the time; within a year Stupak was out as Chairman of the Board and the project ultimately ended as a financial disaster. Stupak lost nearly $200 million personally. Stupak continued to plan Vegas projects, including a purchase of the Moulin Rouge Hotel and a huge hotel shaped like the RMS Titanic, but these endeavors never bore fruit. Stupak appeared in the first season of the GSN series High Stakes Poker. He also appeared at a final table during the first season of the World Poker Tour. As of 2008, his total live tournament winnings exceeded $865,000. With his World Series of Poker Bracelet in the Deuce to Seven Championship and his wife Sandy in the Casino Owner's Championship at Binion's Horseshoe, they were the first husband-and-wife combo to hold WSOP bracelets. Political career Stupak ran for mayor of Las Vegas twice. In 1983, Stupak ran against then-current mayor William H. Briare, as well as six other candidates. Stupak came in second place, with 33.1 percent of the vote, losing to Briare, who attained 62.5 percent and won re-election. Stupak ran for mayor again in 1987, and clashed often with the media. During the campaign, Stupak released financial documents that indicated his net worth at about $54 million. Stupak almost succeeded in being elected mayor. After defeating a dozen other candidates in the primary, Stupak forced an incumbent city council member into a runoff general election contest. Following what many believed was a tampered vote count, Stupak lost the election. In 2006, Stupak unsuccessfully ran as a Democrat for Lieutenant Governor of Nevada. Personal life While in Australia, Stupak was briefly married to Annette Suna, and they had a daughter, Nicole. From 1971 to 1985, Stupak was married to Sandra Joyce Wilkinson, and had two more children, Nevada and Summer. Death and legacy Stupak died of leukemia on September 25, 2009, at 67. In February 2016, the Las Vegas Planning Commission and the Las Vegas City Council unanimously approved the renaming of one block of Baltimore Avenue as Bob Stupak Avenue. The renaming occurred on Stupak's birthday, April 6, 2016, as part of a 20th anniversary celebration held for the Stratosphere on the property's south side, near the corner of Baltimore Avenue and Las Vegas Boulevard. A community center and a park named after Stupak are located near the Stratosphere. The community center was opened in 1992, and was demolished in 2010, to be replaced by the new Stupak Park. A new Stupak Community Center was opened on January 4, 2010. The new facility is 34,183 square feet and cost $7.5 million to construct. The community center celebrated its 25th anniversary in January 2017. References Further reading *Smith, John L. 1997. No Limit: The Rise and Fall of Bob Stupak and Las Vegas' Stratosphere Tower.

The orchestra was founded as a self-governing organisation run on cooperative lines by musicians from George Halford's Orchestra, which had been performing annual series of concerts in Birmingham since 1897. George Halford remained the new orchestra's Music Director, though he would only conduct half of their concerts. The new body included fifty of the musicians from the previous organisation. The inaugural concert took place in Birmingham Town Hall on 4 April 1906 and was conducted by Henry Wood, with further concerts in the 1906-1907 season being conducted by Halford, Hans Richter and Landon Ronald, and the Musical Times describing as a \\"splendid concert\\" a performance conducted by Halford in March 1907. For the 1907-1908 and 1908-1909 seasons concerts by the BSO were promoted under the auspices of the \\"Birmingham Concerts Society\\" and took place on Tuesday evenings, conducted by Halford, Frederick Cowen, Charles Stanford, Allen Gill and Henri Verbrugghen. From July 1910 it was the \\"Birmingham Philharmonic Society\\" that promoted eight concerts a year featuring the BSO players and conductors including Halford, Wood, Ronald, George Henschel, Vasily Safonov, Thomas Beecham and Fritz Cassirer. The orchestra also gave popular Saturday night concerts at the Town Hall that continued until 1918, and performed widely alongside many different choral societies with conductors including Edward Elgar, Henry Coward and George Robertson Sinclair. Although there was no institutional connection between the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and the later City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, fifteen of the players who founded the earlier organisation in 1906 would also play with the later orchestra when it was established in 1920.

The diversity of crops grown on a small area of land, typically from under one acre (0.4 ha) to a few acres, or sometimes in greenhouses distinguishes it from other types of farming. Such a farm on a larger scale is sometimes called a truck farm. A market garden is a business that provides a wide range and steady supply of fresh produce through the local growing season. Unlike large, industrial farms, which practice monoculture and mechanization, many different crops and varieties are grown and more manual labour and gardening techniques are used. The small output requires selling through such local fresh produce outlets as on-farm stands, farmers' markets, community-supported agriculture subscriptions, restaurants and independent produce stores. Market gardening and orchard farming are closely related to horticulture, which concerns the growing of fruits and vegetables. History Cucumbers reach to the ceiling in a greenhouse in Richfield, Minnesota, where market gardeners grew a wide variety of produce for sale in Minneapolis. ca. 1910 Traditionally, \\"market garden\\" was used to contrast farms devoted to raising vegetables and berries, a specialized type of farming, with the larger branches of grain, dairy, and orchard fruit farming; agricultural historians continue to thus use the term. Such operations were not necessarily small-scale. Indeed, many were very large, commercial farms that were called \\"gardens\\" not because of size, but because English-speaking farmers traditionally referred to their vegetable plots as \\"gardens\\": in English whether in common parlance or in anthropological or historical scholarship, husbandry done by the hoe is customarily called \\"gardening\\" and husbandry done by the plough as \\"farming\\" regardless of the scale of either. A \\"market garden\\" was simply a vegetable plot, the produce of which the farmer used to sell as opposed to use to feed his or her family. Market gardens are necessarily close to the markets, i.e. cities, that they serve. The word 'truck' in Truck farms does not refer to the transportation truck, which is derived from Latin for wheel, but rather from the old north French word troquer, which means \\"barter\\" or \\"exchange\\". The use for vegetables raised for market can be traced back to 1784 and truck farms to 1866.Online Etymology Dictionary Business Selling to the wholesale market usually earns 10‚Äì20% of the retail price, but direct-to-consumer selling earns 100%. Although highly variable, a conventional farm may return a few hundred to a few thousand dollars (US) per acre ($0.03/m¬≤ to $0.30/m¬≤) but an efficient market garden can earn in the $10,000‚Äì15,000 per acre ($3/m¬≤ to $5/m¬≤) range, or even higher. However, the size of a market garden has a practical upper bound based on this model, but with conventional farming can farm vast areas because access to a direct market is not a requirement. Larger market gardens often sell to such local food outlets as supermarkets, food cooperatives, community-supported agriculture programs, farmers' markets, fresh food wholesalers, and any other higher-volume channels that benefit from buying a range of vegetables from a single supplier, their freshness allowing for a premium over the revenue from the supermarkets and frequently other local suppliers. A larger market garden can by mixed crop production maintain a sales alternative to the wholesale commodity-style channels often used by farms that specialize in high volumes of a limited number of crops. Relying on cities for markets, however, can have drawbacks. For example, in England, south Sussex was famous for growing tomatoes for the London market that were delivered by train. The arrival of railways in the 19th century at first stimulated growth of market gardens in certain areas by providing quick access to the city, but it eventually allowed commuting residents to move there and turn many market garden areas into suburbs. Urban sprawl still eats up farmland in urban regions. Buying the rights to develop farmland from the farmers solved this problem in Suffolk County, New York. Chinese market gardener in Australia, ca. 1893 Social role In some more affluent countries, including Australia and the United States, market gardening is rated as a high social utility occupation. It is typically taken up by recent immigrant groups for one or two generations, until they can accumulate capital, language and trade skills. The succession of dominant market garden groups in Australia, for example, was ‚Äì from the early 19th century Anglo- Celtic, people from German-speaking countries, Chinese (after the peak of the gold rushes in mid-late 19th century), then southern European migrants from Italy, Malta and Yugoslavia (before it disintegrated), then southeast Asian migrant and refugee communities following the Vietnam War, such as the Vietnamese and Cambodians. Involvement in a market garden lets immigrant groups who otherwise have few marketable skills apart from their labour, become actively involved in the market economy. Benefits are that it does not rely on education or language, it adapts well to providing work for extended family groups, and in large market growing regions even wider community support networks. Sharing of knowledge and experience within communities reduces risks, and supports a network of other trades such as carriers, market agents, and heavy machinery contractors, and contract farm labour. Market- gardening land is typically relatively cheap and allows immigrants to purchase land, often with an accompanying residence, far more readily than in urban settings. However, like all agriculture it risks crop failure, market collapse and competition from industrialised broad-acre farming and 'fresh-frozen' imported produce. Other risks are from hazards such as pesticide use, especially where the market gardeners are not trained in their use or able to read product information. Another consequence is marginalisation of the succeeding generation where they are relied upon as the fittest and strongest to succeed in continuing the farm rather than pursue other ambitions and opportunities. Alternative lifestyle Market gardening has in recent decades become an alternative business and lifestyle choice for individuals who wish to \\"return to the land\\", because the business model and niche allow a smaller start-up investment than conventional commercial farming, and generally offers a viable market (in microeconomics basic or staple foods are considered as necessities and have highly inelastic demand curves meaning that consumers will buy them in relatively constant quantities even if prices or incomes vary), especially with the recent popularity of organic and local food. It is in some instances considered hobby farming, although market gardening is a recognized type of farming with a distinct business model that can be significantly profitable and sustainable. There is a spectrum with overlap from with the efforts of amateur gardeners who sometimes sell from home or at markets, as an extension of their pastime, to fully commercial market gardening as the main or sole income stream. The latter requires the most discipline and business sense. Successful practitioners who have written books about it include Eliot Coleman and Jean-Martin Fortier. In contemporary America A garden with edible plants for use in a culinary school in Lawrenceville, Georgia An example of a market garden operation in North America might involve one farmer working full-time on two acres (8,000 m¬≤). Most work is done with hand and light power tools, and perhaps a small tractor. Some 20 different crops are planted throughout the season. Hardier plants, like peas, spinach, radish, carrots and lettuce are seeded first, in earlier spring, followed by main season crops, like tomatoes, potatoes, corn, beans, cucumber, onions, and summer squash. A further planting timed for harvest in the cooler fall conditions might include more spinach and carrots, winter squash, cabbage, and rutabaga. Harvesting is done at least weekly, by hand, sometimes with part-time help, and produce is sorted, washed and sold fresh at the local farmers' market, and from an on-farm stand. A pick-up truck is used for short distance transport of crops and other farm materials. The workflow is a steady cycle of planting and harvesting right through the growing season, and usually comes to an end in the cold winter months. A somewhat larger market garden operation, ranging from 10 to 100 acres (40,000 to 400,000 m¬≤), may be referred to as intensive mixed vegetable production, although the essential business and farming tasks are the same. Such operations are often run by a full-time farmer or farm family, and a few full- time employees. The tractor is relied upon for many tasks, and manual labor requirements, particularly for setting transplants and harvesting, are often significant, with crews of 10, 20 or more people employed seasonally. This has led in the U.S. to groups of \\"transient\\" or \\"migrant\\" workers who follow the harvest seasons to different farms across the country. In cooler climates, greenhouses are generally used to produce transplants, and sometimes greenhouse production is extended through winter or with hydroponics. Harvest and post-harvest handling are more sophisticated at the larger scale, with some mechanized harvest and processing equipment, walk-in coolers, and refrigerated delivery vehicles.

There is a loss of the ability to move the shoulder, both voluntarily and by others, in multiple directions. The shoulder itself; however, does not generally hurt significantly when touched. Muscle loss around the shoulder may also occur. Onset is gradual over weeks to months. Complications can include fracture of the humerus or biceps tendon rupture. The cause in most cases is unknown. The condition can also occur after injury or surgery to the shoulder. Risk factors include diabetes and thyroid disease. The underlying mechanism involves Inflammation and scarring. The diagnosis is generally based on a person's symptoms and a physical exam. The diagnosis may be supported by an MRI. The condition often resolves over time without intervention but this may take several years. While a number of treatments such as NSAIDs, physical therapy, steroids, and injecting the shoulder at high pressure may be tried it is unclear what is best. Surgery may be suggested for those who do not get better after a few months. About 4% of people are affected. It is more common in people 40‚Äì60 years of age and in women.  Signs and symptoms  Symptoms include shoulder pain and limited range of motion although these symptoms are common in many shoulder conditions. An important symptom of adhesive capsulitis is the severity of stiffness that often makes it nearly impossible to carry out simple arm movements. Pain due to frozen shoulder is usually dull or aching and may be worse at night and with any motion. The symptoms of primary frozen shoulder has been described as having three or four stages. Sometimes a prodromal stage is described that can be present up to three months prior to the shoulder freezing. During this stage people describe sharp pain at end ranges of motion, achy pain at rest, and sleep disturbances. * Stage one: The \\"freezing\\" or painful stage, which may last from six weeks to nine months, and in which the patient has a slow onset of pain. As the pain worsens, the shoulder loses motion. * Stage two: The \\"frozen\\" or adhesive stage is marked by a slow improvement in pain but the stiffness remains. This stage generally lasts from four to nine months. * Stage three: The \\"thawing\\" or recovery, when shoulder motion slowly returns toward normal. This generally lasts from 5 to 26 months. Physical exam findings include restricted range of motion in all planes of movement in both active and passive range of motion. This contrasts with conditions such as shoulder impingement syndrome or rotator cuff tendinitis in which the active range of motion is restricted but passive range of motion is normal. Some exam maneuvers of the shoulder may be impossible due to pain.  Causes  The causes of adhesive capsulitis are incompletely understood, however there are several factors associated with higher risk. Risk factors for secondary adhesive capsulitis include injury or surgery that lead to prolonged immobility. Risk factors for primary, or idiopathic adhesive capsulitis include many systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, stroke, lung disease, connective tissue diseases, thyroid disease, heart disease, autoimmune disease, and Dupuytren's contracture. Both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are risk factors for the condition. = Primary = Primary adhesive capsulitis, also known as idiopathic adhesive capsulitis occurs with no known trigger. It is more likely to develop in the non-dominant arm. = Secondary = Secondary adhesive capsulitis develops after an injury or surgery to the shoulder.  Pathophysiology  The underlying pathophysiology is incompletely understood but is generally accepted to have both inflammatory and fibrotic components. The hardening of the shoulder joint capsule is central to the disease process. This is the result of scar tissue (adhesions) around the joint capsule. There also may be reduction in synovial fluid, which normally helps the shoulder joint, a ball and socket joint, move by lubricating the gap between the humerus (upper arm bone) and the socket in the shoulder blade. In the painful stage (stage I), there is evidence of inflammatory cytokines in the joint fluid. Later stages are characterized by dense collagenous tissue in the joint capsule. Under the microscope the appearance of shoulder joint capsule is very similar to the tissue which stops the fingers from moving in Dupuytren‚Äôs contracture, a fairly common condition where the little finger curls into the palm.  Diagnosis  Adhesive capsulitis can be diagnosed by history and physical exam. It is often a diagnosis of exclusion as other causes of shoulder pain and stiffness must first be ruled out. On physical exam, adhesive capsulitis can be diagnosed if limits of the active range of motion are the same or similar to the limits to the passive range of motion. The movement that is most severely inhibited is external rotation of the shoulder. Imaging studies are not required for diagnosis but may be used to rule out other causes of pain. Radiographs are often normal but imaging features of adhesive capsulitis can be seen on ultrasound or non-contrast MRI. Ultrasound and MRI can help in diagnosis by assessing the coracohumeral ligament, with a width of greater than 3 mm being 60% sensitive and 95% specific for the diagnosis. Shoulders with adhesive capsulitis also characteristically fibrose and thicken at the axillary pouch and rotator interval, best seen as dark signal on T1 sequences with edema and inflammation on T2 sequences. A finding on ultrasound associated with adhesive capsulitis is hypoechoic material surrounding the long head of the biceps tendon at the rotator interval, reflecting fibrosis. In the painful stage, such hypoechoic material may demonstrate increased vascularity with Doppler ultrasound.Arend CF. Ultrasound of the Shoulder. Master Medical Books, 2013. Chapter on ultrasound findings of adhesive capsulitis available at ShoulderUS.com  Management  Management of this disorder focuses on restoring joint movement and reducing shoulder pain, involving medications, physical therapy, or surgery. Treatment may continue for months; there is no strong evidence to favor any particular approach. Medications such as NSAIDs can be used for pain control. Corticosteroids are used in some cases either through local injection or systemically. Oral steroids may provide short-term benefits in range of movement and pain but have side effects such as hyperglycemia. Steroid injections compared to physical therapy have similar effect in improving shoulder function and decreasing pain. The benefits of steroid injections appear to be short-term. It is unclear whether ultrasound guided injections can improve pain or function over anatomy-guided injections. The role for physical therapy in adhesive capsulitis is not settled. Physical therapy is utilized as an initial treatment in adhesive capsulitis or frozen shoulder with the use of range of motion (ROM) exercises and manual therapy techniques of shoulder joint to restore range and function. A low-dose corticosteroid injection and home exercise programs in those with symptoms less than 6 months may be useful. There may be some benefit with manual therapy and stretching as part of a rehabilitation program but due to the time required such use should be carefully considered. Physical therapists may utilize joint mobilizations directly at the glenohumeral joint to decrease pain, increase function, and increase range of motion as another form of treatment. There are some studies that have shown that intensive passive stretching can promote healing. Additional interventions include modalities such as ultrasound, shortwave diathermy, laser therapy and electrical stimulation. Another osteopathic technique used to treat the shoulder is called the Spencer technique. Mobilization techniques and other therapeutic modalities are most commonly used by physical therapist, however there is not strong evidence that these methods can change the course of the disease. If these measures are unsuccessful, more aggressive interventions such as surgery can be trialed. Manipulation of the shoulder under general anesthesia to break up the adhesions is sometimes used. Hydrodilatation or distension arthrography is controversial. However, some studies show that arthrographic distension may play a positive role in reducing pain and improve range of movement and function. Surgery to cut the adhesions (capsular release) may be indicated in prolonged and severe cases; the procedure is usually performed by arthroscopy. Surgical evaluation of other problems with the shoulder, e.g., subacromial bursitis or rotator cuff tear may be needed. Resistant adhesive capsulitis may respond to open release surgery. This technique allows the surgeon to find and correct the underlying cause of restricted glenohumeral movement such as contracture of coracohumeral ligament and rotator interval. Physical therapy may achieve improved results after surgical procedure and postoperative rehabilitation.  Prognosis  Most cases of adhesive capsulitis are self limiting but may take 1‚Äì3 years to fully resolve. Pain and stiffness may not completely resolve in 20-50% of people.  Epidemiology  Adhesive capsulitis newly affects approximately 0.75% to 5.0% percent of people a year. Rates are higher in people with diabetes (10‚Äì46%). Following breast surgery, some known complications include loss of shoulder range of motion (ROM) and reduced functional mobility in the involved arm. Occurrence is rare in children and people under 40 with highest prevalence between 40 and 70 years of age. The condition is more common in women than in men (70% of patients are women aged 40‚Äì60). People with diabetes, stroke, lung disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or heart disease are at a higher risk for frozen shoulder. Symptoms in people with diabetes may be more protracted than in the non-diabetic population.

It runs from the Manhattan Bridge south-southeastward to Jamaica Bay, where it joins the Marine Parkway‚ÄìGil Hodges Memorial Bridge, which connects Brooklyn to the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens. The north end was extended from Fulton Street to the Manhattan Bridge as \\"Flatbush Avenue Extension\\".Pollak, Michael. \\"Twain's Magical Mystery Tour\\", The New York Times, June 18, 2006. Accessed December 9, 2007. \\"The Flatbush Avenue extension was built 100 years ago through the 1850s-era Vinegar Hill neighborhood to connect Flatbush Avenue with the anticipated Manhattan Bridge, which opened in 1909.\\" Flatbush Avenue, including the extension, is long. The avenue is a four-lane street throughout the majority of its run. North of Atlantic Avenue and south of Utica Avenue, it is a six- lane-wide median-divided street. Effect on street grid The diagonal path of Flatbush Avenue creates a unique street pattern in every neighborhood it touches. It is the central artery of the borough, carrying traffic to and from Manhattan past landmarks such as MetroTech Center, City Point, the Fulton Mall, Junior's, Long Island University Brooklyn, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Long Island Rail Road's Atlantic Terminal, the Barclays Center, Grand Army Plaza, the Brooklyn Public Library, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Prospect Park, Erasmus Hall High School, Kings Theatre, Brooklyn College, and Floyd Bennett Field. Flatbush Avenue is the border of Prospect Heights/Park Slope and many other neighborhoods. Other main Brooklyn thoroughfares start at Flatbush Avenue, including Ocean Avenue and Empire Boulevard (both at Willink Plaza), Linden Boulevard, Eastern Parkway, and Utica Avenue. It was originally a Native American trail, running roughly along what is now the eastern edge of Prospect Park and taking advantage of a low point in the Heights of Guan that form the spine of Long Island. A monument beside the former Flatbush Road, now inside the park, commemorates an attempt to block the road at Battle Pass during the Battle of Long Island. For much of the 19th century, it had a plank road run by a turnpike company. Historic homes line the neighborhoods around the avenue, which in the late 1920s was straightened to its current form. Streets such as Amersfort Place that are remnants of old parts of the avenue remain in the city grid as an echo of the past. Transportation The majority of Flatbush Avenue is served by the route of MTA Regional Bus Operations, though the route also serves Flatbush Avenue south of Nostrand Avenue. Several bus routes also use the avenue for shorter stretches. The New York City Subway's IRT Nostrand Avenue Line () has a southern terminus at the Flatbush Avenue‚ÄìBrooklyn College station, while the BMT Brighton Line () and IRT Eastern Parkway Line () run under the avenue between Prospect Park and DeKalb Avenue, and Grand Army Plaza and Nevins Street, respectively.

It was named after an area in Cork in Ireland where Ford's adoptive grandfather, Patrick Ahern, was born. The estate along the River Rouge included a large limestone house, an electrical power plant on the dammed river, a greenhouse, a boathouse, riding stables, a children's playhouse, a treehouse and extensive landmark gardens designed by Chicago landscape architect Jens Jensen. The residence and part of the estate grounds are open to the public as a historical landscape and house museum and preserved as a National Historic Landmark. Part of the estate grounds are preserved as a university nature study area. Architecture Frank Lloyd Wright participated in the initial design.A&E;, with Richard Guy Wilson, Ph.D.,(2000). America's Castles: The Auto Baron Estates, A&E; Television Network However, after Wright fled to Europe with his mistress Mamah Borthwick, one of his assistant architects, Marion Mahony Griffin (one of the first female architects in America) revised and completed the design according to her own interpretation of the Prairie Style. Henry Ford and his wife took a trip to Europe and on returning dismissed Griffin and used William H. Van Tine to add English Manor house details. In 1913 architect Joseph Nathaniel French was brought in to work on the final stages to complete the residence in 1915. The house, with 56 rooms, was considered befitting but less grand than other great houses and mansions of the era in America. It included an indoor pool and bowling alley. The pool is now covered over and serves as an event and meeting space. It had housed a restaurant. Landscape The powerhouse had its cornerstone laid by Thomas Alva Edison and with hydropower not only powered the estate, but a part of the town of Dearborn as well. It included the estate's garage and on the upper level a laboratory where Ford worked on engine designs. The powerhouse is also built of limestone in the Prairie Style. John Burroughs grotto, Henry Ford Estate Jens Jensen employed his \\"delayed view\\" approach in designing the arrival at the residence. Instead of proceeding straight to the house or even a view of it, the entrance drive leads visitors through the estate's dense woodland areas. Bends in the drive, planted on the curves' inside arc with large trees, give a feeling of a natural reason for the turn, and obscure any long view. Suddenly, the visitor is propelled out of the forest and in the open space where the residence is presented fully in view in front of them. This idea of wandering was one which Jensen put forth in almost all of his designs. Expansive meadows and gardens make up the larger landscape, with naturalistic massings of flowers surrounding the house. The largest axial meadow, the \\"Path of the Setting Sun\\", is aligned so that on the summer solstice the setting sun glows through a precise parting of the trees at the meadow's western end.Grese, Robert E., Jens Jensen, Maker of Natural Parks and Gardens. The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992. . pp. 50, 100-02, 159-60, 164-65 The boathouse, with stonework cliffs designed by Jensen, allowed Henry Ford to travel on the Rouge River in his electric boat. Museum The estate was donated to the University of Michigan in 1957 for a new Dearborn campus. The staff's former houses and a pony barn are used by the University of Michigan‚ÄìDearborn, including a child development center. The main house, powerhouse, garage and 72 acres (0.29 km2) of land were operated as a museum, while a restaurant occupied the former indoor swimming pool natatorium until the University closed Fair Lane to the public in 2010.Henry Ford Estate ‚Äì Fair Lane, University of Michigan-Dearborn Archives.

Early life Born October 28, 1925, in New York City, Starr graduated from Manhattan's High School of Music and Art and then studied at Pratt Institute. Career While attending Pratt during 1942-43, Starr worked for the Harry \\"A\\" Chesler and the Funnies, Inc. studios, contributing to the early comic book features produced at these studios. For Funnies, Inc., he began as a background artist, eventually inking Bob Oksner's pencils. He graduated to drawing for early Timely/Marvel Comics titles, including the Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner. Throughout the 1940s, Starr worked for a plethora of publishers of both comic books and pulps, including Better Publications, Consolidated Book, Croyden Publications, E. R. Ross Publishing, Fawcett Comics (doing Don Winslow of the Navy, 1944‚Äì46), Hillman Periodicals and M. C. Combs. He worked with Joe Simon and Jack Kirby on their earlier romance comics titles, in particular the Crestwood/Prize title Young Romance.Howell, Richard, \\"Introduction\\" to Real Love - The Best of the Simon and Kirby Romance Comics\\" 1940s-1950s (Eclipse Books, 1988) In the late 1940s, he drew for EC Comics, including War Against Crime, before working both as an advertising artist and producing a large amount of work for both the American Comics Group and DC Comics titles during the early to mid-1950s. His DC work spanned a large number of covers, and work on titles as diverse as Doctor 13, House of Mystery, Gang Busters, Pow-Wow Smith, Indian Lawman and Star-Spangled War Stories, mainly prior to 1957. For ACG, he worked on Adventures into the Unknown, Operation Peril and Soldiers of Fortune among other titles.. Accessed July 9, 2008 In 1955-56, he moved from comic books to comic strips with uncredited work on King Features' Flash Gordon. Leonard Starr's Mary Perkins, On Stage (November 7, 1974) Mary Perkins, On Stage In 1957, Starr created the comic strip On Stage, later titled Mary Perkins, On Stage for the Chicago- Tribune-New York News Syndicate. Characterized by a mix of soap opera, adventure and humor, the strip featured tight, realistic graphics and, from the beginning, strong layouts, design and storytelling. He received the National Cartoonists Society's Story Comic Strip Award for On Stage in 1960 and 1963, and their Reuben Award in 1965. He continued producing Mary Perkins, On Stage until 1979. Starr would later cite the work of Alex Raymond and Milton Caniff as influences on the strip's artwork.Ron Goulart,The Funnies: 100 Years of American Comic Strips, Holbrook, Massachusetts. Adams Publishing, 1995. (p. 191) Other work Starr returned to comic books very briefly during the 1970s and 1980s, working on \\"Morbius, the Living Vampire\\" for Marvel in 1975 and providing art for DC's Who's Who in the DC Universe (1986) and for a Superman and Lois Lane story in Action Comics. For Dargaud in Paris, he created Kelly Green with Stan Drake in 1980. This series of graphic novels about the sexy and capable female action heroine Kelly Green, were illustrated by Drake. In 1985 he wrote and illustrated an action/adventure graphic novel published only in France Operation Psy featuring Cannonball Carmody. That same year he was enlisted by artist Frank Bolle to take over writing the strip Winnie Winkle (without credit) which he did until its end in 1996.Carlson, Mark. Winnie Winkle‚ÄìThe Saga of America‚Äôs Working Girl He also ghost wrote Rip Kirby as a favor to his friend, artist John Prentice, in the strip's final years. Starr expanded into animation in the 1980s, as he noted, \\"Started writing television scripts in the early 1970s, and in 1984 I was asked to develop and write the bible for the animated television show ThunderCats, and also act as the story editor and head writer. Moved to Westport, Connecticut in 1970 where I still live today.\\" Starr eventually wrote 23 episodes for ThunderCats.Crichton 2011, p. 81. He also worked on the Rankin Bass series Ghost Warrior (1985). In the 1980s Starr attended as a guest several comic conventions held in New York. Also, he was a guest at the 1982 San Diego Comic-Con, at which he received an Inkpot Award. Little Orphan Annie Leonard Starr's Little Orphan Annie In 1979 he revived the comic strip Little Orphan Annie. The strip had been in reprints since 1974 after a string of unsuccessful artists had succeeded the famous creator Harold Gray, who had died in 1968. Retitled Annie, Starr's incarnation of the strip received the National Cartoonists Society's Story Comic Strip Award in 1983 and 1984. Starr continued it successfully until his retirement in 2000. Later life Beginning in 2006, Starr produced new artwork for the covers to the ongoing series of On Stage reprint volumes published by Classic Comics Press.Mary Perkins On Stage reprint volumes listing To publicize the reprints he was a guest at the 2008 New York Comic Con and 2009 San Diego Comic-Con.

In ancient Gaul the region was the country of the Nitiobroges with Aginnum for their capital, which in the fourth century was the Civitas Agennensium, which was a part of Aquitania SecundaAlexander Riese, Geographi Latini Minores, 1878, \\"Notitia Galliarum\\" p. 143 and which formed the diocese of Agen. From 833 to 848, all the land seems to have been ravaged by the Vikings. Having in general shared the fortunes of Aquitaine during the Merovingian and Carolingian periods, Agenais from about 886 became an hereditary county in the part of the country now called Gascony (Vasconia).Joseph Noulens, Le comt√© d'Agenais au xe si√®cle (Paris, 1877). The first count of Agenais (comte d'Agen) was William I of P√©rigord (d. 920), son of Wulgrin I of Angoul√™me. In 1038 this county was purchased by William, Duke of Aquitaine and Count of Poitiers. The marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine with the future Henry II of England in 1152 brought the county under the sway of the Plantagenet house of Anjou. When Richard Coeur-de-Lion married his sister Joan to Raymund VI, Count of Toulouse, in 1196, Agenais formed part of the princess's dowry, and formed part of the other estates of the last independent count of Toulouse. In 1212, during the Albigensian Crusade, Simon de Montfort captured the Cathar fortress of Penne-d'Agenais and burned Cathars at the stake.William W. Kibler, ed.Medieval France: an encyclopedia, s.v. \\"Agenais\\". At the 1259 Treaty of Paris, Louis IX of France agreed to pay an annual rent to Henry III of England for Louis' possession of Agenais.Harry Rothwell, ed. English Historical Documents 1189‚Äì1327, Routledge, 1996, The estates of Agenais lapsed to the crown of France in 1271. This, however, was not for long; the king of France had to recognize the prior rights of the king of England to the possession of the county, and restored it to him in 1279. During the Hundred Years' War between the English and the French, Agenais was frequently taken and retaken, the final retreat of the English in 1453 at last leaving the king of France in peaceable possession. In 1561, Guyenne was made a province, and included Bordelais, Bazadais, Limousin, P√©rigord, Quercy, Rouergue, Agenais, Saintonge, and Angoumois. Thenceforth Agenais was no more than an administrative term. At the end of the Ancien R√©gime it formed part of the Gouvernement of Guienne, and at the Revolution it was incorporated within the d√©partement of Lot-et- Garonne, of which it constitutes nearly the whole. The title of count of Agenais, which the kings of England had allowed to fall into desuetude, was revived by the kings of France, and in 1789 was held by the family of the dukes of Richelieu.

Macdonald, Cataraqui Cemetery Grave of Sir John A. Macdonald, Cataraqui Cemetery, Kingston, Ontario Cataraqui Cemetery is a cemetery located in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Founded in 1850, it predates Canadian Confederation, and continues as an active burial ground. The cemetery is 91-acres in a rural setting with rolling wooded terrain, ponds and watercourses. More than 46,000 individuals are interred within the grounds, and it is the final resting place of many prominent Canadians, including the burial site of Canada's first prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald. The Macdonald family gravesite, and the cemetery itself, are both designated as National Historic Sites of Canada. History The cemetery charter was created during a special act of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada on August 10, 1850. The Cataraqui Cemetery was incorporated as a not- for-profit, non-denominational, and public resting place. Sir Alexander Campbell served as the first president. Architect Frederick Cornell designed the cemetery landscape. Interments increased quickly when the City of Kingston passed a by-law in 1864, preventing burials within the city limits. The gravesite of Sir John A. Macdonald and family plot, were recognized as a National Historic Site of Canada on May 19, 1938. Cataraqui Cemetery as a whole was recognized as a National Historic Site of Canada on July 19, 2011.

Early life Harold Gray was born in Kankakee, Illinois on January 20, 1894, to Estella Mary () and Ira Lincoln Gray, a farmer. Both parents died before he finished high school in 1912 in West Lafayette, Indiana, where the family had moved. In 1913, he got his first newspaper job at a Lafayette daily. He could trace his American ancestry back to 17th- century settlers. He grew up on farms in Illinois and Indiana, and worked in construction to pay his college tuition at Purdue University. He graduated with a degree in engineering by 1917. Gray approached cartoonist John T. McCutcheon for advice on breaking into the cartooning field. He couldn't immediately get cartooning work, but McCutcheon's influence got him work as a reporter for the Chicago Tribune before he enlisted in the military for World War I, where he was a bayonet instructor for six months. Discharged from the military, he returned to the Chicago Tribune and stayed until 1919 when he left to freelance in commercial art. In 1923, while residing in Lombard, Illinois, he became a Freemason. Comic strips From 1921 to 1924, he did the lettering for Sidney Smith's The Gumps. After he came up with a strip idea in 1924 for Little Orphan Otto, the title was altered by Chicago Tribune editor Joseph Medill Patterson to Little Orphan Annie, launched August 5, 1924. Gray's first wife, Doris C. Platt, died in late 1925. He married Winifred Frost in 1929, and the couple moved to Greens Farms, Connecticut, spending winters in La Jolla, California. By the 1930s, Little Orphan Annie had evolved from a crudely drawn melodrama to a crisply rendered atmospheric story with novelistic plot threads. The dialogue consisted mainly of meditations on Gray's own deeply conservative political philosophy. Gray made no secret of his dislike for the New Deal ways of President Franklin Roosevelt and would often decry unions and other things he saw as impediments to the hard-working American way of life. Critic Jeet Heer, who did his thesis on Gray and wrote introductions to IDW's Little Orphan Annie collections, commented: > Gray wasn't really a conservative in the 1920s: he was more of a general > populist, hostile to loan sharks and speculators while celebrating hard > working ordinary people whether they're successful (\\"Daddy\\" Warbucks) or not > (the poor struggling farmers, the Silos). In the 1920s, Gray even defended > labor unions, having Annie launch a successful one-girl strike against a > boss who mistreats her. Gray's political opinions would take on a more > partisan salience in the 1930s when the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt > polarized American politics into those who saw the New Deal as the salvation > for the working class and those who saw it as the end of American liberty. > Gray fell into the anti-FDR camp and Annie became much more explicitly > right-wing ... There might be aspects of Gray's life that didn't make it > into his strip. There are rumors that he was a skirt-chaser, and that's > something that doesn't show up much in Annie, although you can catch hints > of it here and there ... Newspaper cartooning is like keeping a daily diary: > even if you're writing only about the weather and shopping, bits of your > personality will seep into the work. In Gray's case, the strip reflected his > flinty world view, his love of hard work, his populist spirit, and also his > fear of those he thought were undermining society by their laziness and > meanness. You get a very strong sense of the man in his work, which is one > reason it's one of the major comic strips ... Sidney Smith (creator of The > Gumps) was a giant of his day whose place in history has largely been > forgotten. Throughout the 1920s and later, The Gumps was one of the top > strips in America, loved by millions. What set The Gumps apart from earlier > strips was that, although it had a comic element, Smith also often embraced > wholehearted melodrama. It was the first real soap opera strip, with the > fate of characters unfolding in month-long narratives ... It's an > interesting question why Gray's work continues to be remembered and indeed > loved while Smith has been forgotten. I suspect the answer to the question > has something to do with Gray's skill at characterization. Like Charles > Dickens, Gray had a natural gift for creating characters that are vivid and > lifelike. Annie and Warbucks are the best example of this: both of them are > so strong and forceful and memorable. Once you read their adventures, it's > hard to forget them as people. Gray sometimes ghosted Little Joe (1933‚Äì72), the strip by his assistant (and cousin) Ed Leffingwell which was continued by Ed's brother Robert. Maw Green, a spin-off of Annie was published as a topper to Little Orphan Annie. It mixed vaudeville timing with the same deeply conservative attitudes as Annie. Films, radio and merchandising made Gray a multi-millionaire. He died of cancer at the Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla on May 9, 1968, at the age of 74.Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center: Harold Gray Archives Harold Gray's work is in the Special Collections Department at the Boston University Library. The Gray collection includes artwork, printed material, correspondence, manuscripts and photographs. The collection contains a scrapbook, a short story by Gray titled \\"Annie\\", letters, postcards and telegrams from 1937 to 1967, including correspondence with Collier's, Purdue University, Al Capp and Mort Walker. Gray's appointment books with comic strip dialogue and plots are dated 1929, 1931, 1933‚Äì1935, 1937, 1944, 1946, 1949, 1950‚Äì59 and 1961.

It stretches from the Brooklyn waterfront on the East River all the way to Jamaica, Queens. Atlantic Avenue runs parallel to Fulton Street for much of its course through Brooklyn, where it serves as a border between the neighborhoods of Prospect Heights and Fort Greene and between Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights. Atlantic Avenue is the sole east-west through truck route across Brooklyn,New York City Department of Transportation, New York City Truck Route Map, 2007 mostly serving the purpose of the canceled Bushwick Expressway (Interstate 78) and the Brooklyn portion of the Cross Brooklyn Expressway (New York State Route 878, internally known as Interstate 878). The street connects to the existing segment of NY 878 via Conduit Boulevard, which splits from Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn and connects to NY 878 in Queens. Route description In Brooklyn, the area of Atlantic nearest the South Ferry waterfront has long been known for its antique shops and its notable Arab community, including mosques, specialty shops and restaurants specializing in Middle Eastern cuisine. As it stretches east toward Flatbush Avenue, Atlantic separates the neighborhoods of Brooklyn Heights and Cobble Hill and passes through Boerum Hill near Downtown Brooklyn. This section of Atlantic Avenue is the site of the Atlantic Antic, an annual street fair involving local and visiting merchants and artists, held in early October. Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, 1922 At Flatbush Avenue and Fourth Avenue the crossing of the three major thoroughfares form a triangular intersection historically known as Times Plaza. Here the smaller shops, restaurants, churches and boutiques give way to the Atlantic Terminal, where nine subway services at Atlantic Avenue ‚Äì Barclays Center converge with the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR). The area is dominated by massive buildings, formerly factories, now used by storage companies, and by the Atlantic Center Mall (opened in 1996, with tenants including P.C. Richard & Son and Modell's), Atlantic Terminal Mall (opened in 2004, with tenants including Target) and Barclays Center. All three are products of developer Forest City Ratner. The face of Atlantic Avenue east of Flatbush Avenue, the site designated for the Brooklyn Atlantic Yards, is defined by the LIRR tracks that run beneath (from Flatbush Avenue to Bedford Avenue), above (from Bedford Avenue to Dewey Place), and beneath again in East New York until Lefferts Boulevard in Queens. The Atlantic Avenue Railroad (now LIRR) originally ran along Atlantic Avenue as streetcars pulled by horses. With electrification, other traffic was eliminated from the roadway and Atlantic Avenue became discontinuous. When railway sections west of Jamaica station were put underground in the early 1940s, that portion of Atlantic Avenue became continuous again. East of Jamaica, the railway is still at (or above) ground level. Just east of the Van Wyck Expressway, the roadway narrows to two lanes and becomes 94th Avenue, after which the roadway soon diverges into side streets, ending as 157th Street at Liberty Avenue. In July 2020, the eastern end of Atlantic Avenue reopened with a block-long extension that funnels eastbound traffic onto 95th Avenue, with newly built Gateway Park at this traffic split. Atlantic Avenue from the Brooklyn Docks to Gateway Park at Van Wyck Expressway is 10.3 miles long, with 7.4 miles in Brooklyn, making it one of Brooklyn's longest streets. Pre-electrification maps from 1909 and 1910 show Atlantic Avenue, at that time, continued to the city line. =Other iterations of this road= Short roadways still named Atlantic Avenue exist further east adjacent to the LIRR Main Line within Nassau County. A stretch of road still named Atlantic Avenue, just under one mile long, runs just south of the Main Line from the Bellerose station to the Floral Park station. Just north of the Merillon Avenue train station in Garden City is another short roadway called Atlantic Avenue. Other short segments of roadway called Atlantic Avenue exist adjacent to the Main Line at Carle Place in Nassau County, and even as far east as the approach to the Nassau-Suffolk County line, just beyond the Farmingdale LIRR station. =Other roads with the same name= A four-block-long Atlantic Avenue exists in Sea Gate, Brooklyn. Transportation Disused headhouse of Atlantic Avenue subway station. The Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower is shown in the background. The New York City Bus route runs on Atlantic Avenue from Broadway Junction to Jamaica Center‚ÄìParsons/Archer. The runs on it between its western end and Fourth Avenue. The buses run on this street for short sections. The New York City Subway's BMT Canarsie Line () has a station on this street at East New York Avenue, with another entrance at Van Sinderen Avenue; the Atlantic Avenue‚ÄìBarclays Center station () is also located at 4th and Flatbush Avenues.

Through its achievements and advancements in printing, publishing and typography, the family has lent its name to typographic measurements developed by Fran√ßois-Ambroise Didot and the Didot typeface developed by Firmin Didot. The Didot company of France was ultimately incorporated into the modern CPI printing group. First Generation =Fran√ßois Didot= Fran√ßois Didot (son of Denis Didot) was a merchant who was born in Paris in 1689 and died in 1757. In 1713 he opened a bookstore called \\"√Ä la Bible d'or\\" (which could be translated \\"The Golden Bible\\") on the Quai des Grands-Augustins. The celebrated Abb√© de Bernis served for a time there as a clerk after leaving the seminary. Fran√ßois Didot was a learned man, and held by his colleagues in such great esteem that he was elected to the dignity of Syndic of the Booksellers' Corporation in 1735. He received his printer's charter from the king in 1754. Among the books he published should be mentioned the \\"Histoire des voyages\\" (\\"Story of Voyages/Travels\\") (20 vols., quarto), the first seventeen volumes of which are attributed to the Abb√© Pr√©vost. It was remarkable for its typographical perfection, and was adorned with many engravings and maps. Second Generation =Fran√ßois-Ambroise Didot= Fran√ßois-Ambroise Didot (son of Fran√ßois Didot) was born in 1730 and died in 1804. Fran√ßois-Ambroise Didot inherited the work of his father Fran√ßois. He was appointed printer to the clergy in 1788. Many bibliophiles value the editions known as \\"D'Artois\\" (Recueil de romans fran√ßais, 64 volumes) and \\"du Dauphin\\", a collection of French classics in 32 volumes, edited by order of Louis XVI. He also published a Bible. Fran√ßois-Ambroise Didot invented a new printing-press, improved type- founding, and was the first to print on vellum paper. About 1780 Fran√ßois- Ambroise Didot adapted the point system for sizing typefaces by width, using units of 1/72 of the pre-metric French inch. His \\"point\\", later named the didot after him, became the prevailing unit of type measurement throughout continental Europe and its former colonies, including Latin America. In 1973 it was metrically standardized at 0.375 mm for the European Union. (Meanwhile, the English-speaking world adopted a \\"point\\" based on 1/72 of the smaller English inch.) =Pierre-Fran√ßois Didot= BEIC) Pierre-Fran√ßois Didot (son of Fran√ßois Didot) was born in 1732 and died in 1795. Pierre-Fran√ßois Didot founded a paper factory in Essonne and made improvements in type-founding. The most important of his publications are \\"L'Imitation de J√©sus-Christ\\" (folio), \\"T√©l√©maque\\" (quarto) and \\"Tableau de L'Empire Ottoman\\" (folio). One of his daughters married Bernardin de Saint-Pierre. Third Generation =Pierre Didot= Pierre Didot (son of Fran√ßois-Ambroise Didot) was born in 1760 and died in 1853. Pierre Didot was awarded a gold medal at the exhibition of 1798, for his edition of Virgil. By order of the Government, his presses were established in the Louvre, where they remained during the Consulate. The celebrated Louvre editions are Virgil, Racine, Horace, and La Fontaine. The board of examiners of the 1806 exhibition pronounced the Racine edition \\"the most perfect typographical production of all ages\\". Pierre Didot was also a poet and translated in verse the fourth book of Georgics, the first books of Horace's Odes, and wrote a number of original poems. =Firmin Didot= BEIC) Firmin Didot (son of Fran√ßois-Ambroise Didot) was born in 1764 and died in 1836. Firmin Didot was the inventor of stereotypography which entirely changed the book trade. Firmin Didot was the first to engrave slips of so- called \\"English\\" and round hand-writing. Among the works which issued from his press were \\"Les Ruines de Pomp√©i\\", \\"Le Panth√©on √©gyptien\\" of Champollion- Figeac, and \\"Historial du Jongleur\\", printed in Gothic type, with tail-pieces and vignettes, like the editions of the fifteenth century. In 1827, Firmin Didot gave up business to devote himself to politics and literature. He was a member of the Chamber of Deputies and wrote tragedies (\\"La Reine de Portugal\\", \\"La Mort d'Annibal\\") and essays on literary topics. Along with Giambattista Bodoni of Italy, Firmin Didot is credited with designing and establishing the use of the \\"Modern\\" classification of typefaces. The types that Didot used are characterized by extreme contrast in thick strokes and thin strokes, by the use of hairline serifs and by the vertical stress of the letters. Many fonts today are available based on Firmin Didot's typefaces. These include Linotype Didot and HTF Didot . =Henri Didot= Henri Didot (son of Pierre-Fran√ßois Didot) was born in 1765 and died in 1852. Henri Didot made a name for himself as an engraver, founder, and engine-maker. In 1827, he engraved the microscopic type called 'Non Plus Ultra' that was used for the editions of the \\"Maximes\\" of La Rochefoucauld and Horace's works. This type was so small that, to cast it, he had to invent a new mould which he called polyamatype (1819), because it founded one hundred letters at a time. Henri Didot engraved the assignats, the paper money used during the French Revolution. =Saint-L√©ger Didot= Saint-L√©ger Didot (son of Pierre-Fran√ßois Didot) was born in 1767 and died in 1829. Saint-L√©ger Didot devoted his attention to papermaking in the famous factory of Essonne, where one of his workers, Louis-Nicolas Robert invented a machine to make \\"endless\\" paper, and eventually 'sold' the patent to Didot. Fourth Generation =Jules Didot= Jules Didot (son of Pierre Didot) was born in 1794 and died in 1871. Jules Didot is famous for his invention of round-edged initials, to take the place of the sharp-edged ones. In 1825 he took his printing plant to Brussels and founded the Royal Printing House. =Ambroise-Firmin Didot= Ambroise-Firmin Didot (son of Firmin Didot) was born 1790 and died in 1876. Ambroise-Firmin Didot first followed a diplomatic career and was for a time attache of the French Embassy at Constantinople. He took advantage of his position to visit the East and Greece, being the first to discover the location of Pergamacum. When his father retired in 1827, he, together with his brother Hyacinthe, took the management of the publishing business. They published \\"Biblioth√®que des auteurs Grecs\\", \\"Biblioth√®que des auteurs Latins\\", and \\"Biblioth√®que des auteurs fran√ßais\\", an immense collection of two hundred and fifty volumes. Their greatest work was a new edition of the \\"Thesaurus Graecae Linguae\\", of Henry Stephens, edited by Jean Fran√ßois Boissonade de Fontarabie, Dindorf, and Hase (9 vols., 1855‚Äì59). =Edouard Didot= Edouard Didot (son of Saint-L√©ger Didot) was born in 1797 and died in 1825. Edouard Didot made a translation of Johnson's \\"Lives of the Poets\\", which was printed by Jules Didot.

He was nicknamed La Chilindrina in his early years in Mexico and Enano after. Club career √Ålvarez made his professional debut in Argentina for River Plate in 1998. In 2002, he moved to Serie B to play for Reggina. However, he returned to the Americas a year later, joining Morelia of the Liga MX. √Ålvarez played a significant role for the team that season, playing in 16 games, 13 starts, and scoring three goals and helped them reach the league final but lost to Monterrey. He remained a consistent starter for the team and started a total of 60 games for the team, scoring nine goals. He moved to Pachuca, earning six championships with the team: one Copa Sudamericana, three CONCACAF Champions' Cup, one SuperLiga, and the Mexican Clausura 2007. √Ålvarez has been a significant member in every championship. =Tigres UANL= In the 2010 draft of the Liga MX, √Ålvarez was bought by Tigres UANL in a high-profile transfer. A starter under Ricardo Ferretti, he became a key in the team's offensive for the Apertura 2011 Championship. He scored the goal of the 1-0 victory in the first leg of the finals against Santos Laguna. Tigres won the Liga MX Championship for the third time after 29 years. √Ålvarez, along with Danilinho, H√©ctor Mancilla and Lucas Lobos in the attack, became the so-called \\"Cuatro Fant√°sticos\\" (\\"Fantastic Four\\") of the Liga MX. On December 14, 2014, he received a red card along with teammates Hern√°n Burbano and Nahuel Guzm√°n in the Apertura 2014 final against Club Am√©rica. √Ålvarez and his team lost 3‚Äì0 in the final at the Estadio Azteca. √Ålvarez was a regular starter in the 2015 Copa Libertadores. In the group stage, Tigres played against his former team River Plate and scored the second goal of the 2-2 draw in the home game. Tigres would eventually reached to the finals and lose to River Plate. √Ålvarez played an important role in the playoffs of the Apertura 2015 Championship. Dami√°n, who in the regular season played a substitute role, scored one goal in quarterfinals against Chiapas and one more in semifinals against Toluca. Tigres became champions defeating Pumas UNAM. He came in as substitute of Javier Aquino in the second half of the Apertura 2016 finals against Club Am√©rica. √Ålvarez started the play that dramatically tied the game in overtime, by crossing to J√ºrgen Damm, who then re-crossed to Jes√∫s Due√±as, that finally scored a header at the 119'. Tigres beat Am√©rica in penalty shoot-out. With very few minutes in the Apertura 2017 season, a 38-year old √Ålvarez officially retired from his playing career after Tigres beat archrival CF Monterrey in the first and only League final between the two. After his retirement, √Ålvarez became an instant idol among fans, and is considered, along with names such as Tom√°s Boy, Ger√≥nimo Barbadillo, Claudio N√∫√±ez, Walter Gait√°n and Lucas Lobos, as one of the most emblematic players of Tigres. International career In 2012, √Ålvarez became a naturalized Mexican citizen, having settled in Mexico in 2003. He was called up to Mexico national team on 23 February for a friendly against Colombia; Mexico lost 2-0.

The term is used loosely and can refer to substituted acetylides having the general structure RC‚â°CM (where R is an organic side chain). Acetylides are reagents in organic synthesis. The calcium acetylide commonly called calcium carbide is a major compound of commerce. Structure and bonding structure of the cluster formed from PhC2Li complexed to N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,6-diaminohexane (methylene groups omitted for clarity). Color key: turquoise = Li, blue = N. Alkali metal and alkaline earth metal acetylides of the general formula MC‚â°CM are salt-like Zintl phase compounds, containing ions. Evidence for this ionic character can be seen in the ready hydrolysis of these compounds to form acetylene and metal oxides, there is also some evidence for the solubility of ions in liquid ammonia. The ion has a closed shell ground state of 1Œ£, making it isoelectronic to a neutral molecule N2, which may afford it some stability. Analogous acetylides prepared from other metals, particularly transition metals, show covalent character and are invariably associated with their metal centers. This can be seen in their general stability to water (i.e. silver acetylide, copper acetylide) and radically different chemical applications. Acetylides of the general formula RC‚â°CM (where R = H or alkyl) generally show similar properties to their doubly substituted analogues. In the absence of additional ligands, metal acetylides adopt polymeric structures wherein the acetylide groups are bridging ligands. Portion of the structure of the polymer copper phenylacetylide (CuC2C6H5). Preparation Terminal alkynes are weak acids: : RC‚â°CH + R‚Ä≥M R‚Ä≥H + RC‚â°CM To generate acetylides from acetylene and alkynes relies on the use of organometallic or inorganic superbases in solvents which are less acidic than the terminal alkyne. In early studies liquid ammonia was employed, but etherial solvents are more common. Lithium amide, LiHMDS, or organolithium reagents, such as butyllithium, are frequently used to form lithium acetylides: :{H-C\\\\\\\\!{\\\\equiv}\\\\\\\\!C-H} + \\\\overset{butyllithium}{BuLi} ->[\\\\ce{THF}][-78^\\\\circ\\\\ce C] {Li-\\\\\\\\!{\\\\equiv}\\\\\\\\!-H} + BuH Sodium or potassium acetylides can be prepared from various inorganic reagents (e.g. sodium amide) or from their elemental metals, often at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Copper(I) acetylide can be prepared by passing acetylene through an aqueous solution of copper(I) chloride because of a low solubility equilibrium. Similarly, silver acetylides can be obtained from silver nitrate. Calcium carbide is prepared by heating carbon with lime CaO at approximately 2,000 ¬∞C. A similar process is used to produce lithium carbide. Reactions Acetylides of the type RC2M are widely used in alkynylations in organic chemistry. They are nucleophiles that add to a variety of electrophilic and unsaturated substrates. A classic application is the Favorskii reaction. Illustrative is the sequence shown below, ethyl propiolate is deprotonated by n-butyllithium to give the corresponding acetylide. This acetylide adds to the carbonyl center of cyclopentanone. Hydrolytic workup liberate the alkynyl alcohol. Reaction of ethyl propiolate with n-butyllithium to form the lithium acetylide. =Coupling reactions= Acetylides are sometimes intermediates in coupling reactions. Examples include Sonogashira coupling, Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling, Glaser coupling and Eglinton coupling. Hazards Some acetylides are notoriously explosive. Formation of acetylides poses a risk in handling of gaseous acetylene in presence of metals such as mercury, silver or copper, or alloys with their high content (brass, bronze, silver solder).

Following a long string of defeats, the Taira clan retreated to Yashima, today's Takamatsu, just off the coast of Shikoku. Here they had a fortress, and an improvised palace for Emperor Antoku and the imperial regalia, which they had taken earlier in the war. On the 18th, a Minamoto force tried to cross the sea but many of the boats were damaged in a storm. Kajiwara Kagetoki then suggested adding \\"reverse oars\\" to the boats, which prompted an argument from Minamoto no Yoshitsune. Finally after the boats were repaired and despite the high winds, Yoshitsune departed with only five of the 200 boats carrying about 150 of his men. After arriving in Tsubaki Bay, in Awa Province. Yoshitsune then advanced into Sanuki Province through the night reaching the bay with the Imperial Palace at Yashima, and the houses in Mure and Takamatsu. The Taira were expecting a naval attack, and so Yoshitsune lit bonfires on Shikoku, essentially in their rear, fooling the Taira into believing that a large force was approaching on land. They abandoned their palace, and took to their ships, along with Emperor Antoku and the imperial regalia. In a memorable account in the Heike monogatari, a \\"very beautiful lady\\" in a Heike boat, placed a fan atop a pole, and dared the Minamoto to knock it off. In one of the most famous archery feats in all of Japanese history, Nasu no Yoichi rode out into the sea on horseback, and did just that in one shot. The Minamoto were victorious, but the majority of the Taira fleet escaped to Dan-no-ura, where they were defeated one month later in the Battle of Dan-no-ura.

Plot Jota, a failed musician whose girlfriend has recently left him, is about to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge when a girl on a motorcycle, Sof√≠a, crashes off it. Rushing to help her, he discovers she has lost her memory, even forgetting her name. After telling the paramedics and staff at the hospital that she is his girlfriend, he later tells her the same. He invents an entire identity for her, giving her the name Lisa, and a history of their relationship according to his own fantasies. With the hospital psychiatrist starting to become suspicious, he spirits her out of the hospital and away on a trip to the 'Ardilla Roja' campsite, which he claims they have been planning for some while. As their relationship becomes intimate, their behaviour sparks the suspicions of campers Ant√≥n and Carmena. It becomes clear that Lisa/Sof√≠a's memory is not entirely missing and she is hiding her own past secrets; notably, the existence of a psychotic ex-boyfriend, F√©lix, who is rampaging across the country in search of her.

Biography Dobrila was born in the village of Veli Je≈æenj, Tinjan≈°tina (Antignana) region of middle Istria, which was then and for a brief period part of Napoleon's Illyrian provinces and shortly thereafter the Habsburg monarchy (today part of Croatia). His above-average intelligence let him engage a German elementary school in Tinjan and Pazin, then a gymnasium in Gorizia, and Karlovac where he also attended a seminary. He became a priest in 1837 and took duty 1837 - 1838 in Munama and Hrusici. From 1839 he studied theology at Augustineum in Vienna and finished in 1842. After his studies, he became a chaplain in Trieste, a German enlighter and a principal of a girl- school. From 1857 to 1875 he was the bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Parenzo e Pola - Poreƒç i Pula region and from 1875 until his death he was the bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Trieste e Capodistria - Trst in Koper region. Dobrila studied with and was a friend of Josip Juraj Strossmayer, another Croatian bishop and benefactor of the 19th century. He was a vocal supporter of the Croat and Slovene population in Istria, which was the majority there, but culturally and politically dominated by Italians from the coastal towns.Bratulic, Josip. \\"Istra u proslosti i sadasnjosti.\\" Istra, Vol. 24, 1986, p. 10 During the Revolutions of 1848, Dobrila became a member of the Slavjansko dru≈°tvo (\\"Slavic society\\") in Trieste. He supported the introduction of the Slavic languages into schools and public life, funded children who wanted to attend schools in the Croatian part of the monarchy (in Rijeka and Kastav) and encouraged the peasants in Istria, mostly composed of Slavic people, to read books in their native language and avoid being abused by their mostly Italian lords. Dobrila printed the prayer book Oƒçe, budi volja tvoja in Croatian in 1854, and supported the publishing of the first Croatian newspaper in Istria Na≈°a sloga in 1870.Ramet, Sabrina.

During the course of this period, the Jewish population gradually shifted from the Mediterranean Basin to Western Europe and later Eastern Europe. Jewish tradition traces the origins of the Jews to the 12 Israelite tribes, however most Jewish traditions state that modern Jews descend from Judea, Benjamin and Levi. As early as the Babylonian exile Jews, through exile under military constraint or otherwise, came to live in many other Middle Eastern countries, and later formed communities throughout the eastern Mediterranean lands, constituting collectively a Jewish diaspora. Their presence is attested in Greece from the fourth century BCE onwards in places as varied as Chios, Aegina, Attica and RhodesAlexander Panayotou, 'Jews and Jewish Communities in the Balkans and the Aegean until the twelfth century,' in James K. Aitken, James Carleton Paget (eds.), The Jewish-Greek Tradition in Antiquity and the Byzantine Empire, Cambridge University Press, 2014 pp.54-75, pp.64ff. and in Italy as early as the 2nd century BCE.Peter Sch√§fer, Judeophobia: Attitudes Toward the Jews in the Ancient World, Harvard University Press 2009 After the Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE), hundreds of thousands of Jews were taken as slaves to Rome, where they later immigrated to other European lands. The Jews who immigrated to Iberia, and their descendants comprise the Sephardic Jews, while those who immigrated to the German Rhineland and France comprise the Ashkenazi Jews. European Jews were specialized within the economy as artisans, merchants, and money-lenders. A significant depletion in their numbers in Western Europe began to take place with the rise of the Crusades, which brought about many pogroms and successive expulsion orders, in England (1290), France (14th century) and Spain (1492). With the end of the medieval age, a similar phenomenon was to repeat itself in the Italian peninsula and throughout most German towns and principalities in German-speaking lands in the sixteenth century. Large Yiddish speaking populations arose over these same centuries in Eastern Europe. By the 17th century a trickle back process began, with reverse migration back to central and western Europe, following pogroms in Ukraine (1648-1649).Yohanan Aharoni, The Jewish People: An Illustrated History, A&C; Black 2006 p.305. From the fall of Rome to the Late Middle Ages (500-1500) =Fall of Rome= The majority of archaeological and epigraphical evidence of the Jews in Late Ancient Rome lies in funerary sites, making it difficult to uncover a historical picture of their daily lives or their interactions with outsiders. After the decline of the Roman Empire, the Visigoths controlled large portions of former Roman territory, including southwestern Gaul until 507, and much of the Iberian peninsula until 711. At the start, Jewish communities generally flourished under Visigothic rule in both Gaul and Spain. =Visigoth Spain = In 506, Alaric II decreed that Jews were to be considered Roman citizens and were to live under Roman law. They were given freedom to practice their religion, although efforts to convert pagans and Christians to Judaism were to be curtailed. Alaric also decreed that the judicial autonomy of the Jewish communities was to be respected. After Sisebut took the Visigothic throne in 612, these privileges were revoked, and suppression of the Jewish religion became policy, resulting in attempted forced conversion. There was a brief respite in 640, when Chindasuinth usurped the throne and pursued a pro-Jewish policy. His son Recceswinth, to the contrary, denounced Jews as \\"polluting the soil of Spain\\" in 653, and enacted a new code meant to make it impossible for Jews to remain in Spain. These laws proved to be unpopular, and were resisted by both Jews and Christians alike. Despite these persecutions, Jews were able to help Muslim invaders capture Spain, ending Visigothic rule. =Germany= Jewish migration from Roman Italy is considered the most likely source of the first Jews on German territory. While the date of the first settlement of Jews in the regions which the Romans called Germania Superior, Germania Inferior, and Magna Germania is not known, the first authentic documents relating to a large and well-organized Jewish community in these regions date from 321 and refers to Cologne on the Rhine. These documents stated that Jews could be called to the Curia and owed taxes to Rome, and that Jewish religious leaders were exempt from curial service, signalling that a uniquely Jewish community, prosperous enough to be taxed, had existed in Cologne for some time. During the Carolingian period, Jews had a vital function as importers of goods from the East, and their laws and customs were generally tolerated, although they were not allowed to proselytize to Christians. It was during this peaceful time, that Jews from other communities emigrated to Francia in hopes of better treatment, notably members of the Persian House of Exilarchs, such as Isaac the Jew and Makhir of Narbonne came to Francia and with them, brought a large community of Persian Jews, who later assimilated to European customs. Although these peaceful relations would end with the beginning of the First Crusade and thousands of Jews in communities all along the Rhine were attacked and killed under the presumption that if they were going to attack enemies of the Christ in Jerusalem, they should attack \\"Christ's enemies\\" around them in Germany, ushering in a lasting anti-semitism that included pogroms, blood libel, and being blamed as the cause of catastrophes like the Black Death and the Mongol invasion of Europe. Despite those difficulties, German Jews continued to practice, refine, and evolve their religious and social customs, including the development of the Yiddish language and an identity as Ashkenazi Jews. They eventually established a uniquely Jewish occupation, working as Court Jews within the Holy Roman Empire. =Church laws in the Early Middle Ages= Conversions of Jews to Christianity, whether forced or voluntary, during the medieval period were an integral part of the life of Jewish communities in the medieval period. The pressures to convert, other than compulsory baptism to save one's life, could be theological, economic and intellectual. Voluntary conversion by such renegades (meshummadim) was motivated by a number of facts: a change of belief could account for the conversion, as could the desire to marry a Christian or to escape from the restrictions on life as a Jew, or to resecure a livelihood or home. Such conversions proved particularly devastating for the English and Spanish Jewish communities.Ruth Langer, Cursing the Christians?: A History of the Birkat HaMinim, Oxford University Press, 2011 p.73 By the 10th century, most of Europe was under the rule of Christian monarchs who made Christianity the official religion of their realms. In the seriously diminished Roman or Byzantine Empire, Christianity had been the state church since the 380 Edict of Thessalonica. A privileged niche for Jews in the new order nonetheless remained. The Church forbade Christians from charging interest to fellow Christians; therefore the only source of loans were non-Christians such as Jews. While this status did not always lead to peaceful conditions for the Jewish people, they were the most compatible non-Christians for the position due to their shared devotion to the same Abrahamic God that the Christians worshiped. While many Jews rose to prominence in these times, Judaism was mostly practiced in private to avoid persecution. The descendants of the survivors of this period, the Ashkenazi Jews, still commemorate some of the more memorable tragedies of this period in their liturgy. Their fate in each particular country depended on the changing political conditions. In Italy (see History of the Jews in Italy) they experienced difficult days during the wars waged by the Heruli, Rugii, Ostrogoths, and Lombards. The severe laws of the Roman emperors were, in general, more mildly administered than elsewhere; the Arian confession, of which the Germanic conquerors of Italy were adherents, was characterized by its tolerance. In other parts of western Europe, Jews who wished to remain true to the faith of their fathers were protected by the Church itself from compulsory conversion. There was no change in this policy even later, when the Pope called for the support of the Carolingians in protecting his ideal kingdom with their temporal power. Charlemagne, moreover, was glad to use the Church for the purpose of welding together the loosely connected elements of his kingdom when he transformed part of the old Roman empire into a new Christian one, and united under the imperial crown all the German races at that time. Years after his death, in 843, his empire fell apart, and the rulers of Italy, France, and Germany were more attentive to the Church's desires in the making of laws dealing with the Jews. In the wake of a narrow military defeat over Muslim forces, Leo III of Constantinople decided his nation's weakness lay in its heterogeneous population and began the forcible conversion of the Jews, as well as the New Christians. However, some were able to secretly continue their Jewish practices. In 1040, Rashi was born, and in the wake of the Norman conquest of England, Jews left Normandy to settle in London and other cities such as York, Norwich, Oxford, Bristol and Lincoln, where Pope Gregory VII prohibited Jews from holding offices in Christendom. Iban Iashufin, the King of the Almoravides, captured Granada and destroyed the Jewish community, as the survivors fled to Toledo.Sephardim by Rebecca Weiner. In 1095, Henry IV of Germany granted the Jews favorable conditions and issued a charter to the Jews and a decree against forced baptism. In 1171, after the birth of Rambam, Jews were accused of committing ritual murder and blood libel in the town of Blois. The adult Jews of the city were arrested and most were executed after refusing to convert. In 1210, a group of 300 French and English rabbis made aliyah and settled in Israel. During the Black Death, the clerics accused Jews of poisoning the wells of Europe to kill all the Christians. =Sicut Judaeis= Sicut Judaeis (the \\"Constitution for the Jews\\") was the official position of the papacy regarding Jews throughout the Middle Ages and later. The first bull was issued in about 1120 by Calixtus II, intended to protect Jews who were suffering during the First Crusade, and was reaffirmed by many popes, even until the 15th century. The bill forbade, besides other things, Christians from forcing Jews to convert, or to harm them, or to take their property, or to disturb the celebration of their festivals, or to interfere with their cemeteries, on pain of excommunication.Thurston, Herbert (1912). \\"History of Toleration\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Accessed 12 July 2013. Although the Jews and Christians of Rome were organized into distinct communities, the boundaries of which were not only reinforced on a daily basis but were regularly performed on ceremonial occasions such as the papal adventus, Jews and Christians experienced unusually robust cultural and social interactions, especially as the Jews increasingly aligned themselves with the protective power of the papacy. However, despite the Church official position expressed in the Sicut Judaeis, the Church felt free to impose other restrictions and disabilities on Jews not inconsistent with the bull. For example, the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 decreed that Jews be differentiated from others by their type of clothing or marking to avoid intercourse between Jews and Christians. Jews were sometimes required to wear a yellow badge or a pointed hat. Christian theologians began calling for the slavery of all Jews. In 1229, King Henry III of England forced Jews to pay half the value of their property in taxes, following burning of the Talmud in Paris and the Tartars' capture of Jerusalem. During the Fatimid period, many Jewish officials served in the regime. King Henry III of England ordered Jewish worship in synagogue to be held quietly so that Christians passing by would not have to hear it, giving an order that Jews may not employ Christian nurses or maids, nor may any Jew prevent another from converting to Christianity. A few years later, French King Louis IX expelled the Jews from France, ending the Tosaphists period. Most Jews went to Germany and further east. =Later immigration to Germany= In 1267, the Vienna city council forced Jews to wear the Jewish hat, in addition to the yellow badge. Later in the century, a blood libel in Munich resulted in the deaths of 68 Jews, and an additional 180 Jews were burned alive at the synagogue, following another mob in Oberwesel, Germany. In 1290, owing to political pressure, English King Edward I expelled all Jews from England. They were only allowed to take what they could carry and most went to France, paying for their passage only to be robbed and cast overboard by the ship captains. Philip IV of France ordered all Jews expelled from France, with their property to be sold at public auction, and some 125,000 Jews were forced to leave. Similar to accusations made during the Black Plague, Jews were accused of encouraging lepers to poison Christian wells in France. An estimated five thousand Jews were killed before the king, Philip the Tall, admitted the Jews were innocent. Then, Charles IV expelled all French Jews without the one-year period he had promised them, as much of Europe blamed the Black Plague on the Jews and tortured them so they would confess that they poisoned the wells. Despite the pleas of innocence of Pope Clement VI, the accusations resulted in the destruction of over 60 large and 150 small Jewish communities. In 1348, hundreds of Jews were burned and many were baptized in Basel. The city's Christian residents converted the synagogue into a church and destroyed the Jewish cemetery there. Pope Clement VI issued an edict repudiating the libel against Jews, saying that they too were suffering from the Plague. In 1385, German Emperor Wenceslaus arrested Jews living in the Swabian League, a group of free cities in Germany, and confiscated their books. Later, he expelled the Jews of Strassburg after a community debate. In 1391, Ferrand Martinez, archdeacon of Ecija, began a campaign against Spanish Jewry, killing over 10,000 and destroying the Jewish quarter in Barcelona. The campaign quickly spread throughout Spain, except for Granada, and destroyed Jewish communities in Valencia and Palma De Majorca. King Pedro I ordered Spain not to harm the remaining Jews and that synagogues not be converted into churches. He then announced his compliance with the Bull of Pope Boniface IX, protecting Jews from baptism. He extended this edict to Spanish Jewish refugees. Benedict XIII banned the study of the Talmud in any form, as institutes forced Christian sermons and tried to restrict Jewish life completely, and a few years later Pope Martin V favorably reinstated old privileges of the Jews. After more Jews were expelled from France, some remained in Provence until 1500. In 1422, Pope Martin V issued a bull reminding Christians that Christianity was derived from Judaism and warned the Friars not to incite against the Jews, but the Bull was withdrawn the following year. By the end of the 15th century, the Inquisition was established in Spain. Around 1500, Jews found relative security and a renewal of prosperity in present-day Poland.Norman F. Cantor, The Last Knight: The Twilight of the Middle Ages and the Birth of the Modern Era, Free Press, 2004. , p. 28‚Äì29 =The Crusades= The trials the Jews periodically endured in the various Christian West kingdoms echoed the catastrophes that occurred during Crusades. In the First Crusade (1096) flourishing communities on the Rhine and the Danube were utterly destroyed. Furthermore, there were also attacks on the Jews that lived in cities along the Rhine. Prior to these attacks, many Jews were seen as integral members of society despite religious differences. Many Jews worked in the money lending trade. Their services allowed for societies to function financially. In one case Jewish moneylenders were responsible for financially maintaining a monastery. Without these loans the monastery would have been unable to survive. However, this fiscal responsibility that the Jews carried might have caused tensions amongst the middle and upper class. These sects of society would not have approved of the power that the Jewish communities held. At this point there were no strictly Jewish communities. Jews were not concentrated in one area, rather their presence was spread over a larger geographical region. Oftentimes a few families lived immersed in a predominantly Christian settlement. The Jewish families were comfortable in this setting and functioned successfully. In some circumstances, Christians both accepted and welcomed the Jews. When violence against the Jewish people began to occur some Christians attempted to protect their fellow neighbors. In the town of Cologne, Jews fled to the homes of their Christian neighbors where they were given shelter. Christians discussed the topic of conversion with the Jews. There existed a theory that if the Jews were to convert to Christianity then they would no longer be the target of such violence. There were discussions regarding conversion to Christianity. Religious leaders including Bishops and Archbishops alike tried to spare the Jews from violence. One Archbishop from Mainz went so far as to offer monetary bribes to protect Jewish families. These Jews did not want relief from the exile that occurred hundreds of years prior, moreover they saw the towns in which they had immigrated to as their homes. They were well received members of the community. In the Second Crusade (1147) the Jews in France suffered especially under Louis VII. Philip Augustus treated them with exceptional severity. In his days the Third Crusade took place (1188); and the preparations for it proved to be momentous for the English Jews. After being the victims of increasing oppression Jews were banished from England in 1290; and 365 years passed before they were allowed to settle again in the British Isles. The Jews were also subjected to attacks by the Shepherds' Crusades of 1251 and 1320. Protection attempts by Christians during the First Crusade During the First Crusade of 1096, there are documented accounts of Christian attempts to protect Jews from their violent attackers. The first of such attempts was carried out by the archbishop of Mainz, located in the Rhineland of Germany, in response to local Jews who had organized a bribe in return for the archbishop's protection.Jonathan M. Elukin, Living Together, Living Apart: Rethinking Jewish-Christian Relations in the Middle Ages (Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 2007), 76-77. Although the archbishop at first accepted the bribe, community leaders persuaded him to protect the Jews' money instead of taking it, while still offering them refuge in his quarters. Ultimately, the archbishop's rescue attempt was unsuccessful. Crusaders, aided by some townspeople, eventually stormed the archbishop's chamber and slaughtered the Jews hiding there.Elukin, Living Together, Living Apart, p.78. However, the fact remains that this was an attempt at Jewish protection by a member of the Christian clergy. In another instance, the bishop of Trier offered to keep Jews safe from Crusaders in his palace; however, local intimidation eventually forced him to abandon those whom he had previously aided. Because the bishop had no ancestry or allies in Trier, he felt that he could not muster the political power needed to carry out a successful resistance without the support of the townspeople. Instead, he offered the Jews an ultimatum: convert to Christianity or leave the palace. When doing so, he remarked, ‚ÄúYou cannot be saved‚ÄîYour God does not wish to save you now as he did in earlier days.‚ÄùElukin, Living Together, Living Apart, p. 80. In Cologne, Jews were protected by local gentiles after violence had broken out at the beginning of Shavuot, a Jewish holiday. During the two days of Shavuot, one Jewish woman was killed by Crusaders while venturing to the safety of a Christian neighbor's home, where her husband was waiting for her. While the woman's death may be perceived as tragic, the vast majority of Jews in Cologne survived Shavuot because local Christians had reached out and offered their homes as a means of asylum from the Crusaders. =Jewish-Christian relations= The relations of Jews and Christians were fraught with tensions about the death of Jesus and the Christian perception of Jewish obstinacy in refusing to accept the only faith the Christians knew in the world. The pressure on Jews to accept Christianity was intense. Recent years have seen a debate among historians on the nature of Jewish-Christian relations in medieval Europe. Traditionally, historians focused on the trials Jews had to endure in this period. Christian violence towards Jews was rife, as were ritual murder accusations, expulsions, and extortion. However, recently historians have begun to show evidence of other relationships between Jews and Christians, suggesting Jews were more embedded into Christian society than was previously thought. Jonathan Elukin is one historian who thinks in this vein, as elucidated in his book Living Together, Living Apart. He shows that during the Crusades, some Jews were hidden and protected from being attacked by Christians. Some Jews worked in Christian villages. There were also several cases of conversion to Judaism as well as interfaith marriages. One such case was Jacob ben Sullam, a Christian looking to become a part of Jewish society. He chose to \\"slaughter [himself]\\" of his Christian identity in the hope of being accepted as a Jew in the Jewish community. As Christians sought conversion to Judaism, a number of Jews similarly wanted to convert to Christianity. For example, Herman, a Jew who adopted Christianity to the degree that his family worried that he would reject his Jewish heritage completely. Herman's conversion startled the rabbis and made them fear losing other Jews to Christianity. The close bonds between Jewish and Christian neighbors led to Jewish communities thriving in some Christian cities. Jews experienced economic security and prosperity in their communities, even while enduring constant threats of violence. Though strict constraints were placed on Jews in the thirteenth century by the French monarchy, Jews continued to experience a stable living situation. Although the French monarchy prohibited the creation of Jewish religious centers, friendly relations with Christians enabled them to build a synagogue in B√©ziers in 1278. After being expelled from certain areas in Europe, Jews regularly returned to their old places of residence, if they had previously experienced a prosperous life there. Another such historian is Ivan Marcus. The section of his book Cultures of the Jews, \\"Jewish-Christian Symbiosis\\" deals with the relationship between Christians and Ashkenazi Jews. Marcus claims that the time is written off as a time of intolerance against Jews living in Europe. For Marcus times of persecution were rarities and few and far between. The two communities lived amongst each other and interacted socially on an everyday basis. They interacted at such a personal level both Christian and Jewish leaders thought that the other group would heavily influence their respective faiths. When persecution did occur however it was only the more drastic measures that stopped the close interactions between the two groups. Had the intense violence described in other sources been the standard for living condition of the Askkenazi Jews then they would not have survived the era let alone their culture which is the roots for many Jews today. During times of persecution against the Jews, chronicles show that Christian friends provided some of them aid and shelter. A chronicler tells a story of a Jewish woman who is given food and shelter for two days from a gentile acquaintance during a time of violence against the Jews during Shavuot. This gentile acquaintance is believed to be Christian. Also, the chronicles show that some Christians converted to Judaism during these times. Some converts even sacrificed themselves in order to show their loyalty to the Jewish community. In England, many Jews worked and lived in small, mostly Christian towns. Historians interpret this as Jews feeling comfortable living and working in places surrounded by Christians. Another example some historians use to show Jewish attachment to their place in Western Christendom is the Jewish expulsion in France. After they were expelled in 1182, they returned in 1198. Through some of the Christian world, Jews enjoyed privileges at the hands of nobles and even kings that were almost equal to the local Christians. For example, in the Crown of Aragon, in 1241, King James of Aragon issued a decree that the Jewish community of Barcelona would be given the right to elect members of the Jewish community to police itself and investigate Jewish criminals and crimes within the Jewish community. Once the elected police force caught a criminal, they were given the right to impose fines (paid to the crown, not the Jewish community), banish them from the Jewish quarter, or even banish them entirely from the city of Barcelona. Further, these elected members were given the authority to judge cases between Jews in a court of law. In 1271, King James issued a similar decree with a sense of increased urgency which suggests that things had become volatile among the Jewish community, or that the perception of the Jewish community was overwhelmingly one of a state of chaos. This second decree also increased the rights of the council to whatever punishments they deem to be \\"convenient to the community,\\" including any punishments that they deemed fit. Even after multiple expulsions and persecutions, some Jews still returned to their hometowns. Once they returned, many prospered. In spite of royal restrictions attempting to limit their success. They built new synagogues. These examples are used by some historians to shine a light on a more positive relationship between the two religious groups. These historians believe that these stories of aid, neighborliness, and prosperity are more notable and significant than previously recognized. However, some historians do not agree with this view of history. Historian Daniel Lasker does not see the relationship of Christians and Jews in the same light. He contends that the expulsions Jews in Spain faced in 1492 were the product of the revolts seen a century earlier in 1391. Even though the relationship might have been positive, it ended on a negative note. The expulsions of the Jews in various regions is that ending, with a wide range of reasons behind them not just religion. The reason for the Jews returning to regions they were expelled from was not acceptance as to what happened, but a sense of comfort and familiarity. While Lasker acknowledges that Jews and Christians as having some positive relationships he does not want to write off the tension of the area. =Accusations of ritual murder, blood libel and host desecration= Although the first known mention of blood libel is found in the writings of Apion (30-20 B.C.E. to 45 or 48 C.E.), who claimed that the Jews sacrificed Greeks in the Temple of Jerusalem, no other mention is recorded until the 12th century, when blood libels began to proliferate. Jews were frequently accused of ritual murder and of using human blood (especially, the blood of Christian children) to make matzah. In many cases, these \\"blood libels\\" led to the Catholic Church regarding the victims as martyrs. The Catholic Church canonized children in over 20 such cases. England seems to have counted for the first and most important examples of these. The most influential and widely-known of these is Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln (d. 1255 and written about in Chaucer's \\"Canterbury Tales\\") and Simon of Trent (d. 1475). It gained particular currency because of the intervention of Henry III of England, who ordered the death of the Coping, the first to 'confess', and a further 91 Jews to be arrested, leading to 18 being executed. Nevertheless, the rest were released despite their conviction, after monks and his brother Richard interceded.; \\"The Knight's Tale of Young Hugh of Lincoln\\", Gavin I. Langmuir, Speculum, Vol. 47, No. 3 (July 1972), pp. 459‚Äì482. One example of Christian hostility towards Jews is the Accusation of Ritual Murder at Blois. The story follows a Jewish man and a Christian servant watering their horses at the same bend in a river. The Jewish man accidentally scared the Christian's horse with the white corner of his undershirt and the servant rode away, upset about the frightened beast, and told his master he saw the Jew throw a child in the river. The Christian master, who hated Jews, took this opportunity and had the Jew unlawfully accused of murder. The Christians took the man, along with the Jews who had tried to free him, beating and torturing them in the effort that they would abandon their religion. To no avail, the Jews were burned alive. In some cases, the authorities spoke against the accusations, for example Pope Innocent III wrote in 1199: > No Christian shall do the Jews any personal injury, except in executing the > judgments of a judge, or deprive them of their possessions, or change the > rights and privileges which they have been accustomed to have. During the > celebration of their festivals, no one shall disturb them by beating them > with clubs or by throwing stones at them. No one shall compel them to render > any services except those which they have been accustomed to render. And to > prevent the baseness and avarice of wicked men we forbid anyone to deface or > damage their cemeteries or to extort money from them by threatening to > exhume the bodies of their dead. The charge was circulated that they wished to dishonor the Host, which Roman Catholics believe is the body of Jesus Christ. =Black Death= When the Black Death raged through Europe (1346‚Äì53), the charge was given that the Jews had poisoned the wells.Jean de Venette, prior of a Carmelite convent in Paris in the 14th century, wrote: > As a result of this theory of infected water and air as the source of the > plague the Jews were suddenly and violently charged with infecting wells and > water and corrupting the air. The whole world rose up against them cruelly > on this account. In Germany and other parts of the world where Jews lived, > they were massacred and slaughtered by Christians, and many thousands were > burned everywhere, indiscriminately. The only court of appeal that regarded itself as their appointed protector, according to historical conceptions, was the \\"Holy Roman Emperor.\\" The emperor, as legal successor to Titus, who had acquired the Jews for his special property through the destruction of the Temple in the year 70, claimed the rights of possession and protection over all the Jews in the former Roman empire. =Expulsions= In 1275, Edward I of England issued a decree forbidding Jews from lending money with interests, while allowing Jews to engage in craft, commerce and farming. The Jews, who were driven out of England in 1290, out of France in 1394, out of numerous districts of Germany, Italy, and the Balkan peninsula between 1200 and 1600, were scattered in all directions, and fled preferably to the new Slavic kingdoms, where for the time being other confessions were still tolerated. Most fled to Poland, as it had a reputation for religious tolerance unparalleled during this era. This religious tolerance may have also been a byproduct of the fact that Lithuania was the last country in Europe to become Christianized. Here they found a sure refuge under benevolent rulers and acquired a certain prosperity, in the enjoyment of which the study of the Talmud was followed with renewed vigor. Together with their faith, they took with them the German language and customs, which they then cultivated in a Slavic environment with unexampled faithfulness for centuries.  Spain  As in Slavic countries, so also under Muslim rule, the persecuted Jews often found a humane reception, especially from the 8th century onward on the Iberian peninsula. But even as early as the 13th century the Arabs could no longer offer a real resistance to the advancing force of Christian kings; and with the fall of political power Arabic culture declined, after having been transmitted to the Occident at about the same period, chiefly through the Jews in the north of Spain and in the south of France. At that time there was no field of learning the Spanish Jews did not cultivate. They studied the secular sciences with the same zeal as the Bible and Talmud. But the growing influence of the Church gradually crowded them out of this advantageous position. At first, the attempt was made to win them to Christianity through writings and religious disputations; and when these attempts failed they were ever more and more restricted in the exercise of their civil rights. Soon they were obliged to live in separate quarters of the cities and to wear humiliating badges on their clothing. Thereby they were made a prey to the scorn and hatred of their fellow citizens. In 1391, when a fanatical mob killed four thousand Jews in Seville alone, many in their fright sought refuge in baptism. And although they often continued to observe in secret the laws of their fathers the Inquisition soon rooted out these pretended Christians or Marranos. Thousands were thrown into prison, tortured, and burned, until a project was formed to sweep all Spain clean of unbelievers. The plan matured when in 1492 the last Moorish fortress fell into the hands of the Christians. Queen Isabella of Spain issued an edict banishing all Jews from Spain for acts of, ‚Äòa serious a detestable crime,‚Äô a reference to the purported ritual murder of the infant Christopher of La Guardia, which was tried in court in 1491, and who was later made into a Saint. Many of the Jews fled to the Balkan peninsula, where a few decades before Ottoman Turks had won a victory over the Cross. Sultan Bayazid II of the Ottoman Empire, learning about the expulsion of Jews from Spain, dispatched the Ottoman Navy to bring the Jews safely to Ottoman lands, mainly to the cities of Salonica (currently in Greece) and Smyrna (currently in Turkey). Judeo-Spanish also known as Ladino (a form of medieval Spanish influenced by Hebrew) was widely spoken amongst some of the Jewish communities in Europe since the 15th century. Renaissance =Italy= Italian dukes in the Renaissance era accorded protections to resident Jewish communities for a range of political or economic reasons. However, the local authorities rigorously attempted to impose Jewish badges. Franciscan friars exerted pressure on the dukes to enforce the wearing of yellow badges by Jews which the dukes resisted. Taxation records reveal a great quantity of Jewish contribution to the duchy's finances. The Jewish tax contribution in the state budget was 0.2% in 1460. By 1480 this had increased to 1%. In 1482, 6% of the extraordinary tax came from Jewish communities. This evidence indicates the wealth of the Jewish population and also indicates a possible population boom. However, Jews lost support from Ludovico Sforza on the eve of the Italian wars. =Spain= There was no progress towards inter faith harmony in 15th century Spain. Mark Meyerson notes the silence of 15th century records on the Jewish-Christian relations in Morvedre. In that town Jews constituted a quarter of the urban population and had a significant contribution to the area's economy. The Jewish situation varied across Spain. The Jewish quarter of Cervera was sacked by Catalan troops and they warned Jews in Tarrega of the same fate. These events set off the emigration of affluent converso households from Barcelona. The situation was less severe for Jews and conversos in Aragon. In the kingdom of Aragon the strong Jewish ties to the monarchy, in the form of political support, revenue supplies and assistance, ensured their relatively safer position. The introduction of credit mechanisms by the Jews in Morvedre facilitated the Jewish revival in the region and granted the Jews dominance in the kingdom's credit markets. The Jewish community as a whole generally functioned with economic success. The Jewish economic activity was diversified not only in the kingdom of Valencia but also in the kingdom of Aragon. Jews continued lending sums to non-Jews and Jewish usury was no longer contested in public, and religious relations remained stable and unmarred by violent activity. =France= Jews enjoyed a time of prosperity until the end of the 15th century in Provence. There were no significant legal distinctions between the citizenship rights of Jews and Christians under the statutes of Marseilles. Jews were officially given the same citizenship rights in Saint- Remy-de-Provence in 1345 and by 1467 in Tarascon. Comtat Venaissin and Avignon, both being papal principalities, witnessed an era of peace for Jewish communities who were established there without expulsions being a part of their lives. The Jews of Provence received official protection but this was because of Jewish usefulness for the royalty. This did not, however, preclude anti-Jewish incidences which precipitated voluntary Jewish departures. Once Provence was annexed by the Kingdom of France in 1481, the flourishing Jewish residents found themselves expelled by 1498. Enlightenment According to most scholars, the Middle Ages ended around 1500‚Äì1550, giving way to the Early Modern Era, c. 1550‚Äì1789. The Enlightenment appeared at the end of the Early Modern Era, and was characterized by a set of values and ideas that completely opposed the previous Medieval age. It stressed logic and the importance of thinking for oneself, instead of blindly following tradition or prejudice ‚Äî a huge boon for the Jews. The Enlightened Monarch was an important product of the era; he or she strove to create a cultured, modern state populated by effective subjects, and often began the journey to this state by improving the living conditions of the poor and minorities, which included Jews in most countries. The monarchs tried to include their Jewish subjects in mainstream society, reducing restrictions and passing more general laws that applied to all, regardless of religion. A Jewish Enlightenment occurred alongside the broader European one, originally appearing at the end of the eighteenth century. Known as Haskalah, it would re-emerge in the 1820s and lasted for the better part of the century. A form of \\"critical rationalism\\" inspired by the European Enlightenment, Haskalah focused on reform in two specific areas: stimulating an internal rebirth of culture, and better preparing and training Jews to exist in a christocentric world. It did not force its adherents to sacrifice one identity for the other, allowing them to simultaneously be Jewish and emulate their Gentile contemporaries. One of the most important effects of the Enlightenment was emancipation for Jews. Beginning in Napoleonic France after the Revolution-which was directly inspired by the Enlightenment-Jews received full rights and became equal citizens. This trend spread eastward across the continent, lasting until 1917, when Russian Jews were finally emancipated during the first Russian Revolution.

Part of the mid-to-late 1980s thrash metal movement, they were one of the main bands of the genre to emerge from the East Coast along with Overkill, Whiplash, Toxik, Carnivore, and Anthrax; the latter was co-founded by Nuclear Assault bassist Dan Lilker, who left Anthrax shortly after the release of their first album. Nuclear Assault released five full-length albums and toured relentlessly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, and broke up in 1995. The band reunited briefly in 1997 and then permanently in 2002. Nuclear Assault has released six studio albums to date, the latest being Third World Genocide (2005). Their most successful records are Survive (1988) and Handle with Care (1989), which peaked at #145 and #126 on the Billboard 200 chart respectively. History =Early career (1984‚Äì1985)= After the release of Anthrax's debut album Fistful of Metal, bassist Dan Lilker, a founding member of the group, was fired by the band. He decided to pursue a more aggressive style of music and formed Nuclear Assault with guitarist/vocalist John Connelly, who had been involved in an early version of Anthrax. They were joined by guitarist Mike Bogush and drummer Scott Duboys (later of Cities, Cycle Sluts From Hell and Warrior Soul). They then recorded the first of two demos, which included the songs \\"Stranded in Hell\\", \\"The Plague\\", and \\"Hang the Pope\\". The group's first live performance was at the Union Jack in South River, New Jersey in late 1984. Guitarist Mike Bogush was later replaced by Anthony Bramante. Bramante's first live performance with the group was at L'Amour in Brooklyn, New York in April 1985. Shortly after the performance, Duboys left the band and was replaced by drummer Glenn Evans formerly of New Jersey-based band T.T. Quick. =First three albums and rise to fame (1986‚Äì1990)= The second demo Live Suffer Die was recorded and the band began touring the United States consistently. The band signed a multi-album contract with Combat Records and recorded the Game Over album in April 1986, released to critical acclaim later that year. Game Over was followed by an extended play called The Plague, which was released to coincide with a 1987 European tour with Agent Steel and Atomkraft. Later, feeling constrained by their contract with Combat, the band signed with I.R.S. Records and recorded Survive in 1988. The album reached number 145 on the US Billboard 200 chart and Nuclear Assault set off on a 180-day world tour in the United States and Europe; first as an opening act for Slayer and later headlining with British group Acid Reign as a support act. The next album, 1989's Handle with Care, would see the band at their commercial peak, hitting the US chart at number 126, and peaking in the UK Albums Chart at No. 60, with more touring, including a trip to Japan and a U.S. tour opening for Testament and Savatage. The band released their first live album, Live at the Hammersmith Odeon, in 1990, but internal troubles were causing problems for the band. =Two more albums, departure of Dan Lilker and split (1991‚Äì1995)= Constant touring and recording was taking its toll on the band, and there was a rumor that the band might split. The recording of Out of Order was problematic as all 4 members were in the process of making solo projects. Lead songwriter John Connelly was conspicuously absent from the recording process. He only sang on five of the songs and played the guitar on one (Quocustodiat his only full writing credit), leaving Evans and Lilker to do most of the recording alone. Out of Order was poorly received and during the subsequent tour in 1991‚Äì1992 there was some line up shuffling ‚Äì John Connelly moved to vocals only for a time with second guitarist Dave DiPietro joining in 1992. Founding member Dan Lilker departed to concentrate on Brutal Truth and longtime guitarist Anthony Bramante followed by the end of the year. Undaunted Connolly Evens and DiPietro recorded the Something Wicked for IRS/EMI in 1993 with new bassist Scott Metaxas, the title track featuring in the film Warlock: The Armageddon.Reviews again were somewhat unfavourable,as Nuclear Assault struggled to adapt to a less thrash friendly music scene. After touring Europe and the US for much of 1993 the band returned with a new line up of Dave Spitz on bass and a returning Anthony Bramante, joining Connelly and Evens for more North American touring before slowly coming to a halt in early 1995.The band contributed their take on Die Hard for a Venom tribute album in 1995 before calling it a day. Nuclear Assaults classic lineup later reunited for one concert in 1997 (put on by Eric Paone of 'Candy Striper Death Orgy' in New Hampshire)then, two more shows the following year with Eric Paone on bass guitar in New England before parting ways a second time. =Nuclear Assault in the 21st century (2000‚Äìpresent)= The classic line up reformed once again in 2002 to perform at the Metal Meltdown and Wacken festivals and subsequently recorded a live album entitled Alive Again, Bramante leaving for the last time and adding guitarist Eric Burke in time for several European tours, first with Testament and Death Angel in, then with Exodus and Agent Steel both in 2003. A new studio album entitled Third World Genocide followed in 2005, with yet more touring, including a South American tour with Death Angel. and a headlining European tour. The band released the Louder, Faster, Harder DVD before more US touring in 2006. From 2007-2012 nuclear assault occasionally played shows, returning to Japan and South America along with a guest appearance at the Maryland Deathfest and at the Metal Merchants Festival in Oslo, Norway, in January 2011. In 2013, it was announced that Nuclear Assault was working on a new album, which was due for release in 2015. They released an EP on June 1, 2015, titled Pounder, which featured \\"four killer old-school thrash\\" songs written by Dan Lilker and John Connelly. The band embarked on the \\"Final Assault\\" tour to support the EP in 2015-16. Despite this, Nuclear Assault still performs live with new drummer Nic Barker making special appearances and travelling to countries they have not previously played.

He became known for his experimental lyric, mainly sound poems (Sprechgedichte) in the tradition of concrete and visual poetic forms.  Poetry  Ernst Jandl and Friederike Mayr√∂cker, public reading in Vienna, 1974 Influenced by Dada he started to write experimental poetry, first published in the journal \\"Neue Wege\\" (\\"New Ways\\") in 1952. He was the life partner of Friederike Mayr√∂cker. In 1973 he co-founded the \\"Grazer Autorenversammlung\\" in Graz, became its vice president in 1975 and was its president from 1983 to 1987. His poems are characterized by German language word play, often at the level of single characters or phonemes. For example, his famous univocalic poem \\"Ottos Mops\\" (in English, \\"Otto's Pug\\") uses only the vowel \\"o\\". Of course, poems like this cannot easily be translated into other languages. Most of his poems are better heard than read. His lectures were always known as very impressive events, because of the particular way he pronounced his poems. Poems like \\"schtzngrmm\\" (his version of the word \\"Sch√ºtzengraben\\" which describes the trenches of the World War I) can be understood only if read correctly. It is an experimental poem in which he tells the sounds of war only with combinations of letters, which sound like gunfires or detonating missiles.The poem schtzngrmm He translated Gertrude Stein, Robert Creeley's The Island, and John Cage's Silence.

It was superseded by the Third Assessment Report (TAR) in 2001. Overview The Second Assessment Report, titled Climate Change 1995, consists of reports from each of the three Working Groups, and a Synthesis Report:, p. vii, and see IPCC website. * Report of Working Group I: The Science of Climate Change . * Report of Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptations and Mitigation of Climate Change: Scientific-Technical Analyses . * Report of Working Group III: Economic and Social Dimensions of Climate Change . * The \\"Full Report\\", consisting of Synthesis of Scientific-Technical Information Relevant to Interpreting Article 2 of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the Summaries for Policymakers from the three Working Group reports . These reports were prepared by over two thousand experts, and \\"contain the factual basis of the issue of climate change, gleaned from available expert literature and further carefully reviewed by experts and governments.\\", p. viii. The Synthesis Report gave its purpose as providing the scientific, technical and socio-economic information for determining Conclusions Working Group I, dealing with the scientific aspects of climate, stated that Working Group I subsequently characterized its reports in the First and Second Assessments as progressing from an understanding that the greenhouse effect is well understood, greenhouse gases are increasing (due largely to human activity), and therefore should lead to significant global warming (though lack of understanding limited specific regional predictions), to a greater understanding (despite continuing uncertainties) that global warming continues and is most likely due to human activity, and that very substantial cuts in emissions would be required to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations., Technical Summary, Section A.2, pp. 22‚Äì3 Working Group II assessed whether the range of plausible impacts of global warming constitutes dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system,, p. 27. while Working Group III provided information to help countries \\"take decisions they believe are most appropriate for their specific circumstances\\"., p. 45. Chapter 8: Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes In the IPCC process, a \\"convening lead author\\" for each chapter worked with other lead authors and contributing authors to agree the structure of the chapter, and assign teams of scientists to write each section of the chapter, producing a draft which was subject to acceptance by the whole author group. Participating governments then provided review comments on the draft, incorporated into the assessment which was presented to seek acceptance at a plenary session of the IPCC. The IPCC chairman Bert Bolin had difficulty finding a convening lead author for Chapter 8. After delays, Benjamin D. Santer who was doing postdoctoral research on the topic was persuaded to take on the task. Twenty participants from various countries met at the initial meeting in Livermore, California, in August 1994 to identify the scientific topic areas, and discussion continued by email. At the first drafting session (in Sigtuna, Sweden, in October) Santer persuaded the others that the chapter should discuss observational and model uncertainties, though these were also covered in other chapters. The \\"zeroth\\" draft was then sent out for peer review to scientific topic experts, all the chapter authors and lead authors of other chapters. Their responses were incorporated in the second drafting session in March 1995 at Brighton. In May the entire draft Working Group I report as well as the summary for policymakers was submitted for full \\"country review\\" by participating governments, to provide comments for incorporation at the third drafting session at Asheville, North Carolina, in July. Because of the delayed timing, Santer did not receive government comments for this meeting, some did not arrive until the plenary meeting in November. The Chapter 8 draft report put together on 5 October had an Executive Summary of the evidence, and after various qualifications, said \\"Taken together, these results point towards a human influence on climate.\\" Governments at the November plenary meeting in Madrid demanded changes to how this was worded in the Summary for Policymakers, after extended discussions Bolin suggested the adjective \\"discernible\\" and this was agreed. The approved Summary for Policymakers includes a section headed \\"The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate\\", setting out progress in detection and attribution studies, cautioning that \\"Our ability to quantify the human influence on global climate is currently limited because the expected signal is still emerging from the noise of natural variability, and because there are uncertainties in key factors.\\" Santer was subsequently required by the IPCC to bring the rest of the chapter into compliance with this wording.IPCC Second Assessment Report: Climate Change 1995, WG1. Summary for Policymakers, pp. 4‚Äì5 The summary at the start of the accepted version of the chapter stated that \\"these results indicate that the observed trend in global mean temperature over the past 100 years is unlikely to be entirely natural in origin. More importantly, there is evidence of an emerging pattern of climate response to forcings by greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols in the observed climate record. Taken together, these results point towards a human influence on global climate.\\" The final paragraph in the chapter stated \\"The body of statistical evidence in Chapter 8, when examined in the context of our physical understanding of the climate system, now points to a discernible human influence on global climate.\\" An introductory preface to the SAR written by IPCC chairman Bolin and his co-chairs John T. Houghton and L. Gylvan Meira Filho highlighted \\"that observations suggest 'a discernible human influence on global climate', one of the key findings of this report, adds an important new dimension to discussion of the climate issue.\\"IPCC Second Assessment Report: Climate Change 1995, WG1. ch 8, summary, pp. 412, 439, xi Prior to the publication of the Second Assessment Report, the industry group Global Climate Coalition distributed a report entitled \\"The IPCC: Institutionalized Scientific Cleansing\\" to reporters, US Congressmen, and scientists, which said that Santer had altered the text, after acceptance by the Working Group, and without approval of the authors, to strike content characterizing the uncertainty of the science. Three weeks later, and a week after the Second Assessment Report was released, the Global Climate Coalition was echoed in a letter published in The Wall Street Journal from the retired condensed matter physicist and former president of the US National Academy of Sciences, Frederick Seitz, chair of the George C. Marshall Institute and Science and Environmental Policy Project, but not a climatologist. In this letter, Seitz alleged that Santer had perpetrated \\"a disturbing corruption of the peer-review process.\\" Seitz criticized the conclusions of Chapter 8, and wrote that \\"key changes were made after the scientists had met and accepted what they thought was the final peer-reviewed version\\", deleting \\"hints of the skepticism\\" he attributed to other unnamed scientists.Seitz, F.

Marcus (Ed.), Paranoia Within Reason: A Casebook on Conspiracy as Explanation (pp. 111‚Äì136). Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. . The position of the lead author of Chapter 8, Benjamin D. Santer, was supported by fellow IPCC authors and senior figures of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR). The presidents of the AMS and UCAR stated that there was a \\"systematic effort by some individuals to undermine and discredit the scientific process that has led many scientists working on understanding climate to conclude that there is a very real possibility that humans are modifying Earth's climate on a global scale.\\" Other rebuttals of Seitz's comments include a 1997 paper by Paul Edwards and IPCC author Stephen Schneider, and a 2007 complaint to the UK broadcast regulator Ofcom about the television programme, \\"The Great Global Warming Swindle\\". , in The 2007 complaint includes a rebuttal of Seitz's claims by the former IPCC chairman, Bert Bolin. , in  Debate over value of a statistical life  One of the controversies of the Second Assessment Working Group III report is the economic valuation of human life, which is used in monetized (i.e., converted into US dollar values) estimates of climate change impacts.This has been documented in a number of sources:   Often in these monetized estimates, the health risks of climate change are valued so that they are \\"consistent\\" with valuations of other health risks. , in (p.194 of PDF) There are a wide range of views on monetized estimates of climate change impacts. For example: *, pp.4‚Äì19 *, pp.485‚Äì486. *, in *, in * The strengths and weaknesses of monetized estimates are discussed in the SARChapter 5 of the SAR Working Group III report discusses how cost-benefit analysis (which extensively uses monetized estimates) can be applied to climate change. Other chapters (1‚Äì4, 6, and 10) also contain relevant information. and later IPCC assessments.For example: *, in . *, in In the preparation of the SAR, disagreement arose over the Working Group III Summary for Policymakers (SPM). The SPM is written by a group of IPCC authors, who then discuss the draft with government delegates from all of the UNFCCC Parties (i.e., delegates from most of the world's governments). The economic valuation of human life (referred to by economists as the \\"value of statistical life\\") was viewed by some governments (such as India) as suggesting that people living in poor countries are worth less than people living in rich countries. David Pearce, who was a lead author of the relevant chapter of the SAR, officially dissented on the SPM. According to Pearce: > The relevant chapter [of the Report] values of statistical life based on > actual studies in different countries [...] What the authors of Chapter 6 > did not accept, and still do not accept, was the call from a few > [government] delegates for a common valuation based on the highest number > for willingness to pay. In other words, a few government delegates wanted \\"statistical lives\\" in poor countries to be valued at the same level as \\"statistical lives\\" in rich countries. IPCC author Michael Grubb later commented: > Many of us think that the governments were basically right. The metric [used > by Pearce] makes sense for determining how a given government might make > tradeoffs between its own internal projects. But the same logic fails when > the issue is one of damage inflicted by some countries on others: why should > the deaths inflicted by the big emitters ‚Äî principally the industrialised > countries ‚Äî be valued differently according to the wealth of the victims' > countries?

They began in 1980 as a group specializing in music of the Elizabethan period, but soon expanded their repertoire to include Scottish music, broadside ballads, and Italian, French, and other European music of the 16th and 17th centuries. Their music bridges the genres of classical and folk music. History The Baltimore Consort was founded by Roger Harmon and Mindy Rosenfeld in 1980. Harmon formerly had taught lute at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, Maryland. They performed together for ten years before releasing their first album for Dorian Recordings, a collection of Scottish music called On the Banks of Helicon. By the time of that recording the ensemble consisted of Custer LaRue (soprano), Ronn McFarlane (lute), Mary Anne Ballard (viols, fiddle), Larry Lipkis (bass viol, recorder), Chris Norman (flutes, bagpipes, bodhran), Howard Bass (bandora), and Mark Cudek (cittern, bass viol). Norman was replaced in 2003 by Mindy Rosenfeld, founding member of the original 1980 group whom he had replaced in 1987, and LaRue began an indefinite leave of absence in 2004, at which time countertenor Jos√© Lemos began performing with the group, joined in 2005 by soprano Danielle Svonavec. The group has recorded some 15 albums for Dorian, including a Christmas album, Bright Day Star, and a collection of bawdy songs with the a capella quartet called the Merry Companions, The Art of the Bawdy Song and a 2007 instrumental compilation, Gut, Wind and Wire. Their various recordings also cover a number of the Child ballads.

They were originally used to transport the Saturn IB and Saturn V rockets during the Apollo, Skylab and Apollo‚ÄìSoyuz programs. They were then used to transport Space Shuttles from 1981 to 2011. The crawler-transporters carry vehicles on the mobile launcher platforms used by NASA, and after each launch return to the pad to take the platform back to the VAB. The two crawler- transporters were designed and built by Marion Power Shovel Company using components designed and built by Rockwell International at a cost of each. Upon its construction, the crawler-transporter became the largest self-powered land vehicle in the world. While other vehicles such as bucket-wheel excavators like Bagger 293, dragline excavators like Big Muskie and power shovels like The Captain are significantly larger, they are powered by external sources. The two crawler-transporters were added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 21, 2000. Specifications Diagram of a crawler-transporter The crawler-transporter has a mass of and has eight tracks, two on each corner. Each track has 57 shoes, and each shoe weighs . The vehicle measures . The height from ground level to the platform is adjustable from , and each side can be raised and lowered independently of the other. The crawler uses a laser guidance system and a leveling system to keep the Mobile Launcher Platform level within 10 minutes of arc (0.16 degrees; about at the top of the Saturn V), while moving up the 5 percent grade to the launch site. A separate laser docking system provides pinpoint accuracy when the crawler-transporter and Mobile Launch Platform are positioned in the VAB or at the launch pad. A team of nearly 30 engineers, technicians and drivers operate the vehicle, centered on an internal control room, and the crawler is driven from two control cabs located at either end. Before the launch the crawler-transporter is removed. The crawlers were overhauled in 2003 with upgrades to the Motor Control Center, which houses the switchgear and electrical controls of all of major systems on board; a new engine and pump ventilation system; new diesel engine radiators; and replacement of the two driver cabs on each vehicle (one on each end). As of 2003, each crawler had 16 traction motors, powered by four generators, in turn driven by two V16 ALCO 251C diesel engines. Two generators, driven by two engines, were used for jacking, steering, lighting, and ventilating. Two generators were also available to power the Mobile Launcher Platform. The crawler's tanks held of diesel fuel, and it burned . Due to its age and the need to support the heavier Space Launch System and its launch tower, in mid-2012 one of the crawlers was undergoing an upgrade involving \\"new engines, new exhausts, new brakes, new hydraulics, new computers\\", to increase its lifting capacity from . The crawlers traveled along the Crawlerways, to LC-39A and LC-39B, respectively, at a maximum speed of loaded, or unloaded. The average trip time from the VAB along the Crawlerway to Launch Complex 39 is about five hours. Each Crawlerway is deep and covered with Alabama and Tennessee river rock for its low friction properties to reduce the possibility of sparks. In 2000, NASA unearthed and restored an Apollo-era segment of the Crawlerway to provide access to High Bay 2 in the VAB in order to provide protection from a hurricane for up to three Shuttles at the same time. Kennedy Space Center has been using the same two crawlers, now nicknamed \\"Hans\\" and \\"Franz\\", since their initial delivery in 1965. In their lifetime, they have traveled more than , about the same driving distance as from Miami to Seattle. Future use NASA plans to use one of the crawlers to carry NASA's Space Launch System with the Orion spacecraft atop it from the Vehicle Assembly Building. Early in 2016, NASA finished upgrading crawler-transporter 2 (CT-2) to a \\"Super Crawler\\" for use in the Artemis program. CT-1 is now in the process of being modified to serve a variety of commercial spacecraft. In April 2016, Orbital ATK and NASA entered negotiations for the lease of CT-1 and one of the four Vehicle Assembly Building bays. Appearances in popular culture The crawler-transporters have featured in television and movies. In a season three episode of Dirty Jobs, host Mike Rowe helps workers maintain a crawler- transporter and takes the vehicle for a short drive. The crawler was also seen in the 1995 film Apollo 13, the 2011 film Transformers: Dark of the Moon and the 2019 film Apollo 11. Similar vehicles also appeared in the 2013 film Pacific Rim, used for transporting and launching Jaegers. In the Fallout 3 video game add-on pack \\"Broken Steel\\", the US government survivors, The Enclave, have a mobile base built on and into a heavily modified crawler. In Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, various units are called \\"crawlers\\" and feature chassis based on the crawler-transporters.

Principal characters * Leopold Bloom is a protagonist and hero in Joyce's Ulysses. His peregrinations and encounters in Dublin on 16 June 1904 mirror, on a more mundane and intimate scale, those of Ulysses/Odysseus in Homer's epic poem the Odyssey. The character was inspired by James Joyce's close friend, Aron Ettore Schmitz (Italo Svevo), author of Zeno's Conscience. * Molly Bloom, the wife of main character Leopold Bloom, she roughly corresponds to Penelope in the Odyssey. The major difference between Molly and Penelope is that while Penelope is eternally faithful, Molly is not. * Stephen Dedalus is James Joyce's literary alter ego, appearing as the protagonist and antiheroJoyce, James, Abbreviated profile from World Authors 1900‚Äì1950. Accessed October 16, 2008. of his first, semi-autobiographical novel of artistic existence A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and an important character in Joyce's Ulysses. Stephen Dedalus appears in Ulysses as the character who corresponds to Telemachus; less overtly, he embodies aspects of Hamlet. He is the protagonist of the first three chapters. Subsequently, Leopold Bloom is introduced, and Stephen's interactions with Bloom and his wife, Molly, form much of the final chapters' substance. Other characters * Almidano Artifoni, an opera singer. * Mrs. Yelverton Barry has been described as \\"one of the fantasized sadistic women of \\"Circe\\"\\" who accuse Bloom in the courtroom scene of having made sexual advances‚Äîin her case, of writing to her claiming to have observed her \\"peerless globes\\" in the Theatre Royal, and offered to send her a work of fiction by a Monsieur Paul de Kock. She also features as a character in the play, Ulysses in Nighttown. * Mrs. Bellingham is one of the fantasized sadistic women of the \\"Circe\\" chapter who accuse Bloom in the courtroom scene of having made sexual advances‚Äîin her case, of sending her a letter asking her to \\"commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity\\". She also features as a character in the play, Ulysses in Nighttown, and was played by Bernadette McKenna and Maire Ni Ghrainne at the Abbey Theatre. * Richard Best is a character based on Celtic scholar Richard Irvine Best. Best was an acquaintance of J. M. Synge and Joyce. Best was depicted as one of the characters in the National Library scene in Episode 9 \\"Scylla and Charybdis\\". Best was known to have disapproved of Joyce's characterisation of him. * Milly Bloom is Molly and Leopold's fifteen-year-old daughter, who does not actually appear in Ulysses other than through verbal recollections and letters. The Blooms send Milly to live in Mullingar and learn photography. She is dating Alec Bannon in Mullingar. * Edy Boardman ‚Äì a prostitute. * Blazes Boylan is the manager for Molly Bloom's upcoming concert in Belfast. Boylan is well known and well liked around town, but comes across as a rather sleazy individual, especially regarding his attitudes toward women. Boylan has become interested in Molly, and they have an affair during the novel. * Josie Breen is a former love interest of Leopold. He encounters her in Dublin, and then later in the \\"Nighttown\\" sequence where Bloom re-lives his affection for her. Josie's husband Denis is something of a laughingstock and is in poor mental health. * Denis Breen is the husband of Josie Breen and is a figure of fun. A person unknown sent him a postcard with \\"U.p: up\\" written on it and he seeks to take a libel action for ten thousand pounds. Leopold states that Josie's marriage to Denis was a case of \\"beauty and the beast\\". * Cissy, Jacky, and Tommy Caffrey * Nurse Callan is a nurse at the National Maternity Hospital. She is described as a \\"virgin\\" and attends to a local woman, Mina Purefoy. She is described as brushing a Dr. O'Hare's coat attentively. * Private Carr ‚Äì a British soldier. * The Citizen is an old Irish nationalist with xenophobic and anti-semitic views who engages in an argument with Leopold in Barney Kiernan's pub, ultimately throwing a biscuit tin at him. \\"The Citizen\\" is an important figure in the \\"Cyclops\\" episode of the novel. The character has been described as having characteristics not only of the mythological Cyclops but also of the Irish epic figure Finn McCool.Maureen Waters, The Comic Irishman (SUNY Press, 1984), , pp. 97ff. Excerpts available at Google Books. \\"The Citizen\\" is, in part, a satirical portrait of Irish nationalist (and Gaelic Athletic Association founder) Michael CusackSen Moran, \\"Cusack's creation is a blooming legacy\\", The Irish Times, June 16, 2004 . and Joyce's portrayal operates to expose what one critic called the \\"xenophobic ideologies of radical Celticists\\".Vincent J. Cheng, Joyce, Race, and Empire (Cambridge University Press, 1995), , pp. 198ff. Excerpts available at Google Books. * Martha Clifford is a correspondent with Leopold Bloom, who according to some scholars is a pseudonymous identity for over a half a dozen other characters. * Bella Cohen is the brothel-mistress in the \\"Nighttown\\" sequence, and has a large and mannish appearance. She has a son in an Oxford college. * Private Compton is a British soldier who wanders around Nighttown with Private Carr, eventually encountering Stephen Dedalus. At Compton's urging, Carr eventually assaults Dedalus. * Father John Conmee, a Jesuit priest. * Punch Costello is a medical student who we first encounter singing a bawdy song in the National Maternity Hospital. He is told by nurse Quigley to be quiet. He later appears as \\"Dr\\" Punch Costello in the medical examination of Leopold Bloom and pronounces, anti-Semitically, that the \\"fetor judaicus\\" is palpable from Bloom. * Myles Crawford is the Editor of the Evening Telegraph, and refuses to honour an agreement entered into with Leopold Bloom and Alexander Keyes regarding an advertisement for the \\"House of Keyes\\". * Martin Cunningham is a friend of Leopold and accompanies him in the carriage to Paddy Dignam's funeral and thereafter to Kiernan's pub. There he kindly facilitates Bloom's escape from the Citizen, and to visit Dignam's widow. * Garrett Deasy is the headmaster in the school where Stephen Dedalus teaches and is pompous and opinionated. He writes a self-important letter to the evening newspaper which Dedalus helps get published, on the subject of foot-and-mouth disease. * Dilly, Katey, Boody, and Maggy Dedalus are sisters of Stephen Dedalus. * May Golding Dedalus is the mother of Stephen Dedalus. Stephen, a non-believer, refuses to pray at her deathbed and in consequence, thoughts of May haunt him later in the novel. She states, \\"I was once the beautiful May Golding\\" (her maiden name). In the 1967 film of Ulysses, the American director americanizes this as \\"May Golding Dedalus\\", an anachronism which does not appear in the book, where European conventions are observed. * Simon Dedalus is the father of Stephen Dedalus, the young protagonist in both, and his character is largely based on Joyce's own father, John Stanislaus Joyce. Simon is a passionate Irish nationalist and supporter of Charles Stewart Parnell, facilitating his financial success within Dublin society in Stephens' earlier years. But with the political \\"fall from grace\\" of Parnell, he and his family also fall on hard times. Simon has lost his wife but has continued to maintain an air of respectability within Dublin's \\"drinking society\\" where he is known for his wit and singing ability but is unable to provide support for his two daughters. His and Stephen's paths cross several times during the course of the book but the two never meet. Simon briefly mentions concern for Stephen, who is now living on his own and supporting himself, but Stephen feels only the need to escape what remains of his disintegrating family. The novel presents Bloom as Stephen's metaphoric and symbolic father. * Patrick \\"Paddy\\" Dignam ‚Äì Leopold Bloom attends his funeral from the family home to Glasnevin Cemetery in the chapter Hades. He is survived by Mrs. Dignam and their son Patrick Aloysius \\"Patsy\\" Dignam. The Dignams live at number 9, Newbridge Avenue, Sandymount. As he dies in a drunken stupor, he is considered Joyce's analog of Elpenor, who died in similar circumstances and who greeted his friend Odysseus. * Mrs. Dignam, and Patrick Dignam, Jr. * Dr. Dixon * Ben Dollard * Bob Doran is a drunk in Kiernan's pub and together with The Citizen creates an unpleasant atmosphere for Leopold Bloom ultimately resulting in The Citizen throwing a biscuit tin at Bloom. * Mary Driscoll is a maid who was fired by Molly Bloom who was jealous of Leopold's interest in her. She appears in both Leopold and Molly's streams of consciousness later in the novel. * Miss Dunne is Blazes Boylan's secretary * John Eglinton * Lieutenant Gardner is a British soldier and a former lover of Molly Bloom and in her soliloquy at the end of the novel, Molly recalls fondling him \\"to keep him from doing worse\\". Gardner, who served in the 8th Battalion of the 2nd East Lancashire Regiment, was killed in the Boer War. * Richie, Sara (Sally), and Walter Goulding * Haines is an English student who comes to visit Buck Mulligan and Stephen Dedalus in the Martello Tower in Sandymount. Haines is somewhat anti- semitic in attitude and is in Ireland to study Irish culture. * Zoe Higgins is a namesake of Leopold's mother and is a worker in Bella Cohen's brothel. She plays an important role in the \\"Nighttown\\" sequence of the novel. She is the first to lure Bloom into the brothel and later steals his potato and dances with Stephen Dedalus. * John Hooper was an Irish nationalist, journalist, politician and MP in the House of Commons. As a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party he represented South-East Cork from 1885 to 1889. He is mentioned when a matrimonial gift of a stuffed owl given by \\"alderman Hooper\\" is described along with a number of items sitting on a mantelpiece.Joyce, James. Ulysses, Chap. 6 * Joe Hynes * Corny Kelleher ‚Äì an undertaker's employee who rejects Leopold's request for assistance for Stephen Dedalus who was injured in a fight with Private Carr. * Mina Kennedy and Lydia Douce * Barney Kiernan is the owner of a public house where Leopold Bloom comes to meet Martin Cunningham, and where he has an altercation with the anti-semitic character, The Citizen. * Ned Lambert * Lenehan * Vincent Lynch is a somewhat treacherous friend of Stephen Dedalus, who is present in the National Maternity Hospital in the \\"Oxen of the Sun\\" chapter. In \\"Circe\\", he is impatient with Dedalus' drunkenness and abandons Dedalus after leaving Bella Cohen's establishment, having helped spend Dedalus' money. * Bantam Lyons is a Dubliner who misunderstands Leopold Bloom's reference to throwing away a newspaper as being a tip for a horse called Throwaway. He later shares this tip with fellow gamblers. * Thomas W. Lyster * Gerty MacDowell is a woman in her early twenties with a limp, who lets Bloom see her undergarments on Sandymount Strand. She appears again in the \\"Nighttown\\" sequence as a lady of the night. * Madden is introduced in the novel as a medical student, though he later appears as \\"Dr.\\" Madden in the medical examination of Leopold Bloom where he states that \\"In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum\\". * John Henry Menton based on the real John Henry Mentin, he is a practising solicitor and attends Paddy Dignam's funeral. He is offhand with Leopold, presumably because of his former love interest in Molly Bloom. Denis Breen attends upon him for advice on a proposed libel action. * Buck Mulligan ‚Äì appears most prominently in episode 1 (Telemachus), and is the subject of the novel's famous first sentence: Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. * City Councillor Nannetti * J.

He is later present in Barney Kiernan's pub for an altercation between Bloom and The Citizen. * Kitty Ricketts ‚Äì a worker in Bella Cohen's brothel. and is a lover of another character, Lynch, being almost caught in the bushes with him by Father Conmee. She is thin in appearance and dresses with upwardly mobile aspirations. * George William Russell (A.E.) who wrote with the pseudonym √Ü (sometimes written AE or A.E.), was an Irish writer, editor, critic, poet, artistic painter and Irish nationalist. His first book of poems, Homeward: Songs by the Way (1894), established him in what was known as the Irish Literary Revival, where √Ü met the young James Joyce in 1902 and introduced him to other Irish literary figures, including William Butler Yeats. He appears as a character in the \\"Scylla and Charybdis\\" episode, where he dismisses Stephen's theories on Shakespeare. His collected poems was published in 1913, with a second edition in 1926. * Cyril Sargent is a pupil of Stephen Dedalus and is an uncertain and mediocre student, reminding Dedalus of his own childhood and uncertainties. * Florry Talbot is a worker in Bella Cohen's brothel. She plays an important role in the \\"Nighttown\\" sequence of the novel and is an overweight presence in the premises. She is concerned about the possible end of the world. * Mrs. Mervyn Talboys is one of the fantasized sadistic women of \\"Circe\\" who accuse Bloom in the courtroom scene of having made sexual advances‚Äîin her case, of sending her an obscene postcard and urging her to soil the correspondence \\"in an unspeakable manner\\". Talboys announces that she will horsewhip Bloom: \\"To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets\\". She also features as a character in the play, Ulysses in Nighttown, having been played by Kathleen Barrington and Maire O'Neill at the Abbey Theatre.

The division of a religious institute into provinces is generally along geographical lines and may consist of one or more countries, or of only a part of a country There may be, however, one or more houses of one province situated within the physical territory of another since the jurisdiction over the individual religious is personal, rather than territorial. The title of the office is often abbreviated to Provincial. Among the friars and Third Order Religious Sisters of the Augustinian, Carmelite and Dominican orders, the title or Prioress Provincial is generally used. The Friars Minor, in contrast, use the title in line with their emphasis on living as brothers to one another. History The old orders had no provincial superiors; even when the monasteries were united to form congregations, the arch-abbot of each congregation was in the position of a superior general whose powers were limited to particular cases, almost like the powers of a metropolitan archbishop over the dioceses of his suffragans. Provincial superiors are found in the institutes of more recent formation, which began with the mendicant orders. The Holy See hesitated for a long time before allowing the division of congregations with simple vows, especially congregations of women, into different provinces as a regular institution, and some congregations have no such division. The Provincial Superior is ordinarily elected by the Provincial Chapter, subject to confirmation by the Superior General or the General Chapter, depending on the regulations of the particular groups (in the Society of Jesus he is directly appointed by the Father General). The \\"Regulations\\" (Normae) of 18 June 1901, vest the appointment of the provincial in the general council. The provincial superior is never elected for life, but ordinarily for three or six years. In religious orders with clerics, he is a regular prelate, and has the rank of ordinary with quasi-episcopal jurisdiction. In religious institutes whether of men or of women, he or she appoints the regular confessors, calls together the Provincial Chapter, presides over its deliberations, and takes care that the orders of the General Chapter and the Superior General are properly carried out. He or she is an ex officio member of the chapter. His or her principal duty is to make regular visitations of the houses of the province in the name of the General and to report to the latter on all the religious and the property of the order; authority over the various houses and local superiors differs in different orders. He or she has, in many cases, the right of appointment to the less important offices. For institutes of men, at the end of his term of office, the provincial is bound, according to the Constitution \\"Nuper\\" of Innocent XII (23 December 1697), to prove that he has complied with all the precepts of that decree concerning Masses; if he fails to do so, he loses his right to be elected and to vote in the general chapter. Politics A unique case was eastern Paraguay, where the Spanish colonial authorities allowed the Jesuit missionaries to establish both the Catholic faith and a unique, humane regime for the local Guarani Indian tribes, making their provincial superior the governor of the first autonomous Indian reserve, known as the (Jesuit) Misiones or Reducciones, till 1667, ten years after a Guarani rebellion against increased abuse by the regular colonial authorities: the territory lost its status and was divided up between Spain (then under the viceroyalty of la Plata, previously part of Upper Peru) and Portugal (Brazil).

The cigar-shaped boat carried a explosive charge of gunpowder on the end of a spar projecting forward from her bow. CSS David operated as a semi-submersible: water was taken into ballast tanks so that only the length of the open-top conning tower and the stack for the boiler appeared above water.Tony Gibbons, \\"Warships and Navy Battles of the Civil War\\", Gallery Books, W.H. Smith Publishers, 1989. . Designed to operate very low in the water, David resembled in general a submersible submarine; she was, however, strictly a surface vessel. Operating on dark nights, and using anthracite coal (which burns without smoke), David was nearly as hard to see as a true submarine. Attack on New Ironsides Torpedo Boat David at Charleston Dock, Oct. 25, 1863 by Conrad Wise Chapman On the night of October 5, 1863, David, commanded by Lieutenant William T. Glassell, CSN, left Charleston Harbor to attack the casemate ironclad steamer . The torpedo boat approached undetected until she was within of the blockader. Hailed by the watch on board New Ironsides, Glassell replied with a blast from a shotgun and David plunged ahead to strike. Her spar torpedo detonated under the starboard quarter of the ironclad, throwing high a column of water which rained back upon the Confederate vessel and put out her boiler fires. Her engine dead, David hung under the quarter of New Ironsides while small arms fire from the Federal ship spattered the water around the torpedo boat. Believing that their vessel was sinking, Glassell and two others abandoned her; the pilot, Walker Cannon, who could not swim, remained on board. A short time later, Assistant Engineer J. H. Tomb swam back to the craft and climbed on board. Rekindling the fires, Tomb succeeded in getting Davids engine working again, and with Cannon at the wheel, the torpedo boat steamed up the channel to safety. Glassell and Seaman James Sullivan, Davids fireman, were captured. New Ironsides, though not sunk, was damaged by the explosion. US Navy casualties were Acting Ensign C.W.Howard (died of gunshot wound), Seaman William L. Knox (legs broken) and Master at Arms Thomas Little (contusions).Official records of the Union and Confederate Navies in the War of the Rebellion. ; Series I - Volume 15: South Atlantic Blockading Squadron (October 1, 1863 - September 30, 1864) Author: United States. Naval War Records Office, page 18: Abstract log of USS Ironsides, October 5, 1863 Photograph of a captured David-class torpedo boat (possibly CSS David herself), taken after the fall of Charleston in 1865 The wreck of CSS David The next four months of Davids existence are obscure. She or other torpedo boats tried more attacks on Union blockaders; reports from different ships claim three such attempts, all unsuccessful, during the remainder of October 1863. On March 6, 1864, David attacked in the North Edisto River. The torpedo boat struck the blockader first on the port quarter, but the torpedo did not explode. Memphis slipped her chain, at the same time firing ineffectively at David with small arms. Putting about, the torpedo boat struck Memphis again, this time a glancing blow on the starboard quarter; once more the torpedo misfired. Since Memphis had now opened up with her heavy guns, David, having lost part of her stack when rammed, retreated up the river out of range. Memphis, uninjured, resumed her blockading station. Davids last confirmed action came on April 18, 1864 when she tried to sink the screw frigate . Alert lookouts on board the blockader sighted David in time to permit the frigate to slip her chain, avoid the attack, and open fire on the torpedo boat. Neither side suffered any damage. The ultimate fate of David is uncertain. Several torpedo boats of this type fell into Union hands when Charleston was captured in February 1865. David may well have been among them. Wrecks discovered On January 20, 1998, underwater archaeologist Dr. E. Lee Spence led a Sea Research Society expedition, funded by philanthropist Stanley M. Fulton, to find the remains of the two Confederate torpedo boats shown in various photos taken shortly after the fall of Charleston. Spence's theory was that the two vessels had been abandoned where they lay and were simply filled over as the city expanded.Treasures of the Confederate Coast: the \\"real Rhett Butler\\" & Other Revelations by Dr. E. Lee Spence, (Narwhal Press, Charleston/Miami, 1995), , p. 375 Spence used still existing houses in the pictures to triangulate where they might be. Using a ground penetrating radar, operated by Claude E. \\"Pete\\" Petrone of National Geographic Magazine, the expedition located two radar anomalies consistent with what would be expected of the two wrecks.

After the court ordered mediation in the case, the parties reached a closed settlement agreement on April 1, 2010; however, in October 2012, Winkelmann admitted in court that he and his father violated the settlement agreement with The North Face and agreed to pay US$65,000, an amount that will be reduced by US$1,000 for every month of compliance. In May 2019, Leo Burnett Tailor Made, a marketing agency for The North Face Brazil, revealed that they had surreptitiously replaced photos of popular outdoor destinations on Wikipedia with photos featuring North Face products in an attempt to get these products to appear more prominently in search engine results. Following widespread media coverage and criticism from the Wikimedia Foundation, The North Face apologized for the campaign, ended it, and the product placement was undone.

Flavia Caesariensis (Latin for \\"The Caesarian province of Flavius\\"), sometimes known as Britannia Flavia, was one of the provinces of the Diocese of \\"the Britains\\" created during the Diocletian Reforms at the end of the 3rd century. It was probably created after the defeat of the usurper Allectus by Constantius Chlorus in 296 and was mentioned in the Verona List of the Roman provinces. It seems to have been named after Chlorus's family and was probably located beside Maxima Caesariensis, but their positions and capitals remain uncertain. At present, most scholars place Flavia Caesariensis in the southern Pennines, possibly reaching the Irish Sea and including the lands of the Iceni. Its capital is sometimes placed at Lindum Colonia (Lincoln). your bitcoinCamden, placing Flavia in central England. On the basis of modern archaeology, it's known that at least Corinium was part of Britannia I. Another possible arrangement of the late Roman provinces, with more northerly borders for Flavia History Following the Roman conquest, Britain was administered as a single province from Camulodunum (Colchester) and then Londinium (London) until the Severan Reforms following the revolt of its governor Clodius Albinus. These divided the territory into Upper and Lower Britain (Britannia Superior and Inferior), whose respective capitals were at Londinium and Eboracum (York). During the first phases of the Diocletian Reforms, Britain was under the control of the Allectus's Britannic Empire as part of the Carausian Revolt. At some point after the territory was retaken by Constantius Chlorus in 296, the Diocese of the Britains (with its vicar at Londinium) was formed and made a part of Prefecture of Gaul. The Britains were divided among three, four, or five provinces, which seem to have borne the names Prima, Secunda, Maxima Caesariensis, and (possibly) Flavia Caesariensis and Valentia.Notitia Dignitatum.Verona List. The placement and capitals of these late British provinces are uncertain, although the Notitia Dignitatum lists the governor (') of Flavia being of equestrian rank, making it unlikely to have been based in Londinium. The list of bishops who attended the 314 Council of Arles is patently corrupt but generally assumed to have mimicked the Roman administration: the identification of Lindum Colonia as a provincial capital rests on proposed emendations of one or the other of the bishops from the cities Londinensi and colonia Londinensium. Those emendations are highly speculative: Bishop Ussher proposed Colonia, Selden Camaloden or Camalodon, and Spelman Camalodunum (all various names of Colchester);Thackery, Francis.

Modern scholars usually place Londinium in Maxima rather than Flavia. Birley has argued that Maxima and Flavia originally consisted of a single province, which received the name Britannia Caesariensis as a mark of favour for support against the rebel Allectus in 296. Although Flavia is usually thought to have been formed from the old province of Lower Britain, Birley proposes that Upper Britain was divided in two (between Prima and Caesariensis) and then three (Prima, Maxima, and Flavia). This repeats Camden's earlier theory (relying on Sextus Rufus) that Maxima was formed first and Flavia followed sometime after. Supporters of a later creation of Flavia note that it need not refer to Constantius Chlorus himself: instead, it may have honored any of Constantine, Valentinian, or Theodosius.Stillingfleet, Edward.

The name is actually applied to two distinct but nearby crossings of the range. The lower of the two, at an elevation of , carries two railroad rights-of-way (ROWs) and Altamont Pass Road, part of the old Lincoln Highway and the original alignment of US 50 before it was bypassed c. 1937. The bypass route travels over the higher summit, at , and now carries Interstate 580, a major regional highway heavily congested by Central Valley suburbanization. Of the two railroad lines through the old pass, one is still in use: the ex-Western Pacific line, sometimes known as the Altamont Corridor, now owned by Union Pacific. It carries freight trains as well as the Altamont Corridor Express, which gives its occasional name (A.C.E.) and operates between Stockton, Livermore, Pleasanton, Fremont, and San Jose. The abandoned right-of-way was used by the Southern Pacific, now also part of Union Pacific. This line was the Bay Area's original connection to the transcontinental railroad, from 1869 until 1879, when a sea level ferry crossing at the Carquinez Strait replaced it. The route remained in use for other purposes, but it was abandoned in 1984 in favor of trackage rights on the ex-Western Pacific line. From 1966 to 2008, the Altamont Pass area was home to the Altamont Speedway, which became famous as the site of the 1969 Altamont Free Concert, a large outdoor concert featuring The Rolling Stones and marred by violence. The pass is also known for the Altamont Pass Wind Farm, one of the earliest in the United States.  History  From the time of the California Gold Rush, what is now Altamont Pass was called Livermore's Pass after Robert Livermore, the owner of the Rancho Las Positas and a way station near the pass. After the railroad was built through the pass in 1869, Altamont, formerly The Summit, was established in 1872. Eventually the pass took the name of the town, but the site is now essentially uninhabited.

The show presented five selected news stories of the day, with commentary by Olbermann and interviews of guests. At the start of Countdown, Olbermann told television columnist Lisa de Moraes: > Our charge for the immediate future is to stay out of the way of the > news.... News is the news. We will not be screwing around with it.... As > times improve and the war [in Iraq] ends we will begin to introduce more and > more elements familiar to my style. The show was known for Olbermann's fast-paced rhetoric, historical and pop culture references, and liberal commentary. Olbermann melded news stories, both serious and light, with commentary, much of it critical of Republicans and conservative politics. The show has been the source of controversy due to these criticisms, as well as the host's ongoing commentary against Fox News and his feud with its leading primetime personality, Bill O'Reilly. During the January 21, 2011, edition of Countdown, Olbermann announced that it would be his last appearance on the show, but gave no explanation why. The New York Times reported the following day that Olbermann had negotiated his exit from MSNBC, with a secret deal. After being hired by Current TV, Olbermann announced on April 26, 2011, that his nightly news program on the new network would begin June 20, 2011, and would also be called Countdown with Keith Olbermann. On March 30, 2012, Current TV terminated its relationship with Olbermann and replaced his show with a program hosted by Eliot Spitzer. History =MSNBC period= Countdown with Keith Olbermann debuted as Countdown: Iraq on March 31, 2003, hosted by NBC News anchor Lester Holt; the program featured live updates on the then-unfolding War in Iraq. Countdown was broadcast at 8:00 p.m. on weekday nights, having replaced a cancelled talk show hosted by Phil Donahue. Olbermann--who left MSNBC in the late 1990s-- returned to the network around this time and replaced Holt, becoming the permanent host for the renamed Countdown with Keith Olbermann. The show did not feature political commentary in its first few years, simply recapping the news of the day in a \\"5-4-3-2-1\\" format as the title suggested. Countdown began to attract liberal and progressive viewers in 2005, when Olbermann began critiquing and satirizing conservative media commentators, specifically Fox News and its main primetime anchor, Bill O'Reilly. He criticized Fox and O'Reilly for purportedly deceiving their viewers in service to their alleged right-wing biases, frequently including the latter in Countdown's \\"Worst Person in the World\\" segment. O'Reilly, while not directly mentioning Olbermann, launched an online petition implicitly asking MSNBC to fire him,Time: Bill O'Reilly vs. Keith Olbermann, Top 10 TV Feuds.

In 2006, Olbermann started delivering occasional \\"Special Comments\\" in which he has expressed sharp criticisms of members of the George W. Bush administration, including then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Vice President Dick Cheney and President George W. Bush. While further Special Comments were directed at members of the Republican Party, Olbermann occasionally targeted Democrats as well. Issues addressed in the Special Comments dealt with the Bush Administration's foreign and domestic policies, mainly the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. One of the Special Comments spoke out against the passage of Proposition 8 in California on November 4, 2008, for which he was awarded the 2009 GLAAD Media Award for \\"Outstanding TV Journalism Segment\\". Olbermann's Special Comments were compared to Edward R. Murrow's signature essays.Boyer, Peter J., One Angry Man: Is Keith Olbermann changing TV news? In the New Yorker, June 23, 2008. On two occasions, guest hosts for Countdown proved popular enough to be given their own MSNBC shows, contributing to a widespread perception of MSNBC being a left-leaning network. In 2008, Air America Radio personality Rachel Maddow hosted Countdown in Olbermann's absence, leading to the debut of her own program, The Rachel Maddow Show. In 2009, left-wing political analyst Lawrence O'Donnell hosted Countdown for an extended period, leading to the eventual launch of his show The Last Word. Subsequent guest hosts included progressive radio hosts Cenk Uygur and Sam Seder, Obama biographer Richard Wolffe, journalist Chris Hayes, and DNC chairman Howard Dean. Hiatus and first cancellation On October 28, 2010, five days before the 2010 U.S. elections, Olbermann donated $2,400 each to three Democratic candidates for Congress: Kentucky Senate candidate Jack Conway, and Arizona Democratic Representatives Raul Grijalva and Gabrielle Giffords. In response, MSNBC President Phil Griffin suspended Olbermann indefinitely without pay on November 5, for violating a network policy regarding political contributions which required prior approval from management. An online petition calling for his reinstatement received over 250,000 signatures, and two days after the suspension began, Griffin announced that Olbermann would return to the air starting with the November 9 program. On the January 21, 2011, episode of Countdown, Olbermann abruptly announced that the show would be his final MSNBC broadcast.Keith Olbermann signs off from MSNBC, CNN.com, 22 January 2011 Olbermann thanked viewers, producers, and technical staff for his show's eight-year success. However, he did not thank Griffin or NBC News president Steve Capus. Neither Olbermann nor MSNBC divulged the reason for the cancellation. Many liberal bloggers and commentators blamed the cable operator Comcast for Olbermann's departure, accusing the company of silencing the host for political purposes just days after acquiring NBC Universal on January 18.Critics see Comcast's hand in Olbermann departure from MSNBC, The Hill, 22 January 2011Olbermann Fired Because of Comcast via TMZ - Stance on Net Neutrality To Blame?, The Daily Kos, 21 January 2011 Statements from MSNBC and Comcast denied this allegation.

In subsequent interviews, Olbermann went into greater detail about the circumstances surrounding his exit from MSNBC. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter published on June 7, 2011, Olbermann said he had faced increasing opposition from network management after Tim Russert died in 2008, because the Meet the Press moderator had been his ally and a peacemaker at the network. He further stated that \\"there were lots of people who were forced to choose sides\\" over his presence at MSNBC, including Maddow. Olbermann further stated that he didn't know he had been released from his MSNBC contract until less than a half-hour before his on-air farewell.Keith Olbermann Breaks Silence On MSNBC Exit; Could Earn $100M at Current TV, The Hollywood Reporter, 7 June 2011 However, Olbermann's 2012 breach-of-contract lawsuit against Current TV indicated that Olbermann had been moved to leave MSNBC by Current founders Al Gore and Joel Hyatt. The lawsuit alleged that Gore and Hyatt had attempted to court Olbermann despite being informed that he had two years remaining on his MSNBC contract, and reached an agreement for him to join the network the same month as his departure from MSNBC, according to court documents acquired by Warner Bros.-owned TMZ. =Current TV period= On February 8, Olbermann announced that he had been hired as the host of a new primetime show on Current TV, the cable television network founded by former vice president Al Gore and businessman Joel Hyatt; in April, it was announced that the show would retain the Countdown title.

By the fall of 2011, Olbermann came into conflict with Current TV management over production values and creative control, and nearly left the network.Al Gore's Desperate Bid to Keep Keith Olbermann‚Äîand Save Current TV, The Daily Beast, 6 February 2012 Second cancellation On March 30, 2012, Current TV terminated its relationship with Olbermann, thereby cancelling Countdown for a second time. In its statement, Current TV cited Olbermann's implied lack of \\"respect, openness, collegiality, and loyalty to our viewers.\\" Internal sources reported that Olbermann's repeated absences, his failure to promote Current TV, and disparaging public comments he had made about the network contributed to the decision to fire him.Current TV Fires Keith Olbermann, Replaces Him With Spitzer Immediately, Olbermann to Sue, ThinkProgress, 30 March 2012 Olbermann called Current TV's claims \\"untrue\\" and sued the network for breach-of-contract, demanding $50 million in damages.Acid-tongued broadcaster Keith Olbermann gets the boot from Al Gore's Current TV, The Christian Science Monitor, 31 March 2012 A counter-suit by Current TV cited Olbermann's work absences, as well as his allegedly abusive treatment of executives and staff.Current TV Counter-Sues Keith Olbermann, TVNewser.com, 6 April 2012 In March 2013, Olbermann and Current TV reached a settlement, with Olbermann receiving an undisclosed amount.Keith Olbermann Settles $50 Million Lawsuit Against Current TV and Al Gore, Forbes, 13 March 2013 On his April 3, 2012 appearance on CBS's Late Show with David Letterman, Olbermann showed concern for his viewers and the production crew on Countdown, stating that \\"I screwed up. I screwed up really big on this.\\" Olbermann referred to production issues, in-fighting and key absences during political events as the primary reasons that ended with Current TV's decision to pull Countdown from the network lineup. About the show The show's theme music was the opening bars of the second movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, a nod to NBC's Huntley- Brinkley Report and NBC Nightly News themes from the 1960s and 1970s. During the opening sequence of each nightly episode, Olbermann, in voice-over, previewed upcoming stories after asking, \\"Which of these stories will you be talking about tomorrow?\\" On MSNBC, the stories featured in the show's \\"countdown\\" was introduced by a \\"5-4-3-2-1\\" format; this format, however, was downplayed after Countdown move to Current TV. =Special comments= =\\"Worst Person in the World\\" segment= The \\"Worst Person in the World\\" segment was a nightly feature in which Olbermann recounts three news stories involving people saying or doing things that offended Olbermann. \\"Nominees\\" for the dubious \\"Worst Person in the World\\" award are declared \\"worse\\", \\"worser\\", and \\"worst\\", which Olbermann refers to as bronze, silver, and gold levels, respectively. While many of his targets are not political, the overwhelming majority are conservatives, Fox News personalities, Tea Party activists, and, at the time, Bush Administration officials. The segment is introduced by Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor. On a few occasions, during the show's MSNBC run, the segment was either briefly suspended or renamed in response to concerns that it contributed to an atmosphere of political divisiveness.Keith Olbermann‚Äôs ‚ÄòWorst Person‚Äô Suspension Over? According to his Twitter It is , TVNewser, 17 November 2010 Based on this segment of the show, a book titled The Worst Person in the World was published in September 2006. It includes transcripts of segments that aired from this feature's inception on July 1, 2005, through May 31, 2006, as well as some original material. Another such book, Pitchforks and Torches‚Äînamed after Olbermann's catchphrase in introducing the segment‚Äîwas released in 2010. On October 7, 2020, Olbermann revived the \\"Worst Person in the World\\" branding for a current-events webseries, delivering an extended commentary on one selected individual followed by a brief rundown of other news headlines.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE-GxWyhw_Q&feature;=youtu.be =\\"Time Marches On\\" segment= The \\"Time Marches On\\" segment was another nightly feature, in which Olbermann shows footage of strange news stories from around the world. The segment was originally called \\"Oddball\\", as a reference to the MSNBC program Hardball with Chris Matthews. =The \\"Keith number\\"= During the 2008 U.S. Presidential Primary season, Olbermann began using the term \\"Keith number\\" in reference to the sum of a pre-election opinion poll's margin of error and the percentage of respondents who are undecided. Olbermann believes this value tends to be predictive of the extent to which a poll may vary from actual election results, and also of the volatility of the electorate's leanings. To summarize: * The greater the poll's margin of error, the farther the results may be from the current views of the voters. * The more undecided voters, the more likely voters are to change their views in the future. On the January 11, 2008, episode of Countdown, Olbermann described the number as follows: Olbermann's \\"Keith number\\" is unrelated (mathematically or otherwise) to the more traditional use of the term. Criticism and response The Media Research Center, a conservative media watchdog group, was critical of Olbermann and his coverage, issuing a press release describing Olbermann's November 1, 2006 Special Comment as \\"preaching hate speech\\", and describing Olbermann as \\"a brown-shirted left-winger spew[ing] hate from an NBC-owned podium.\\" In response, Olbermann named MRC founder Brent Bozell - whom he has described variously as \\"Redbeard the pirate\\", and \\"humorist\\", - the \\"worst person in the world\\" for various comments he has made about Countdown and other topics. Olbermann, in an interview with the Hartford Courant, claimed that the MRC desires \\"an institutionalized, pro-Republican slant\\" in the media.Hartford Courant: March 15, 2005. Olbermann has addressed the assertions of liberal bias by stating that he would be equally critical of a Democratic president who had invited criticism by his actions: > \\"I mean, no one in 1998, no one accused me of being a liberal in 1998 > because I was covering the Lewinsky scandal. And whatever I had to do about > it, I tried to be fair and honest and as accurate and as informed as > possible, and allow my viewer to be the same way. And nowadays it's the same > thing.

However, Howard Kurtz has written that Olbermann departed MSNBC the first time as a result of the Clinton-Lewinsky coverage, which he did not personally agree with. Elsewhere, Los Angeles Times TV critic Howard Rosenberg commented on the show's absence of guests who challenged Olbermann's views, writing \\"'Countdown' is more or less an echo chamber in which Olbermann and like- minded bobbleheads nod at each other.\\" On November 25, 2006, Fox News Watch panelist Cal Thomas named Olbermann as his choice for 2006's \\"Media Turkey Award\\" for what Thomas alleged were Olbermann's \\"inaccuracies\\" and \\"hot air\\".Fox News: Fox News Watch. November 25, 2006. Olbermann in turn gave the show the Bronze for \\"Worst Person in the World\\", not for naming him \\"Turkey of the Year\\", but for misspelling his last name as \\"Olberman\\" on the onscreen graphic.

From 1928 to 1930 he was Chairman of the Russian All-Military Union (ROVS).–ó–∏–Ω–∫–µ–≤–∏—á –ú. –ú. –ì–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –ü–∞–≤–ª–æ–≤–∏—á –ö—É—Ç–µ–ø–æ–≤.  Biography  = Family = Alexander Kutepov was born in the family of a personal nobleman Konstantin Mikhailovich Timofeev and his wife Olga Andreevna in Cherepovets, Novgorod Governorate.In the track record of A.P. Kutepov for 1908, which is in the Russian State Military Historical Archive, the city of Cherepovets is indicated as the birthplace of Kutepov. This is confirmed by a biographical essay written on the basis of Kutepov‚Äôs personal memoirs by his secretary M. A. Kritsky and published in the book \\"General Kutepov\\", published in Paris in 1934. In 1890, K. M. Timofeev died. In 1892, Olga Andreevna married a hereditary nobleman Pavel Aleksandrovich Kutepov, an official on peasant affairs of the corps of foresters (after the Stolypin reform, he became chairman of the Land Survey Commission). On 9 March 1893, by the definition of the Novgorod District Court, children born by Olga Andreevna in her first marriage ‚Äî including Alexander, P. A. Kutepov became adopted. = Education and military service = Alexander Kutepov was educated at the Arkhangelsk gymnasium (graduated from 7th grade). In 1902 he entered the ranks of the rank junker at the Junker Infantry School in St. Petersburg, which he graduated in the 1st category. A year later, the younger clerk-junker Kutepov has been noticed at the parade by the Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich who appointed him right away in the sergeant-major, bypassing the rank of senior caravan-junker. As a young infantry officer, he fought in the Russo-Japanese War, where he was severely wounded in action and decorated for valor. On 9 August 1904 he was promoted to lieutenant of the 85th Vyborg Infantry Regiment, which acted in the army. In 1906, he was transferred to the Preobrazhensky Regiment, an elite guards regiment. During World War I, he received several decorations for bravery and was again severely wounded in action. During the course of the war, he rose from company, to battalion to commander of the Preobrazhensky Regiment. As such, he became the last commander of this historic regiment. = Participation in the Russo-Japanese War = Upon arrival at the regiment, Kutepov asked for the appointment into the survey corps ‚Äî the part that was entrusted with the most dangerous missions. Soon he excelled in a night with several hunters upon a Japanese outpost. Russian scouts captured rich trophies (machine guns and rifles). For this case, the Order of St. George was awarded to the head of the survey corps who did not participate in the case. When the details of the operation became known after the war, efforts were made to ensure that Kutepov also received the order. Kutepov himself did not know anything about this, but nothing had happened. However, he was still awarded the military order for this reconnaissance ‚Äî it was a reward from the German prince (the 85th Vyborg regiment had the German emperor Wilhelm as his chief), who found out the details of one of the Kutepov's operation, thus, the order of the German Crown with swords and on the ribbon of the Iron Cross was awarded in this regard. For military distinctions, he was awarded the Order of Saint Anna of the 4th degree with the inscription \\"For Courage\\", St. Stanislav of the 3rd degree with swords and St. Vladimir of the 4th degree with swords and a bow. Alexander Pavlovich was returning from Manchuria to the capital separately from his regiment; he was appointed to a special team sent to Russia to train new recruits. Here Kutepov first encountered a revolution: on the way of the echelon, the local revolutionaries declared a \\"republic\\", the administration was confused, and he had to break through, taking full responsibility for the echelon and led several soldiers and arrested the strike committee of the railway station. Upon arrival in Petersburg, on a presentation to the emperor, Kutepov received from the tsar's hands for his front-line services the Order of St. Vladimir of the 4th degree with swords and a bow. = Officer of the Preobrazhensky Regiment = On 18 November 1906 he was sent to the Preobrazhensky Regiment, and on 1 November 1907 ‚Äî for the \\"military distinctions\\" he was transferred to the regiment. Since 1907, he has been a lieutenant; since 1911, he has been the captain. He served in the regiment as an assistant to the head of the training team, head of the machine gun team, head of the survey team, commander of the 15th company, and head of the training team. = The First World War = With the beginning of mobilization, the training team was disbanded, and Kutepov accepted the 4th company of the Preobrazhensky Life-Guard Regiment, and with which he went to the front of the First World War. He was wounded in a battle near Vladislavov on 20 August 1914. In 1915 he was promoted to captain with seniority from 19 July 1915. He was awarded the Order of St. George 4th degree : \\"For the fact that on July 27, 1915, in the battle near the village of Petrilov, when the Germans, after intensifying the preparation of heavy guns with artillery fire, captured the trenches of one of the companies, he, being in private support, not being able to receive instructions on the terms of the battle, on his own initiative, he went over to the counter-attack and, despite significant losses, knocked out the enemy from their position and restored his position, and although he was badly wounded, he continued to lead the battle until the evening.\\"–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π –ò–Ω–≤–∞–ª–∏–¥, ‚Ññ 273. ‚Äî 13-–≥–æ –æ–∫—Ç—è–±—Ä—è 1916 –≥. ‚Äî –°. 3.

He was promoted to colonel on 25 November 1916 with seniority from 26 September 1916. In December 1916, Colonel Kutepov was elected by the general meeting of officers of the regiment to the court of honor and to his administrative team. 1 April 1917, already in the context of the ongoing \\"democratization\\" of the army, was re-elected to the court of honor.–ì–∞–≥–∫—É–µ–≤ –†. –ì., –¶–≤–µ—Ç–∫–æ–≤ –í. –ñ., –ì–æ–ª–∏—Ü—ã–Ω –í. –í. –ì–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª –ö—É—Ç–µ–ø–æ–≤. ‚Äî –ú.: –ü–æ—Å–µ–≤, 2009. ‚Äî 590 —Å. ‚Äî , –°. 15 = The February Revolution = During the February Revolution, Colonel Kutepov, who was on short leave in Petrograd, turned out to be the only senior officer who tried to organize effective resistance to the rebels by leading, on behalf of the commander of the Petrograd Military District, General S.S. Khabalov, a combined detachment aimed at suppressing the revolution. However, his detachment was not supported by other military units located in Petrograd, and part of the officers sent to his disposal showed no desire to fight for the monarchy. In this situation, Kutepov's detachment could not have a serious impact on the development of events and was forced to stop resistance. After the victory of the revolution, he returned to the front. Since 27 April 1917 ‚Äî the commander of the Preobrazhensky Life-Guard Regiment, which was one of the few units of the army that retained combat effectiveness in conditions of active anti-war agitation. For special differences in the battles near the village of Mshany during the Tarnopol breakthrough, on 7 July 1917, he was presented by the St. George Duma to the Order of St. George of the 3rd degree, but did not receive it because of a representation that did not reach the government in post-revolutionary chaos. According to his fellow regiment V. Deutrich: :\\"Kutepov‚Äôs name has become an eyesore. It means fidelity to duty, calm determination, intense sacrificial impulse, cold, sometimes cruel will and ... clean hands ‚Äî and all this is brought and given to the service of the Motherland\\". = Russian Civil War = taking the city in June 1919. After the October Revolution, Kutepov joined the anti-Bolshevik Volunteer Army (part of the White Movement) at the very outset of the Russian Civil War. At the start of the Ice March in early 1918, Kutepov was a company commander of an officer's regiment. (In the beginning of the Russian Civil War the small Volunteer Army had a surplus of officers, which meant that many of them had to serve as common soldiers. These formations soon became the crack units of the White Army.) After the death in battle of Colonel Nezhentsev, Kutepov took over the command of the Kornilov Shock Regiment, and after the death of the commander of the 1st Infantry Division, he became its commander. When the Whites captured Novorossiysk in August 1918, Kutepov was appointed Governor General of the Black Sea region. Starting in January 1919, 36-year-old Lieutenant General Kutepov became the commander of the 1st Army Corps of the White Army. Throughout his career, Kutepov had a reputation for being a decisive, direct and no-nonsense military leader. During the chaotic times of the Russian Civil War, order was usually rapidly restored after Kutepov's arrival. He accomplished this, however, by means of the swift and ruthless application of the death penalty on suspected looters and pogrom perpetrators. = In exile = Shteifon, Kutepov and Vitkovsky. Standing (behind Kutepov) : generals Skoblin and Turkul. After the White Army's final defeat in the Crimean Peninsula in November 1920, Kutepov and the remnants of his corps evacuated to Gallipoli. Despite very unfavourable and demoralizing circumstances, the troops in Gallipoli kept up their morale thanks to Kutepov's leadership. In the beginning of the Gallipoli period, Kutepov was disliked by many of the troops because of his disciplinary measures, but by the end, he was warmly regarded by most of them. When the Gallipoli camp was disbanded, Kutepov moved to Bulgaria in late 1921. In May 1922, he was expelled from Bulgaria during the upheavals of the Aleksandar Stamboliyski era and resided in Serbia until 1924, when he and his wife settled in Paris. After General Pyotr Wrangel's death in April 1928, he became the commander of the Russian All-Military Union (ROVS). In this position, he abandoned the ROVS' strategy of waiting for Western powers' intervention in Russia, instead he stepped up sabotage and terrorist activities by ROVS inside the USSR. He is credited with setting up a counter-intelligence branch of ROVS, the Inner Line.‚Ä≥–û—Å–Ω–∏–≤–∞—ö–µ –±–µ–ª–æ–≥–≤–∞—Ä–¥–µ—ò—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Ç–∞—ò–Ω–∏—Ö —Å–ª—É–∂–±–∏: –ò–∑ —Ç–∞—ò–Ω–∏—Ö –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–≤–∞ –£–î–ë–ï: –†–£–°–ö–ê –ï–ú–ò–ì–†–ê–¶–ò–à–ê –£ –à–£–ì–û–°–õ–ê–í–ò–à–ò 1918‚Äì1941.‚Ä≥ // Politika, 13 December 2017, p. 18. = Abduction and death = The Monument to the General Kutepov and to his associates On 26 January 1930, Kutepov was kidnapped in Paris by OGPU agents.

Ioffe also wrote that it is incorrect to call Zakharchenko-Schulz a niece, since \\"niece\\" was her code name in correspondence with persons who collaborated with \\"Trust\\".  –úemorial  In 1921, near the Russian cemetery of the Turkish city of Gelibolu, on the European shore of the Dardanelles, the memorial in the form of a stone mound was opened by Kutepov leadership together with the other ranks of the Russian Army and blessed by the Russian Orthodox Church. When the army left the Gallipoli camp, the cemetery and memorial were solemnly transferred to the care of the local administration. After the earthquake of 1949, the mound was severely destroyed and later demolished. In 1961, a copy of the Gallipoli monument was restored at the Russian cemetery of Sainte- Genevieve-des-Bois, near which the symbolic grave of General Kutepov is located.

Biography Charles Ferdinand was the fourth son of King Sigismund III Vasa and his wife Constance of Austria and the brother of John Casimir, John Albert, Alexander Charles and Anna Catherine Constance. Charles Ferdinand spent his childhood and youth in the care of his mother at the royal court in Warsaw. On March 23, 1624, he received from Pope Urban VIII dispensation, allowing him to take the dignity of being a canon in Wroc≈Çaw. In this case, cardinal-protector Cosmo de Torres intervened with the pope. On May 3, 1625, through the political efforts of Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor, he was appointed the Bishop of Wroc≈Çaw. On October 22, 1625 he received papal approval for the post. On January 18, 1626, despite being a minor (12 years old) and not having a proper ordination ceremony he was officially installed as bishop. After the death of his mother in 1631, together with his brother John Casimir he inherited the wealthy city of ≈ªywiec in Lesser Poland. During the reign of W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV, Charles Ferdinand resided mainly in Warsaw. Being a close relative of the royal court, however, he was not interested in politics and had no ambition to acquire the secular authorities. Between 1632 and 1648 he devoted his time mostly to administrative work, financial affairs and accumulation of ecclesiastical benefice. In 1640 he was appointed the Bishop of P≈Çock. After his coming of age, Charles Ferdinand decided never to accept the ordination of priesthood and gave the control of the Archdiocese of Wroc≈Çaw to other influential bishops and priests that would be in charge like Bishop John von Balthasar Liesch Hornau and Archdeacon Peter Gebauer. Similarly, with the Archdiocese of P≈Çock, he gave control over the sect to Stanis≈Çaw Starczewski and Wojciech Tolibowski After the death of King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa in 1648, he was a candidate to the Polish throne, together with his brother John Casimir whom he supported. Later he has launched a tough policy and decisive steps to quell the civil war in Polish occupied Ruthenia and Ukraine. He received the support of two-thirds majority of senators and bishops in the Polish Sejm (Parliament). Most notably he was supported by the Ruthenian nobles led by Jeremi Wi≈õniowiecki, however, his policies were opposed by the Protestants, Lutherans and by the nobility of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which feared the tightening of the Counter-Reformation. At the forefront of opposition to Charles Ferdinand Vasa stood Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç and his brother Bogus≈Çaw Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, who even threatened to break the Polish- Lithuanian union. After losing the election, Charles Ferdinand received, from his brother and newly elected king, the Duchy of Opole and Racib√≥rz. He then retired from public life. He settled on the estates of the bishops in P≈Çock, in Mazovia. His main residence was a large renaissance castle in Brok. In 1651, he took care of the orphaned and deprived of estates in Ruthenia, Michael Korybut Wi≈õniowiecki (later King Michael I). Vasa financed his travels abroad and provided thorough education and studies in the best schools of Europe. Charles Ferdinand Vasa died on May 9, 1655 in Wyszk√≥w. He was buried in the Jesuit Church in Warsaw. Charles Ferdinand Vasa left a huge fortune and the majority of it was spent on various foundations of churches in the country. The rest was inherited by his brother John II Casimir. Money and estates inherited from the king's brother helped to finance the troops and the military during the Polish-Swedish War (known as the \\"Deluge\\"), and the Duchy of Silesia provided the king with shelter when he had to flee Poland in 1655. Charles Ferdinand was a great patron of art and supporter of the Society of Jesus (he had an enormous silver altar built for the Jesuit Church in WarsawLileyko Jerzy, ≈ªycie codzienne w Warszawie za Waz√≥w, Warszawa, 1984. ). In the 1640s, royal architect, Giovanni Battista Gisleni built for him a palace situated on the northern bastion of the Warsaw Royal Castle fortifications. It was later ransacked and destroyed by Swedes and Germans of Brandenburg in 1650s, during the Deluge. He also had a large wooden palace in Wyszk√≥w.

This street begins at the intersection of Adams Street and Joralemon Street in Brooklyn Heights, and runs eastward to East New York and Cypress Hills. At the border with Queens, Fulton Street becomes 91st Avenue, which ends at 84th Street in Woodhaven. The street is named after Robert Fulton; a street of the same name in Manhattan was linked to this street by Fulton with his steam ferries. For a hundred years before the Fulton Ferry monopoly, Fulton Street was the Ferry Road through Jamaica Pass and, in the centuries before any ferry service, Indian path to the Hempstead Plains. It began at the Fulton Ferry Landing and climbed south through Brooklyn Heights past Brooklyn Borough Hall to where it now begins at Adams Street. Part of the original Fulton Street survives as Old Fulton Street in Brooklyn Heights and Dumbo, and as Cadman Plaza West in Downtown Brooklyn. The segment of Fulton Street that traveled past Borough Hall has been turned into a pedestrian esplanade. Route Pedestrian street in Columbus Park leading to Old Fulton Street The initial segment of Fulton Street as it exists today is the Fulton Mall between Adams Street and Flatbush Avenue. East of Flatbush Avenue, Fulton Street becomes a major artery of Downtown Brooklyn, Fort Greene and Clinton Hill. At Franklin Avenue, Fulton Street then becomes the signature street of Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant. At Broadway Junction in East New York, the street is interrupted by the intersection of Broadway and Jamaica Avenue, but continues on the other side as a one-way residential street through East New York and Cypress Hills until Norwood Avenue, once again as a two-way street reaching the Queens border at Elderts Lane in Woodhaven, Queens. There it becomes 91st Avenue, which continues until 84th Street in Queens. The elevated BMT Fulton Street Line used to run over Fulton Street. The New York City Subway's IND Fulton Street subway line () has replaced it east of Washington Avenue. The BMT Jamaica Line () runs above Fulton Street between Broadway Junction and Crescent Street. On March 10, 2005, Fulton Street was co-named Harriet Ross Tubman Avenue along most of its length from Rockaway Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant to Elm Place in Downtown Brooklyn, on the anniversary of the death of the ex-slave and abolitionist, which has been designated \\"Harriet Tubman Day of Commemoration\\" in New York State. Fulton Mall Fulton Mall is a pedestrian street and transit mall in Downtown Brooklyn that runs on Fulton Street between Flatbush Avenue and Adams Street. Fulton Mall contains 230 stores as well as dedicated bus lanes. For the mall's length, only buses, commercial vehicles, local truck deliveries, and emergency vehicles are allowed to use the street. The center of the Fulton Mall is an open public space known as Albee Square. = History = A B38 bus on Fulton Mall Architect Lee Harris Pomeroy redesigned the mall in the early 1980s: he designed street furniture and equipment for the project including large, free- standing canopies, vendors‚Äô kiosks, directory and telephone kiosks; and high mast lighting. The graphics program, which he also designed for the project, consists of informational, directional and street signage. The Mall had been in operation since the 1970s, but Pomeroy's renovation was completed in 1984; the project was awarded an Albert S. Bard Award from the City Club of New York. Numerous subway services at , , , , and stations and bus lines service the Fulton Mall area.http://web.mta.info/nyct/maps/subwaymap.pdf The Fulton Mall area is New York City's third largest commercial center after Herald Square and a stretch of Madison Avenue. The mall has attracted major investments from prominent Brooklyn retail real estate developers such as Stanley Chera, Albert Laboz, Joseph Jemal, Raymond M.

According to Fulton Mall Improvement Association, in 2003 the Fulton Mall area saw between 100,000 and 125,000 visitors a day. Fulton Mall has spurred additional commercial development in its immediate vicinity, such as the City Point development. The Fulton Mall has become the most expensive place to do business in the downtown Brooklyn area. Fulton Street's retail space was $301 per square foot in 2016, and $326 per square foot in 2017. The Macy's store, located at 422 Fulton Street, was originally Abraham & Straus's flagship store. This building was built in 1933 and the design is Art Deco, designed by Starrett & Van Vleck. The Macy's building was formerly the showroom for the W.C. Vosburgh Mfg. Co. As of 2017, the former Abraham & Straus Building is undergoing a $194 million renovation by Tishman Speyer.

In the Middle Ages, France was a center of Jewish learning but over time persecution increased, including multiple expulsions and returns. During the French Revolution in the late 18th century, France on the other hand was the first country in Europe to emancipate its Jewish population. Antisemitism still occurred in cycles, reaching a high level in the 1890s, as shown during the Dreyfus affair, and in the 1940s, under Nazi German occupation and the Vichy regime. Before 1919, most French Jews lived in Paris, with many being very proud to be fully assimilated into French culture, and they comprised an upscale subgroup. A more traditional Judaism was based in Alsace-Lorraine, which was taken by Germany in 1871 and recovered by France in 1918 following World War I. In addition, numerous Jewish refugees and immigrants came from Russia and eastern and central Europe in the early 20th century, changing the character of French Judaism in the 1920s and 1930s. These new arrivals were much less interested in assimilation into French culture. Some supported such new causes as Zionism, the Popular Front and communism, the latter two being popular among the French political left. During World War II, the Vichy government collaborated with Nazi occupiers to deport a large number of both French Jews and foreign Jewish refugees to concentration camps. By the war's end, 25% of the Jewish population of France had perished in the Holocaust, though this was a lower proportion than in most other countries under Nazi occupation.Yad Vashem In the 21st century, France has the largest Jewish population in Europe and the third-largest Jewish population in the world (after Israel and the United States). The Jewish community in France is estimated to number 480,000‚Äì550,000, depending on the definition being used. French Jewish communities are concentrated in the metropolitan areas of Paris, which has the largest Jewish population, Marseille, with a population of 70,000, Lyon, Nice, Strasbourg and Toulouse. The majority of French Jews in the 21st century are Sephardi and Mizrahi North African Jews, many of whom (or their parents) emigrated from former French colonies of North Africa after those countries gained independence in the 1950s and 1960s. They span a range of religious affiliations, from the ultra-Orthodox Haredi communities to the large segment of Jews who are entirely secular and who often marry outside the Jewish community. Approximately 200,000 French Jews live in Israel. Since 2010 or so, more have been making aliyah in response to rising antisemitism in France. Roman-Gallic epoch According to the Jewish Encyclopedia (1906), \\"The first settlements of Jews in Europe are obscure. From 163 BCE there is evidence of Jews in Rome [...]. In the year 6 C.E. there were Jews at Vienne and Gallia Celtica; in the year 39 at Lugdunum (i.e. Lyon)\\". An early account praised Hilary of Poitiers (died 366) for having fled from the Jewish society. The emperors Theodosius II and Valentinian III sent a decree to Amatius, prefect of Gaul (9 July 425), that prohibited Jews and pagans from practising law or holding public offices (militandi). This was to prevent Christians being subject to them and possibly incited to change their faith. At the funeral of Hilary, Bishop of Arles, in 449, Jews and Christians mingled in crowds and wept; the former were said to have sung psalms in Hebrew. From the year 465 the Church acknowledged the Jews. In the sixth century, Jews were documented in Marseilles, Arles, Uz√®s, Narbonne, Clermont-Ferrand, Orl√©ans, Paris, and Bordeaux. These places were generally centers of Roman administration, and located on the great commercial routes. The Jews built synagogues in these centers. In harmony with the Theodosian code, and according to an edict of 331 by the emperor Constantine, the Jews were organized for religious purposes as they were in the Roman empire.They appear to have had priests (rabbis or ·∏•azzanim), archisynagogues, patersynagogues, and other synagogue officials. The Jews worked principally as merchants, as they were prohibited from owning land; they also served as tax-collectors, sailors, and physicians. Funerary stele from Narbonne at the 7th-century beginning of the reign of Egica. The text begins with the Latin phrase and includes the Hebrew phrase . In various sources it is described as a Jewish inscription dated with the local calendar‚Äîthe regnal year of Egica‚Äîrather than the Hebrew calendar, an \\"inscription relating to the Jews of France\\", or as a \\"Christian inscription\\" (Click on search link and enter above EDCS-ID.). They probably remained under Roman law until the triumph of Christianity, with the status established by Caracalla, on a footing of equality with their fellow citizens. Their association with fellow citizens was generally amicable, even after the establishment of Christianity in Gaul. The Christian clergy participated in some Jewish feasts; intermarriage between Jews and Christians sometimes occurred; and the Jews made proselytes. Worried about Christians adopting Jewish religious customs, the third Council of Orl√©ans (539) warned the faithful against Jewish \\"superstitions\\", and ordered them to abstain from traveling on Sunday and from adorning their persons or dwellings on that day. In the 6th century, a Jewish community thrived in Paris. They built a synagogue on the √éle de la Cit√©, but it was later torn down by Christians, who erected a church on the site. In 629, King Dagobert proposed the expulsion of all Jews who would not accept Christianity. No mention of the Jews was found from his reign to that of Pepin the Short. But in Southern France, then known as Septimania and a dependency of the Visigothic kings of Spain, the Jews continued to dwell and to prosper. From this epoch (689) dates the earliest known inscription relating to the Jews of France, the \\"Funerary Stele of Justus, Matrona and Dulciorella\\" of Narbonne, written in Latin and Hebrew. The Jews of Narbonne, chiefly merchants, were popular among the people, who often rebelled against the Visigothic kings. Carolingian period The presence of Jews in France under Charlemagne is documented, with their position being regulated by law. Exchanges with the Orient strongly declined with the presence of Saracens in the Mediterranean sea. Trading and importing of oriental products such as gold, silk, black pepper or papyrus almost disappeared under the Carolingians. The Radhanite Jewish traders were nearly the only group to maintain trade between the Occident and the Orient. Charlemagne fixed a formula for the Jewish oath to the state. He allowed Jews to enter into lawsuits with Christians. They were not allowed to require Christians to work on Sunday. Jews were not allowed to trade in currency, wine, or grain. Legally, Jews belonged to the emperor, and could be tried only by him. But the numerous provincial councils which met during Charlemagne's reign were not concerned with the Jewish communities. Louis le D√©bonnaire (ruled 814-840), faithful to the principles of his father Charlemagne, granted strict protection to Jews, whom he respected as merchants. Like his father, Louis believed that 'the Jewish question' could be solved with the gradual conversion of Jews; according to medieval scholar JM Wollace-Harill, some people believed this tolerance threatened the Christian unity of the Empire, which led to the strengthening of the Bishops at the expense of the Emperor. Saint Agobard of Lyon (779-841) had many run-ins with the Jews of France. He wrote about how rich and powerful they were becoming. Scholars such as Jeremy Cohen suggest that Saint Agobard's belief in Jewish power contributed to his involvement in violent revolutions attempting to dethrone Louis the Pious in the early 830s. Lothar and Agobard's entreaties to Pope Gregory IV, gained them Papal support for the overthrow of Emperor Louis. Upon Louis the Pious' return to power in 834, he deposed Saint Agobard from his see, to the consternation of Rome. There were unsubstantiated rumors in this period that Louis', second wife Judith was a converted Jew, as she would not accept the Ordinatio for their first child. Jews were engaged in export trade, particularly traveling to Palestine under Charlemagne. When the Normans disembarked on the coast of Narbonnese Gaul, they were taken for Jewish merchants. One authority said the Jewish traders boasted about buying whatever they pleased from bishops and abbots. Isaac the Jew, who was sent by Charlemagne in 797 with two ambassadors to Harun al-Rashid, the fifth Abbasid Caliph, was probably one of these merchants. He was said to have asked the Baghdad caliph for a rabbi to instruct the Jews whom he had allowed to settle at Narbonne (see History of the Jews in Babylonia). Capetians =Persecutions under the Capets (987‚Äì1137)= Various costumes of medieval French Jews. There were widespread persecutions of Jews in France beginning in 1007 or 1009. These persecutions, instigated by Robert II (972‚Äì1031), King of France (987‚Äì1031), called \\"the Pious\\", are described in a Hebrew pamphlet,Published in Berliner's Magazin iii. 46-48, Hebrew part, reproducing Parma De Rossi MS. No. 563, 23; see also Jew. Encyc. v. 447, s.v. France. which also states that the King of France conspired with his vassals to destroy all the Jews on their lands who would not accept baptism, and many were put to death or killed themselves. Robert is credited with advocating forced conversions of local Jewry, as well as mob violence against Jews who refused. Among the dead was the learned Rabbi Senior. Robert the Pious is well known for his lack of religious toleration and for the hatred which he bore toward heretics; it was Robert who reinstated the Roman imperial custom of burning heretics at the stake. In Normandy under Richard II, Duke of Normandy, Rouen Jewry suffered from persecutions that were so terrible that many women, in order to escape the fury of the mob, jumped into the river and drowned. A notable of the town, Jacob b. Jekuthiel, a Talmudic scholar, sought to intercede with Pope John XVIII to stop the persecutions in Lorraine (1007).Berliner's \\"Magazin,\\" iii.; \\"O·∫ìar ·π¨ob,\\" pp. 46-48. Jacob undertook the journey to Rome, but was imprisoned with his wife and four sons by Duke Richard, and escaped death only by allegedly miraculous means. He left his eldest son, Judah, as a hostage with Richard while he with his wife and three remaining sons went to Rome. He bribed the pope with seven gold marks and two hundred pounds, who thereupon sent a special envoy to King Robert ordering him to stop the persecutions. If Adh√©mar of Chabannes, who wrote in 1030, is to be believed (he had a reputation as a fabricator), the anti-Jewish feelings arose in 1010 after Western Jews addressed a letter to their Eastern coreligionists warning them of a military movement against the Saracens. According to Ad√©mar, Christians urged by Pope Sergius IVMonumenta Germaniae Historica, Scriptores, iv. 137. were shocked by the destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem by the Muslims in 1009. After the destruction, European reaction to the rumor of the letter was of shock and dismay, Cluniac monk Rodulfus Glaber blamed the Jews for the destruction. In that year Alduin, Bishop of Limoges (bishop 990-1012), offered the Jews of his diocese the choice between baptism and exile. For a month theologians held disputations with the Jews, but without much success, for only three or four of Jews abjured their faith; others killed themselves; and the rest either fled or were expelled from Limoges.Chronicles of Adh√©mar of Chabannes ed. Bouquet, x. 152; Chronicles of William Godellus ib. 262, according to whom the event occurred in 1007 or 1008. Similar expulsions took place in other French towns. By 1030, Rodulfus Glaber knew more concerning this story.Chronicles of Adh√©mar of Chabannes ed. Bouquet, x. 34 According to his 1030 explanation, Jews of Orl√©ans had sent to the East through a beggar a letter which provoked the order for the destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Glaber adds that, on the discovery of the crime, the expulsion of the Jews was everywhere decreed. Some were driven out of the cities, others were put to death, while some killed themselves; only a few remained in all the \\"Roman world\\". Count Paul Riant (1836-1888) says that this whole story of the relations between the Jews and the Mohammedans is only one of those popular legends with which the chronicles of the time abound.Inventaire Critique des Lettres Historiques des Croisades ‚Äî 786‚Äì1100 by Paul Edouard Didier Riant (Paris, 1880), p. 38. ASIN B0017H91JQ. Another violent commotion arose about 1065. At this date Pope Alexander II wrote to B√©ranger, Viscount of Narbonne and to Guifred, bishop of the city, praising them for having prevented the massacre of the Jews in their district, and reminding them that God does not approve of the shedding of blood. In 1065 also, Alexander admonished Landulf VI of Benevento \\"that the conversion of Jews is not to be obtained by force.\\"Simonsohn, pp 35-37. Also in the same year, Alexander called for a crusade against the Moors in Spain. These Crusaders killed without mercy all the Jews whom they met on their route. Franco-Jewish literature During this period, which continued until the First Crusade, Jewish culture flourished in the South and North of France. The initial interest included poetry, which was at times purely liturgical, but which more often was a simple scholastic exercise without aspiration, destined rather to amuse and instruct than to move. Following this came Biblical exegesis, the simple interpretation of the text, with neither daring nor depth, reflecting a complete faith in traditional interpretation, and based by preference on the Midrashim, despite their fantastic character. Finally, and above all, their attention was occupied with the Talmud and its commentaries. The text of this work, together with that of the writings of the Geonim, particularly their responsa, was first revised and copied; then these writings were treated as a corpus juris, and were commented upon and studied both as a pious exercise in dialectics and from the practical point of view. There was no philosophy, no natural science, no belles-lettres, among the French Jews of this period. Rashi frame The great Jewish figure which dominated the second half of the 11th century, as well as the whole rabbinical history of France, was Rashi (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki) of Troyes (1040‚Äì1106). He personified the genius of northern French Judaism: its devoted attachment to tradition; its untroubled faith; its piety, ardent but free from mysticism. His works are distinguished by their clarity, directness, and are written in a simple, concise, unaffected style, suited to his subject. His commentary on the Talmud, which was the product of colossal labor, and which eclipsed the similar works of all his predecessors, by its clarity and soundness made easy the study of that vast compilation, and soon became its indispensable complement. Every edition of the Talmud that was ever published has this commentary printed on the same page of the Talmud itself. His commentary on the Bible (particularly on the Pentateuch), a sort of repertory of the Midrash, served for edification, but also advanced the taste for seeking the plain and true meaning of the bible. The school which he founded at Troyes, his birthplace, after having followed the teachings of those of Worms and Mainz, immediately became famous. Around his chair were gathered Sim·∏•ah b. Samuel, R. Shamuel b. Me√Ør (Rashbam), and Shemaya, his grandsons; likewise Shemaria, Judah b. Nathan, and Isaac Levi b. Asher, all of whom continued his work. The school's Talmudic commentaries and interpretations are the basis and starting point for the Ashkenazic tradition of how to interpret and understand the Talmud's explanation of Biblical laws. In many cases these interpretations differ substantially from those of the Sephardim, which results in differences between how Ashkenazim and Sephardim hold what constitutes the practical application of the law. In his Biblical commentaries he availed himself of the works of his contemporaries. Among them must be cited Moses ha-Darshan, chief of the school of Narbonne, who was perhaps the founder of exegetical studies in France, and Menachem b. ·∏§elbo. Thus the 11th century was a period of fruitful activity in literature. Thenceforth French Judaism became one of the poles within Judaism. =The Crusades= The Jews of France suffered during the First Crusade (1096), when the Crusaders are stated, for example, to have shut up the Jews of Rouen in a church and to have murdered them without distinction of age or sex, sparing only those who accepted baptism. According to a Hebrew document, the Jews throughout France were at that time in great fear, and wrote to their brothers in the Rhine countries making known to them their terror and asking them to fast and pray. In the Rhineland thousands of Jews were killed by the Crusaders (see German Crusade, 1096). =Expulsions and Returns= Expulsion from France, 1182 A miniature from Grandes Chroniques de France depicting the expulsion The First Crusade led to nearly a century of accusations (blood libel) against the Jews, many of whom were burned or attacked in France. Immediately after the coronation of Philip Augustus on 14 March 1181, the King ordered the Jews arrested on a Saturday, in all their synagogues, and despoiled of their money and their investments. In the following April 1182, he published an edict of expulsion, but according the Jews a delay of three months for the sale of their personal property. Immovable property, however, such as houses, fields, vines, barns, and wine- presses, he confiscated. The Jews attempted to win over the nobles to their side, but in vain. In July they were compelled to leave the royal domains of France (and not the whole kingdom); their synagogues were converted into churches. These successive measures were simply expedients to fill the royal coffers. The goods confiscated by the king were at once converted into cash. During the century which terminated so disastrously for the Jews their condition was not altogether bad, especially if compared with that of their brethren in Germany. Thus may be explained the remarkable intellectual activity which existed among them, the attraction which it exercised over the Jews of other countries, and the numerous works produced in those days. The impulse given by Rashi to study did not cease with his death; his successors‚Äîthe members of his family first among them‚Äîcontinued his work. Research moved within the same limits as in the preceding century, and dealt mainly with the Talmud, rabbinical jurisprudence, and Biblical exegesis. Recalled by Philip Augustus, 1198 This century, which opened with the return of the Jews to France proper (then reduced almost to the √éle de France), closed with their complete exile from the country in a larger sense. In July 1198, Philip Augustus, \\"contrary to the general expectation and despite his own edict, recalled the Jews to Paris and made the churches of God suffer great persecutions\\" (Rigord). The king adopted this measure from no good will toward the Jews, for he had shown his true sentiments a short time before in the Bray affair. But since then he had learned that the Jews could be an excellent source of income from a fiscal point of view, especially as money-lenders. Not only did he recall them to his estates, but he gave state sanction by his ordinances to their operations in banking and pawnbroking. He placed their business under control, determined the legal rate of interest, and obliged them to have seals affixed to all their deeds. Naturally this trade was taxed, and the affixing of the royal seal was paid for by the Jews. Henceforward there was in the treasury a special account called \\"Produit des Juifs\\", and the receipts from this source increased continually. At the same time it was to the interest of the treasury to secure possession of the Jews, considered as a fiscal resource. The Jews were therefore made serfs of the king in the royal domain, just at a time when the charters, becoming wider and wider, tended to bring about the disappearance of serfdom. In certain respects their position became even harder than that of serfs, for the latter could in certain cases appeal to custom and were often protected by the Church; but there was no custom to which the Jews might appeal, and the Church laid them under its ban. The kings and the lords said \\"my Jews\\" just as they said \\"my lands\\", and they disposed in like manner of the one and of the other. The lords imitated the king: \\"they endeavored to have the Jews considered an inalienable dependence of their fiefs, and to establish the usage that if a Jew domiciled in one barony passed into another, the lord of his former domicil should have the right to seize his possessions.\\" This agreement was made in 1198 between the king and the Count of Champagne in a treaty, the terms of which provided that neither should retain in his domains the Jews of the other without the latter's consent, and furthermore that the Jews should not make loans or receive pledges without the express permission of the king and the count. Other lords made similar conventions with the king. Thenceforth they too had a revenue known as the Produit des Juifs, comprising the taille, or annual quit-rent, the legal fees for the writs necessitated by the Jews' law trials, and the seal duty. A thoroughly characteristic feature of this fiscal policy is that the bishops (according to the agreement of 1204 regulating the spheres of ecclesiastical and seigniorial jurisdiction) continued to prohibit the clergy from excommunicating those who sold goods to the Jews or who bought from them. The practice of \\"retention treaties\\" spread throughout France after 1198. Lords intending to impose a heavy tax (captio, literally \\"capture\\") on Jews living in their lordship (dominium) signed treaties with their neighbours, whereby the latter refused to permit the former's Jews entry into his domains, thus \\"retaining\\" them for the lord to tax. This practice arose in response to the common flight of Jews in the face of a captio to a different dominium, where they purchased the right to settle unmolested by gifts (bribes) to their new lord. In May 1210 the crown negotiated a series of treaties with the neighbours of the royal demesne and successfully \\"captured\\" its Jews with a large tax levy. From 1223 on, however the Count Palatine of Champagne refused to sign any such treaties, and in that year even refused to affirm the crown's asserted right to force non-retention policies on its barons. Such treaties became obsolete after Louis IX's ordinance of Melun (1230), when it became illegal for a Jew to migrate between lordships. This ordinance‚Äîthe first piece of public legislation in France since Carolingian times‚Äîalso declared it treason to refuse non-retention. Under Louis VIII Biblioth√®que Nationale, Paris). Louis VIII of France (1223‚Äì26), in his Etablissement sur les Juifs of 1223, while more inspired with the doctrines of the Church than his father, Philip Augustus, knew also how to look after the interests of his treasury. Although he declared that from 8 November 1223, the interest on Jews' debts should no longer hold good, he at the same time ordered that the capital should be repaid to the Jews in three years and that the debts due the Jews should be inscribed and placed under the control of their lords. The lords then collected the debts for the Jews, doubtless receiving a commission. Louis furthermore ordered that the special seal for Jewish deeds should be abolished and replaced by the ordinary one. Twenty-six barons accepted Louis VIII's new measures, but Theobald IV (1201‚Äì53), the powerful Count of Champagne, did not, since he had an agreement with the Jews that guaranteed their safety in return for extra income through taxation. Champagne's capital at Troyes was where Rashi had lived a century before, and Champagne continued to have a prosperous Jewish population. Theobald IV would become a major opposition force to Capetian dominance, and his hostility was manifest during the reign of Louis VIII. For example, during the siege of Avignon, he performed only the minimum service of 40 days, and left for home amid charges of treachery. Under Louis IX In spite of all these restrictions designed to restrain, if not to suppress moneylending, Louis IX of France (1226‚Äì70) (also known as Saint Louis), with his ardent piety and his submission to the Catholic Church, unreservedly condemned loans at interest. He was less amenable than Philip Augustus to fiscal considerations. Despite former conventions, in an assembly held at Melun in December 1230, he compelled several lords to sign an agreement not to authorize Jews to make any loan. No one in the whole Kingdom of France was allowed to detain a Jew belonging to another, and each lord might recover a Jew who belonged to him, just as he might his own serf (tanquam proprium servum), wherever he might find him and however long a period had elapsed since the Jew had settled elsewhere. At the same time the ordinance of 1223 was enacted afresh, which only proves that it had not been carried into effect. Both king and lords were forbidden to borrow from Jews. In 1234, Louis freed his subjects from a third of their registered debts to Jews (including those who had already paid their debts), but debtors had to pay the remaining two-thirds within a specified time. It was also forbidden to imprison Christians or to sell their real estate to recover debts owed to Jews. The king wished in this way to strike a deadly blow at usury. In 1243, Louis ordered, at the urging of Pope Gregory IX, the burning in Paris of some 12,000 manuscript copies of the Talmud and other Jewish works. In order to finance his first Crusade, Louis ordered the expulsion of all Jews engaged in usury and the confiscation of their property, for use in his crusade, but the order for the expulsion was only partly enforced if at all. Louis left for the Seventh Crusade in 1248. However, he did not cancel the debts owed by Christians. Later, Louis became conscience-stricken, and, overcome by scruples, he feared lest the treasury, by retaining some part of the interest paid by the borrowers, might be enriched with the product of usury. As a result, one-third of the debts was forgiven, but the other two-thirds was to be remitted to the royal treasury. In 1251, while Louis was in captivity on the Crusade, a popular movement rose up with the intention of traveling to the east to rescue him; although they never made it out of northern France, Jews were subject to their attacks as they wandered throughout the country (see Shepherds' Crusade). In 1257 or 1258 (\\"Ordonnances\\", i. 85), wishing, as he says, to provide for his safety of soul and peace of conscience, Louis issued a mandate for the restitution in his name of the amount of usurious interest which had been collected on the confiscated property, the restitution to be made either to those who had paid it or to their heirs. Later, after having discussed the subject with his son-in-law, King Theobald II of Navarre and Count of Champagne, Louis decided on 13 September 1268 to arrest Jews and seize their property. But an order which followed close upon this last (1269) shows that on this occasion also Louis reconsidered the matter. Nevertheless, at the request of Paul Christian (Pablo Christiani), he compelled the Jews, under penalty of a fine, to wear at all times the rouelle or badge decreed by the Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215. This consisted of a piece of red felt or cloth cut in the form of a wheel, four fingers in circumference, which had to be attached to the outer garment at the chest and back.  The Medieval Inquisition  Miniature from the North French Hebrew Miscellany of Noah's Ark landing on the Mountains of Ararat (fol. 521a, c. 1278-98) The Inquisition, which had been instituted in order to suppress Catharism, finally occupied itself with the Jews of Southern France who converted to Christianity. The popes complained that not only were baptized Jews returning to their former faith, but that Christians also were being converted to Judaism. In March 1273, Pope Gregory X formulated the following rules: relapsed Jews, as well as Christians who abjured their faith in favor of \\"the Jewish superstition\\", were to be treated by the Inquisitors as heretics. The instigators of such apostasies, as those who received or defended the guilty ones, were to be punished in the same way as the delinquents. In accordance with these rules, the Jews of Toulouse, who had buried a Christian convert in their cemetery, were brought before the Inquisition in 1278 for trial, with their rabbi, Isaac Males, being condemned to the stake. Philip IV at first ordered his seneschals not to imprison any Jews at the instance of the Inquisitors, but in 1299 he rescinded this order. The Great Exile of 1306 Toward the middle of 1306 the treasury was nearly empty, and the king, as he was about to do the following year in the case of the Templars, condemned the Jews to banishment, and took forcible possession of their property, real and personal. Their houses, lands, and movable goods were sold at auction; and for the king were reserved any treasures found buried in the dwellings that had belonged to the Jews. That Philip the Fair intended merely to fill the gap in his treasury, and was not at all concerned about the well- being of his subjects, is shown by the fact that he put himself in the place of the Jewish moneylenders and exacted from their Christian debtors the payment of their debts, which they themselves had to declare. Furthermore, three months before the sale of the property of the Jews the king took measures to ensure that this event should be coincident with the prohibition of clipped money, in order that those who purchased the goods should have to pay in undebased coin. Finally, fearing that the Jews might have hidden some of their treasures, he declared that one-fifth of any amount found should be paid to the discoverer. It was on 22 July, the day after Tisha B'Av, a Jewish fast day, that the Jews were arrested. In prison they received notice that they had been sentenced to exile; that, abandoning their goods and debts, and taking only the clothes which they had on their backs and the sum of 12 sous tournois each, they would have to quit the kingdom within one month. Speaking of this exile, an American Rabbi has said, > In striking at the Jews, Philip the Fair at the same time dried up one of > the most fruitful sources of the financial, commercial, and industrial > prosperity of his kingdom. This overview work (by an American Rabbi, not a > French historian) may itself be a quoting an earlier historian, but it's a > source of the quoted words. Pages 395‚Äì396 give a bibliography which someone > dedicated might scan for an original source. To a large extent the history of the Jews of France ceased. The span of control of the King of France had increased considerably in extent. Outside the √éle de France, it now comprised Champagne, the Vermandois, Normandy, Perche, Maine, Anjou, Touraine, Poitou, the Marche, Lyonnais, Auvergne, and Languedoc, reaching from the Rh√¥ne to the Pyr√©n√©es. The exiles could not take refuge anywhere except in Lorraine, the county of Burgundy, Savoy, Dauphin√©, Roussillon, and a part of Provence ‚Äì all regions located in Empire. It is not possible to estimate the number of fugitives; that given by Gr√§tz, 100,000, has no foundation in fact. Return of the Jews to France, 1315 Hanukkah lamp dating from before the expulsion of 1394 Museum of Jewish Art and History Nine years had hardly passed since the expulsion of 1306 when Louis X of France (1314‚Äì16) recalled the Jews. In an edict dated 28 July 1315, he permitted them to return for a period of twelve years, authorizing them to establish themselves in the cities in which they had lived before their banishment. He issued this edict in answer to the demands of the people. Geoffrey of Paris, the popular poet of the time, says in fact that the Jews were gentle in comparison with the Christians who had taken their place, and who had flayed their debtors alive; if the Jews had remained, the country would have been happier; for there were no longer any moneylenders at all.Bouquet, xxii. 118 The king probably had the interests of his treasury also in view. The profits of the former confiscations had gone into the treasury, and by recalling the Jews for only twelve years he would have an opportunity for ransoming them at the end of this period. It appears that they gave the sum of 122,500 livres for the privilege of returning. It is also probable, as Adolphe Vuitry states, that a large number of the debts owing to the Jews had not been recovered, and that the holders of the notes had preserved them; the decree of return specified that two thirds of the old debts recovered by the Jews should go into the treasury. The conditions under which they were allowed to settle in the land are set forth in a number of articles; some of the guaranties which were accorded the Jews had probably been demanded by them and been paid for. They were to live by the work of their hands or to sell merchandise of a good quality; they were to wear the circular badge, and not discuss religion with laymen. They were not to be molested, either with regard to the chattels they had carried away at the time of their banishment, or with regard to the loans which they had made since then, or in general with regard to anything which had happened in the past. Their synagogues and their cemeteries were to be restored to them on condition that they would refund their value; or, if these could not be restored, the king would give them the necessary sites at a reasonable price. The books of the Law that had not yet been returned to them were also to be restored, with the exception of the Talmud. After the period of twelve years granted to them the king might not expel the Jews again without giving them a year's time in which to dispose of their property and carry away their goods. They were not to lend on usury, and no one was to be forced by the king or his officers to repay to them usurious loans. If they engaged in pawnbroking, they were not to take more than two deniers in the pound a week; they were to lend only on pledges. Two men with the title \\"auditors of the Jews\\" were entrusted with the execution of this ordinance and were to take cognizance of all claims that might arise in connection with goods belonging to the Jews that had been sold before the expulsion for less than half of what was regarded as a fair price. The king finally declared that he took the Jews under his special protection and that he desired to have their persons and property protected from all violence, injury and oppression. Expulsion of 1394 On 17 September 1394, Charles VI suddenly published an ordinance in which he declared, in substance, that for a long time he had been taking note of the many complaints provoked by the excesses and misdemeanors which the Jews committed against Christians; and that the prosecutors, having made several investigations, had discovered many violations by the Jews of the agreement they had made with him. Therefore, he decreed as an irrevocable law and statute that thenceforth no Jew should dwell in his domains (\\"Ordonnances\\", vii. 675). According to the Religieux de St. Denis, the king signed this decree at the insistence of the queen (\\"Chron. de Charles VI.\\" ii. 119).History of the reign of Charles VI, titled Chronique de Religieux de Saint-Denys, contenant le regne de Charles VI de 1380 a 1422, encompasses the king's full reign in six volumes. Originally written in Latin, the work was translated to French in six volumes by L. Bellaguet between 1839 and 1852. The decree was not immediately enforced, a respite being granted to the Jews in order that they might sell their property and pay their debts. Those indebted to them were enjoined to redeem their obligations within a set time; otherwise their pledges held in pawn were to be sold by the Jews. The provost was to escort the Jews to the frontier of the kingdom. Subsequently, the king released the Christians from their debts. Provence Archaeological evidence has been discovered of a Jewish presence in Provence since at least the 1st century. The earliest documentary evidence for the presence of Jews dates from the middle of the 5th century in Arles. The Jewish presence reached a peak in 1348, when it probably numbered about 15,000. Provence was not incorporated into France until 1481, and the expulsion edict of 1394 did not apply there. The privileges of the Jews of Provence were confirmed in 1482. However, from 1484, anti-Jewish disturbances broke out, with looting and violence perpetrated by laborers from outside the region hired for the harvest season. In some places Jews were protected by the town officials, and they were declared to be under royal protection. However, a voluntary exodus began and was accelerated when similar disorders were repeated in 1485. According to Isidore Loeb, in a special study of the subject in the Revue des √âtudes Juives (xiv. 162‚Äì183), about 3,000 Jews came to Provence after the Alhambra Decree expelled Jews from Spain in 1492. From 1484, one town after another had called for expulsion, but the calls were rejected by Charles VIII. However, Louis XII, in one of his first acts as king in 1498, issued a general expulsion order of the Jews of Provence. Though not enforced at the time, the order was renewed in 1500 and again in 1501. On this occasion, it was definitively implemented. The Jews of Provence were given the option of conversion to Christianity and a number chose that option. However, after a short while ‚Äì if only to compensate partially for the loss of revenues caused by the departure of the Jews ‚Äì the king imposed a special tax, referred to as \\"the tax of the neophytes.\\" These converts and their descendants soon became the objects of social discrimination and slanders. During the second half of the 17th century a number of Jews attempted to reestablish themselves in Provence. Before the French Revolution abolished the administrative entity of Provence, the first community outside the southwest, Alsace-Lorraine and Comtat Venaissin, was re-formed in Marseilles. Early Modern period =17th century= Old Jewish Quarter of Troyes In the beginning of the 17th century Jews began again to re-enter France. This resulted in a new edict of 23 April 1615See Article 1 of The Code Noir, of 6 May 1687 which forbade Christians, under the penalty of death and confiscation, to shelter Jews or to converse with them. Alsace and Lorraine were the home of a significant number of Jews. In annexing the provinces in 1648, Louis XIV was at first inclined toward the banishment of Jews living in those provinces, but thought better of it in view of the benefit he could derive from them. On 25 September 1675, he granted these Jews letters patent, taking them under his special protection. This, however, did not prevent them from being subjected to every kind of extortion, and their position remained the same as it had been under the Austrian government. The Regency was no less severe. In 1683, Louis XIV expelled Jews from the newly acquired colony of Martinique. =Beginnings of emancipation= In the course of the 18th century the attitude of the authorities toward Jews changed for the better. A spirit of tolerance began to prevail, which corrected the iniquities of previous legislation. The authorities often overlooked infractions of the edict of banishment; a colony of Portuguese and German Jews was tolerated in Paris. The voices of enlightened Christians who demanded justice for the proscribed people, began to be heard. By the 1780s there were about 40,000 to 50,000 Jews in France, chiefly centered in Bordeaux, Metz and a few other cities. They had very limited rights and opportunities, apart from the money-lending business, but their status was not illegal.Nigel Aston, Religion and Revolution in France, 1780-1804 (2000) pp 72-89 An Alsatian Jew named Cerfbeer, who had rendered great service to the French government as purveyor to the army, was the interpreter of the Jews before Louis XVI. The humane minister, Malesherbes, summoned a commission of Jewish notables to make suggestions for the amelioration of the condition of their coreligionists. The direct result of the efforts of these men was the abolition, in 1785, of the degrading poll-tax and the permission to settle in all parts of France. Shortly afterward the Jewish question was raised by two men of genius, who subsequently became prominent in the French Revolution‚ÄîCount Mirabeau and the abb√© Gr√©goire‚Äîthe former of whom, while on a diplomatic mission in Prussia, had made the acquaintance of Moses Mendelssohn and his school (see Haskalah), who were then working toward the intellectual emancipation of the Jews. In a pamphlet, \\"Sur Moses Mendelssohn, sur la R√©forme Politique des Juifs\\" (London, 1787), Mirabeau refuted the arguments of the German antisemites like Michaelis, and claimed for the Jews the full rights of citizenship. This pamphlet naturally provoked many writings for and against the Jews, and the French public became interested in the question. On the proposition of Roederer the Royal Society of Science and Arts of Metz offered a prize for the best essay in answer to the question: \\"What are the best means to make the Jews happier and more useful in France?\\" Nine essays, of which only two were unfavorable to the Jews, were submitted to the judgment of the learned assembly. Of the challenge there were three winners: Abb√© Gregoire, Claude-Antoine Thiery, and Zalkind Hourwitz. The Revolution and Napoleon Loi relative aux Juifs, the 1791 decree giving the Jews full citizenship Museum of Jewish Art and History Jews in Bordeaux and Bayonne participated in 1789 to the election of the Estates-General but those in Alsace, Lorraine and in Paris were denied this right. Herz Cerfbeer, a French- Jewish financier, then asked to Jacques Necker and obtained the right for Jews from eastern France to elect their own delegates. Among them were the son of Cerf Beer, Theodore, and Joseph David Sinzheim. The Cahier written by the Jewish community from eastern France asked for the end of the discriminatory status and taxes targeting Jews. The fall of the Bastille was the signal for disorders everywhere in France. In certain districts of Alsace the peasants attacked the dwellings of the Jews, who took refuge in Basel. A gloomy picture of the outrages upon them was sketched before the National Assembly (3 August) by the abb√© Henri Gr√©goire, who demanded their complete emancipation. The National Assembly shared the indignation of the prelate, but left the question of emancipation undecided; it was intimidated by the deputies of Alsace, especially by Jean-Fran√ßois Rewbell. On 22 December 1789, the Jewish question came again before the Assembly in debating the issue of admitting to public service all citizens without distinction of creed. Mirabeau, the abb√© Gr√©goire, Robespierre, Duport, Barnave and the comte de Clermont-Tonnerre exerted all the power of their eloquence to bring about the desired emancipation; but the repeated disturbances in Alsace and the strong opposition of the deputies of that province and of the clericals, like La Fare, Bishop of Nancy, the abb√© Maury, and others, caused the decision to be again postponed. Only the Portuguese and the Avignonese Jews, who had hitherto enjoyed all civil rights as naturalized Frenchmen, were declared full citizens by a majority of 150 on 28 January 1790. This partial victory infused new hope into the Jews of the German districts, who made still greater efforts in the struggle for freedom. They won over the eloquent advocate Godard, whose influence in revolutionary circles was considerable. Through his exertions the National Guards and the diverse sections pronounced themselves in favor of the Jews, and the abb√© Malot was sent by the General Assembly of the Commune to plead their cause before the National Assembly. Unfortunately the grave affairs which absorbed the Assembly, the prolonged agitations in Alsace, and the passions of the clerical party kept in check the active propaganda of the Jews and their friends. A few days before the dissolution of the National Assembly (27 September 1791) a member of the Jacobin Club, formerly a parliamentary councilor, Duport, unexpectedly ascended the tribune and said, > I believe that freedom of worship does not permit any distinction in the > political rights of citizens on account of their creed. The question of the > political existence of the Jews has been postponed. Still the Muslems and > the men of all sects are admitted to enjoy political rights in France. I > demand that the motion for postponement be withdrawn, and a decree passed > that the Jews in France enjoy the privileges of full citizens. This proposition was accepted amid loud applause. Rewbell endeavored, indeed, to oppose the motion, but he was interrupted by Regnault de Saint-Jean, president of the Assembly, who suggested \\"that every one who spoke against this motion should be called to order, because he would be opposing the constitution itself\\". =During the Reign of Terror= Judaism in France thus became, as the Alsatian deputy Schwendt wrote to his constituents, \\"nothing more than the name of a distinct religion\\". However, in Alsace, especially in the Bas-Rhin the reactionaries did not cease their agitations and Jews were victims of discriminations. During the Reign of Terror, at Bordeaux, Jewish bankers, compromised in the cause of the Girondins, had to pay important fines or to run away to save their lives while some Jewish bankers (49 according to the Jewish Encyclopedia) were imprisoned at Paris as suspects and nine of them were executed. The decree of the convention by which the Catholic faith was annulled and replaced by the worship of Reason was applied by the provincial clubs, especially by those of the German districts, to the Jewish religion as well. Some synagogues were pillaged and the mayors of a few eastern towns (Strasbourg, Troyes, etc.) forbade the celebration of Sabbath (to apply the week of ten days). Meanwhile, the French Jews gave proofs of their patriotism and of their gratitude to the land that had emancipated them. Many of them died in battle as part of the Army of the Republic while fighting the forces of Europe in coalition. To contribute to the war fund, candelabra of synagogues were sold, and wealthier Jews deprived themselves of their jewels to make similar contributions. =Attitude of Napoleon= Joseph David Sinzheim was the president of the Grand Sanhedrin, an imperial Jewish high court sanctioned by Napoleon. Sermon in an israelite oratory Museum of Jewish Art and History Though the Revolution had begun the process of Jewish emancipation in France, Napoleon also spread the concept in the lands he conquered across Europe, liberating Jews from their ghettos and establishing relative equality for them. The net effect of his policies significantly changed the position of the Jews in Europe. Starting in 1806, Napoleon passed a number of measures supporting the position of the Jews in the French Empire, including assembling a representative group elected by the Jewish community, the Grand Sanhedrin. In conquered countries, he abolished laws restricting Jews to ghettos. In 1807, he added Judaism as an official religion of France, with previously sanctioned Roman Catholicism, and Lutheran and Calvinist Protestantism. Despite the positive effects, it is unclear however, whether Napoleon himself was disposed favorably towards the Jews, or merely saw them as a political or financial tool. On 17 March 1808, Napoleon rolled back some reforms by the so-called d√©cret inf√¢me, declaring all debts with Jews reduced, postponed, or annulled; this caused the Jewish community to nearly collapse. The decree also restricted where Jews could live, especially for those in the eastern French Empire, with all its annexations in the Rhineland and beyond (as of 1810), in hopes of assimilating them into society. Many of these restrictions were eased again in 1811 and finally abolished in 1818. After the Restoration The restoration of Louis XVIII did not bring any change in the political condition of the Jews. Such of the enemies of the Jews as cherished the hope that the Bourbons would hasten to undo the work of the Revolution with regard to Jewish emancipation were soon disappointed. The emancipation the French Jews had made such progress that the most clerical monarch could not find any pretext for curtailing their rights as citizens. They were no longer treated as poor, downtrodden peddlers or money-lenders with whom every petty official could do as he liked. Many of them already occupied high positions in the army and the magistracy, as well as in the arts and sciences. =State recognition= Of the faiths recognized by the state, only Judaism had to support its ministers, while those of the Catholic and Protestant churches were supported by the government. This legal inferiority was removed in that year, thanks to the intervention of the Duke of Orl√©ans, lieutenant-general of the kingdom, and to the campaign led in Parliament by the deputies comte de Rambuteau and Jean Viennet. Encouraged by these prominent men, the minister of education, on 13 November 1830, offered a motion to place Judaism upon an equal footing with Catholicism and Protestantism as regards support for the synagogues and for the rabbis from the public treasury. The motion was accompanied by flattering compliments to the French Jews, \\"who\\", said the minister, \\"since the removal of their disabilities by the Revolution, have shown themselves worthy of the privileges granted them\\". After a short discussion the motion was adopted by a large majority. In January 1831, it passed in the Chamber of Peers by 89 votes to 57, and on 8 February it was ratified by King Louis Philippe, who from the beginning had shown himself favorable to placing Judaism on an equal footing with the other faiths. Shortly afterward the rabbinical college, which had been founded at Metz in 1829, was recognized as a state institution, and was granted a subsidy. The government likewise liquidated the debts contracted by various Jewish communities before the Revolution. =Full equality= Full equality did not occur until 1831. By the fourth decade of the nineteenth century, France provided an environment in which Jews took active and many times leading roles. The Napoleonic policy of carri√®res aux talents 'careers for the gifted' permitted French Jews to enter previously forbidden fields such as the arts, finance, trade, and government. For this they were never forgiven by primarily Royalist and Catholic antisemites. =Assimilation= Adolphe Cr√©mieux, founder of the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle. Mus√©e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda√Øsme While the Jews had been placed in every point the equals of their Christian fellow citizens, the oath More Judaico still continued to be administered to them, in spite of the repeated protestations of the rabbis and the consistory. It was only in 1846, owing to a brilliant speech of the Jewish lawyer Adolphe Cr√©mieux, pronounced before the Court of N√Æmes in defense of a rabbi who had refused to take this oath, and to a valuable essay on the subject by Martin, a prominent Christian advocate of Strasburg, that the Court of Cassation removed this last remnant of the legislation of the Middle Ages. With this act of justice the history of the Jews of France merges into the general history of the French people. The rapidity with which many of them won affluence and distinction in the nineteenth century is without parallel. In spite of the deep-rooted prejudices which prevailed in certain classes of French society, many of them occupied high positions in literature, art, science, jurisprudence, the army‚Äîindeed, in every walk of life. In 1860, the Alliance Israelite Universelle was formed \\"to work everywhere for the emancipation and moral progress of the Jews; to offer effective assistance to Jews suffering from antisemitism; and to encourage all publications calculated to promote this aim.\\" In 1870, the Cr√©mieux decrees granted automatic French citizenship to the approximately 40,000 Jews of Algeria, at that time a French d√©partement, contrary to their Muslim neighbors. People of Jewish faith in France were becoming assimilated into their lives. After their Emancipation in 1791, Jews in France had new freedoms. For example, Jews were allowed to attend schools that were once delegated for just non-Jews. They were also allowed to pray in their own synagogues. Lastly, many Jews found themselves moving from the rural areas of France and into the big cities. In these big cities, Jews had new job opportunities and many were advancing up the economic ladder. 1893 edition of Edouard Drumont's antisemitic newspaper La Libre Parole. Although life was looking brighter for these Western Jews, some Jews who lived in Eastern Europe believed that the Emancipation in Western countries were causing the Jews to lose their traditional beliefs and culture. As more and more Jews were becoming assimilated into their new lives, these Jews were breaking away from rabbinical law and rabbinical authority decreased. For example, Jews were marrying outside of their religion and their children were growing up in homes where they were not being introduced to traditional beliefs and losing connection with their roots. Also, in these new urbanized Jewish homes, less and less Jews were following the strict laws of Kosher laws. Many Jews were so preoccupied with assimilating and prospering in their new lives that they formed a new type of Judaism that would fit with the times. The Reform Movement came about to let Jews stay connected to their roots while also living their lives without so many restrictions. =Antisemitism= Alphonse Toussenel (1803-1885) was a political writer and zoologist who introduced antisemitism into French mainstream thinking. A utopian socialist and a disciple of Charles Fourier. He criticized the economic liberalism of the July Monarchy and denounced the ills of civilization: individualism, egoism, and class conflict. He was hostile to the Jews and also to the British. Toussenel's Les juifs rois de l'√©poque, histoire de la f√©odalit√© financi√®re (1845) argued that French finance and commerce was controlled by an alien' Jewish presence, typified in the malign influence of the Rothschild banking family of France. Toussenel's antisemitism was rooted in a revolutionary- nationalist interpretation reading of French history. He was innovative and using zoology as a vehicle for social criticism, and his natural history books, as much as his political writings, were infused with antisemitic and anti-English sentiments. For Toussenel, the English and the Jews represented external and internal threats to French national identity. Antisemitism based on racism emerged in the 1880s led by Edouard Drumont, who founded the Antisemitic League of France in 1889, and was the founder and editor of the newspaper La Libre Parole. After spending years of research, he synthesized three major strands of antisemitism. The first strand was traditional Catholic attitudes toward the \\"Christ killers\\" augmented by vehement antipathy toward the French Revolution. The second strand was hostility to capitalism, of the sort promoted by the Socialist movement. The third strand was scientific racism, based on the argument that races have fixed characteristics, and the Jews have highly negative characteristics. Dreyfus affair Newspaper front page with √âmile Zola's letter, J'Accuse‚Ä¶! (I Accuse), addressing the President of the Republic, and accusing the government with antisemitism in the Dreyfus affair. The Dreyfus affair was a major political scandal that convulsed France from 1894 until its resolution in 1906, and which had reverberations for decades more. The affair is often seen as a modern and universal symbol of injusticeGuy Canivet, first President of the Supreme Court, Justice from the Dreyfus Affair, p. 15. for reasons of state and remains one of the most striking examples of a complex miscarriage of justice where the press and public opinion played a central role. The issue was blatant antisemitism as practiced by the Army and defended by traditionalists (especially Catholics) against secular and republican forces, including most Jews. In the end the latter triumphed, albeit at a very high personal cost to Dreyfus himself.Piers Paul Read, The Dreyfus Affair (2012) The affair began in November 1894 with the conviction for treason of Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a young French artillery officer of Alsatian Jewish descent. He was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for allegedly having communicated French military secrets to the German Embassy in Paris, Dreyfus was sent to the penal colony at Devil's Island in French Guiana, where he spent almost five years. Two years later, in 1896, evidence came to light identifying a French Army major named Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy as the real spy. After high-ranking military officials suppressed the new evidence a military court unanimously acquitted Esterhazy after the second day of his trial. The Army accused Dreyfus of additional charges based on false documents. Word of the military court's framing of Dreyfus and of an attendant cover-up began to spread, chiefly owing to J'Accuse‚Ä¶!, a vehement open letter published in a Paris newspaper in January 1898 by the notable writer √âmile Zola. Activists put pressure on the government to reopen the case. In 1899, Dreyfus was returned to France for another trial. The intense political and judicial scandal that ensued divided French society between those who supported Dreyfus (now called \\"Dreyfusards\\"), such as Anatole France, Henri Poincar√© and Georges Clemenceau, and those who condemned him (the anti-Dreyfusards), such as √âdouard Drumont, the director and publisher of the antisemitic newspaper La Libre Parole. The new trial resulted in another conviction and a 10-year sentence but Dreyfus was given a pardon and set free. Eventually all the accusations against Alfred Dreyfus were demonstrated to be baseless. In 1906 Dreyfus was exonerated and reinstated as a major in the French Army. The Affair from 1894 to 1906 divided France deeply and lastingly into two opposing camps: the pro-Army, mostly Catholic \\"anti-Dreyfusards\\" who generally lost the initiative to the anticlerical, pro-republican Dreyfusards. It embittered French politics and allowed the radicals to come to power. 20th century The relatively small Jewish community was based in Paris, and very well established in the city's business, financial, and intellectual elite. A third of Parisian bankers were Jewish, led by the Rothschild family, which also played a dominant role in the well organized Jewish community. Many of the most influential French intellectuals were nominally Jewish, including Henri Bergson, Lucien L√©vy- Bruhl and Emile Durkheim. The Dreyfus affair to some degree rekindled their sense of being Jewish. Jews were prominent in art and culture, typified by such artists as Modigliani, Soutine, and Chagall. The Jews considered themselves fully assimilated into French culture, for them Judaism was entirely a matter of religious belief, with minimal ethnic or cultural dimensions.Hyman, From Dreyfus to Vichy : the remaking of French Jewry, 1906-1939 pp 18-49. By the time Dreyfus was fully exonerated in 1906, antisemitism declined sharply and it declined again during the First World War, as a nation was aware that many Jews died fighting for France. The antisemitic newspaper La Libre Parole closed in 1924, and the former anti- Dreyfusard Maurice Barr√®s included Jews among France's \\"spiritual families\\". However it soared during the 1930s.Hyman, From Dreyfus to Vichy : the remaking of French Jewry, 1906-1939 pp 54-57, 199-202. After 1900, a wave of Jewish immigrants arrived, mostly fleeing the pogroms of Eastern Europe. The flow temporarily halted during World War I but resumed afterwards. The long- established, heavily assimilated Jewish population by 1920 was now only a third of the French Jewish population. It was overwhelmed by new immigrants and the restoration of Alsace-Lorraine. About 200,000 immigrants arrived, 1900 to 1939, mostly Yiddish-speakers from Russia and Poland as well as German- speaking Jews who fled the Nazi regime after 1933. The historic base of traditional Judaism was in Alsace-Lorraine, which was recovered by France in 1918. The new arrivals got along poorly with the established elite Jewish community. They did not want to assimilate, and they vigorously supported such new causes, especially Zionism and communism.Hyman, From Dreyfus to Vichy: The Remaking of French Jewry, 1906-1939 (1979) pp 63-88. The Yiddish influx and the Jewishness of the Popular Front's leader L√©on Blum contributed to a revival of antisemitism in the 1930s. Conservative writers such as Paul Morand, Pierre Gaxotte, Marcel Jouhandeau, and the leader of Action fran√ßaise Charles Maurras denounced Jews. Perhaps the most violent antisemitic writer was Louis-Ferdinand C√©line, who wrote, \\"I feel myself very friendly to Hitler, and to all Germans, whom I feel to be my brothers.... Our real enemies are Jews and Masons\\", and \\"Yids are like bedbugs.\\" By 1937, even mainstream French conservatives and socialists, not previously associated with antisemitism, denounced the alleged Jewish influence pushing the country into a \\"Jewish war\\" against Nazi Germany. The new intensity of antisemitism facilitated the extremism of the Vichy regime after 1940. =World War II and the Holocaust= Antisemitic Exposition during Nazi occupation of France (1942). When France came under occupation by Nazi Germany in June 1940, there were about 330,000 Jews living in France (and 370,000 in French North Africa). Of the 330,000, fewer than half held French citizenship. The others were foreigners, mostly exiles from Germany and Central Europe who had immigrated to France during the 1930s. Another 110,000 French Jews were living in the colony of French Algeria. About 200,000 Jews, and the large majority of foreign Jews, resided in the Paris area. Among the 150,000 French Jews, about 30,000, generally native to Central Europe, had obtained French citizenship after immigrating to France during the 1930s. Following the 1940 armistice after Germany occupied France, the Nazis incorporated the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine into Germany. The remainder of northern and western France was placed under German military control. Unoccupied southern metropolitan France and the French empire were placed under the control of the Vichy Regime, a new collaborationist French government. Some Jews managed to escape the invading German forces. Some found refuge in the countryside. Spain allowed 25,600 Jews to use its territory as an escape route. German occupation forces published their first anti-Jewish measure on 27 September 1940 as the \\"First Ordinance.\\" The measure was a census of Jews, and defined \\"who is a Jew.\\" The Second Ordinance was published on 18 October 1940, proscribing various business activities for Jews. On 31 August 1941 German forces confiscated all radios belonging to Jews, followed by their telephones, their bicycles, and disconnecting all phones to Jews. They were forbidden to use public telephones. Jews were forbidden to change their address, and next were forbidden to leave their homes between 8 pm and 5 am. All public places, parks, theatres and certain shops were soon closed to Jews. German forces issued new restrictions, prohibitions and decrees by the week. Jews were barred from public swimming pools, restaurants, cafes, cinemas, concerts, music halls, etc. On the metro, they were allowed to ride only in the last carriage. Antisemitic articles were frequently published in newspapers since the Occupation. The Germans organized antisemitic exhibitions to spread their propaganda. The music of Jewish composers was banned, as were works of art by Jewish artists. On 2 October 1941, seven synagogues were bombed. The first roundup of Jews took place on 14 May 1941, and 4,000 foreign Jews were taken captive. Another roundup took place on 20 August 1941, collecting both French and foreign Jews, who were sent to the Drancy internment camp and other concentration camps in France. Roundups continued, collecting French nationals, including lawyers and other professionals. On 12 December 1941, the most distinguished members of the Paris Jewish community, including doctors, academics, scientists and writers, were rounded up. On 29 May 1942, the Eighth Ordinance was published, which ordered Jews to wear the yellow star. The most notorious roundup was the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup, which required detailed planning and the use of the full resources of French police forces. This roundup took place on 16 and 17 July 1942; it collected nearly 13,000 Jews, 7,000 of whom, including more than 4,000 children, were interned and locked into the V√©lodrome d'Hiver, without adequate food or sanitation. In the meantime, the Germans began deportations of Jews from France to the death camps in eastern Europe. The first trains left on 27 March 1942. Deportations continued until 17 August 1944, by which time nearly 76,000 Jews (including those from Vichy France) were deported, of whom only 2,500 survived. (see Timeline of deportations of French Jews to death camps.) The majority of Jews deported were non-French Jews. One quarter of the pre-war Jewish population of France was killed in that process. Antisemitism was particularly virulent in Vichy France, which controlled a third of France from 1940 to 1942, at which point the Germans took over that southern area. Vichy's Jewish policy was a mixture of 1930s antiforeigner legislation with the virulent antisemitism of the Action Fran√ßaise movement.Jacques Adler, \\"The Jews and Vichy: reflections on French historiography.\\" Historical Journal 44.4 (2001): 1065-1082. The Vichy government openly collaborated with the Nazi occupiers to identify Jews for deportation and transportation to the death camps. As early as October 1940, without any request from the Germans, the Vichy government passed anti-Jewish measures (the Vichy laws on the status of Jews), prohibiting them from moving, and limiting their access to public places and most professional activities, especially the practice of medicine. The Vichy government also implemented those anti-Jewish laws in the colonies of Vichy North Africa. In 1941, the Vichy government established a Commissariat g√©n√©ral aux questions juives (1941-1944), which in 1942 worked with the Gestapo to round-up Jews. They participated in the Vel' d'Hiv roundup on 16 and 17 July 1942. On the other hand, France is recognised as the nation with the third highest number of Righteous Among the Nations (according to the Yad Vashem museum, 2006). This award is given to \\"non-Jews who acted according to the most noble principles of humanity by risking their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust.\\" In 1995 French President Jacques Chirac formally apologized to the Jewish community for the complicit role that French policemen and civil servants played in the roundups. He said: :\\"These black hours will stain our history for ever and are an injury to our past and our traditions. Yes, the criminal madness of the occupant was assisted ('second√©e') by the French, by the French state. Fifty- three years ago, on 16 July 1942, 450 policemen and gendarmes, French, under the authority of their leaders, obeyed the demands of the Nazis. That day, in the capital and the Paris region, nearly 10,000 Jewish men, women and children were arrested at home, in the early hours of the morning, and assembled at police stations... France, home of the Enlightenment and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, land of welcome and asylum, France committed that day the irreparable. Breaking its word, it delivered those it protected to their executioners.\\" Chirac also identified those who were responsible: \\"450 policemen and gendarmes, French, under the authority of their leaders [who] obeyed the demands of the Nazis.\\" In July 2017, while at a ceremony at the site of the V√©lodrome d'Hiver, France's President Emmanuel Macron denounced the country's role in the Holocaust and the historical revisionism that denied France's responsibility for 1942 roundup and subsequent deportation of 13,000 Jews (or the eventual deportation of 76,000 Jews). He refuted claims that the Vichy government, in power during WW II, did not represent the State. \\"It was indeed France that organised this\\", French police collaborating with the Nazis. \\"Not a single German\\" was directly involved, he added. Neither Chirac nor Fran√ßois Hollande had specifically stated that the Vichy government, in power during World War II, actually represented the French State. Macron on the other hand, made it clear that the government during the War was indeed that of France. \\"It is convenient to see the Vichy regime as born of nothingness, returned to nothingness. Yes, it‚Äôs convenient, but it is false. We cannot build pride upon a lie.\\" Macron made a subtle reference to Chirac's 1995 apology when he added, \\"I say it again here. It was indeed France that organized the roundup, the deportation, and thus, for almost all, death.\\" =Post-World War II: Anti-discriminatory laws and migration= In the wake of the Holocaust, around 180,000 Jews remained in France, many of whom were refugees from Eastern Europe who either could not or would not return to their former home countries. To prevent the types of abuses that took place under the German Occupation and Vichy Regime, the legislature passed laws to suppress antisemitic harassment and actions, and established educational programs. Jewish exodus from France's colonies in North Africa The surviving French Jews were joined in the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s by large numbers of Jews from France's predominantly Muslim North African colonies (along with millions of other French nationals) as part of the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries. They fled to France because of the decline of the French Empire and a surge in Muslim Antisemitism following the founding of Israel and Israel's victories in the Six-Day War and other Arab-Israeli wars. By 1951, France's Jewish population totalled around 250,000. Between 1956 and 1967, about 235,000 Sephardi Jews from Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco immigrated to France. By 1968, Sephardi Jews from the former French possessions in North Africa constituted the majority of the Jews of France. Before World War II and the Holocaust, French Jews were predominately from the Ashkenazi tradition and culture. The Sephardim, who follow nusach sepharad (Judaism as per the Sephardic ritual, according to Dan Michman's definition of such Jews), have since had a significant influence on the nature of French Jewish culture. These Jews from French North Africa have generally enjoyed a successful social and economic integration and helped reinvigorate the country's Jewish community. Kosher restaurants and Jewish schools have multiplied, in particular since the 1980s. In part in response to internal and international events, many of the younger generations have committed to religious renewal. In the 1980 Paris synagogue bombing, France's Jewish population suffered its first deadly terrorist attack since actions of the German occupation in the Second World War. The attack followed an increase in antisemitic incidents in the late 1970s by Neo Nazis. France‚ÄìIsrael relations Since World War II, France's government has varied in supporting and opposing the Israeli government. It was initially a very strong supporter of Israel, voting for its formation at the United Nations. It was Israel's main ally and primary supplier of military hardware for nearly two decades between 1948 and 1967. After the military alliance between France and Israel during the 1956 Suez Crisis, relations between Israel and France remained strong. It is widely believed that, as a result of the Protocol of S√®vres agreement, the French government secretly transported parts of its own atomic technology to Israel in the late 1950s which the Israeli government used to create nuclear weapons. But, after the end of the Algerian War in 1962, in which Algeria gained independence, France began to shift toward a more pro- Arab view. This change accelerated rapidly after the Six-Day War in 1967. Following the war, the United States became Israel's main supplier of weapons and military technology. After the 1972 Munich massacre at the Olympics, the French government refused to extradite Abu Daoud, one of the planners of the attack. Both France and Israel participated in the 15-year-long Lebanese Civil War. 21st century Ha√Øm Korsia, the current Chief Rabbi of France. France has the largest Jewish population in Europe and the third largest Jewish population in the world (after Israel and the United States). The Jewish community in France is estimated from a core population of 480,000-500,000 to an enlarged population of 600,000. In 2009, France's highest court, the council of state issued a ruling recognising the state's responsibility in the deportation of tens of thousands of Jews during World War II. The report cited \\"mistakes\\" in the Vichy regime that had not been forced by the occupiers, stating that the state \\"allowed or facilitated the deportation from France of victims of anti-Semitism\\". =Antisemitism and Jewish emigration= In the early 2000s, rising levels of antisemitism among French Muslims and antisemitic acts were publicized around the world, including the desecration of Jewish graves and tensions between the children of North African Muslim immigrants and North African Jewish children. One of the worst crimes happened when Ilan Halimi was mutilated and tortured to death by the so-called \\"Barbarians gang\\", led by Youssouf Fofana. This murder was motivated by money and fueled by antisemitic prejudices (the perpetrators said they believed Jews to be rich). In March 2012, a gunman, who had previously killed three soldiers, opened fire at a Jewish school in Toulouse in an antisemitic attack, killing four people, including three children. President Nicolas Sarkozy said, \\"I want to say to all the leaders of the Jewish community, how close we feel to them. All of France is by their side.\\" However, Jewish philanthropist Baron Eric de Rothschild suggested that the extent of antisemitism in France has been exaggerated and that \\"France was not an antisemitic country\\".Krieger, Leila Hilary. \\"Rothschild: France not anti-Semitic\\" . The Jerusalem Post, 15 June 2006/ 24 November 2010. The Newspaper Le Monde Diplomatique had earlier said the same thing. According to a 2005 poll made by the Pew Research Center, there is no evidence of any specific antisemitism in France, which, according to this poll, appears to be one of the least antisemitic countries in Europe, though France has the world's third largest Jewish population. France is the country that had the most favourable views of Jews in Europe (82%), next to the Netherlands, and the country with the third-least unfavourable views (16%) next to the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Rises in antisemitism in modern France have been linked to the intensifying Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. Between the start of the Israeli offensive in Gaza in late December 2008 and its end in January 2009, an estimated hundred antisemitic acts were recorded in France. This compares with a total of 250 antisemitic acts in the whole of 2007. In 2009, 832 acts of antisemitism were recorded in France (with, in the first half of 2009, an estimated 631 acts, more than the whole of 2008, 474), in 2010, 466 and, in 2011, 389. In 2011, there were 260 threats (100 graffitis, 46 flyers or mails, 114 insults) and 129 crimes (57 assaults, 7 arsons or attempted arsons, 65 deteriorations and acts of vandalism but no murder, attempted murder or terrorist attack) recorded. Between 2000 and 2009, 13,315 French Jews moved to Israel, or made aliyah, an increase compared to the previous decade (1990‚Äì1999 : 10,443) that was in the continuity of a similar increase since the 1970s. A peak was reached during this period, in 2005 (2005: 2,951 Olim) but a significant proportion (between 20 and 30%) eventually came back to France. Some immigrants cited antisemitism and the growing Arab population as reasons for leaving. One couple who moved to Israel claimed that rising antisemitism by French Muslims and the anti-Israel bias of the French government was making life for Jews increasingly uncomfortable for them. At a welcoming ceremony for French Jews in the summer of 2004, then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon caused controversy when he advised all French Jews to \\"move immediately\\" to Israel and escape what he coined \\"the wildest anti-semitism\\" in France. In August 2007, some 2,800 olim were due to arrive in Israel from France, as opposed to the 3,000 initially forecast. 1,129 French Jews made aliyah to Israel in 2009 and 1,286 in 2010. However, in the long term, France is not one of the top countries of Jewish emigration toward Israel. Many French Jews feel a strong attachment to France.Sitbon, Shirli. \\"Stay or go? French Jews face a growing ‚Äì and emotional ‚Äì dilemma.\\" Jewish Journal. 21 January 2015. 21 January 2015. In November 2012, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a joint press conference with Fran√ßois Hollande advised the French Jewish community by saying \\"In my role as Prime Minister of Israel, I always say to Jews, wherever they may be, I say to them: Come to Israel and make Israel your home.\\" alluding to former Israel Prime Minister's Ariel Sharon's similar advisement towards the French Jewish community to move to Israel back in 2004. In 2013, 3,120 French Jews immigrated to Israel, marking a 63% increase over the previous year. During the first few months of 2014, The Jewish Agency of Israel continued to encourage an increase of French aliyah through aliyah fairs, Hebrew-language courses, sessions which assist in potential olim to find jobs in Israel, and immigrant absorption in Israel. A May 2014 survey revealed that 74 percent of French Jews considered leaving France for Israel where of the 74 percent, 29.9 percent cited anti-Semitism. Another 24.4 cited their desire to \\"preserve their Judaism,\\" while 12.4 percent said they were attracted by other countries. \\"Economic considerations\\" was cited by 7.5 percent of the respondents. By June 2014, it was estimated by the end of 2014 a full 1 percent of the French Jewish community would have made aliyah to Israel, the largest in a single year. Many Jewish leaders stated the emigration is being driven by a combination of factors, including the cultural gravitation towards Israel and France's economic woes, especially for the younger generation drawn by the possibility of other socioeconomic opportunities in the more vibrant Israeli economy. Others point out that in 2014, many dramatic incidents of antisemitism took place, especially during Operation Protective Edge, and that France took an unusual pro-Palestine stance by recognizing the State of Palestine in Parliament and by undertaking to adopt a resolution in the United Nations Security Council which would unilaterally impose an end of the Israel- Arab conflict on Israel. At the end of 2014, a record 7,000 French Jews are reported to have made Aliyah. Some wealthy French Jewish families are choosing to immigrate to the United States instead, with \\"less red tape\\" for business than Israel. In January 2015, events such as the Charlie Hebdo shooting and Porte de Vincennes hostage crisis created a shock wave of fear across the French Jewish community. As a result of these events, the Jewish Agency planned an aliyah plan for 120,000 French Jews who wish to make aliyah. In addition, with Europe's stagnant economy as of early 2015, many affluent French Jewish skilled professionals, business moguls and investors have sought Israel as a start-up haven for international investments, as well as job and new business opportunities. In addition, Dov Maimon, a French Jewish √©migr√© who studies migration as a senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute, expects as many as 250,000 French Jews to make aliyah by the year 2030. Hours after the 2015 Saint-Quentin-Fallavier attack on a gas factory near Lyon on 26 June 2015, in which the severed head of a local (non-Jewish) businessman was pinned to the gates and an ISIS flag was raised, Immigration and Absorption Minister Ze‚Äôev Elkin strongly urged the French Jewish community to move to Israel and made it a national priority for Israel to welcome the French Jewish community with open arms. Immigration from France is on the rise: in the first half of 2015, approximately 5,100 French Jews made aliyah to Israel marking 25% more than in the same period during the previous year. Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, committed by suspected ISIS affiliates reputedly in retaliation for Op√©ration Chammal, more than 80 percent of French Jews considered making aliyah. The largest attack on the evening of 13 November killed 90 people, leaving 200 wounded at a rock concert in the Bataclan Theatre in Paris. Although its long time Jewish owners (who regularly set Jewish events there, including some in support of Israel) had sold the theatre shortly before the massacre, speculation arose about an antisemitic motive behind the attack, but this was not a popular theory in the French media. However to some, this possible antisemitic motive was concealed by the general media, raising questions about the medias' motives to do this, an issue reflected in the French Jewish community press. According to the Jewish Agency, nearly 6500 French Jews had made aliyah as of mid November 2015 and it was estimated that 8000 French Jews would settle down in Israel by the end of 2015. In January 2016, a 35-year-old teacher in Marseille was attacked with a machete by a Kurdish teenager. Some Jewish groups debated recommending that Jews not wear the kippah in public. A 73 year old Jewish municipal councillor in Cr√©teil was murdered in his apartment the same month. On 4 April 2017, the horrific murder of a 65-year-old French Jewish woman, Sarah Halimi, in her popular neighborhood home of Belleville in Paris, around the corner from a mosque reputed for its radicalism, and as police standing in the staircase heard the murderer yelling \\"Allahu akbar\\" repeatedly for minutes, and did not intervene in spite of the screams and the beating, has raised questions again. As it took several months for the French justice to qualify this murder as an antisemitic act, concern about an institutional covering of antisemitism increased. It was further feared as Roger Pinto was mugged with his family during a burglary at his Livry-Gargan home on 8 September 2017. Pinto soon witnessed that, as for Ilan Halimi's murder, he was told, \\"You are Jewish so you must have money;\\" this attack has neither been qualified as an anti-semitic act. On 23 March 2018, an 85-year-old French Jewish woman and Holocaust survivor, Mireille Knoll, was found dead in her apartment in the east of the French capital, where she lived alone. She was murdered by two Muslim suspects, one of which she had known since he was a child. The chief rabbi of Paris, Ha√Øm Korsia, wrote on Twitter that he was \\"horrified\\" by the killing.

It became prominent during the 1980s and 1990s along with the management principle value-based management or \\"managing for value\\". Definition The term can be used to refer to: *The market capitalization of a company; *The concept that the primary goal for a company is to increase the wealth of its shareholders (owners) by paying dividends and/or causing the stock price to increase; *The more specific concept that planned actions by management and the returns to shareholders should outperform certain bench- marks such as the cost of capital concept. In essence, the idea that shareholders' money should be used to earn a higher return than they could earn themselves by investing in other assets having the same amount of risk. The term in this sense was introduced by Alfred Rappaport in 1986. For a publicly traded company, Shareholder Value (SV) is the part of its capitalization that is equity as opposed to long-term debt. In the case of only one type of stock, this would roughly be the number of outstanding shares times current shareprice. Things like dividends augment shareholder value while issuing of shares (stock options) lower it. This shareholder value added should be compared to average/required increase in value, making reference to the organizations cost of capital. For a privately held company, the value of the firm after debt must be estimated using one of several valuation methods, such as discounted cash flow or others. History During the 1970s, there was an economic crisis caused by stagflation. The stock market had been flat for nearly 12 years and inflation levels had reached double-digits. The Japanese had taken the top spot as the dominant force in auto and high technology manufacturing, a title historically held by American companies. This, coupled with the economic changes noted by Mizruchi and Kimeldorf, brought about the question as to how to fix the current model of management. Though there were contending solutions to resolve these problems (e.g. consumer value), the winner was the Agency Theory developed by Jensen and Meckling. On August 12, 1981, Jack Welch made a speech at The Pierre in New York City called ‚ÄòGrowing fast in a slow-growth economy‚Äô.Betsy Morris, \\"Tearing up the Jack Welch playbook\\" (July 11, 2006) Fortune at CNNmoney.com This is often acknowledged as the \\"dawn\\" of the obsession with shareholder value. Welch's stated aim was to be the biggest or second biggest market player, and to return maximum value to stockholders. In 1983, Brian Pitman became CEO of Lloyds Bank and sought to clarify the governing objective for the company. The following year, he set return on equity as the key measure of financial performance and set a target for every business within the bank to achieve a return that exceeded its cost of equity. Marakon Associates was founded in 1978 and pioneered value-based management (VBM) from the mid 1980s based on the academic work of Dr. Bill Alberts. Other management consulting firms including Alcar (based on the work of Professor Al Rappaport), McKinsey, Stern Stewart (based on the work of Joel Stern) and BCG developed VBM approaches which collectively became prominent during the 1980s and 1990s along with the management principle value-based management or \\"managing for value\\". In March 2009, Welch criticized parts of the application of this concept, calling a focus on shareholder quarterly profit and share price gains \\"the dumbest idea in the world\\".Financial Times \\"Welch condemns share price focus\\" (March 13, 2009) Welch then elaborated on this, claiming that the quotes were taken out of context.Business Week \\"Jack Welch Elaborates\\" (March 16, 2009) = Interpretation = Mark Mizruchi and Howard Kimeldorf offer an explanation of the rise in prominence of institutional investors and securities analysts as a function of the changing political economy throughout the late 20th century. The crux of their argument is based upon one main idea. The rise in prominence of institutional investors can be credited to three significant forces, namely organized labor, the state and the banks. The roles of these three forces shifted, or were abdicated, in an effort to keep corporate abuse in check. However, ‚Äúwithout the internal discipline provided by the banks and external discipline provided by the state and labor, the corporate world has been left to the professionals who have the ability to manipulate the vital information about corporate performance on which investors depend‚Äù. This allowed institutional investors and securities analysts from the outside to manipulate information for their own benefit rather than for that of the corporation as a whole. Though Ashan and Kimeldorf (1990) admit that their analysis of what historically led to the shareholder value model is speculative, their work is well regarded and is built upon the works of some of the premier scholars in the field, namely Frank Dobbin and Dirk Zorn. As a result of the political and economic changes of the late 20th century, the balance of power in the economy began to shift. Today, ‚Äú‚Ä¶power depends on the capacity of one group of business experts to alter the incentives of another, and on the capacity of one group to define the interests of another. As stated earlier, what made the shift to the shareholder value model unique was the ability of those outside the firm to influence the perceived interests of corporate managers and shareholders. However, Dobbin and Zorn argue that those outside the firm were not operating with malicious intentions. ‚ÄúThey conned themselves first and foremost. Takeover specialists convinced themselves that they were ousting inept CEOs. Institutional investors convinced themselves that CEOs should be paid for performance. Analysts convinced themselves that forecasts were a better metric for judging stock price than current profits‚Äù. Overall, it was the political and economic landscape of the time that offered the perfect opportunity for professionals outside of firms to gain power and exert their influence in order to drastically change corporate strategy.  Agency theory and shareholder value Agency theory is the study of problems characterized by disconnects between two cooperating parties: a principal and an agent.Kathleen M. Eisenhardt, \\"Agency Theory: An Assessment and Review,\\" The Academy of Management Review 14(1989) 58. Agency problems arise in situations where there is a division of labor, a physical or temporal disconnect separating the two parties, or when the principal hires an agent for specialized expertise. In these circumstances, the principal takes on the agent to delegate responsibility to him. Theorists have described the problem as one of ‚Äúseparation and control‚Äù:Jensen and Meckling, \\"Theory of the Firm,\\" 310. agents cannot be monitored perfectly by the principal, so they may shirk their responsibilities or act out of sync with the principal's goals.Eisenhardt, \\"Agency Theory,\\" 61. The information gap and the misalignment of goals between the two parties results in agency costs,Shapiro, \\"Agency Theory,\\" 265. which are the sum of the costs to the principal of monitoring, the costs to the agent of bonding with the principal, and the residual loss due to the disconnect between the principal's interests and agent's decisions.Jensen and Meckling, \\"Theory of the Firm,\\" 308. Lastly, the shareholder value theory seeks to reform the governance of publicly owned firms in order to decrease the principal-agent information gap. The model calls for firms‚Äô boards to be independent from their corporate executives, specifically, for the head of the board to be someone other than the CEO and for the board to be independently chosen.Shapiro, \\"Agency Theory,\\" 269. An independent board can best objectively monitor CEO undertakings and risk.Dobbin and Jung, \\"The Misapplication of Mr. Michael Jensen,\\" 31. Shareholder value also argues in favor of increased financial transparency. By making firms‚Äô finances available to scrutiny, shareholders become more aware of the agent's behavior and can make informed choices about with whom to invest.Dobbin, \\"The Rise of Shareholder Value,\\" Sociology 25, Harvard University. Value-based management As a management principle, value-based management (VBM), or managing for value (MFV), states that management should first and foremost consider the interests of shareholders when making management decisions. Under this principle, senior executives should set performance targets in terms of delivering shareholder returns (stock price and dividends payments) and managing to achieve them. The concept of maximizing shareholder value is usually highlighted in opposition to alleged examples of CEO's and other management actions which enrich themselves at the expense of shareholders. Examples of this include acquisitions which are dilutive to shareholders, that is, they may cause the combined company to have twice the profits for example but these might have to be split amongst three times the shareholders. Although the legal premise of a publicly traded company is that the executives are obligated to maximize the company's profit,Maxwell S. Kennerly, Esq., \\"eBay v. Newmark: Al Franken Was Right, Corporations Are Legally Required To Maximize Profits\\" (September 13, 2010) this does not imply that executives are legally obligated to maximize shareholder value. As shareholder value is difficult to influence directly by any manager, it is usually broken down in components, so called value drivers. A widely used model comprises 7 drivers of shareholder value,Corporate Financial Strategy, Ruth Bender, Keith Ward, 3rd edition, 2008, p. 17 giving some guidance to managers: * Revenue * Operating Margin * Cash Tax Rate * Incremental Capital Expenditure * Investment in Working Capital * Cost of Capital * Competitive Advantage Period Looking at some of these elements also makes it clear that short term profit maximization does not necessarily increase shareholder value. Most notably, the competitive advantage period takes care of this: if a business sells sub- standard products to reduce cost and make a quick profit, it damages its reputation and therefore destroys competitive advantage in the future. The same holds true for businesses that neglect research or investment in motivated and well-trained employees. Shareholders, analysts and the media will usually find out about these issues and therefore reduce the price they are prepared to pay for shares of this business. This more detailed concept therefore gets rid of some of the issues (though not all of them) typically associated with criticism of the shareholder value model. Based on these seven components, all functions of a business plan and show how they influence shareholder value. A prominent tool for any department or function to prove its value are so called shareholder value maps that link their activities to one or several of these seven components. So, one can find \\"HR shareholder value maps\\", \\"R&D; shareholder value maps\\", and so on. Criticism The sole concentration on shareholder value has been widely criticized,Tirole 2001; Aglietta and Reberioux, 2005 particularly after the late-2000s financial crisis. While a focus on shareholder value can benefit the owners of a corporation financially, it does not provide a clear measure of social issues like employment, environmental issues, or ethical business practices. A management decision can maximize shareholder value while lowering the welfare of third parties. Shareholder value coupled with short-termism has also been criticized as lowering the overall rate of economic growth due to reduced business capital accumulation.Masouros, Pavlos E., \\"Corporate Law and Economic Stagnation: How Shareholder Value and Short-termism Contribute to the Decline of the Western Economies\\" Eleven International Publishing. pp. 6-9 It can also disadvantage other stakeholders such as customers. For example, a company may, in the interests of enhancing shareholder value, cease to provide support for old, or even relatively new, products. Additionally, short term focus on shareholder value can be detrimental to long term shareholder value; the expense of gimmicks that briefly boost a stocks value can have negative impacts on its long term value. Disadvantages of the shareholder value model Shareholder value may be detrimental to a company's worth. When all of a company's focus and strategy is concentrated on increasing share prices, the practice and ethics of the firm can become lost because of the following problems with the shareholder value model. =Lack of transparency= This is a disadvantage to companies and the market at large because it allows profit to be made without any successful business practice being conducted. The ethics of firms are compromised in the interest of increasing share value. =Increased risk= In the shareholder value model, companies often take on much more risk than they otherwise would. The acquisition of debt makes the company unstable and at risk of bankruptcy. Plentiful debt is conducive to increasing share value because the company has greater potential to increase value when starting at a lower baseline. This however is a detrimental to the stability of the company. Debt financing, or the purposeful acquisition of debt, causes the debt to equity ratio of the company to rise. Without shareholder value, this would normally be considered negative because it means that the company is not making money. In the shareholder value system, high debt to equity ratios are considered an indicator that the company has confidence to make money in the future. Therefore, debt is not something to avoid but rather something to embrace and having debt will actually gain the company investors. Taking on large risk attracts investors and increases potential value gain, but puts the company in danger of bankruptcy and collapse. =Short term strategy= When companies use the shareholder value model, firm behavior is focused on increasing the shareholder value rather than the long-term success of the company. Because employees are given stock options instead of salaries, it is in their interest for the share value to go up. In order for it to go up repeatedly, a strategy would be to allow the share price to alternate rising and falling. After the value has fallen, the amount of increase can be maximized. This type of oscillation is not beneficial to the long-term success of the company. Repeatedly decreasing share value so that it can be again increased generates profit for shareholders, but does not generate profit for the company; instead the company could become stagnant and fragile. Short-term strategies to increase share value are beneficial to investors and employees with stock options but are a disadvantage to sustained success of the company. Alternatives While shareholder value is the most common framework for measuring a company's success and financial viability, a number of alternatives have been proposed. Indeed, maximizing shareholder value is not always the goal of successful companies. =Stakeholder value= The broad idea of \\"stakeholder value\\" is the most common basis of alternative frameworks. The intrinsic or extrinsic worth of a business measured by a combination of financial success, usefulness to society, and satisfaction of employees, the priorities determined by the makeup of the individuals and entities that together own the shares and direct the company. This is sometimes referred to as stakeholder value. Stakeholder value heavily relies on corporate social responsibility and long-term financial stability as a core business strategy. The stakeholder value model is prevalent in regions where limited liability laws are not strong. Some companies, choosing to prioritize social responsibility, elect to prioritize the social and financial welfare of employees and suppliers over shareholders; this, in turn, shields shareholders, the owners of the company, from liability when the law would not be lenient should the company engage in poor behavior.\\"In Search of an alternative to Shareholder Value Maximization\\" Despite its high potential social benefit, this concept is difficult to implement in practice because of the difficulty of determining equivalent measures for usefulness to society and satisfaction of employees. For instance, how much additional \\"usefulness to society\\" should shareholders expect if they were to give up $100 million in shareholder return? In response to this criticism, defenders of the stakeholder value concept argue that employee satisfaction and usefulness to society will ultimately translate into shareholder value. Another related criticism is that it is difficult to determine how to equitably distribute value to stakeholders. The question of \\"who deserves what and how much\\" is a difficult one to answer. =Social enterprise= A company may choose to disregard shareholders completely. A social enterprise instead focuses its objectives on goals other than the profitability of its owners; indeed, the legal body of a social enterprise often precludes issuing dividends to shareholders. Social enterprises require significant investment in financial stability and long-term profitability, in the meantime taking very little risk. Social enterprises manifest themselves in the UK as community interest companies or limited by guarantee. In the United States, California allows companies to incorporate as flexible purpose corporations.

Its mainline currently extends from Interstate 4 (State Road 400) in Four Corners north to SR 46 in Sorrento. Control cities are Apopka and Tampa although the control cities for traffic at the entrances at U.S. Highway 441 and north are Orlando, Tampa, and Daytona Beach. SR 429 was originally planned as a western half of State Road 417. Route description State Road 429 traverses some of the highest elevations in Orange County and is often within a few miles of the Lake Wales Ridge. It runs along the west side of Greater Orlando. The road peaks at Mile Marker 13 where on clear days it is possible to see the skyline of downtown Orlando to the northeast and various portions of Walt Disney World Resort to the southeast. Florida's Turnpike Enterprise maintains the portion of the expressway south of Seidel Road, and CFX controls the portion north of the interchange. FDOT will control the portion under construction north of State Road 46. History The highway is named the \\"Daniel Webster Western Beltway\\" in honor of Daniel Webster, Florida's longest-serving legislator and figure often involved in state transportation issues. =Section A= Southbound at the Forest Lake Mainline Toll Plaza Section A is the original section from Florida's Turnpike in Ocoee, to US 441 in Apopka. It has a toll plaza in the middle, which was the first toll-plaza in the Orlando area with open road tolling for users of the E-Pass and related electronic toll collection systems. The road itself was finished in July 2000, temporarily ending at SR 50, and the interchange with Florida's Turnpike, featuring the highest ramp in the Orlando area, was completed in February 2001. SR 429 was originally planned to continue north from its original US 441 junction, but because the land needed for the SR 429 right of way was not secured ahead of time, new housing was developed north of the former SR 429/US 441 (now SR 451/US 441) intersection. This has forced a change in plans for the extension of SR 429. =Section B= Section B, also known as the Wekiva Parkway, would connect SR 429 from US 441 to I-4 in Sanford. This section of roadway is still currently under construction. It has been under debate for over a decade, due to its planned alignment being complicated by the ecologically-fragile Wekiva River basin and shifty support from Lake County. In 2004, an agreement was reached for its completion. It will be built largely as a long causeway with a limited number of exits to better control development in the region. It is now planned to link SR 429 with SR 417, creating a continuous beltway north of Orlando;http://www.wekivaparkway.com/ however, older plans involved a short drive on I-4 or its collector/distributor roads to reach SR 417. On May 25, 2011, the Florida Department of Transportation and CFX announced that they have partnered to jointly explore construction of the Wekiva Parkway extension. The proposed route will extend through Orange, Lake, and Seminole counties and is estimated to cost $1.8 billion. Officials hope to break ground in 2012, with completion by 2021. On January 20, 2016, the first stub section from County Road 435 (Mount Plymouth Road) near Haas Road in Orange County to State Road 46 east of Camp Challenge Road in Lake County opened to traffic and it is the first all electronic toll road in Central Florida. http://wekivaparkway.com/pnews.php?d=106&p;=1 On July 27, 2017, the Wekiva Parkway's mainline was extended from the US 441 connector road to a new northern terminus at Kelly Park Road.http://www.princecontracting.com/sr-429-wekiva-parkway-from-us-441-to- north-of-ponkan-road/ On March 31, 2018, the Wekiva Parkway's mainline was extended from Kelly Park Road to a new northern terminus at State Road 46. Along with this, a spur known as State Road 453 connecting the Wekiva Parkway with State Road 46 near Sorrento was opened in conjunction with the extension. This was the final section of the CFX's Section 2 of the road, and the final section of the CFX's section altogether. The final section of the Wekiva Parkway between State Road 46 and I-4 is under construction and is planned to open in 2023. This section will be constructed and maintained by FDOT. =Section C= Section C is the section from Florida's Turnpike to I-4 (SR 400) in Four Corners south of Walt Disney World. The section from Florida's Turnpike to County Road 535 was completed in December 2002. The part from CR 535 south to W Osceola Parkway opened December 16, 2005, with the extension to US 192 opening December 23. The Turnpike-maintained section, south of Seidel Road, was on a very tight construction schedule. An extended cold snap required the contractor to push to reach the opening date, although the interchanges at Western Way and Seidel Road were not complete. The Western Way interchange was not scheduled to open until Spring of 2006 to coincide with the opening of the new Expedition Everest ride at Disney's Animal Kingdom. The open road tolling gantry, while located north of US 192, was let for construction with the southern five miles (8 km) and was never intended to be open to traffic in conjunction with the 2005 opening between US 192 and Seidel. The Schofield Road interchange was identified as a future interchange, meaning that on December 23 no interchanges were open between US 192 and New Independence Parkway. Other openings were April 4, 2006 for Western Way, April 12, 2006 for Seidel Road, and December 9, 2006 for the remainder from US 192 south to I-4. The Schofield Road interchange opened on May 2015. =State Road 414 Phase 2= During June 2010, construction work began on the westward extension of State Road 414. Approximately of current SR 429 roadway was demolished and on May 14, 2012 a new interchange opened from SR 429 northbound to SR 414 eastbound and from SR 414 westbound to SR 429 southbound. SR 429 and SR 414 now runs concurrently to a new intersection with U.S. Route 441 near Plymouth where the SR 414 designation ends. The control city is Mount Dora. The road previously signed as SR 429 north of the current SR 414 interchange has been redesignated as State Road 451, and has been extended across US 441 to a new north terminus at Vick Road.

The community survived under Charlemagne, but suffered during the Crusades. Accusations of well poisoning during the Black Death (1346‚Äì53) led to mass slaughter of German Jews and they fled in large numbers to Poland. The Jewish communities of the cities of Mainz, Speyer and Worms became the center of Jewish life during medieval times. \\"This was a golden age as area bishops protected the Jews resulting in increased trade and prosperity.\\" The First Crusade began an era of persecution of Jews in Germany. Entire communities, like those of Trier, Worms, Mainz and Cologne, were slaughtered. The war upon the Hussite heretics became the signal for renewed persecution of Jews. The end of the 15th century was a period of religious hatred that ascribed to Jews all possible evils. The atrocities during the Khmelnytsky Uprising committed by Bohdan Khmelnytsky's Cossacks (1648, in the Ukrainian part of southeastern Poland) drove the Polish Jews back into western Germany. With Napoleon's fall in 1815, growing nationalism resulted in increasing repression. From August to October 1819, pogroms that came to be known as the Hep-Hep riots took place throughout Germany. During this time, many German states stripped Jews of their civil rights. As a result, many German Jews began to emigrate. From the time of Moses Mendelssohn until the 20th century, the community gradually achieved emancipation, and then prospered. In January 1933, some 522,000 Jews lived in Germany. After the Nazis took power and implemented their antisemitic ideology and policies, the Jewish community was increasingly persecuted. About 60% (numbering around 304,000) emigrated during the first six years of the Nazi dictatorship. In 1933, persecution of the Jews became an official Nazi policy. In 1935 and 1936, the pace of antisemitic persecution increased. In 1936, Jews were banned from all professional jobs, effectively preventing them from participating in education, politics, higher education and industry. The Schutzstaffel (SS) ordered what became during the night of November 9‚Äì10, 1938, as the Night of Broken Glass (Kristallnacht). The storefronts of Jewish shops and offices were smashed and vandalized, and many synagogues were destroyed by fire. Only roughly 214,000 Jews were left in Germany proper (1937 borders) on the eve of World War II. Beginning in late 1941, the remaining community was subjected to systematic deportations to ghettos and ultimately, to death camps in Eastern Europe. In May 1943, Germany was declared judenrein (clean of Jews; also judenfrei: free of Jews). By the end of the war, an estimated 160,000 to 180,000 German Jews had been killed by the Nazi regime and their collaborators. A total of about six million European Jews were murdered under the direction of the Nazis, in the genocide that later came to be known as the Holocaust. After the war, the Jewish community in Germany started to slowly grow again. Beginning around 1990, a spurt of growth was fueled by immigration from the former Soviet Union, so that at the turn of the 21st century, Germany had the only growing Jewish community in Europe, and the majority of German Jews were Russian-speaking. By 2018, the Jewish population of Germany had leveled off at 116,000, not including non-Jewish members of households; the total estimated enlarged population of Jews living in Germany, including non- Jewish household members, was close to 225,000. Currently in Germany, denial of the Holocaust or that six million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust (¬ß 130 StGB) is a criminal act; violations can be punished with up to five years of prison. In 2006, on the occasion of the World Cup held in Germany, the then-Interior Minister of Germany Wolfgang Sch√§uble, urged vigilance against far-right extremism, saying: \\"We will not tolerate any form of extremism, xenophobia, or antisemitism.\\" In spite of Germany's measures against these groups and antisemites, a number of incidents have occurred in recent years.  From Rome to the Crusades  pileus cornutus depicted ca. 1185 in the Hortus deliciarum of the Abbess Herrad of Landsberg. Jewish migration from Roman Italy is considered the most likely source of the first Jews on German territory. While the date of the first settlement of Jews in the regions which the Romans called Germania Superior, Germania Inferior, and Magna Germania is not known, the first authentic document relating to a large and well-organized Jewish community in these regions dates from 321 and refers to Cologne on the Rhine (Jewish immigrants began settling in Rome itself as early as 139 BC). It indicates that the legal status of the Jews there was the same as elsewhere in the Roman Empire. They enjoyed some civil liberties, but were restricted regarding the dissemination of their culture, the keeping of non-Jewish slaves, and the holding of office under the government. Jews were otherwise free to follow any occupation open to indigenous Germans and were engaged in agriculture, trade, industry, and gradually money-lending. These conditions at first continued in the subsequently established Germanic kingdoms under the Burgundians and Franks, for ecclesiasticism took root slowly. The Merovingian rulers who succeeded to the Burgundian empire were devoid of fanaticism and gave scant support to the efforts of the Church to restrict the civic and social status of the Jews. Charlemagne (800‚Äì814) readily made use of the Church for the purpose of infusing coherence into the loosely joined parts of his extensive empire, by any means a blind tool of the canonical law. He employed Jews for diplomatic purposes, sending, for instance, a Jew as interpreter and guide with his embassy to Harun al-Rashid. Yet, even then, a gradual change occurred in the lives of the Jews. The Church forbade Christians to be usurers, so the Jews secured the remunerative monopoly of money-lending. This decree caused a mixed reaction of people in general in the Frankish empire (including Germany) to the Jews: Jewish people were sought everywhere, as well as avoided. This ambivalence about Jews occurred because their capital was indispensable, while their business was viewed as disreputable. This curious combination of circumstances increased Jewish influence and Jews went about the country freely, settling also in the eastern portions (Old Saxony and Duchy of Thuringia). Aside from Cologne, the earliest communities were established in Mainz, Worms, Speyer, and Regensburg. The status of the German Jews remained unchanged under Charlemagne's successor, Louis the Pious. Jews were unrestricted in their commerce; however, they paid somewhat higher taxes into the state treasury than did the non-Jews. A special officer, the Judenmeister, was appointed by the government to protect Jewish privileges. The later Carolingians, however, followed the demands of the Church more and more. The bishops continually argued at the synods for including and enforcing decrees of the canonical law, with the consequence that the majority Christian populace mistrusted the Jewish unbelievers. This feeling, among both princes and people, was further stimulated by the attacks on the civic equality of the Jews. Beginning with the 10th century, Holy Week became more and more a period of antisemitic activities, yet the Saxon emperors did not treat the Jews badly, exacting from them merely the taxes levied upon all other merchants. Although the Jews in Germany were as ignorant as their contemporaries in secular studies, they could read and understand the Hebrew prayers and the Bible in the original text. Halakhic studies began to flourish about 1000. At that time, Rav Gershom ben Judah was teaching at Metz and Mainz, gathering about him pupils from far and near. He is described in Jewish historiography as a model of wisdom, humility, and piety, and became known to succeeding generations as the \\"Light of the Exile\\".Ben-Sasson, Haim Hillel (1976). \\"The Middle Ages,\\" in: Ben-Sasson (Ed.), A History of the Jewish People (pp. 385-723). Translated from the Hebrew. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. p. 433. In highlighting his role in the religious development of Jews in the German lands, The Jewish Encyclopedia (1901‚Äì1906) draws a direct connection to the great spiritual fortitude later shown by the Jewish communities in the era of the Crusades: > He first stimulated the German Jews to study the treasures of their > religious literature. This continuous study of the Torah and the Talmud > produced such a devotion to Judaism that the Jews considered life without > their religion not worth living; but they did not realize this clearly until > the time of the Crusades, when they were often compelled to choose between > life and faith. = Cultural and religious centre of European Jewry = The Jewish communities of the cities of Speyer, Worms, and Mainz formed the league of cities which became the center of Jewish life during Medieval times. These are referred to as the ShUM cities, after the first letters of the Hebrew names: Shin for Speyer (Shpira), Waw for Worms (Varmaisa) and Mem for Mainz (Magentza). The Takkanot Shum ( \\"Enactments of ShUM\\") were a set of decrees formulated and agreed upon over a period of decades by their Jewish community leaders. The official website for the city of Mainz states: Historian John Man describes Mainz as \\"the capital of European Jewry\\", noting that Gershom ben Judah \\"was the first to bring copies of the Talmud to Western Europe\\" and that his directives \\"helped Jews adapt to European practices.\\" (first published in 2002 by Headline Book under the title The Gutenberg revolution: the story of a genius and an invention that changed the world). Gershom's school attracted Jews from all over Europe, including the famous biblical scholar Rashi; and \\"in the mid-14th century, it had the largest Jewish community in Europe: some 6,000.\\" \\"In essence,\\" states the City of Mainz web site, \\"this was a golden age as area bishops protected the Jews resulting in increased trade and prosperity.\\"  A period of massacres (1096‚Äì1349)  Crusaders led by Peter the Hermit ravaged Jewish communities in Speyer, Worms, and Mainz during the Rhineland massacres of 1096. The First Crusade began an era of persecution of Jews in Germany, especially in the Rhineland.Riley-Smith, Jonathan (1991). The First Crusade and the Idea of Crusading. University of Pennsylvania. . pp. 50-7. The communities of Trier, Worms, Mainz, and Cologne, were attacked. The Jewish community of Speyer was saved by the bishop, but 800 were slain in Worms. About 12,000 Jews are said to have perished in the Rhenish cities alone between May and July 1096. Alleged crimes, like desecration of the host, ritual murder, poisoning of wells, and treason, brought hundreds to the stake and drove thousands into exile. Jews were alleged to have caused the inroads of the Mongols, though they suffered equally with the Christians. Jews suffered intense persecution during the Rintfleisch massacres of 1298. In 1336 Jews from Alsace were subjected to massacres by the outlaws of Arnold von Uissigheim. When the Black Death swept over Europe in 1348‚Äì49, some Christian communities accused Jews of poisoning wells. In the Erfurt Massacre of 1349, the members of the entire Jewish community were murdered or expelled from the city, due to superstitions about the Black Death. Royal policy and public ambivalence towards Jews helped the persecuted Jews fleeing the German- speaking lands to form the foundations of what would become the largest Jewish community in Europe in what is now Poland/Ukraine/Romania/Belarus/Lithuania.  In the Holy Roman Empire  Etching of the expulsion of the Jews from Frankfurt on August 23, 1614: The text says, \\"1,380 persons old and young were counted at the exit of the gate.\\" The legal and civic status of the Jews underwent a transformation under the Holy Roman Empire. Jewish people found a certain degree of protection with the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, who claimed the right of possession and protection of all the Jews of the empire. A justification for this claim was that the Holy Roman Emperor was the successor of the emperor Titus, who was said to have acquired the Jews as his private property. The German emperors apparently claimed this right of possession more for the sake of taxing the Jews than of protecting them. A variety of such taxes existed. Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, was a prolific creator of new taxes. In 1342, he instituted the \\"golden sacrificial penny\\" and decreed that every year all the Jews should pay the emperor one kreutzer out of every gulden of their property in addition to the taxes they were already paying to both the state and municipal authorities. The emperors of the house of Luxembourg devised other means of taxation. They turned their prerogatives in regard to the Jews to further account by selling at a high price to the princes and free towns of the empire the valuable privilege of taxing and fining the Jews. Charles IV, via the Golden Bull of 1356, granted this privilege to the seven electors of the empire when the empire was reorganized in 1356. From this time onward, for reasons that also apparently concerned taxes, the Jews of Germany gradually passed in increasing numbers from the authority of the emperor to that of both the lesser sovereigns and the cities. For the sake of sorely needed revenue, the Jews were now invited, with the promise of full protection, to return to those districts and cities from which they had shortly before been expelled. However, as soon as Jewish people acquired some property, they were again plundered and driven away. These episodes thenceforth constituted a large portion of the medieval history of the German Jews. Emperor Wenceslaus was most expert in transferring to his own coffers gold from the pockets of rich Jews. He made compacts with many cities, estates, and princes whereby he annulled all outstanding debts to the Jews in return for a certain sum paid to him. Emperor Wenceslaus declared that anyone helping Jews with the collection of their debts, in spite of this annulment, would be dealt with as a robber and peacebreaker, and be forced to make restitution. This decree, which for years allegedly injured the public credit, is said to have impoverished thousands of Jewish families during the close of the 14th century. Jews burned alive for the alleged host desecration in Deggendorf, Bavaria, in 1338, and in Sternberg, Mecklenburg, in 1492; a woodcut from the Nuremberg Chronicle (1493) The 15th century did not bring any amelioration. What happened in the time of the Crusades happened again. The war upon the Hussites became the signal for renewed persecution of Jews. The Jews of Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia passed through all the terrors of death, forced baptism, or voluntary self-immolation for the sake of their faith. When the Hussites made peace with the Church, the Pope sent the Franciscan friar John of Capistrano to win the renegades back into the fold and inspire them with loathing for heresy and unbelief; 41 martyrs were burned in Wroc≈Çaw alone, and all Jews were forever banished from Silesia. The Franciscan friar Bernardine of Feltre brought a similar fate upon the communities in southern and western Germany. As a consequence of the fictitious confessions extracted under torture from the Jews of Trent, the populace of many cities, especially of Regensburg, fell upon the Jews and massacred them. The end of the 15th century, which brought a new epoch for the Christian world, brought no relief to the Jews. Jews in Germany remained the victims of a religious hatred that ascribed to them all possible evils. When the established Church, threatened in its spiritual power in Germany and elsewhere, prepared for its conflict with the culture of the Renaissance, one of its most convenient points of attack was rabbinic literature. At this time, as once before in France, Jewish converts spread false reports in regard to the Talmud, but an advocate of the book arose in the person of Johann Reuchlin, the German humanist, who was the first one in Germany to include the Hebrew language among the humanities. His opinion, though strongly opposed by the Dominicans and their followers, finally prevailed when the humanistic Pope Leo X permitted the Talmud to be printed in Italy. = Moses Mendelssohn = Moses Mendelssohn Though reading German books was forbidden in the 1700s by Jewish inspectors who had a measure of police power in Germany, Moses Mendelson found his first German book, an edition of Protestant theology, at a well-organized system of Jewish charity for needy Talmud students. Mendelssohn read this book and found proof of the existence of God ‚Äì his first meeting with a sample of European letters. This was only the beginning to Mendelssohn's inquiries about the knowledge of life. Mendelssohn learned many new languages, and with his whole education consisting of Talmud lessons, he thought in Hebrew and translated for himself every new piece of work he met into this language. The divide between the Jews and the rest of society was caused by a lack of translation between these two languages, and Mendelssohn translated the Torah into German, bridging the gap between the two; this book allowed Jews to speak and write in German, preparing them for participation in German culture and secular science. In 1750, Mendelssohn began to serve as a teacher in the house of Isaac Bernhard, the owner of a silk factory, after beginning his publications of philosophical essays in German. Mendelssohn conceived of God as a perfect Being and had faith in \\"God's wisdom, righteousness, mercy, and goodness.\\" He argued, \\"the world results from a creative act through which the divine will seeks to realize the highest good,\\" and accepted the existence of miracles and revelation as long as belief in God did not depend on them. He also believed that revelation could not contradict reason. Like the deists, Mendelssohn claimed that reason could discover the reality of God, divine providence, and immortality of the soul. He was the first to speak out against the use of excommunication as a religious threat. At the height of his career, in 1769, Mendelssohn was publicly challenged by a Christian apologist, a Zurich pastor named John Lavater, to defend the superiority of Judaism over Christianity. From then on, he was involved in defending Judaism in print. In 1783, he published Jerusalem, or On Religious Power and Judaism. Speculating that no religious institution should use coercion and emphasized that Judaism does not coerce the mind through dogma, he argued that through reason, all people could discover religious philosophical truths, but what made Judaism unique was its revealed code of legal, ritual, and moral law. He said that Jews must live in civil society, but only in a way that their right to observe religious laws is granted, while also recognizing the needs for respect, and multiplicity of religions. He campaigned for emancipation and instructed Jews to form bonds with the gentile governments, attempting to improve the relationship between Jews and Christians while arguing for tolerance and humanity. He became the symbol of the Jewish Enlightenment, the Haskalah. Early 19th Century David Friedl√§nder was a German-Jewish communal leader who promoted Jewish emancipation in the Holy Roman Empire. In the late 18th century, a youthful enthusiasm for new ideals of religious equality began to take hold in the western world. Austrian Emperor Joseph II was foremost in espousing these new ideals. As early as 1782, he issued the Patent of Toleration for the Jews of Lower Austria, thereby establishing civic equality for his Jewish subjects. Before 1806, when general citizenship was largely nonexistent in the Holy Roman Empire, its inhabitants were subject to varying estate regulations. In different ways from one territory of the empire to another, these regulations classified inhabitants into different groups, such as dynasts, members of the court entourage, other aristocrats, city dwellers (burghers), Jews, Huguenots (in Prussia a special estate until 1810), free peasants, serfs, peddlers and Gypsies, with different privileges and burdens attached to each classification. Legal inequality was the principle. The concept of citizenship was mostly restricted to cities, especially free imperial cities. No general franchise existed, which remained a privilege for the few, who had inherited the status or acquired it when they reached a certain level of taxed income or could afford the expense of the citizen's fee (B√ºrgergeld). Citizenship was often further restricted to city dwellers affiliated to the locally dominant Christian denomination (Calvinism, Roman Catholicism, or Lutheranism). City dwellers of other denominations or religions and those who lacked the necessary wealth to qualify as citizens were considered to be mere inhabitants who lacked political rights, and were sometimes subject to revocable residence permits. Most Jews then living in those parts of Germany that allowed them to settle were automatically defined as mere indigenous inhabitants, depending on permits that were typically less generous than those granted to gentile indigenous inhabitants (Einwohner, as opposed to B√ºrger, or citizen). In the 18th century, some Jews and their families (such as Daniel Itzig in Berlin) gained equal status with their Christian fellow city dwellers, but had a different status from noblemen, Huguenots, or serfs. They often did not enjoy the right to freedom of movement across territorial or even municipal boundaries, let alone the same status in any new place as in their previous location. With the abolition of differences in legal status during the Napoleonic era and its aftermath, citizenship was established as a new franchise generally applying to all former subjects of the monarchs. Prussia conferred citizenship on the Prussian Jews in 1812, though this by no means resulted in full equality with other citizens. Jewish emancipation did not eliminate all forms of discrimination against Jews, who often remained barred from holding official state positions. The German federal edicts of 1815 merely held out the prospect of full equality, but it was not genuinely implemented at that time, and even the promises which had been made were modified. However, such forms of discrimination were no longer the guiding principle for ordering society, but a violation of it. In Austria, many laws restricting the trade and traffic of Jewish subjects remained in force until the middle of the 19th century in spite of the patent of toleration. Some of the crown lands, such as Styria and Upper Austria, forbade any Jews to settle within their territory; in Bohemia, Moravia, and Austrian Silesia many cities were closed to them. The Jews were also burdened with heavy taxes and imposts. In the German kingdom of Prussia, the government materially modified the promises made in the disastrous year of 1813. The promised uniform regulation of Jewish affairs was time and again postponed. In the period between 1815 and 1847, no less than 21 territorial laws affecting Jews in the older eight provinces of the Prussian state were in effect, each having to be observed by part of the Jewish community. At that time, no official was authorized to speak in the name of all Prussian Jews, or Jewry in most of the other 41 German states, let alone for all German Jews. Nevertheless, a few men came forward to promote their cause, foremost among them being Gabriel Riesser (d. 1863), a Jewish lawyer from Hamburg, who demanded full civic equality for his people. He won over public opinion to such an extent that this equality was granted in Prussia on April 6, 1848, in Hanover and Nassau on September 5 and on December 12, respectively, and also in his home state of Hamburg, then home to the second-largest Jewish community in Germany.By the introduction of the basic freedoms decided on by the National Assembly, adopted into Hamburg's statutory law on February 21, 1849. In W√ºrttemberg, equality was conceded on December 3, 1861; in Baden on October 4, 1862; in Holstein on July 14, 1863; and in Saxony on December 3, 1868. After the establishment of the North German Confederation by the law of July 3, 1869, all remaining statutory restrictions imposed on the followers of different religions were abolished; this decree was extended to all the states of the German empire after the events of 1870. = The Jewish Enlightenment = During the General Enlightenment (the 1600s to late 1700s), many Jewish women began to frequently visit non-Jewish salons and to campaign for emancipation. In Western Europe and the German states, observance of Jewish law, Halacha, started to be neglected. In the 18th century, some traditional German scholars and leaders, such as the doctor and author of Ma'aseh Tuviyyah, Tobias b. Moses Cohn, appreciated the secular culture. The most important feature during this time was the German Aufkl√§rung, which was able to boast of native figures who competed with the finest Western European writers, scholars, and intellectuals. Aside from the externalities of language and dress, the Jews internalized the cultural and intellectual norms of German society. The movement, becoming known as the German or Berlin Haskalah offered many effects to the challenges of German society. As early as the 1740s, many German Jews and some individual Polish and Lithuanian Jews had a desire for secular education. The German-Jewish Enlightenment of the late 18th century, the Haskalah, marks the political, social, and intellectual transition of European Jewry to modernity. Some of the elite members of Jewish society knew European languages. Absolutist governments in Germany, Austria, and Russia deprived the Jewish community's leadership of its authority and many Jews became 'Court Jews'. Using their connections with Jewish businessmen to serve as military contractors, managers of mints, founders of new industries and providers to the court of precious stones and clothing, they gave economic assistance to the local rulers. Court Jews were protected by the rulers and acted as did everyone else in society in their speech, manners, and awareness of European literature and ideas. Isaac Euchel, for example, represented a new generation of Jews. He maintained a leading role in the German Haskalah, is one of the founding editors of Ha- Me/assef. Euchel was exposed to European languages and culture while living in Prussian centers: Berlin and Koenigsberg. His interests turned towards promoting the educational interests of the Enlightenment with other Jews. Moses Mendelssohn as another enlightenment thinker was the first Jew to bring secular culture to those living an Orthodox Jewish life. He valued reason and felt that anyone could arrive logically at religious truths while arguing that what makes Judaism unique is its divine revelation of a code of law. Mendelssohn's commitment to Judaism leads to tensions even with some of those who subscribed to Enlightenment philosophy. Faithful Christians who were less opposed to his rationalistic ideas than to his adherence to Judaism found it difficult to accept this Juif de Berlin. In most of Western Europe, the Haskalah ended with large numbers of Jews assimilating. Many Jews stopped adhering to Jewish law, and the struggle for emancipation in Germany awakened some doubts about the future of Jews in Europe and eventually led to both immigrations to America and Zionism. In Russia, antisemitism ended the Haskalah. Some Jews responded to this antisemitism by campaigning for emancipation, while others joined revolutionary movements and assimilated, and some turned to Jewish nationalism in the form of the Zionist Hibbat Zion movement. = Reorganization of the German Jewish Community = The empowerment of the Jews and the rebirth of Jewish science led to a transfer of ancient traditions to the newer generations. Geiger and Holdeim were two founders of the conservative movement in modern Judaism accepted the modern spirit of liberalism. Samson Raphael Hirsch defended traditional customs: denying the modern \\"spirit\\". Neither of these beliefs was followed by the faithful Jews; Zachary Frankel created a moderate reform movement in assurance with German communities, public worships were reorganized, reduction of medieval additions to the prayer, congregational singing was introduced, and regular sermons required scientifically trained rabbis. Religious schools were enforced by the state due to a want for the addition of religious structure to secular education of Jewish children. Pulpit oratory started to thrive mainly due to German preachers, such as M. Sachs and M. Joel. Synagogal music was accepted with the help of Louis Lewandowski. Part of the evolution of the Jewish community was the cultivation of Jewish literature and associations created with teachers, rabbis, and leaders of congregations. Another vital part of the reorganization of the Jewish-German community was the heavy involvement of Jewish women in the community and their new tendencies to assimilate their families into a different lifestyle. Jewish women were contradicting their view points in the sense that they were modernizing, but they also tried to keep some traditions alive. German Jewish mothers were shifting the way they raised their children in ways such as moving their families out of Jewish neighborhoods, thus changing who Jewish children grew up around and conversed with, all in all shifting the dynamic of the then close-knit Jewish community. Additionally, Jewish mothers wished to integrate themselves and their families into German society in other ways. Because of their mothers, Jewish children participated in walks around the neighborhood, sporting events, and other activities that would mold them into becoming more like their other German peers. In order for mothers to assimilate into German culture, they took pleasure in reading newspapers and magazines that focused on the fashion styles, as well as other trends that were up and coming for the time and that the Protestant, bourgeois Germans were exhibiting. Similar to this, German-Jewish mothers also urged their children to partake in music lessons, mainly because it was a popular activity among other Germans. Another effort German-Jewish mothers put into assimilating their families was enforcing the importance of manners on their children. It was noted that non- Jewish Germans saw Jews as disrespectful and unable to grasp the concept of time and place. Because of this, Jewish mothers tried to raise their kids having even better manners than the Protestant children in an effort to combat the pre-existing stereotype put on their children. In addition, Jewish mothers put a large emphasis on proper education for their children in hopes that this would help them grow up to be more respected by their communities and eventually lead to prosperous careers. While Jewish mothers worked tirelessly on ensuring the assimilation of their families, they also attempted to keep the familial aspect of Jewish traditions. They began to look at Shabbat and holidays as less of culturally Jewish days, but more as family reunions of sorts. What was once viewed as a more religious event became more of a social gathering of relatives. = Birth of the Reform Movement = The beginning of the Reform Movement in Judaism was emphasized by David Philipson, who was the rabbi at the largest Reform congregation. The increasing political centralization of the late 18th and early 19th centuries undermined the societal structure that perpetuated traditional Jewish life. Enlightenment ideas began to influence many intellectuals, and the resulting political, economic, and social changes were overpowering. Many Jews felt a tension between Jewish tradition and the way they were now leading their lives- religiously- resulting in less tradition. As the insular religious society that reinforced such observance disintegrated, falling away from vigilant observance without deliberately breaking with Judaism was easy. Some tried to reconcile their religious heritage with their new social surroundings; they reformed traditional Judaism to meet their new needs and to express their spiritual desires. A movement was formed with a set of religious beliefs, and practices that were considered expected and tradition. Reform Judaism was the first modern response to the Jew's emancipation, though reform Judaism differing in all countries caused stresses of autonomy on both the congregation and individual. Some of the reforms were in the practices: circumcisions were abandoned, rabbis wore vests after Protestant ministers, and instrumental accompaniment was used: pipe organs. In addition, the traditional Hebrew prayer book was replaced by German text, and reform synagogues began being called temples which were previously considered the Temple of Jerusalem. Reform communities composed of similar beliefs and Judaism changed at the same pace as the rest of society had. The Jewish people have adapted to religious beliefs and practices to the meet the needs of the Jewish people throughout the generation.  1815‚Äì1918  Kaiser's army, born in Saarbr√ºcken The headstones of the fallen Jewish soldiers who fought for Germany in World War I were removed during World War II, and were later replaced.

Willi Ermann of Saarbrucken, a German Jewish soldier in World War I: Ermann was murdered at Auschwitz in the Holocaust.A Page of Testimony given by Ermann's brother, at Yad Vashem website Napoleon I emancipated the Jews across Europe, but with Napoleon's fall in 1815, growing nationalism resulted in increasing repression. From August to October 1819, pogroms that came to be known as the Hep-Hep riots took place throughout Germany. Jewish property was destroyed, and many Jews were killed. During this time, many German states stripped Jews of their civil rights. In the Free City of Frankfurt, only 12 Jewish couples were allowed to marry each year, and the 400,000 gulden the city's Jewish community had paid in 1811 for its emancipation was forfeited. After the Rhineland reverted to Prussian control, Jews lost the rights Napoleon had granted them, were banned from certain professions, and the few who had been appointed to public office before the Napoleonic Wars were dismissed.Elon, Amos: The Pity of It All: A History of the Jews in Germany, 1743‚Äì1933 Throughout numerous German states, Jews had their rights to work, settle, and marry restricted. Without special letters of protection, Jews were banned from many different professions, and often had to resort to jobs considered unrespectable, such as peddling or cattle dealing, to survive. A Jewish man who wanted to marry had to purchase a registration certificate, known as a Matrikel, proving he was in a \\"respectable\\" trade or profession. A Matrikel, which could cost up to 1,000 gulden, was usually restricted to firstborn sons.Sachar, Howard M.: A History of the Jews in America ‚Äì Vintage Books As a result, most Jewish men were unable to legally marry. Throughout Germany, Jews were heavily taxed, and were sometimes discriminated against by gentile craftsmen. As a result, many German Jews began to emigrate. The emigration was encouraged by German-Jewish newspapers. At first, most emigrants were young, single men from small towns and villages. A smaller number of single women also emigrated. Individual family members would emigrate alone, and then send for family members once they had earned enough money. Emigration eventually swelled, with some German Jewish communities losing up to 70% of their members. At one point, a German-Jewish newspaper reported that all the young Jewish males in the Franconian towns of Hagenbach, Ottingen, and Warnbach had emigrated or were about to emigrate. The United States was the primary destination for emigrating German Jews. The Revolutions of 1848 swung the pendulum back towards freedom for the Jews. A noted reform rabbi of that time was Leopold Zunz, a contemporary and friend of Heinrich Heine. In 1871, with the unification of Germany by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, came their emancipation, but the growing mood of despair among assimilated Jews was reinforced by the antisemitic penetrations of politics. In the 1870s, antisemitism was fueled by the financial crisis and scandals; in the 1880s by the arrival of masses of Ostjuden, fleeing from Russian territories; by the 1890s it was a parliamentary presence, threatening anti-Jewish laws. In 1879 the Hamburg anarchist pamphleteer Wilhelm Marr introduced the term 'antisemitism' into the political vocabulary by founding the Antisemitic League. Antisemites of the v√∂lkisch movement were the first to describe themselves as such, because they viewed Jews as part of a Semitic race that could never be properly assimilated into German society. Such was the ferocity of the anti-Jewish feeling of the v√∂lkisch movement that by 1900, antisemitic had entered German to describe anyone who had anti-Jewish feelings. However, despite massive protests and petitions, the v√∂lkisch movement failed to persuade the government to revoke Jewish emancipation, and in the 1912 Reichstag elections, the parties with v√∂lkisch-movement sympathies suffered a temporary defeat. Jews experienced a period of legal equality after 1848. Baden and W√ºrttemberg passed the legislation that gave the Jews complete equality before the law in 1861‚Äì64. The newly formed German Empire did the same in 1871.V. R. Berghahn, Imperial Germany, 1871‚Äì1914: Economy, Society, Culture, and Politics (1994) p 102 Historian Fritz Stern concludes that by 1900, what had emerged was a Jewish-German symbiosis, where German Jews had merged elements of German and Jewish culture into a unique new one. Marriages between Jews and non-Jews became somewhat common from the 19th century; for example, the wife of German Chancellor Gustav Stresemann was Jewish. However, opportunity for high appointments in the military, the diplomatic service, judiciary or senior bureaucracy was very small.Berghahn, Imperial Germany, 1871‚Äì1914 (1994) pp 105-6 Some historians believe that with emancipation the Jewish people lost their roots in their culture and began only using German culture. However, other historians including Marion A. Kaplan, argue that it was the opposite and Jewish women were the initiators of balancing both Jewish and German culture during Imperial Germany. Jewish women played a key role in keeping the Jewish communities in tune with the changing society that was evoked by the Jews being emancipation. Jewish women were the catalyst of modernization within the Jewish community. The years 1870-1918 marked the shift in the women's role in society. Their job in the past had been housekeeping and raising children. Now, however, they began to contribute to the home financially. Jewish mothers were the only tool families had to linking Judaism with German culture. They felt it was their job to raise children that would fit in with bourgeois Germany. Women had to balance enforcing German traditions while also preserving Jewish traditions. Women were in charge of keeping kosher and the Sabbath; as well as, teaching their children German speech and dressing them in German clothing. Jewish women attempted to create an exterior presence of German while maintaining the Jewish lifestyle inside their homes. During the history of the German Empire, there were various divisions within the German Jewish community over its future; in religious terms, Orthodox Jews sought to keep to Jewish religious tradition, while liberal Jews sought to \\"modernise\\" their communities by shifting from liturgical traditions to organ music and German-language prayers. The Jewish population grew from 512,000 in 1871 to 615,000 in 1910, including 79,000 recent immigrants from Russia, just under one percent of the total. About 15,000 Jews converted to Christianity between 1871 and 1909.Berghahn, Imperial Germany, 1871‚Äì1914 (1994) p 102-3 The typical attitude of German liberals towards Jews was that they were in Germany to stay and were capable of being assimilated; anthropologist and politician Rudolf Virchow summarised this position, saying \\"The Jews are simply here. You cannot strike them dead.\\" This position, however, did not tolerate cultural differences between Jews and non-Jews, advocating instead eliminating this difference.Zimmerman, Andrew. Anthropology and antihumanism in imperial Germany.

Approximately 2,000 Jews became military officers and 1,200 became medical officers.\\" Many German Jews supported the war out of patriotism; like many Germans, they viewed Germany's actions as defensive in nature and even left-liberal Jews believed Germany was responding to the actions of other countries, particularly Russia. For many Jews it was never a question as to whether or not they would stand behind Germany, it was simply a given that they would. The fact that the enemy was Russia also gave an additional reason for German Jews to support the war; Tsarist Russia was regarded as the oppressor in the eyes of German Jews for its pogroms and for many German Jews, the war against Russia would become a sort of holy war. While there was partially a desire for vengeance, for many Jews ensuring Russia's Jewish population was saved from a life of servitude was equally important ‚Äì one German-Jewish publication stated \\"We are fighting to protect our holy fatherland, to rescue European culture and to liberate our brothers in the east.\\"Grady, Timothy L. A Deadly Legacy: German Jews and the Great War. Yale University Press, 2017, pp.22-23Mikics, David, The Jews Who Stabbed Germany in The Back, Tablet Magazine, 09.11.2017, retrieved 15.10.2019 War fervour was as common amongst Jewish communities as it was amongst ethnic Germans ones. The main Jewish organisation in Germany, the Central Association of German Citizens of the Jewish Faith, declared unconditional support for the war and when 5 August was declared by the Kaiser to be a day of patriotic prayer, synagogues across Germany surged with visitors and filled with patriotic prayers and nationalistic speeches.Grady, Timothy L. A Deadly Legacy: German Jews and the Great War. Yale University Press, 2017, p.26 While going to war brought the unsavoury prospect fighting fellow Jews in Russia, France and Britain, for the majority of Jews this severing of ties with Jewish communities in the Entente was accepted part of their spiritual mobilisation for war. After all, the conflict also pitted German Catholics and Protestants against their fellow believers in the east and west. Indeed, for some Jews the fact that Jews were going to war with one another was proof of the normality of German-Jewish life; they could no longer be considered a minority with transnational loyalties but loyal German citizens. German Jews often broke ties with Jews of other countries; the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle, a French organisation that was dedicated to protecting Jewish rights, saw a German Jewish member quit once the war started, declaring that he could not, as a German, belong to a society that was under French leadership.Grady, Timothy L. A Deadly Legacy: German Jews and the Great War. Yale University Press, 2017, p.33 German Jews supported German colonial ambitions in Africa and Eastern Europe, out of the desire to increase German power and to rescue Eastern European Jews from Tsarist rule. The eastern advance became important for German Jews because it combined German military superiority with rescuing Eastern Jews from Russian brutality; Russian antisemitism and pogroms had only worsened as the war dragged on.Crim, Brian E. \\"A Deadly Legacy: German Jews and the Great War.\\" (2018): 295-297.Grady, Timothy L. A Deadly Legacy: German Jews and the Great War. Yale University Press, 2017, pp.74-79 However, German Jews did not always feel a personal kinship with Russian Jews. Many were repelled by Eastern Jews, who dressed and behaved differently, as well as being much more religiously devout. Victor Klemperer, a German Jew working for military censors, stated \\"No, I did not belong to these people, even if one proved my blood relation to them a hundred times over...I belonged to Europe, to Germany, and I thanked my creator that I was German.\\" This was a common attitude amongst ethnic Germans however; during the invasion of Russia the territories the Germans overran seemed backwards and primitive, thus for many Germans their experiences in Russia simply reinforced their national self- concept.Strachan, Hew. The First World War: A New History. Simon and Schuster, 2014. Prominent Jewish industrialists and bankers, such as Walter Rathenau and Max Warburg played major roles in supervising the German war economy. In October 1916, the German Military High Command administered the Judenz√§hlung (census of Jews). Designed to confirm accusations of the lack of patriotism among German Jews, the census disproved the charges, but its results were not made public.\\"Deutsche J√ºdische Soldaten\\" (German Jewish soldiers) Bavarian National Exhibition Denounced as a \\"statistical monstrosity\\",Bajohr, Frank: The \\"Folk Community\\" and the Persecution of the Jews: German Society under National Socialist Dictatorship, 1933‚Äì1945. Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Fall 2006; 20: 183‚Äì206. the census was a catalyst to intensified antisemitism and social myths such as the \\"stab-in-the-back myth\\" (Dolchsto√ülegende). For many Jews, the fact the census was carried out at all caused a sense of betrayal, as German Jews had took part in the violence, food shortages, nationalist sentiment and misery of attrition alongside their fellow Germans, however most German-Jewish soldiers carried on dutifully to the bitter end. When strikes broke out in Germany towards the end of the war, some Jews supported them. However, the majority of Jews had little sympathy for the strikers and one Jewish newspaper accused the strikers of \\"stabbing the frontline army in the back.\\" Like many Germans, German Jews would lament the Treaty of Versailles.  Weimar years, 1919‚Äì33  Under the Weimar Republic, 1919‚Äì1933, German Jews played a major role in politics and diplomacy for the first time in their history, and they strengthened their position in financial, economic, and cultural affairs.Donald L. Niewyk, The Jews in Weimar Germany (2001) Hugo Preu√ü was Interior Minister under the first post-imperial regime and wrote the first draft of the liberal Weimar Constitution.Peter Stirk, \\"Hugo Preuss, German political thought and the Weimar constitution.\\" History of Political Thought (2002) 23#3 pp: 497-516. Walther Rathenau, the chairman of General Electric (AEG) and head of the German Democratic Party (DDP), served as foreign minister in 1922, when he negotiated the important Treaty of Rapallo. He was assassinated two months later.David Felix, Walther Rathenau and the Weimar Republic: the politics of reparations (1971). Already by 1914, the Jews were well represented among the wealthy, including 24 percent of the richest men in Prussia, and eight percent of the university students.Berghahn, Imperial Germany, 1871‚Äì1914 (1994) pp 104-5 = Antisemitism = Austrian postcard published in 1919, depicting the legend of Jewish betrayal during WWI There was sporadic antisemitism based on the false allegation that wartime Germany had been betrayed by an enemy within. There was some violence against German Jews in the early years of the Weimar Republic, and it was led by the paramilitary Freikorps. The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (1920), a forgery which claimed that Jews were taking over the world, was widely circulated. The second half of the 1920s were prosperous, and antisemitism was much less noticeable. When the Great Depression hit in 1929, it surged again as Adolf Hitler and his Nazi party promoted a virulent strain. Author Jay Howard Geller says that four possible responses were available to the German Jewish community. The majority of German Jews were only nominally religious and they saw their Jewish identity as only one of several identities; they opted for bourgeois liberalism and assimilation into all phases of German culture. A second group (especially recent migrants from eastern Europe) embraced Judaism and Zionism. A third group of left-wing elements endorsed the universalism of Marxism, which downplayed ethnicity and antisemitism. A fourth group contained some who embraced hardcore German nationalism and minimized or hid their Jewish heritage. When the Nazis came to power in 1933, a fifth option was seized upon by hundreds of thousands: escape into exile, typically at the cost of leaving all wealth behind.Jay Howard Geller, \\"The Scholem Brothers and the Paths of German Jewry, 1914-1939,\\" Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies . (2012) 30#2 pp 52-73 The German legal system generally treated Jews fairly throughout the period. The Centralverein, the major organization of German Jewry, used the court system to vigorously defend Jewry against antisemitic attacks across Germany; it proved generally successful. = Intellectuals = Heidelberg University was considered to be one of the most eminent institutions of Jewish-German learning. Jewish intellectuals and creative professionals were among the leading figures in many areas of Weimar culture. German university faculties became universally open to Jewish scholars in 1918. Leading Jewish intellectuals on university faculties included physicist Albert Einstein; sociologists Karl Mannheim, Erich Fromm, Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, and Herbert Marcuse; philosophers Ernst Cassirer and Edmund Husserl; communist political theorist Arthur Rosenberg; sexologist and pioneering LGBT advocate Magnus Hirschfeld, and many others. Seventeen German citizens were awarded Nobel prizes during the Weimar Republic (1919‚Äì1933), five of whom were Jewish scientists. The German-Jewish literary magazine, Der Morgen, was established in 1925. It published essays and stories by prominent Jewish writers such as Franz Kafka and Leo Hirsch until its liquidation by the Nazi government in 1938.  Jews under the Nazis (1933‚Äì45)  Taken in March 1933, immediately after the Nazis seized power, this photo shows Nazi SA militants forcing a Jewish lawyer to walk barefoot through the streets of Munich wearing a sign that says \\"I will never again complain to the police\\" In Germany, according to historian Hans Mommsen, there were three types of antisemitism. In a 1997 interview, Mommsen was quoted as saying: > One should differentiate between the cultural antisemitism symptomatic of > the German conservatives‚Äîfound especially in the German officer corps and > the high civil administration‚Äîand mainly directed against the Eastern Jews > on the one hand, and v√∂lkisch antisemitism on the other. The conservative > variety functions, as Shulamit Volkov has pointed out, as something of a > \\"cultural code.\\" This variety of German antisemitism later on played a > significant role insofar as it prevented the functional elite from > distancing itself from the repercussions of racial antisemitism. Thus, there > was almost no relevant protest against the Jewish persecution on the part of > the generals or the leading groups within the Reich government. This is > especially true with respect to Hitler's proclamation of the \\"racial > annihilation war\\" against the Soviet Union. Besides conservative > antisemitism, there existed in Germany a rather silent anti-Judaism within > the Catholic Church, which had a certain impact on immunizing the Catholic > population against the escalating persecution. The famous protest of the > Catholic Church against the euthanasia program was, therefore, not > accompanied by any protest against the Holocaust. > > The third and most vitriolic variety of antisemitism in Germany (and > elsewhere) is the so-called v√∂lkisch antisemitism or racism, and this is the > foremost advocate of using violence. In 1933, persecution of the Jews became an active Nazi policy, but at first laws were not as rigorously obeyed or as devastating as in later years. Such clauses, known as Aryan paragraphs, had been postulated previously by antisemitism and enacted in many private organizations. boycott of April 1, 1933 The continuing and exacerbating abuse of Jews in Germany triggered calls throughout March 1933 by Jewish leaders around world for a boycott of German products. The Nazis responded with further bans and boycotts against Jewish doctors, shops, lawyers and stores. Only six days later, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was passed, banning Jews from being employed in government. This law meant that Jews were now indirectly and directly dissuaded or banned from privileged and upper-level positions reserved for \\"Aryan\\" Germans. From then on, Jews were forced to work at more menial positions, beneath non-Jews, pushing them to more labored positions. The Civil Service Law reached immediately into the education system because university professors, for example, were civil servants. While the majority of the German intellectual classes were not thoroughgoing National Socialists, academia had been suffused with a \\"cultured antisemitism\\" since imperial times, even more so during Weimar. With the majority of non-Jewish professors holding such feelings about Jews, coupled with how the Nazis' outwardly appeared in the period during and after the seizure of power, there was little motivation to oppose the anti-Jewish measures being enacted‚Äîfew did, and many were actively in favor. According to a German professor of the history of mathematics, \\"There is no doubt that most of the German mathematicians who were members of the professional organization collaborated with the Nazis, and did nothing to save or help their Jewish colleagues.\\" \\"German physicians were highly Nazified, compared to other professionals, in terms of party membership,\\" observed Raul Hilberg and some even carried out experiments on human beings at places like Auschwitz. Full text On August 2, 1934, President Paul von Hindenburg died. No new president was appointed; with Adolf Hitler as chancellor of Germany, he took control of the office of F√ºhrer. This, and a tame government with no opposition parties, allowed Adolf Hitler totalitarian control of law-making. The army also swore an oath of loyalty personally to Hitler, giving him power over the military; this position allowed him to enforce his beliefs further by creating more pressure on the Jews than ever before. In 1935 and 1936, the pace of persecution of the Jews increased. In May 1935, Jews were forbidden to join the Wehrmacht (Armed Forces), and that year, anti-Jewish propaganda appeared in Nazi German shops and restaurants. The Nuremberg Racial Purity Laws were passed around the time of the Nazi rallies at Nuremberg; on September 15, 1935, the Law for the Protection of German Blood and Honor was passed, preventing sexual relations and marriages between Aryans and Jews. At the same time the Reich Citizenship Law was passed and was reinforced in November by a decree, stating that all Jews, even quarter- and half-Jews, were no longer citizens (Reichsb√ºrger) of their own country. Their official status became Reichsangeh√∂riger, \\"subject of the state\\". This meant that they had no basic civil rights, such as that to vote, but at this time the right to vote for the non-Jewish Germans only meant the obligation to vote for the Nazi party. This removal of basic citizens' rights preceded harsher laws to be passed in the future against Jews. The drafting of the Nuremberg Laws is often attributed to Hans Globke. In 1936, Jews were banned from all professional jobs, effectively preventing them from exerting any influence in education, politics, higher education and industry. Because of this, there was nothing to stop the anti-Jewish actions which spread across the Nazi-German economy. After the Night of the Long Knives, the Schutzstaffel (SS) became the dominant policing power in Germany. Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler was eager to please Hitler and so willingly obeyed his orders. Since the SS had been Hitler's personal bodyguard, its members were far more loyal and skilled than those of the Sturmabteilung (SA) had been. Because of this, they were also supported, though distrusted, by the army, which was now more willing to agree with Hitler's decisions than when the SA was dominant. All of this allowed Hitler more direct control over government and political attitude towards Jews in Nazi Germany. In 1937 and 1938, new laws were implemented, and the segregation of Jews from the true \\"Aryan\\" German population was started. In particular, Jews were penalized financially for their perceived racial status. On June 4, 1937, two young German Jews, Helmut Hirsch and Isaac Utting, were both executed for being involved in a plot to bomb the Nazi party headquarters in Nuremberg. As of March 1, 1938, government contracts could no longer be awarded to Jewish businesses. On September 30, \\"Aryan\\" doctors could only treat \\"Aryan\\" patients. Provision of medical care to Jews was already hampered by the fact that Jews were banned from being doctors or having any professional jobs. German Jewish passports could be used to leave, but not to return. Beginning August 17, 1938, Jews with first names of non-Jewish origin had to add Israel (males) or Sarah (females) to their names, and a large J was to be imprinted on their passports beginning October 5. On November 15 Jewish children were banned from going to normal schools. By April 1939, nearly all Jewish companies had either collapsed under financial pressure and declining profits, or had been forced to sell out to the Nazi German government. This further reduced Jews' rights as human beings. They were in many ways officially separated from the German populace. Synagogue at Nuremberg, c. 1890‚Äì1900. The structure was destroyed in 1938. The increasingly totalitarian, militaristic regime which was being imposed on Germany by Hitler allowed him to control the actions of the SS and the military. On November 7, 1938, a young Polish Jew, Herschel Grynszpan, attacked and shot two German officials in the Nazi German embassy in Paris. (Grynszpan was angry about the treatment of his parents by the Nazi Germans.) On November 9 the German Attache, Ernst vom Rath, died. Goebbels issued instructions that demonstrations against Jews were to be organized and undertaken in retaliation throughout Germany. The SS ordered the Night of Broken Glass (Kristallnacht) to be carried out that night, November 9‚Äì10, 1938. The storefronts of Jewish shops and offices were smashed and vandalized, and many synagogues were destroyed by fire. Approximately 91 Jews were killed, and another 30,000 arrested, mostly able bodied males, all of whom were sent to the newly formed concentration camps. In the following 3 months some 2,000‚Äì2,500 of them died in the concentration camps, the rest were released under the condition that they leave Germany. Many Germans were disgusted by this action when the full extent of the damage was discovered, so Hitler ordered that it be blamed on the Jews. Collectively, the Jews were made to pay back one billion Reichsmark (equivalent to billion euros) in damages, the fine being raised by confiscating 20 per cent of every Jewish property. The Jews also had to repair all damages at their own cost. Jews emigrating from Berlin to the United States, 1939 Increasing antisemitism prompted a wave of Jewish mass emigration from Germany throughout the 1930s. Among the first wave were intellectuals, politically active individuals, and Zionists. However, as Nazi legislation worsened the Jews' situation, more Jews wished to leave Germany, with a panicked rush in the months after Kristallnacht in 1938. Palestine was a popular destination for German Jewish emigration. Soon after the Nazis' rise to power in 1933, they negotiated the Haavara Agreement with Zionist authorities in Palestine, which was signed on August 25, 1933. Under its terms, 60,000 German Jews were to be allowed to emigrate to Palestine and take $100 million in assets with them. During the Fifth Aliyah, between 1929 and 1939, a total of 250,000 Jewish immigrants arrived in Palestine‚Äîmore than 55,000 of them from Germany, Austria, or Bohemia. Many of them were doctors, lawyers, engineers, architects, and other professionals, who contributed greatly to the development of the Yishuv. The United States was another destination for German Jews seeking to leave the country, though the number allowed to immigrate was restricted due to the Immigration Act of 1924. Between 1933 and 1939, more than 300,000 Germans, of whom about 90% were Jews, applied for immigration visas to the United States. By 1940, only 90,000 German Jews had been granted visas and allowed to settle in the United States. Some 100,000 German Jews also moved to Western European countries, especially France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. However, these countries would later be occupied by Germany, and most of them would still fall victim to the Holocaust. Another 48,000 emigrated to the United Kingdom and other European countries.  The Holocaust in Germany  Jews are deported from W√ºrzburg to the Lublin District of Poland, 25 April 1942 Overall, of the 522,000 Jews living in Germany in January 1933, approximately 304,000 emigrated during the first six years of Nazi rule and about 214,000 were left on the eve of World War II. Of these, 160,000-180,000 were killed as a part of the Holocaust. On May 19, 1943, only about 20,000 Jews remained and Germany was declared judenrein (clean of Jews; also judenfrei: free of Jews).  Persistence of antisemitism  During the medieval period antisemitism flourished in Germany. Especially during the time of the Black Death from 1348 to 1350 hatred and violence against Jews increased. Approximately 72% of towns with a Jewish settlement suffered from violent attacks against the Jewish population. After World War I, antisemitism grew again, during the time of the Weimar Republic and later on during the Nazi reign. Regions that suffered from the Black Death pogroms were 6 times more likely to engage in antisemitic violence during the 1920s, racist and fascist parties like the DNVP, NSDAP and DVFP gained a 1.5 times higher voting share in the 1928 election, their inhabitants wrote more letters to antisemitic newspapers like ‚ÄúDer St√ºrmer‚Äù, and they deported more Jews during the Nazi reign. This is due to cultural transmission. A simple model of cultural transmission and Persistence of attitudes comes from Bisin and Verdier who state, that children acquire their preference scheme through imitating their parents, who in turn attempt to socialize their children to their own preferences, without taking into consideration if these traits are useful or not. Economic factors had the potential to undermine this persistence throughout the centuries. Hatred against outsiders was more costly in trade open cities, like the members of the Hanseatic League. Faster growing cities saw less persistence in antisemitic attitudes, this may be due to the fact that trade-openness was associated with more economic success and therefore higher migration rates into these regions.  Jews in Germany from 1945 to the reunification  When the Soviet army took over Berlin in late April 1945, only 8,000 Jews remained in the city, all of them either in hiding or married to non-Jews. Most German Jews who survived the war in exile decided to remain abroad; however, a small number returned to Germany. Additionally, approximately 15,000 German Jews survived the concentration camps or survived by going into hiding. These German Jews were joined by approximately 200,000 displaced persons (DPs), Eastern European Jewish Holocaust survivors. They came to Allied-occupied western Germany after finding no homes left for them in eastern Europe or after having been liberated on German soil. The overwhelming majority of the DPs wished to emigrate to Palestine and lived in Allied- and U.N.-administered refugee camps, remaining isolated from German society. When Israel became independent in 1948, most European-Jewish DPs left for the new state; however, 10,000 to 15,000 Jews decided to resettle in Germany. Despite hesitations and a long history of antagonism between German Jews (Yekkes) and East European Jews (Ostjuden), the two disparate groups united to form the basis of a new Jewish community. In 1950 they founded their unitary representative organization, the Central Council of Jews in Germany. = Jews of West Germany = The Jewish community in West Germany from the 1950s to the 1970s was characterized by its social conservatism and generally private nature. Although there were Jewish elementary schools in West Berlin, Frankfurt, and Munich, the community had a very high average age. Few young adults chose to remain in Germany, and many of those who did married non-Jews. Many critics of the community and its leadership accused it of ossification. In the 1980s, a college for Jewish studies was established in Heidelberg; however, a disproportionate number of its students were not Jewish. By 1990, the community numbered between 30,000 and 40,000. Although the Jewish community of Germany did not have the same impact as the pre-1933 community, some Jews were prominent in German public life, including Hamburg mayor Herbert Weichmann; Schleswig-Holstein Minister of Justice (and Deputy Chief Justice of the Federal Constitutional Court) Rudolf Katz; Hesse Attorney General Fritz Bauer; former Hesse Minister of Economics Heinz-Herbert Karry; West Berlin politician Jeanette Wolff; television personalities Hugo Egon Balder, Hans Rosenthal, Ilja Richter, Inge Meysel, and Michel Friedman; Jewish communal leaders Heinz Galinski, Ignatz Bubis, Paul Spiegel, and Charlotte Knobloch (see: Central Council of Jews in Germany), and Germany's most influential literary critic, Marcel Reich-Ranicki. = Jews of East Germany = The Jewish community of communist East Germany numbered only a few hundred active members. Most Jews who settled in East Germany did so either because their pre-1933 homes had been there or because they had been politically leftist before the Nazi seizure of power and, after 1945, wished to build an antifascist, socialist Germany. Most such politically engaged Jews were not religious or active in the official Jewish community. They included writers such as Anna Seghers, Stefan Heym, Stephan Hermlin, Jurek Becker, Stasi Colonel General Markus Wolf, singer Lin Jaldati, composer Hanns Eisler, and politician Gregor Gysi. Many East German Jews emigrated to Israel in the 1970s.  Jews in the reunited Germany (post-1990)  The end of the Cold War contributed to a growth of the Jewish community of Germany. An important step for the renaissance of Jewish life in Germany occurred in 1990 when Helmut Kohl convened with Heinz Galinski, to allow Jewish people from the former Soviet Union to emigrate to Germany, which led to a large Jewish emigration.Einwanderer So leise wie m√∂glich Spiegel 27 May 1996 Germany is home to a nominal Jewish population of more than 200,000 (although this number reflects non-Jewish spouses or children who also immigrated under the Quota Refugee Law); 104,024 are officially registered with Jewish religious communities. The size of the Jewish community in Berlin is estimated at 120,000 people, or 60% of Germany's total Jewish population. Today, between 80 and 90 percent of the Jews in Germany are Russian speaking immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Many Israelis also move to Germany, particularly Berlin, for its relaxed atmosphere and low cost of living. Olim L'Berlin, a Facebook snowclone asking Israelis to emigrate to Berlin, gained notoriety in 2014.An Israeli in Berlin: The chocolate pudding exodus, Spiegel 2014 Some eventually return to Israel after a period of residence in Germany. There are also a handful of Jewish families from Muslim countries, including Iran, Turkey, Morocco, and Afghanistan. Germany has the third-largest Jewish population in Western Europe after France (600,000) and Britain (300,000)Die Welt: \\"Oberrabbiner tagen erstmals in Berlin.\\" November 17, 2004 and the fastest- growing Jewish population in Europe in recent years. The influx of immigrants, many of them seeking renewed contact with their Ashkenazi heritage, has led to a renaissance of Jewish life in Germany. In 1996, Chabad-Lubavitch of Berlin opened a center. In 2003, Chabad-Lubavitch of Berlin ordained 10 rabbis, the first rabbis to be ordained in Germany since World War II. In 2002 a Reform rabbinical seminary, Abraham Geiger College, was established in Potsdam. In 2006, the college announced that it would be ordaining three new rabbis, the first Reform rabbis to be ordained in Germany since 1942. Partly owing to the deep similarities between Yiddish and German, Jewish studies have become a popular academic study, and many German universities have departments or institutes of Jewish studies, culture, or history. Active Jewish religious communities have sprung up across Germany, including in many cities where the previous communities were no longer extant or were moribund. Several cities in Germany have Jewish day schools, kosher facilities, and other Jewish institutions beyond synagogues. Additionally, many of the Russian Jews were alienated from their Jewish heritage and unfamiliar or uncomfortable with religion. American-style Reform Judaism (which originated in Germany), has re- emerged in Germany, led by the Union of Progressive Jews in Germany, even though the Central Council of Jews in Germany and most local Jewish communities officially adhere to Orthodoxy. Public menorah in Karlsruhe On January 27, 2003, then German Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der signed the first- ever agreement on a federal level with the Central Council, so that Judaism was granted the same elevated, semi-established legal status in Germany as the Roman Catholic Church and the Evangelical Church in Germany, at least since the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany of 1949. The Central Council of Jews in Germany is the nationally sanctioned organization to manage the German-Jewish community. In Germany it is a criminal act to deny the Holocaust or that six million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust (¬ß 130 StGB); violations can be punished with up to five years of prison. In 2007, the Interior Minister of Germany, Wolfgang Sch√§uble, pointed out the official policy of Germany: \\"We will not tolerate any form of extremism, xenophobia or antisemitism.\\" Although the number of right-wing groups and organisations grew from 141 (2001)Bundesamt f√ºr Verfassungsschutz.

October 22, 2006 Despite these facts, Israeli Ambassador Shimon Stein warned in October 2006 that Jews in Germany feel increasingly unsafe, stating that they \\"are not able to live a normal Jewish life\\" and that heavy security surrounds most synagogues or Jewish community centers. Yosef Havlin, Rabbi at the Chabad Lubavitch in Frankfurt, does not agree with the Israeli Ambassador and states in an interview with Der Spiegel in September 2007 that the German public does not support far-right groups; instead, he has personally experienced the support of Germans, and as a Jew and rabbi he \\"feels welcome in his (hometown) Frankfurt, he is not afraid, the city is not a no-go- area\\".Der Spiegel: \\"Wir d√ºrfen uns auf keinen Fall verstecken\\". September 12, 2007 A flagship moment for the burgeoning Jewish community in modern Germany occurred on November 9, 2006 (the 68th anniversary of Kristallnacht), when the newly constructed Ohel Jakob synagogue was dedicated in Munich, Germany.New Munich Synagogue Opens on Nazi Persecution Anniversary, Deutsche Welle, November 9, 2006. This is particularly crucial given the fact that Munich was once at the ideological heart of Nazi Germany. Jewish life in the capital Berlin is prospering, the Jewish community is growing, the Centrum Judaicum and several synagogues‚Äîincluding the largest in Germany‚Äîhave been renovated and opened, and Berlin's annual week of Jewish culture and the Jewish Cultural Festival in Berlin, held for the 21st time, featuring concerts, exhibitions, public readings and discussionsDie Bundesregierung (Federal government of Germany): \\"Germany's largest synagogue officially reopened. \\" August 31, 2007Axelrod, Toby. \\"Cantor who led Berlin's Jews for past 50 years dies.\\" j.. January 21, 2000 can only partially explain why Rabbi Yitzhak Ehrenberg of the orthodox Jewish community in Berlin states: \\"Orthodox Jewish life is alive in Berlin again. [...] Germany is the only European country with a growing Jewish community.\\" In spite of Germany's measures against right-wing groups and antisemites, a number of incidents have occurred in recent years. On August 29, 2012 in Berlin, a rabbi in visible Jewish garb was physically attacked by a group of Arabic youths, causing a head wound that required hospitalization. The rabbi was walking with his six-year-old daughter in downtown Berlin when the group asked if he was a Jew, and then proceeded to assault him. They also threatened to kill the rabbi's young daughter. On November 9, 2012, the 74th Kristallnacht anniversary, neo-Nazis in Greifswald vandalized the city's Holocaust memorial.

He became an instructor at Frunze Military Academy in 1938. In 1941, Antonov became Chief of Staff for the Soviet Southwestern Front and Southern Front. In December 1942 he became Deputy Chief General Staff of the combined Soviet forces and Head of the Operations Directorate, a pivotal role within the Stavka.R. Overy, Why the Allies Won (2006) p. 332 In fact, A. I. Antonov was effective leader of the Soviet General Staff since Chief of Staff A. M. Vasilevsky was usually absent due to his frequent frontline missions as Stavka representative. As a result, Stavka relieved Antonov of his position in Operational Directorate, so that Antonov could fully concentrate in the leadership in the General Staff. In February 1945, Vasilevsky was appointed as the commander of 3rd Belarusian Front, and Antonov finally became the formal leader of Soviet General Staff.S. M. Shtemenko, Volume 1, p. 220, 225 In spite of his key role in the Red Army's ultimate victory, he was never named a Marshal of the Soviet Union. Richard Overy writes of him at this time: > Vasilevsky came to rely on one subordinate above all others: the chief of > operations, General Aleksei Antonov. [...] On December 11 [1942] the forty- > six-year-old Antonov stepped into the role which was more directly exposed > to Stalin's inquisitive leadership than any other.

The bandora or bandore is a large long-necked plucked string-instrument that can be regarded as a bass cittern though it does not have the re-entrant tuning typical of the cittern. Probably first built by John Rose in England around 1560, it remained popular for over a century. A somewhat smaller version was the orpharion. The bandora is frequently one of the two bass instruments in a broken consort as associated with the works of Thomas Morley, and it is also a solo instrument in its own right. Anthony Holborne wrote many pieces for solo bandora. The multiple lute settings of Pacoloni appear both with and without optional wire-strung instruments. Construction and type The bandora, though built like a cittern, had six or seven courses (unison pairs) of strings tuned in a more lute-like fashion, but without the high d found on a bass lute. In fact, the barring is very close to an orpharion, and closer to contemporary lute than to cittern or guitar construction. This creates a proportion closer to present guitar tunings; typically C D G C E A, and occasionally a seventh low G string. Thomas Morley calls for a \\"Pandora\\" in his Consort Lessons. The term bandore and bandora were occasionally incorrectly applied to a Ukrainian folk instrument now more commonly known as the bandura, an instrument with up to 68 strings that differs considerably from the bandora. During the Renaissance there were no naming conventions and terms were used loosely. The Spanish bandurria, though this term was once also interchangeable, now applies to a treble instrument like a mandolin - a similar confusion as has occurred with mandore, mandora, mandola (q.v.). All these instruments are thought to derive their names originally from the ancient Greek pandura (which term, once again, is found applied to a variety of stringed instruments in different regions at an early date).F.

It provides information and research on agriculture and economics. History The first USDA agency formally tasked with data collection was the Division of Statistics, created in 1863, one year after the USDA itself was created.Panel to Study the Research Program of the Economic Research Service, Sowing Seeds of Change: Informing Public Policy in the Economic Research Service of USDA, Committee on National Statistics, Commission on Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, National Research Council (John F. Gewek et al., eds. 1999). By 1902, a Division of Foreign Markets had been created, and the following year, that division was merged with the Division of Statistics to form the Bureau of Statistics. In 1914, the bureau was renamed the Bureau of Crop Estimates, and in 1921 this bureau merged with the Bureau of Markets to form the Bureau of Markets and Crop Estimates. This merger brought together \\"responsibility for the collection of farm-level crop and livestock data with that for major domestic and foreign commodity market transactions\\" in a single agency. While the USDA's data collection activities were developing, the department was also developing expertise in agricultural economics research. In 1903, the Office of Farm Management was formed within the Bureau of Plant Industry. In 1915, this office was transferred to the Office of the Secretary to provide analytic support during World War I. In 1919, the office was renamed in Office of Farm Management and Farm Economics. In 1920, the office became a separate USDA agency. In 1922, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAE), the ERS's immediate predecessor, was established by the merger of the Office of Farm Management and Farm Economics and the Bureau of Markets and Crop Estimates, bringing together responsibility for data collection and economic research/analysis in a single agency. This new agency brought together for the first time in data collection and economic analysis and research. The first leader of the BAE was the pioneering agricultural economist Henry Charles Taylor, appointed by Secretary of Agriculture Henry C. Wallace.Milestones in ERS History: Henry C. Taylor , Economic Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture. In its initial years the BAE recruited agricultural economists from the handful of land-grant universities that offered the Ph.D in agriculture, such as Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Cornell. The ERS was established by Secretary of Agriculture Memorandum 1446, supp. 1, of April 3, 1961.United States Government Manual 2012, Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, p. 555. It was subsequently consolidated with other USDA units (including the Economic Development Service, established in 1969, and the Economic Management Support Center, established 1974) into the Economics, Statistics, and Cooperatives Service by Secretary's Memorandum 1927, effective December 23, 1977. The agency was redesignated as the Economic Research Service by secretarial order of October 1, 1981. Under the Trump administration, the ERS and another USDA agency, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture were directed to move from the USDA's headquarters in Washington, D.C. to the Kansas City metropolitan area. Two-thirds of the USDA employees reassigned chose to quit rather than accept relocation.Emily Moon, 'Cut, Relocate, Eviscerate': Moving a USDA Research Agency Will Have Lasting Consequences, Employees Say, Pacific Standard (July 18, 2019).Ben Guarino, Many USDA workers to quit as research agencies move to Kansas City: 'The brain drain we all feared', Washington Post (July 18, 2019). In 2018, the office of Trump's Agriculture Secretary, Sonny Perdue, also issued a directive to ERS and other research components of USDA, ordering them to include a disclaimer on peer-reviewed research in scientific journals stating that findings and conclusions were \\"preliminary\\" and \\"should not be construed to represent any agency determination or policy.\\"Ben Guarino, USDA orders scientists to say published research is 'preliminary', Washington Post (April 19, 2019).Ryan McCrimmon, Economists flee Agriculture Dept. after feeling punished under Trump, Politico (May 7, 2019). Susan Offutt, the ERS administrator under the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, said that the requirement was contrary to the USDA's longstanding policy that permitted and encouraged federal scientists from publishing work in journals, and the \\"disclaimer\\" mandate was strongly criticized by USDA employees, science advocates, and scientific journal editors.Ben Guarino, After outcry, USDA will no longer require scientists to label research 'preliminary', Washington Post (May 10, 2019). In May 2019, following an outcry, the USDA rescinded the directive. Current and former employees of the ERS were strongly critical of the relocation to Kansas City and other Trump administration policies, and the exodus of scientific and economic talent and disruption to federal research (especially on climate change and food security) that they had caused.Liz Crampton, ERS union predicts mass exodus ahead of relocation, Politico (June 25, 2019). The move to Kansas City area resulted in an attrition rate particularly high in the Resource and Rural Economics Division (90%) and in the Food Economics Division (up to 89%). ERS economists said that the Trump administration's moves were retaliation against the agency for publishing research reports detailing the negative economic effects of Trump's policies, including tariffs and Republican tax legislation, on U.S. agriculture. Functions Today, ERS's mission is to provide \\"economic research and information to inform public and private decision making on economic and policy issues related to agriculture, food, natural resources, and rural America.\\"Economic Research Service (ERS) Overview, United States Department of Agriculture. The ERS and National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) jointly fund and manage the Agricultural Resource Management Survey, a multi- phase, nationally representative survey of U.S. farms that is the USDA's \\"primary source of information on the financial condition, production practices, and resource use of America's farm businesses and the economic well-being of America's farm households.\\"Overview: ARMS Farm Financial and Crop Production Practices, Economic Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture. The ERS publishes the magazine Amber Waves five times a year.Peggy Garvin, The United States Government Internet Directory 2010 (Bernan Press, 2011), p. 9. The publication began in February 2003; it replaced Agricultural Outlook, FoodReview, and Rural America. The publication \\"features information and economic analysis about food, farms, natural resources, and rural community issues\\" and includes data and charts on various economic indications, including livestock cash receipts, farm household income, agricultural imports and exports, and food spending.

National Research Council. that (along with NASS) reported to the Under Secretary for Research, Education, and Economics. However, in 2019, the Trump administration, under Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, moved to place ERS under the direct oversight of a political appointee, reporting to the chief economist under the Office of the Secretary.Perdue's plan to put ERS under chief economist, move ERS, NIFA out of Washington area doesn't escape criticism, Hagstrom Report (August 10, 2018). This restructuring prompted criticism that the ERS's historically independent and autonomous data-collection mission would be compromised by political interference. The ERS is organized into the Office of the Administrator and four divisions: The Food Economics Division; the Information Services Division; the Market and Trade Economics Division; and the Resource and Rural Economics Division.Management Directory, Economic Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture. Each division is led by a director. ERS had about 510 employees in 1998, 430 employees in 2009, and 250 employees in 2019.Nicole Ogrysko, Faced with possible relocation, USDA's ERS employees vote to unionize, Federal News Network (May 9, 2019).

They evolved during the Late Jurassic but were not very common until the Cretaceous period, when they rapidly diversified and became one of the most distinctive components of Cretaceous marine faunas. They have been recorded from every continent and many are used as zonal or index fossils. The most distinctive feature of the majority of the Ancyloceratina is the tendency for most of them to have shells that are not regular spirals like most other ammonites. These irregularly-coiled ammonites are called heteromorph ammonites, in contrast to regularly coiled ammonites, which are called homomorph ammonites. Biology The biology of the heteromorph ammonites is not clear, but one certainty is that their uncoiled shells would have made these forms very poor swimmers. Open shells, particularly ones with spines and ribs, create a lot of drag; but more importantly, the orientation of the shell, with the body hanging below the buoyant part of the shell, would have created a serious impediment to efficient swimming. It's more likely these ammonites either drifted in the plankton, collecting small animals on long tentacles like modern jellyfish, or else they crawled along the sea floor feeding on sessile or slow-moving animals such as clams. Morphology Assemblage of Barremian heteromorph ammonites from southeastern France Ancyloceratida varied widely in size, ranging from diminutive Ptychoceras, which was barely long, to Baculites and Diplomoceras, which could grow to in length. Some species were very widely distributed, for example some species of Hamites can be found in Eurasia, South America, Australia, and Antarctica. Others, like those inhabiting the Western Interior Seaway that covered much of the US, were much more localized. In the more primitive forms, the shell departs only slightly from being a perfect spiral, with only the last, outermost whorl being open, forming a hook underneath the main spiral. In such forms the spiral was the chambered, buoyant part of the shell, and the hook was the living chamber in which the soft body of the ammonite resided. Examples of such types were Ancyloceras, Protanisoceras, and Tropaeum. The more advanced heteromorphs departed from such forms radically. The shells of Ptychoceras consisted of three or four shafts squashed together and connected with tight, 180 degree bends. Members of the genus Hamites were much larger but had a similar sort of shape, though the shafts were open so that the whole thing looked rather like a big paper clip. Many of the earlier heteromorph forms had regularly coiled shells barely distinguishable from the homomorph ammonites (for example, the Lower Cretaceous genus Deshayesites). Some offshoots of the uncoiled varieties even went back to being regularly coiled. Most notable among these were the Scaphites, Hoploscaphites and their relatives, which were mostly regular spirals in shape except for a very slight hook at the end. The Late Cretaceous enjoyed the widest variety of heteromorphs, including the straight-shelled Baculites and Sciponoceras; the helically coiled Turrilites; and the bizarre Nipponites, which looked more like a ball of string than anything else. Some forms combined different coiling modes. For example, Nostoceras started off with a helix like a Turrilites, but had a planar hook hanging underneath, more like an Ancyloceras. The thin shelled heteromorphic ammonites probably lived at depths . Classification Crioceratites nolani with spines partially restored Nipponites mirabilis Scaphites sp.

He later served as the third Chancellor of Auckland University of Technology, from 2005 until his death. Early life and education Reeves was born in Wellington, New Zealand, on 6 December 1932, the son of D'arcy Reeves by his marriage to Hilda Pirihira, who had moved from Waikawa to Newtown, a working-class suburb of Wellington. Hilda was of MƒÅori descent, of the Te ƒÄti Awa iwi; D'arcy was PƒÅkehƒÅ and worked for the tramways. Reeves was educated at Wellington College and at Victoria College, University of New Zealand (now the Victoria University of Wellington), where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1955 and a Master of Arts in 1956. He went on to study for ordination as an Anglican priest at St John's College, Auckland, receiving his Licentiate in Theology in 1958. Ministry as deacon and priest Reeves was ordained deacon in 1958. After serving a brief curacy at Tokoroa, he spent the period 1959‚Äì64 in England. From 1959 until 1961 he was an Advanced Student at St Peter's College, Oxford (Bachelor of Arts 1961, Master of Arts 1965) as well as Assistant Curate at the University Church of St Mary the Virgin. He was ordained priest in 1960. He served two further curacies in England, first at Kirkley St Peter (1961‚Äì63), then at Lewisham St Mary (1963‚Äì64). Returning to New Zealand, Reeves was Vicar of Okato St Paul (1964‚Äì66), Lecturer in Church History at St John's College, Auckland (1966‚Äì69), and Director of Christian Education for the Anglican Diocese of Auckland (1969‚Äì71). Ministry as bishop, archbishop, and primate In 1971 Reeves was appointed Bishop of Waiapu and consecrated to the episcopate on 25 March.ACANZP Lectionary, 2009 (p. 96) He was Bishop of Auckland from 1979 to 1985, and additionally as Archbishop and Primate of New Zealand, the leader of New Zealand's Anglicans, from 1980 to 1985. During this time Reeves also served as chairman of the Environmental Council (1974‚Äì76), and he served as president of the National Council of Churches in New Zealand (1984‚Äì85). Reeves was a supporter of Citizens for Rowling (the campaign for the re-election of Labour Prime Minister Bill Rowling). Governor-general Sir Ron Brierley at an investiture ceremony =Appointment= On the advice of Prime Minister David Lange, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Reeves the 15th Governor-General of New Zealand effective from 20 November 1985. His appointment was met with some scepticism due to his previous political involvement in Citizens for Rowling, opposing the 1981 Springbok Tour, and the fact that he was an Anglican bishop. The Leader of the Opposition, Jim McLay opposed the appointment on these grounds, stating \\"How can an ordained priest fulfil that [constitutional] role?\\" However, many MƒÅori groups welcomed the appointment, with Sir James Henare arguing that \\"It must be a fruit of the Treaty of Waitangi to see a person from our people.\\" He was the first (and up to the present the only) cleric to hold the post. Moreover, as a member of the Puketapu hap≈´ of the Te ƒÄti Awa of Taranaki, he was the first governor-general to be of MƒÅori descent. =Tenure= Reeves welcomes Pope John Paul II to New Zealand. Government House, 23 November 1986 As a clergyman, Reeves opted not to wear the military uniform of the governor-general. During his term, Reeves joined the Newtown Residents' Association, and invited members of that association to visit Government House, Wellington. He hosted the first open day at Government House on 7 October 1990, and employed the first public affairs officer, Cindy Beavis, to promote the governor-general's role. Reeves remained in office until 20 November 1990. He was succeeded by Dame Catherine Tizard. =Controversies= During Reeves' tenure, the Fourth Labour Government made radical changes to the New Zealand economy, later known as Rogernomics. In November 1987 Reeves made comments critical of Rogernomics, stating that the reforms were creating \\"an increasingly stratified society\\". He was rebuked for these comments by Lange, but later stated in May 1988 \\"...the spirit of the market steals life from the vulnerable but the spirit of God gives life to all\\". Reeves later recalled that this marked a \\"parting of ways\\" with the government. Reeves also recalled \\"I had a little sense of being left alone and felt that I needed to be taken into the loop more, or be taken seriously.\\" Reeves wrote to the Queen, but did not receive replies directly from the Queen. He said, \\"I used to write to the Queen and express my opinion about this and that going on it the country and I wouldn't get a direct reply from her but I would always get a lengthy reply from her private secretary, which I took was expressing her viewpoint.\\" On a state visit to Vanuatu in 1989, Reeves was invited to kill a pig at a ceremony, creating controversy as he was patron of the Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Retirement After his retirement from the viceregal office, Reeves became the Anglican Consultative Council Observer at the United Nations in New York (1991‚Äì93) and Assistant Bishop of New York (1991‚Äì94). From 1994 until 1995 he served briefly as Dean of Te Whare WƒÅnanga o Te Rau Kahikatea (the theological college of Te Pihopatanga o Aotearoa, and a constituent member of St John's College, Auckland). He was also Deputy Leader of the Commonwealth Observer group to South Africa, Chair of the Nelson Mandela Trust, and Visiting Montague Burton Professor of International Relations at the University of Edinburgh. Reeves went on to chair the Fiji Constitution Review Commission from 1995 until 1997, culminating in Fiji's readmission to the Commonwealth, until its suspension in 2000. On 12 December 2007 it was reported that Reeves was involved with \\"secret talks\\" to resolve Fiji's year- long political crisis, following the 2006 Fijian coup d'√©tat. In 2004 Reeves made a statement in support of New Zealand republic, stating in an interview, \\"...if renouncing knighthoods was a prerequisite to being a citizen of a republic, I think it would be worth it.\\" Reeves served as the Chancellor of the Auckland University of Technology, from February 2005 until August 2011. In July 2011, Reeves announced that he had been diagnosed with cancer, and therefore was retiring from all public responsibilities. He died from cancer on 14 August 2011, aged 78. Honours and other awards Reeves was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal (1977), he was appointed a Chaplain of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem in April 1982, Knight Bachelor in the 1985 Queen's Birthday Honours, a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George on 6 November 1985, a Knight of Justice of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem in 1986, and a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order on 2 March 1986. In 1990 he became a Companion of the Queen's Service Order. Reeves was also made a Companion of the Order of Fiji. There was some concern regarding Reeves' using the title Sir, as members of the clergy in the Church of England do not usually receive this title when knighted, and the same rule presumably applied to the Anglican Church in New Zealand. Moreover, clergy are traditionally not dubbed. To avoid placing the Queen in an awkward situation (governors-general would by tradition be knighted by her in person at Buckingham Palace), the prime minister of the time, David Lange, made Reeves a Knight Bachelor before meeting her. Consequently, when Reeves went to receive the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George from the Queen, he was already Sir Paul. On Waitangi Day 2007 Reeves was awarded New Zealand's highest honour, being admitted to the Order of New Zealand. The University of Oxford conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Civil Law in 1985 and his college, St Peter's, appointed him an Honorary Fellow in 1981 and a Trustee in 1994. A Fellowship of St John's College, Auckland followed in 1989. He has received other honorary degrees, including an LLD of Victoria University of Wellington (1989), a DD of the General Theological Seminary, New York (1992), and the degree of Doctor Honoris Causa of the University of Edinburgh (1994). Changes to the rules in 2006 allowed him to use the style The Honourable for life.

The boat was laid down as Motor Boat Submarine Chaser PTC-21, but was reclassified as PT-41 prior to its launch on 8 July 1941, and was completed on 23 July 1941. It was used to evacuate General Douglas MacArthur from Corregidor at the beginning of the war in the Pacific in World War II. Ship history PT-41 served as the flagship of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three, which was based in the Philippines from late 1941 to April 1942. The commander of PT-41 was Lieutenant John D. Bulkeley, who became one of the U.S. Navy's most highly decorated officers. PT-41 evacuated General (later General of the Army) Douglas MacArthur, Mrs. Jean MacArthur, Arthur MacArthur IV (General MacArthur's son), Ah Cheu (Arthur's Chinese nurse), Major General Richard K.

After MacArthur's party left Mindanao, PT-41, along with the two remaining PT boats of the squadron (PT-34 and PT-35), established a new base of operations at Cagayan de Oro, Mindanao, supporting the American military forces defending Mindanao and the nearby islands from the invading Japanese throughout late March and early April 1942. After a torpedo attack in concert with on the on April 9, 1942, PT-41 became the last remaining PT boat of the squadron (PT-34 was sunk in the aftermath of the attack and PT-35 was burned at Cebu). With no more torpedoes available for PT-41 to use, it was commandeered by the United States Army to patrol Lake Lanao, Mindanao. It was destroyed by the Army on April 15, 1942, to prevent its capture while being transported via road to Lake Lanao.

Upon the abdication of King Farouk following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, he served as Regent for King Ahmed Fuad II until the declaration of the Republic of Egypt and abolition of the Egyptian and Sudanese monarchy in 1953. Early life Prince Muhammad Abdul Moneim was born at the Montaza Palace, near Alexandria. His father Abbas II was the reigning Khedive and so Muhammad Abdul Moneim became heir apparent upon his birth and was given the title of Hereditary Prince. He was educated at Fribourg, Switzerland. Following the Ottoman Empire's entry into World War I, Muhammad Abdul Moneim's father Abbas II was deposed by Britain on 18 December 1914 for supporting the Ottomans in the War. His father was replaced on the throne by his uncle Hussein Kamel, bypassing Muhammad Abdul Moneim who was now demoted in the line of succession. He was created His Highness in 1922. He served as President of the Egyptian Olympic Committee from 1934 until 1938. In 1939 he was appointed President of the Arab delegation to the Palestine Conference in London in 1939. Regency Following the abdication of King Farouk, Muhammad Abdul Moneim served as Chairman of the Council of Egyptian Regency from 26 July 1952 to 18 June 1953 for the infant King Fuad II, being created His Royal Highness in 1952.

The Jewish presence in Italy dates to the pre-Christian Roman period and has continued, despite periods of extreme persecution and expulsions, until the present. As of 2019, the estimated core Jewish population in Italy numbers around 45,000.As reported by the American Jewish Yearbook (2007), on a total Italian population of circa 60 million people, which therefore is approx. 0.075%. Greater concentrations are in Rome and Milan. Cf. the demographic statistics by Sergio DellaPergola, published on World Jewish Population, American Jewish Committee, 2007.URL accessed 13 March 2013. As data originate from records kept by the various Italian Jewish congregations (which means they register \\"observant\\" Jews who have somehow had to go through basic rituals such as the Brit Milah or Bar/Bat Mitzvah etc.). Excluded are therefore \\"ethnic Jews\\", lay Jews, atheist/agnostic Jews, et al. ‚Äì cfr. \\"Who is a Jew?\\". If these are added, then the total population would increase, possibly to approx. 45,000 Jews in Italy, not counting recent migrations from North Africa and Eastern Europe.  Pre-Christian Rome  The Jewish community in Rome is likely one of the oldest continuous Jewish communities in the world, existing from classical times through to today. It is known more certainly that an embassy was sent by Simon Maccabeus to Rome in 139 BCE to strengthen the alliance with the Romans against the Hellenistic Seleucid kingdom.1 Maccabees 14: 24: \\"After this Simon sent Numenius to Rome with a large gold shield weighing a thousand minas, to confirm the alliance with the Romans.\\" The ambassadors received a cordial welcome from their coreligionists already established in Rome. Large numbers of Jews lived in Rome even during the late Roman Republican period (from around 150 BC). They were largely Greek-speaking and poor. As Rome had increasing contact with and military/trade dealings with the Greek-speaking Levant, during the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE, many Greeks, as well as Jews, came to Rome as merchants or were brought there as slaves.Philo of Alexandria, with Charles Duke Yonge, trans., The works of Philo Judaeus, the contemporary of Josephus (London, England: Henry G. Bohn, 1855), vol. 4, \\"A treatise on the virtues and on the office of ambassadors. Addressed to Caius.\\", p. 134. From p. 134: \\"How then did he [i.e., the emperor Caligula] look upon the great division of Rome which is on the other side of the river Tiber, which he was well aware was occupied and inhabited by the Jews? And they were mostly Roman citizens, having been emancipated; for, having been brought as captives into Italy, they were manumitted by those who had bought them for slaves, without ever having been compelled to alter any of their heredity or national observances.\\" The Romans appear to have viewed the Jews as followers of peculiar, backward religious customs, but antisemitism as it would come to be in the Christian and Islamic worlds did not exist (see Anti-Judaism in the pre-Christian Roman Empire).However, the Roman author Valerius Maximus in Book 1, Chapter 3, ¬ß 3 of his book Factorum ac dictorum memorabilium libri IX (Nine books of memorable deeds and sayings), states that during the consulship of Marcus Popillius Laenas and Gnaeus Calpurnius (ca. 139 B.C.), the praetor Gnaeus Cornelius Hispanus expelled the Jews from Rome because they had tried to spread their religion among the Romans. See: * Valerius Maximus, with Carl Halm, ed., Factorum et dictorum memorabilium libri novem (Leipzig, (Germany): Teubner, 1865), p. 17. (in Latin) * Valerius Maximus with Henry John Walker, trans., Memorable Deeds and Sayings: One Thousand Tales from Ancient Rome (Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S.: Hackett Publishing Co., 2004), p. 14. Despite their disdain, the Romans did recognize and respect the antiquity of the Jews' religion and the fame of their Temple in Jerusalem (Herod's Temple). Many Romans did not know much about Judaism, including the emperor Augustus who, according to his biographer Suetonius, thought that Jews fasted on the sabbath. Julius Caesar was known as a great friend to the Jews, and they were among the first to mourn his assassination.https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0011_0_10485.html; Suetonius, Divus Iulius, 84 (http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#34) In Rome, the community was highly organized, and presided over by heads called Œ¨œÅœáŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ (archontes) or Œ≥ŒµœÅŒøœÖœÉŒπŒ¨œÅœáŒøŒπ (gerousiarchoi). The Jews maintained in Rome several synagogues, whose spiritual leader was called Œ±œÅœáŒπœÉœÖŒΩŒ¨Œ≥œâŒ≥ŒøœÇ (archisunagogos). Their tombstones, mostly in Greek with a few in Hebrew/Aramaic or Latin, were decorated with the ritual menorah (seven- branched candelabrum). Jews in pre-Christian Rome were very active in proselytising Romans in their faith, leading to an increasing number of outright converts, as well as those who adopted some Jewish practices and belief in the Jewish God without actually converting (called God-fearers). The fate of Jews in Rome and Italy fluctuated, with partial expulsions being carried out under the emperors Tiberius and Claudius.The expulsion of the Jews from Rome by the emperor Tiberius is mentioned in: * Josephus Flavius, with William Whiston, trans., The Genuine Works of Flavius Josephus (New York, New York: Robinson, Pratt & Co., 1841), vol. 4, The Antiquities of the Jews: Book 18, Chapter 3, ¬ß 5, p. 68. From p. 68: \\"There was a man who was a Jew, but had been driven away from his own country by an accusation laid against him for transgressing their laws, and by the fear he was under of punishment for the same; but in all respects a wicked man. He, then living at Rome, professed to instruct men in the wisdom of the laws of Moses. He procured also three other men, entirely of the same character with himself, to be his partners. These men persuaded Fulvia, a woman of great dignity, and one that had embraced the Jewish religion, to send purple and gold to the temple at Jerusalem; and when they had gotten them, they employed them for their own uses, and spent the money themselves, on which account it was that they at first required it of her. Whereupon Tiberius, who had been informed of the thing by Saturninus, the husband of Fulvia, who desired inquiry might be made about it, ordered all of the Jews to be banished out of Rome; at which time the consuls listed four thousand men out of them, and sent them to the island of Sardinia; but punished a greater number of them, who were unwilling to become soldiers, on account of keeping the laws of their forefathers. Thus were the Jews banished out of the city by the wickedness of four men.\\" * Cornelius Tacitus, The Annals (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.: David McKay, 1897), Book 2, ¬ß 85, pp. 122‚Äì123. From pp. 122‚Äì123: \\"Measures were also taken for exterminating the solemnities of the Jews and the Egyptians; and a decree of the senate was passed, that four thousand descendants of franchised slaves, defiled with that superstition, and of age to carry arms, should be deported to Sardinia, to check the practice of freebootery there; and if, through the malignity of the climate, they perished, it would be small loss; that the rest should depart Italy, unless by a stated day they had renounced their profane rites.\\" * Suetonius, The Lives of the Twelve Caesars (New York, New York: The Modern Library, 1931), ¬ß 36, p. 142. From p. 142: \\"He [i.e., the emperor Tiberius] abolished foreign cults, especially the Egyptian and the Jewish rites, compelling all who were addicted to such superstitions to burn their religious vestments and all their paraphernalia. Those of the Jews who were of military age he assigned to provinces of less healthy climate, ostensibly to serve in the army. Others of the same race or of similar beliefs he banished from the city, on pain of slavery for life if they did not obey.\\" * Cassius Dio with Earnest Cary, trans., Dio's Roman History (London, England: William Heinemann Ltd., 1968), vol. 7, Book 57, Ch. 18, line 5a, p. 163. From p. 163: \\"As the Jews had flocked to Rome in great numbers and were converting many of the natives to their ways, he [i.e., the emperor Tiberius] banished most of them.\\" * The expulsion of the Jews from Rome by the emperor Claudius is mentioned in: * Acts 18:1‚Äì3: \\"After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.

From p. 227: \\"Since the Jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, he [i.e., the emperor Claudius] expelled them from Rome.\\" * However, Cassius Dio states that Claudius did not expel all of the Jews from Rome.

From p. 383: \\"As for the Jews, who had again increased so greatly that by reason of their multitude it would have been hard without raising a tumult to bar them from the city, he did not drive them out, but ordered them, while continuing their traditional mode of life, not to hold meetings.\\" * See also Wikipedia's article: Claudius' expulsion of Jews from Rome. After the successive Jewish revolts of 66 and 132 CE, many Judean Jews were brought to Rome as slaves (the norm in the ancient world was for prisoners of war and inhabitants of defeated cities to be sold as slaves). These revolts caused increasing official hostility from the reign of Vespasian onwards. The most serious measure was the Fiscus Judaicus, which was a tax payable by all Jews in the Roman Empire. The new tax replaced the tithe that had formerly been sent to the Temple in Jerusalem (destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE), and was used instead in the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus in Rome. In addition to Rome, there were a significant number of Jewish communities in southern Italy during this period. For example, the regions of Sicily, Calabria, and Apulia had well established Jewish populations. Late antiquity The treasures of Jerusalem (detail from the Arch of Titus). With the promotion of Christianity as a legal religion of the Roman Empire by Constantine in 313 (the Edict of Milan), the position of Jews in Italy and throughout the empire declined rapidly and dramatically. Constantine established oppressive laws for the Jews; but these were in turn abolished by Julian the Apostate, who showed his favor toward the Jews to the extent of permitting them to resume their plan for the reconstruction of the Temple at Jerusalem. This concession was withdrawn under his successor, who, again, was a Christian; and then the oppression grew considerably. Nicene Christianity was adopted as the state church of the Roman Empire in 380, shortly before the fall of the Western Roman Empire. At the time of the foundation of the Ostrogothic rule under Theodoric (493‚Äì526), there were flourishing communities of Jews in Rome, Milan, Genoa, Palermo, Messina, Agrigentum, and in Sardinia. The Popes of the period were not seriously opposed to the Jews; and this accounts for the ardor with which the latter took up arms for the Ostrogoths as against the forces of Justinian‚Äîparticularly at Naples, where the remarkable defense of the city was maintained almost entirely by Jews. After the failure of the various attempts to make Italy a province of the Byzantine empire, the Jews had to suffer much oppression from the Exarch of Ravenna; but it was not long until the greater part of Italy came into the possession of the Lombards (568-774), under whom they lived in peace. Indeed, the Lombards passed no exceptional laws relative to the Jews. Even after the Lombards embraced Catholicism the condition of the Jews was always favorable, because the popes of that time not only did not persecute them, but guaranteed them more or less protection. Pope Gregory I treated them with much consideration. Under succeeding popes the condition of the Jews did not grow worse; and the same was the case in the several smaller states into which Italy was divided. Both popes and states were so absorbed in continual external and internal dissensions that the Jews were left in peace. In every individual state of Italy a certain amount of protection was granted to them in order to secure the advantages of their commercial enterprise. The fact that the historians of this period scarcely make mention of the Jews, suggests that their condition was tolerable. Middle Ages There were many expulsions, including an expulsion from Trani in 1380, as well as all other Jewish communities south of Rome and a brief expulsion from Bologna in 1172. A nephew of Rabbi Nathan ben Jehiel acted as administrator of the property of Pope Alexander III, who showed his amicable feelings toward the Jews at the Lateran Council of 1179, where he defeated the designs of hostile prelates who advocated anti-Jewish laws. Under Norman rule the Jews of southern Italy and of Sicily enjoyed even greater freedom; they were considered the equals of the Christians, and were permitted to follow any career; they even had jurisdiction over their own affairs. Indeed, in no country were the canonical laws against the Jews so frequently disregarded as in Italy. A later pope‚Äîeither Nicholas IV (1288‚Äì1292) or Boniface VIII (1294‚Äì1303)‚Äîhad for his physician a Jew, Isaac ben Mordecai, nicknamed Maestro Gajo. =Literary achievement= Among the early Jews of Italy who left behind them traces of their literary activity was Shabbethai Donnolo (died 982). Two centuries later (1150) there became known as poets Shabbethai ben Moses of Rome; his son Jehiel Kalonymus, once regarded as a Talmudic authority even beyond Italy; and Rabbi Jehiel of the Mansi (Anaw) family, also of Rome. Their compositions are full of thought, but their diction is rather crude. Nathan, son of the above- mentioned Rabbi Jehiel, was the author of a Talmudic lexicon (\\"'Aruk\\") which became the key to the study of the Talmud. Solomon ben Abraham ibn Parhon compiled during his residence at Salerno a Hebrew dictionary which fostered the study of Biblical exegesis among the Italian Jews. On the whole, however, Hebrew culture was not in a flourishing condition. The only liturgical author of merit was Joab ben Solomon, some of whose compositions are extant. Toward the second half of the 13th century signs appeared of a better Hebrew culture and of a more profound study of the Talmud. Isaiah di Trani the Elder (1232‚Äì1279), a high Talmudic authority, was the author of many celebrated responsa. David, his son, and Isaiah di Trani the Younger, his nephew, followed in his footsteps, as did their descendants until the end of the seventeenth century. Me√Ør ben Moses presided over an important Talmudic school in Rome, and Abraham ben Joseph over one in Pesaro. In Rome two famous physicians, Abraham and Jehiel, descendants of Nathan ben Jehiel, taught the Talmud. One of the women of this gifted family, Paola dei Mansi, also attained distinction; her Biblical and Talmudic knowledge was considerable, and she transcribed Biblical commentaries in a notably beautiful handwriting (see Jew. Encyc. i. 567, s.v. Paola Anaw). About this period the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, the last of the Hohenstaufen, employed Jews to translate from the Arabic philosophical and astronomical treatises; among these writers were Judah Kohen of Toledo, later of Tuscany, and Jacob Anatoli of Provence. This encouragement naturally led to the study of the works of Maimonides‚Äîparticularly of the \\"Moreh Nebukim\\"‚Äîthe favorite writer of Hillel of Verona (1220‚Äì1295). This last-named litterateur and philosopher practised medicine at Rome and in other Italian cities, and translated into Hebrew several medical works. The liberal spirit of the writings of Maimonides had other votaries in Italy; e.g., Shabbethai ben Solomon of Rome and Zerahiah ·∏§en of Barcelona, who migrated to Rome and contributed much to spread the knowledge of his works. The effect of this on the Italian Jews was apparent in their love of freedom of thought and their esteem for literature, as well as in their adherence to the literal rendering of the Biblical texts and their opposition to fanatical cabalists and mystic theories. Among other devotees of these theories was Immanuel ben Solomon of Rome, the celebrated friend of Dante Aligheri. The discord between the followers of Maimonides and his opponents wrought most serious damage to the interests of Judaism. The rise of poetry in Italy at the time of Dante influenced the Jews also. The rich and the powerful, partly by reason of sincere interest, partly in obedience to the spirit of the times, became patrons of Jewish writers, thus inducing the greatest activity on their part. This activity was particularly noticeable at Rome, where a new Jewish poetry arose, mainly through the works of Leo Romano, translator of the writings of Thomas Aquinas and author of exegetical works of merit; of Judah Siciliano, a writer in rimed prose; of Kalonymus ben Kalonymus, a famous satirical poet; and especially of the above-mentioned Immanuel. On the initiative of the Roman community, a Hebrew translation of Maimonides' Arabic commentary on the Mishnah was made. At this time Pope John XXII was on the point of pronouncing a ban against the Jews of Rome. The Jews instituted a day of public fasting and of prayer to appeal for divine assistance. King Robert of Sicily, who favored the Jews, sent an envoy to the pope at Avignon, who succeeded in averting this great peril. Immanuel himself described this envoy as a person of high merit and of great culture. This period of Jewish literature in Italy is indeed one of great splendor. After Immanuel there were no other Jewish writers of importance until Moses da Rieti (1388). =Worsening conditions under Innocent III= Simon of Trent blood libel. Illustration in Hartmann Schedel's Weltchronik, 1493 The position of Jews in Italy worsened considerably under Pope Innocent III (1198‚Äì1216). This pope threatened with excommunication those who placed or maintained Jews in public positions, and he insisted that every Jew holding office should be dismissed. The deepest insult was the order that every Jew must always wear, conspicuously displayed, a special yellow badge. In 1235 Pope Gregory IX published the first bull against the ritual murder accusation. Other popes followed his example, particularly Innocent IV in 1247, Gregory X in 1272, Clement VI in 1348, Gregory XI in 1371, Martin V in 1422, Nicholas V in 1447, Sixtus V in 1475, Paul III in 1540, and later Alexander VII, Clement XIII, and Clement XIV. =Antipope Benedict XIII= The Jews suffered much from the relentless persecutions of the Avignon-based antipope Benedict XIII. They hailed his successor, Martin V, with delight. The synod convoked by the Jews at Bologna, and continued at Forl√¨, sent a deputation with costly gifts to the new pope, praying him to abolish the oppressive laws promulgated by Benedict and to grant the Jews those privileges which had been accorded them under previous popes. The deputation succeeded in its mission, but the period of grace was short; for Martin's successor, Eugenius IV, at first favorably disposed toward the Jews, ultimately reenacted all the restrictive laws issued by Benedict. In Italy, however, his bull was generally disregarded. The great centers, such as Venice, Florence, Genoa, and Pisa, realized that their commercial interests were of more importance than the affairs of the spiritual leaders of the Church; and accordingly the Jews, many of whom were bankers and leading merchants, found their condition better than ever before. It thus became easy for Jewish bankers to obtain permission to establish banks and to engage in monetary transactions. Indeed, in one instance even the Bishop of Mantua, in the name of the pope, accorded permission to the Jews to lend money at interest. All the banking negotiations of Tuscany were in the hands of a Jew, Jehiel of Pisa. The influential position of this successful financier was of the greatest advantage to his coreligionists at the time of the exile from Spain. The Jews were also successful as skilled medical practitioners. William of Portaleone, physician to King Ferdinand I of Naples, and to the ducal houses of Sforza and Gonzaga, was one of the ablest of that time. He was the first of the long line of illustrious physicians in his family. Early modern period It is estimated that in 1492 Jews made up between 3% and 6% of the population of Sicily. Many Sicilian Jews first went to Calabria, which already had a Jewish community since the 4th century. In 1524 Jews were expelled from Calabria, and in 1540 from the entire Kingdom of Naples, as all these areas fell under Spanish rule and were subject to the edict of expulsion by the Spanish Inquisition. Throughout the 16th century, Jews gradually moved from the south of Italy to the north, with conditions worsening for Jews in Rome after 1556 and Venice in the 1580s. Many Jews from Venice and the surrounding area migrated to Poland and Lithuania at this time. =Refugees from Spain= When Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492, many of them found refuge in Italy, where they were given protection by King Ferdinand I of Naples. One of the refugees, Don Isaac Abravanel, even received a position at the Neapolitan court, which he retained under the succeeding king, Alfonso II. The Spanish Jews were also well received in Ferrara by Duke Ercole d'Este I and in Tuscany through the mediation of Jehiel of Pisa and his sons. But at Rome and Genoa they experienced all the vexations and torments that hunger, plague, and poverty bring with them, and they were forced to accept baptism to escape starvation. In a few cases, the refugees exceeded in number the Jews already domiciled, and thus gave the determining vote in matters of communal interest and in the direction of studies. Popes Alexander VI to Clement VII were indulgent toward Jews, having more urgent matters to occupy them. After the 1492 expulsion of Jews from Spain, some 9,000 impoverished Spanish Jews arrived at the borders of the Papal States. Alexander VI welcomed them into Rome, declaring that they were \\"permitted to lead their life, free from interference from Christians, to continue in their own rites, to gain wealth, and to enjoy many other privileges.\\" He similarly allowed the immigration of Jews expelled from Portugal in 1497 and from Provence in 1498.James Carroll, Constantine's Sword, Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 2002, pp. 363‚Äì64. The popes and many of the most influential cardinals openly violated one of the most severe enactments of the Council of Basel, namely, that prohibiting Christians from employing Jewish physicians; they even gave the latter positions at the papal court. The Jewish communities of Naples and of Rome received the greatest number of accessions; but many Jews passed on from these cities to Ancona, Venice, Calabria, and thence to Florence and Padua. Venice, imitating the odious measures of the German cities, assigned to the Jews a special quarter (ghetto). =Expulsion from Naples= The ultra-Catholic party tried with all the means at its disposal to introduce the Inquisition into the Neapolitan realm, then under Spanish rule. Charles V, upon his return from his victories in Africa, was on the point of exiling the Jews from Naples when Benvenida, wife of Samuel Abravanel, caused him to defer the action. A few years later, in 1533, a similar decree was proclaimed, but upon this occasion also Samuel Abravanel and others were able through their influence to avert for several years the execution of the edict. Many Jews repaired to the Ottoman Empire, some to Ancona, and still others to Ferrara, where they were received graciously by Duke Ercole II. After the death of Pope Paul III (1534‚Äì1549), who had showed favor to the Jews, a period of strife, persecution, and despondency set in. A few years later the Jews were exiled from Genoa, among the refugees being Joseph Hakohen, physician to the doge Andrea Doria and eminent historian. Duke Ercole allowed the Maranos, driven from Spain and Portugal, to enter his dominions and to profess Judaism freely and openly. Samuel Usque, also a historian, who had fled from the Inquisition in Portugal, settled in Ferrara, and Abraham Usque founded a large printing establishment there. A third Usque, Solomon, merchant of Venice and Ancona and poet of some note, translated the sonnets of Petrarch into excellent Spanish verse, and this work was much admired by his contemporaries. Although the return to Judaism of the Marano Usques caused much rejoicing among the Italian Jews, this was counterbalanced by the deep grief into which they were plunged by the conversion to Christianity of two grandsons of Elijah Levita, Leone Romano and Vittorio Eliano. One became a canon of the Church; the other, a Jesuit. They heavily criticized the Talmud to Pope Julius III and the Inquisition; as a consequence the pope pronounced a sentence of destruction against this work, to the printing of which one of his predecessors, Leo X, had given his sanction. On the Jewish New Year Day (9 September) in 1553, all the copies of the Talmud in the principal cities of Italy, in the printing establishments of Venice, and even in the distant island of Candia (Crete), were burned. In 1555, Pope Marcellus II wished to exile the Jews of Rome on a ritual murder accusation. He was restrained from the execution of the scheme by Cardinal Alexander Farnese who succeeded in bringing to light the true culprit. =Paul IV= Marcellus' successor, Paul IV, confirmed all the bulls against the Jews issued up to that time and added more oppressive measures, including a variety of prohibitions designed to condemn Jews to abject misery, depriving them of the means of sustenance, and denying them the exercise of all professions. The papal bull Cum nimis absurdum of 1555 created the Roman ghetto and required the wearing of yellow badges. The Jews were also forced to labor at the restoration of the walls of Rome without any compensation. Cum nimis absurdum limited each ghetto in the Papal States to one synagogue. In the early 16th century, there were at least seven synagogues across Rome, each serving as the house of worship for distinct demographic subgroup: Roman Jews (Ben√® Rom√¨), Sicilian Jews, Italian Jews (that were neither Ben√® Rom√¨ nor Sicilian), German Ashkenazim, French Proven√ßal, Castilian Sephardim, and Catalan Sephardim. On one occasion the pope had secretly given orders to one of his nephews to burn the Jewish quarter during the night. However, Alexander Farnese, hearing of the infamous proposal, succeeded in frustrating it. Many Jews abandoned Rome and Ancona and went to Ferrara and Pesaro. Here the Duke of Urbino welcomed them graciously in the hope of directing the extensive commerce of the Levant to the new port of Pesaro, which was, at that time, exclusively in the hands of the Jews of Ancona. Among the many who were forced to leave Rome was the Marano Amato Lusitano, a distinguished physician, who had often attended Pope Julius III. He had even been invited to become physician to the King of Poland, but had declined the offer in order to remain in Italy. He fled from the Inquisition to Pesaro, where he openly professed Judaism. =Expulsion from Papal States= Paul IV was followed by the tolerant pope Pius IV, who was succeeded by Pius V, who restored all the anti-Jewish bulls of his predecessors‚Äînot only in his own immediate domains, but throughout the Christian world. In Lombardy, the expulsion of the Jews was threatened, and, although this extreme measure was not put into execution, they were tyrannized in countless ways. At Cremona and at Lodi their books were confiscated. In Genoa, from which the Jews were expelled at this time, an exception was made in favor of Joseph Hakohen. In his Emek Habachah he narrates the history of these persecutions. He had no desire to take advantage of the exception, though, and went to Casale Monferrato, where he was graciously received even by the Christians. In this same year the pope directed his persecutions against the Jews of Bologna. Many of the wealthiest Jews were imprisoned and tortured to force false confessions from them. When Rabbi Ishmael ·∏§anina was being racked, he declared that should the pains of torture elicit from him any words that might be construed as casting reflection on Judaism, they would be false and null. Jews were forbidden to leave the city, but many succeeded in escaping by bribing the watchmen at the gates of the ghetto and of the city. The fugitives, together with their wives and children, repaired to the neighboring city of Ferrara. Then Pius V decided to banish the Jews from all his dominions, and, despite the enormous loss which was likely to result from this measure, and the remonstrances of influential and well-meaning cardinals, the Jews (in all about 1,000 families) were actually expelled from all the Papal States excepting Rome and Ancona. A few became Christians. The majority found refuge in other parts of Italy, e.g. Leghorn and Pitigliano. =Approval within the Republic of Venice= The Venetian Ghetto was abolished by Napoleon when he occupied the city in 1797 A great sensation was caused in Italy by the choice of a prominent Jew, Solomon of Udine, as Turkish ambassador to Venice who was selected to negotiate within that republic during July 1574. There was a pending decree of expulsion of the Jews by the leaders of several kingdoms within Italy, thereby making the Venetian Senate concerned if whether there would be difficulties collaborating with Solomon of Udine. However, through the influence of the Venetian diplomats themselves, and particularly of the Patrician, Marcantonio Barbaro of the noble Barbaro family, who esteemed Udine highly, Solomon was received with great honors at the Doge's Palace. In virtue of this, Udine received an exalted position within the Republic of Venice and was able to render great service to his coreligionists. Through his influence Jacob Soranzo, an agent of the Venetian Republic at Constantinople, came to Venice. Solomon was influential in having the decree of expulsion revoked within Italian kingdoms, and he furthermore obtained a promise from Venetian patricians that Jews would have a secure home within the Republic of Venice. Udine was eventually honored for his services and returned to Constantinople, leaving his son Nathan in Venice to be educated. Nathan was one of the first Jewish students to have studied at the University of Padua, under the inclusive admission policy established by Marcantonio Barbaro. The success of Udine inspired many Jews in the Ottoman Empire, particularly in Constantinople, where they had attained great prosperity. =Persecutions and confiscations= The position of the Jews of Italy at this time was pitiable; pope Paul IV and Pius V reduced them to the utmost humiliation and had materially diminished their numbers. In southern Italy there were almost none left; in each of the important communities of Rome, Venice, and Mantua there were about 2,000 Jews; while in all Lombardy there were hardly 1,000. Gregory XIII was not less fanatical than his predecessors; he noticed that, despite papal prohibition, Christians employed Jewish physicians; he therefore strictly prohibited the Jews from attending Christian patients, and threatened with the most severe punishment alike Christians who should have recourse to Hebrew practitioners, and Jewish physicians who should respond to the calls of Christians. Furthermore, the slightest assistance given to the Maranos of Portugal and Spain, in violation of the canonical laws, was sufficient to deliver the guilty one into the power of the Inquisition, which did not hesitate to condemn the accused to death. Gregory also induced the Inquisition to consign to the flames a large number of copies of the Talmud and of other Hebrew books. Special sermons, designed to convert the Jews, were instituted; and at these at least one-third of the Jewish community, men, women, and youths above the age of twelve, was forced to be present. The sermons were usually delivered by baptized Jews who had become friars or priests; and not infrequently the Jews, without any chance of protest, were forced to listen to such sermons in their own synagogues. These cruelties forced many Jews to leave Rome, and thus their number was still further diminished. =Varied fortunes= Under the following pope, Sixtus V (1585‚Äì1590), the condition of the Jews was somewhat improved. He repealed many of the regulations established by his predecessors, permitted Jews to reside in all parts of his realm, and gave Jewish physicians freedom to practice their profession. David de Pomis, an eminent physician, profited by this privilege and published a work in Latin, entitled De Medico Hebraeo, dedicated to Duke Francis of Urbino, in which he proved to the Jews their obligation to consider the Christians as brothers, to assist them, and to attend them. The Jews of Mantua, Milan, and Ferrara, taking advantage of the favorable disposition of the pope, sent to him an ambassador, Bezaleel Massarano, with a present of 2,000 scudi, to obtain from him permission to reprint the Talmud and other Jewish books, promising at the same time to expurgate all passages considered offensive to Christianity. Their demand was granted, partly through the support given by Lopez, a Marano, who administered the papal finances and who was in great favor with the pontiff. Scarcely had the reprinting of the Talmud been begun, and the conditions of its printing been arranged by the commission, when Sixtus died. His successor, Gregory XIV, was as well disposed to the Jews as Sixtus had been; but during his short pontificate he was almost always ill. Clement VIII (1592‚Äì1605), who succeeded him, renewed the anti- Jewish bulls of Paul IV and Pius V, and exiled the Jews from all his territories with the exception of Rome, Ancona, and Avignon; but, in order not to lose the commerce with the East, he gave certain privileges to the Turkish Jews. The exiles repaired to Tuscany, where they were favorably received by Duke Ferdinand dei Medici, who assigned to them the city of Pisa for residence, and by Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga, at whose court Joseph da Fano, a Jew, was a favorite. They were again permitted to read the Talmud and other Hebrew books, provided that they were printed according to the rules of censorship approved by Sixtus V. From Italy, where these expurgated books were printed by thousands, they were sent to the Jews of other various countries. Giuseppe Ciante (d. 1670),Galletti in Vat.

Such an inconsistency of policy was designed to work ill for the interests of the Jews. To avert this misfortune an eloquent ambassador, Samuel Coen, was sent to the king at Alessandria; but he was unsuccessful in his mission. The king, persuaded by his confessor, expelled the Jews from Milanese territory in the spring of 1597. The exiles, numbering about 1,000, were received at Mantua, Modena, Reggio, Verona, and Padua. The princes of the house of Este had always accorded favor and protection to the Jews, and were much beloved by them. Eleonora, a princess of this house, had inspired two Jewish poets; and when she was ill public prayers were said in the synagogues for her restoration to health. But misfortune overtook the Jews of Ferrara as well; for when Alfonso II., the last of the Este family, died, the principality of Ferrara was incorporated in the dominions of the Church under Clement VIII., who decreed the banishment of the Jews. Aldobrandini, a relative of the pope, took possession of Ferrara in the pontiff's name. Seeing that all the commerce was in the hands of the Jews, he complied with their request for an exemption of five years from the decree, although this was much against the pope's wish. The Mantuan Jews suffered seriously at the time of the Thirty Years' war. The Jews exiled from the papal dominions had repeatedly found refuge in Mantua, where the dukes of Gonzaga had accorded protection to them, as they had done to the Jews already resident there. The next to the last duke, although a cardinal, favored them sufficiently to enact a statute for the maintenance of order in the ghetto. After the death of the last of this house the right of succession was contested at the time of the Thirty Years' war, and the city was besieged by the German soldiery of Wallenstein. After a valiant defense, in which the Jews labored at the walls until the approach of the Sabbath, the city fell into the power of the besiegers, and for three days was at the mercy of fire and sword. The commander-in-chief, Altringer, forbade the soldiers to sack the ghetto, thereby hoping to secure the spoils for himself. The Jews were ordered to leave the city, taking with them only their personal clothing and three gold ducats per capita. There were retained enough Jews to act as guides to the places where their coreligionists were supposed to have hidden their treasures. Through three Jewish zealots these circumstances came to the knowledge of the emperor, who ordered the governor, Collalto, to issue a decree permitting the Jews to return and promising them the restoration of their goods. Only about 800, however, returned, the others having died. The victories in Europe of the Turks, who brought their armies up to the very walls of Vienna (1683), helped even in Italy to incite the Christian population against the Jews, who remained friendly to the Turks. In Padua, in 1683, the Jews were in great danger because of the agitation fomented against them by the cloth-weavers. A violent tumult broke out; the lives of the Jews were seriously menaced; and it was only with the greatest difficulty that the governor of the city succeeded in rescuing them, in obedience to a rigorous order from Venice. For several days thereafter the ghetto had to be especially guarded. Reaction after Napoleon The Mole Antonelliana in Turin was conceived and constructed as a synagogue. Among the first schools to adopt the Reform projects of Hartwig Wessely were those of Trieste, Venice, and Ferrara. Under the influence of the liberal religious policy of Napoleon I, the Jews of Italy, like those of France, were emancipated. The supreme power of the popes was broken: they had no longer time to give to framing anti-Jewish enactments, and they no longer directed canonical laws against the Jews. To the Sanhedrin convened by Napoleon at Paris (1807), Italy sent four deputies: Abraham Vita da Cologna; Isaac Benzion Segre, rabbi of Vercelli; Graziadio Neppi, physician and rabbi of Cento; and Jacob Israel Karmi, rabbi of Reggio. Of the four rabbis assigned to the committee which was to draw up the answers to the twelve questions proposed to the Assembly of Notables, two, Cologna and Segre, were Italians, and were elected respectively first and second vice-presidents of the Sanhedrin. But the liberty acquired by the Jews under Napoleon was of short duration; it disappeared with his downfall. Pope Pius VII, on regaining possession of his realms, reinstalled the Inquisition; he deprived the Jews of every liberty and confined them again in ghettos. Such became to a greater or less extent their condition in all the states into which Italy was then divided; at Rome they were again forced to listen to proselytizing sermons. In the year 1829, consequent upon an edict of the Emperor Francis I, there was opened in Padua, with the cooperation of Venice, of Verona, and of Mantua, the first Italian rabbinical college, in which Lelio della Torre and Samuel David Luzzatto taught. Luzzatto was a man of great intellect; he wrote in pure Hebrew upon philosophy, history, literature, criticism, and grammar. Many distinguished rabbis came from the rabbinical college of Padua. Zelman, Moses Tedeschi, and Castiglioni followed at Trieste the purposes and the principles of Luzzatto's school. At the same time, Elijah Benamozegh, a man of great knowledge and the author of several works, distinguished himself in the old rabbinical school at Leghorn. Nineteenth century Great Synagogue of Florence, built in 1874‚Äì1882 The return to medieval servitude after the Italian restoration did not last long; and the Revolution of 1848, which convulsed all Europe, brought great advantages to the Jews. Although this was followed by restoration of the Papal States only four months later, in early 1849, yet the persecutions and the violence of past times had to a large extent disappeared. The last outrage against the Jews of Italy was connected with the case of Edgardo Mortara, which occurred in Bologna in 1858. In 1859 most of the papal states were annexed into the united Kingdom of Italy under King Victor Emanuel II. Except in and near Rome, where oppression lasted until the end of the papal dominion (20 September 1870), the Jews obtained full emancipation. In behalf of their country the Jews with great ardor sacrificed life and property in the memorable campaigns of 1859, 1866, and 1870. Of the many who deserve mention in this connection may be singled out Isaac Pesaro Maurogonato. He was minister of finance to the self-proclaimed Venetian Republic of San Marco (whose president, Daniele Manin came from a Jewish family that had converted to Christianity in 1759) during the war of 1848 against Austria, and his grateful country erected to him a memorial in bronze. Also erected in the palace of the doges there was a marble bust of Samuel Romanin, a celebrated Jewish historian of Venice. Florence, too, has commemorated a modern Jewish poet, Solomon Fiorentino, by placing a marble tablet upon the house in which he was born. The secretary and faithful friend of Count Cavour was the Piedmontese Isaac Artom; while L'Olper, later rabbi of Turin, and also the friend and counselor of Mazzini, was one of the most courageous advocates of Italian independence. The names of the Jewish soldiers who died in the cause of Italian liberty were placed along with those of their Christian fellow soldiers on the monuments erected in their honour. Twentieth century =Early twentieth century= Italian prime minister Luigi Luzzatti, who took office in 1910, was one of the world's first Jewish heads of government (not converted to Christianity). Another Jew, Ernesto Nathan served as mayor of Rome from 1907 to 1913. By 1902, out of 350 senators, there were six Jews. By 1920, there were nineteen Jewish senators. Pope John Paul II gave access to some formerly secret Vatican archives to scholars, one of whom, David Kertzer, used information thus obtained in his book The Popes Against the Jews. According to that book, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the popes and many Catholic bishops and Catholic publications consistently made a distinction between \\"good anti-Semitism\\" and \\"bad anti-Semitism\\". The \\"bad\\" kind directed hatred against Jews merely because of their descent. That was considered un-Christian, in part because the church held that its message was for all of mankind equally, and any person of any ancestry could become a Christian. The \\"good\\" kind denounced alleged Jewish plots to gain control of the world by controlling newspapers, banks, schools, etc., or otherwise attributed various evils to Jews. Kertzer's book details many instances in which Catholic publications denounced such alleged plots, and then, when criticized for inciting hatred of Jews, would remind people that the Catholic Church condemned the \\"bad\\" kind of anti- Semitism. Approximately 5,000 Italian Jews were conscripted during World War I and about half of them served as officers (this was due to the average higher level of education among Italian Jews). About 420 were killed in action or went missing in action; about 700 received military decorations. =Jews during the Fascist era= A Holocaust Memorial in Rome's Jewish ghetto A significant train of thought inside Italian Fascism, influenced by Nazism and its race theories, actively promoted anti-Semitism. Jews were depicted both as \\"rootless cosmopolitan\\" capitalist bourgeois and as communists. The most notable figures associated with this point of view were Julius Evola, Paolo Orano, Roberto Farinacci, Telesio Interlandi and Giovanni Preziosi. However, at least until the promulgation of the 1938 racial laws, a number of Italian Jews were sympathetic to the regime and occupied significant offices and positions in politics and economy. It is estimated that 230 Italian Jews participated in the October 1922 March on Rome that brought about Mussolini's ascent to power. Examples of Italian Jews that operated within the regime until the enactment of the racial laws include Giorgio Morpurgo (lieutenant colonel, staff officer of the Corpo Truppe Volontarie), Aldo Finzi, Renzo Ravenna (podest√† of Ferrara and personal friend of Italo Balbo), Ettore Ovazza and Guido Jung (the latter however eventually converted to Christianity in 1938). Furthermore, Margherita Sarfatti, a writer and socialite, was a close friend and possibly mistress of Mussolini and a propaganda and political adviser of his. She authored the popular biography of the Italian dictator entitled \\"Dux\\". Giorgio Bassani, a Jewish Italian author, has given an insight into the life of the Jewish middle class during the Fascist regime. Michele Sarfatti has written a thorough compendium of the situation of the Italian Jewish community under the fascist regime in his book The Jews in Mussolini's Italy: from equality to persecution. On the other hand, a significant number of Italian Jews were also active in anti-fascist organizations, and some joined the Resistenza: among them the most significant were the brothers Carlo and Nello Rosselli, Franco Momigliano, Leone Ginzburg and the brothers Ennio and Emanuele Artom. The Fascist regime also helped, at the request of Vladimir Jabotinski, the establishment in 1934 of a navy officer training camp in Civitavecchia for Mandatory Palestine Jews, laying the foundations of the Israeli Navy. By helping the Zionist cause, Mussolini hoped to gain influence in the Middle East at the expense of the British Empire. The Italian colonial authorities in Ethiopia after the conquest of this African state came into contact with the Beta Israel community and greatly favoured them, enacting special laws to protect them from offences and violences routinely committed against them by Christian and Muslim Ethiopians. The regime also encouraged cultural exchanges between the Italian Jewish community and the Ethiopian Jews. Incidentally, the first scholar to describe using a modern, scientific approach this ethnic group had been Filosseno Luzzatto, an Italki Jew. Starting in 1843, he collected and selected data about the Falasha. On 28 July 1938, Pope Pius XI made a speech at Propaganda Fide college, expressing the view that mankind is a single, large, universal human race (...) [with] no room for special races, and the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle thanked him for that speech.Sergio Pagano, The Catholic Church and Racial Laws, L'Osservatore Romano. Weekly Edition in English, 14 January 2009, p.10 In September of that year in a speech to Belgian pilgrims, Pius XI proclaimed: > Mark well that in the Catholic Mass, Abraham is our Patriarch and > forefather. Anti-Semitism is incompatible with the lofty thought which that > fact expresses. It is a movement with which we Christians can have nothing > to do. No, no I say to you it is impossible for a Christian to take part in > anti-Semitism. It is inadmissible. Through Christ and in Christ we are the > spiritual progeny of Abraham. Spiritually we are all Semites. While some Roman Catholic prelates tried to find compromises with Fascism, several others spoke out against racism. The Archbishop of Milan, Cardinal Schuster, who had supported Amici Israel,Hubert Wolf, Kenneth Kronenberg, \\"Pope and Devil: The Vatican's Archives and the Third Reich\\", Harvard University Press, 2010, p.91 ; See also :fr:Oremus et pro perfidis Judaeis#Les ann√©es 1920 et la tentative de r√©forme des Amici Israel. condemned racism as heresy and an international danger (...) not lesser than bolshevism in his 13 November 1938 homily at Milan Cathedral.\\" √à nata all'estero ‚Äì disse ‚Äì e serpeggia un po' dovunque una specie di eresia, che non-solamente attenta alla fondamenta soprannaturali della cattolica Chiesa, ma materializza nel sangue umano i concetti spirituali di individuo, di Nazione e di Patria, rinnega all'umanit√† ogni altro valore spirituale, e costituisce cos√¨ un pericolo internazionale non-minore di quello dello stesso bolscevismo. √à il cosiddetto razzismo \\". Chiesadimilano.it, with the collaboration of Annamaria Braccini,Quando il cardinale Schuster denunci√≤ le leggi razziali , 19 December 2008, quoting \\"Un'Eresia Antiromana\\", , 15 November 1938, p.1 After Italy entered the war in 1940, Jewish refugees living in Italy were interned in concentration camps such as the Campagna concentration camp and the concentration camp at Ferramonti di Tarsia. In 1942, the Italian military commander in Croatia refused to hand over Jews in his zone to the Nazis. In January 1943, the Italians refused to cooperate with the Nazis in rounding up the Jews living in the occupied zone of France under their control, and in March prevented the Nazis from deporting Jews in their zone. German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop complained to Benito Mussolini that \\"Italian military circles... lack a proper understanding of the Jewish question.\\" The deportations of Italian Jews to Nazi death camps began after September 1943, when Italy capitulated to the Allies and, in response, the German troops invaded Italy from the North. However, by the time they got to the Campagna concentration camp, all the inmates had already fled to the mountains with the help of the local inhabitants. Rev. Aldo Brunacci of Assisi, under the direction of his bishop, Giuseppe Nicolini, saved all the Jews who sought refuge in Assisi. This effort became the basis for the novel The Assisi Underground. In October 1943, Nazis raided the Jewish ghetto in Rome. In November 1943, the Jews of Genoa and Florence were deported to Auschwitz. Jews of Friuli were deported to Auschwitz via Risiera di San Sabba concentration camp. It is estimated that 7,682 Italian Jews became victims of the Holocaust. The attitude of the Italian Fascists towards Italian Jews drastically changed in November 1943, after the Fascist authorities declared them to be of \\"enemy nationality\\" during the Congress of Verona and begun to actively participate in the prosecution and arrest of Jews. However, this prosecution by Italian authorities did not extend to people descended from mixed marriages.Gentile, p. 15 Initially, after the Italian surrender, the Italian police had only assisted in the round up of Jews when requested to do so by the German authorities. With the ', in which Jews were declared to be foreigners and, in times of war, enemies, this changed. Police Order No. 5 on 30 November 1943, issued by the minister of the interior of the RSI Guido Buffarini Guidi, ordered the Italian police to arrest Jews and confiscate their property. After September 1943, when the northern half effectively came under German occupation, SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Karl Wolff, was appointed as the Highest SS and Police leader in Italy tasked with overseeing the final solution, the genocide of the Jews. Wolff assembled a group of SS personnel under him that had a vast experience in the extermination of Jews in Eastern Europe. Odilo Globocnik, appointed as police leader for the coastal area, was responsible for the murder of hundreds of thousands of Jews and Gypsies in Lublin, Poland, before being sent to Italy.Gentile, p. 4 Karl Brunner was appointed as SS and police leader in Bolzano, South Tyrol, Willy Tensfeld in Monza for upper and western Italy and Karl-Heinz B√ºrger was placed in charge of anti-partisan operations.Gentile, p. 5 The security police and the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) came under the command of Wilhelm Harster, based in Verona, who had previously held the same position in the Netherlands.Gentile, p. 6 Theodor Dannecker, previously active in the deportation of Greek Jews in the part of Greece occupied by Bulgaria, was made chief of the Judenreferat of the SD and was tasked with the deportation of the Italian Jews. Not seen as efficient enough, he was replaced by Friedrich Bo√ühammer, who was, like Dannecker, closely associated with Adolf Eichmann. Dannecker committed suicide after being captured in December 1945 while Bo√ühammer assumed a false name after the war. He was discovered and sentenced to life in jail in West Germany in 1972 but died before ever serving any time. General Kurt M√§lzer, the German commander in Rome, died in 1952. The Austrian Ludwig Koch was the head of the Gestapo and the Fascist Italian police in Rome and received three years imprisonment after the war. =Jews after the war= It is estimated that about 10,000 Italian Jews were deported to concentration and death camps, of whom 7,700 perished in the Holocaust, out of a pre-war Jewish population that amounted to 58,500 (46,500 by Jewish religion and 12,000 converted or non-Jewish sons of mixed marriages).Elizabeth Bettina, \\"It happened in Italy: Untold stories of how the people of Italy defied the horrors of the Holocaust\\", p. 26, Thomas Nelson, 2011 The surviving community was able to maintain its distinctiveness throughout the following decades and continued to have a significant role in the fields of politics, literature, science and industry. Writers such as Giorgio Bassani, Natalia Ginzburg and Primo Levi were among the leading figures of the Italian culture in the post-war years. A significant event that marked the Italian Jewish community was the conversion to Catholicism of the Chief Rabbi of Rome, Israel Zolli, in 1945. The size of the Italian Jewish community has faced a slight but continuous drop throughout the postwar decades, partly because of emigration to Israel or the United States and partly because of low birth rates, assimilation and intermarriage, especially in the small congregations of the North. A significant increase occurred during the 1970s due to the arrival of Iranian Jews (following the ousting of the Shah) and North African Jews (mainly coming from Libya in the aftermath of Gaddafi's seizure of power). 21st century Rita Levi-Montalcini in 2009 In 2007 the Jewish population in Italy numbered around 45‚Äì46,000 people, decreased to 42,850 in 2015 (36,150 with Italian citizenship) and to 41,200 in 2017 (36,600 with Italian citizenship and 25‚Äì28,000 affiliated with the Union of Italian Jewish Communities), mainly because of low birth rates and emigration due to the financial crisis. There have been occasional antisemitic incidents in the last decades. On December 13, 2017 the Museum of Italian Judaism and the Shoah (MEIS) was inaugurated in Ferrara. The museum traces the history of the Jewish people in Italy starting from the Roman empire, and going through the Holocaust during the 20th century. Demographics In 2007, there were approximately 45,000 Jews in Italy, of a total Italian population of 60 million people (i.e., 0.05-0.1% of the total), not counting recent migrations from Eastern Europe. The greatest concentrations were in Rome (20,000 people) and Milan (12,000 people).

Brimson was a Slow Left Arm Orthodox bowler who played for Kent, and then Leicestershire, in the English County Cricket Competition. Only moderately successful as a professional cricketer, in 1999 Brimson was apparently frustrated at the management of the Leicestershire county cricket club. When a series of team photographs were taken for the official Wisden almanack, Brimson decided to expose himself for one of the photos. Unluckily for Wisden, the photo that they picked was the offending photograph. Brimson explained his actions as merely a prank that went wrong, and apologised quickly when his actions were discovered. His relations with the Leicestershire club never recovered, and he retired from professional cricket soon afterwards. The discovery of Brimson's actions caused a furore throughout the cricketing world at the time. Wisden, one of Cricket's oldest established institutions and an expression of the sport's \\"traditional\\" side, was embarrassed that the gaffe was not noticed before publication. The photograph of a sportsman exposing himself in the pages of one of the world's most \\"proper\\" publications was a source of much mirth. Brimson played for North Devon Cricket Club, and works as a geography teacher/head of sixth form as well as coaching hockey/cricket for West Buckland School.

For fixed target experiments, the interaction point is the point where beam and target interact. For colliders, it is the place where the beams interact. Experiments (detectors) at particle accelerators are built around the nominal interaction points of the accelerators. The whole region around the interaction point (the experimental hall) is called an interaction region.

He is best known for his work Tempest Fantasy, which received the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for Music. Biography Moravec was born in Buffalo, New York, and subsequently attended the Lawrenceville School, graduating in 1975. He received his B.A. in composition from Harvard University in 1980; while there, he performed with the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum, one of the Holden Choirs. He won the Prix de Rome and studied at the American Academy in Rome after graduating. He then received the Master of Music (1982) and Doctor of Musical Arts (1987) in composition, both from Columbia University.Curriculum Vita at PaulMoravec.com Moravec has taught at Dartmouth College (1987‚Äì96) and Hunter College (1997‚Äì98). He suffered from clinically diagnosed depression that reached a zenith during the time immediately surrounding his departure from Dartmouth College, and underwent electroshock therapy.

In 2004, Moravec received the Pulitzer Prize for Music for his work Tempest Fantasy. This prestigious award raised Moravec's profile significantly, and he was appointed to several residencies. He was named the new honorary composer- member of the New York Composers Circle in September, 2006. He was also appointed the composer in residence for the 2007-2008 academic year at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In addition to his Pulitzer Prize, Moravec has received a Composer Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship, and the Charles Ives Prize and Goddard Lieberson Awards in American Composition. He has been commissioned by such ensembles as the Dessoff Choirs, the Albany Symphony Orchestra, and the Harvard Glee Club. Musical style Moravec has been placed into a group called \\"new tonalists\\" by the critic Terry Teachout, who describes them as composers who are \\"neither embarrassed nor paralyzed by tradition. Rather they accept it as a given.\\" Thus, according to this analysis, his style is primarily tonal and neo-romantic. However, Moravec himself asserts: > The term ‚Äònew tonalist‚Äô is a little outdated simply because of the passage > of time[.] It had more relevance a few decades ago, when late modernism was > dying or even dead. For my work, I regard the term only as a point of > departure before considering each composition on a case-by-case basis. As a > composer, I try always to make beautiful things, and I use whatever > techniques and materials are useful for the particular composition at > hand[.] Some of those materials are atonal or nontonal, but the overall > harmonic context of my music derives from the tonal tradition, which after > all is the lingua franca of Western music ‚Äî essentially, Monteverdi to the > Beatles and beyond. Critic Jens F. Laurson described Moravec's Pulitzer Prize-winning Tempest Fantasy as \\"remarkably accessible music. Picturesque, conventionally beautiful at times, but without pandering to the ears‚Äô lowest harmonic expectations. [It is] music that works with all the traditional tools from the composer‚Äôs workshop[,] which have changed surprisingly little since Bach - but Moravec uses them to create music anew.\\" He named Federico Mompou, Claude Debussy, Paul Hindemith, Francis Poulenc, and Elliott Carter as clear musical influences in Moravec's music. He also noted a clear disparity between Moravec's music and that of minimalist composers Steve Reich, Philip Glass, and John Adams. Critic Victor Carr Jr. characterizes Moravec's musical language as \\"generally tonal--and although it's not consistently melodic, it's always accessible. More than that, it's highly engrossing[.]\\" Musical works His best-known pieces include the Pulitzer-winning, Shakespeare- inspired Tempest Fantasy, a 30-minute chamber work scored for clarinet, violin, cello, and piano, which was premiered on May 2, 2003, at the Morgan Library in New York City by David Krakauer and Trio Solisti, for whom it was written; Northern Lights Electric, a 1994 work that combines a musical illustration of the Northern Lights with a musical depiction of electric light; and the 1998 cantata Fire/Ice/Air, which contrasts the journeys of Captain Robert Falcon Scott, on his expedition to the Antarctic, and Charles Lindbergh, on his trans-Atlantic flight. An oratorio, Blizzard Voices, about the Schoolhouse Blizzard of 1888, was commissioned by Opera Omaha and was premiered there in September 2008.

Ideophones are found in many of the world's languages, though they are claimed to be relatively uncommon in Western languages.Nuckolls 2004 In many languages, they are a major lexical class of the same order of magnitude as nouns and verbs: dictionaries of languages like Japanese, Korean, Xhosa and Zulu list thousands of them. The word class of ideophones is sometimes called phonosemantic to indicate that it is not a grammatical word class in the traditional sense of the word (like 'verb' or 'noun'), but rather a lexical class based on the special relation between form and meaning exhibited by ideophones. In the discipline of linguistics, ideophones have long been overlooked or treated as mysterious words,Voeltz and Kilian-Hatz 2001:2 though a recent surge of interest in sound symbolism, iconicity and linguistic diversity has brought them renewed attention.Imai & Kita 2014, Dingemanse et al. 2015 Characteristics An often-cited definition of the notion of ideophone is the following by Clement Martyn DokeDoke 1935 as cited in Voeltz & Kilian-Hatz 2001 Ideophones evoke sensory events. A well known instance of ideophones are onomatopoeic words ‚Äì words that imitate the sound (of the event) they refer to. Some ideophones may be derived from onomatopoeic notions. A case in point is the English ideophonic verb to tinkle, which imitates a brief metallic sound. In many languages, however, ideophones go far beyond onomatopoeia in imitating many things beyond sound. For instance, in Gbaya, kpuk 'a rap on the door' may be onomatopoeic, but other ideophones depict motion and visual scenes: lo…ìoto-lo…ìoto 'large animals plodding through mud', kil√°≈ã-kil√°≈ã 'in a zigzagging motion', p…õ…ó…õ≈ã-p…õ…ó…õ≈ã 'razor sharp'. Ideophones are often characterized as iconic or sound-symbolic words, meaning that there can be a resemblance between their form and their meaning. For instance, in West-African languages, voiced consonants and low tone in ideophones are often connected to large and heavy meanings, whereas voiceless consonants and high tones tend to relate to small and light things.Westermann 1927 Reduplication figures quite prominently in ideophones, often conveying a sense of repetition or plurality present in the evoked event.Watson in Voeltz & Kilian-Hatz 2001 The iconicity of ideophones is shown by the fact that people can guess the meanings of ideophones from various languages at a level above chance.Iwasaki et al. 2007, Dingemanse et al. 2015 However, not everything about the form of ideophones directly relates to their meaning; as conventionalized words, they contain arbitrary, language-specific phonemes just like other parts of the vocabulary. =Grammar= The grammatical function of ideophones varies by language. In some languages (e.g. Welayta, Yir-Yiront, Semai, Korean), they form a separate word class, while in others, they occur across a number of different word classes (e.g. Mundang, Ewe, Sotho, Hausa).Voeltz & Kilian-Hatz 2001 Despite this diversity, ideophones show a number of robust regularities across languages. One is that they are often marked in the same way as quoted speech and demonstrations. Sometimes ideophones can form a complete utterance on their own, as in English \\"ta-da!\\" or Japanese .Diffloth 1972 However, ideophones also often occur within utterances, depicting a scene described by other elements of the utterance, as in Japanese Taro wa _sutasuta to_ haya-aruki o si-ta 'Taro walked hurriedly' (literally 'Taro did haste-walk sutasuta'). Whether they occur as part of other utterances or on their own, ideophones tend show a high degree of grammatical independence. They often occur at the edge of the utterance; they may be syntactically optional; and they tend to carry little inflectional or derivational morphology. Other signs of their relative independence are that they are often produced with higher intonation and expressive lengthening, and set off from the rest of the utterance by a brief pause.Kunene in Voeltz & Kilian-Hatz 2001 Because of their relative independence, ideophones are sometimes compared to interjections: direct expressions of emotions like \\"Wow!\\" or \\"Ouch!\\". However, they are distinct in a number of ways. Whereas interjections usually occur on their own, ideophones more often modify other utterances, providing an illustration of a scene the utterance is about. Also, ideophones are more like illustrations of events than responses to events. An ideophone like Gbaya kil√°≈ã-kil√°≈ã 'in a zigzagging motion' displays a certain resemblance to the event (for instance, its irregular vowels and tones depicting the irregularity of the motion). An interjection like 'Wow!' indexes someone's response to an event but does not resemble that event itself. =Registers= Languages may differ in the context in which ideophones are used. In some languages, ideophones are primarily used in spoken language (e.g. narrative contexts) and are rarely encountered in written language.Noss in Voeltz & Kilian-Hatz 2001 In other languages (e.g. Ewe, Japanese), ideophones can be freely used in all registers. In general, however, ideophones tend to occur more extensively in spoken language because of their expressive or dramaturgic function. Examples =English= True ideophones are few in English: most ideophone-like words are either onomatopoeia like murmur or sound-symbolic ordinary words like pitter-patter, where patter is a normal word but pitter is added to give an impression of lightness and quickness. * zigzag; an onomatopoetic impression of sharp edges or angles * gaga; unintelligible utterances * boing; the sound of a spring being released * boom; the sound of an explosion * bang; the sound of a gunshot * swish; the sound of swift movement * splish-splash; the sound of water splashing * ta- daa!; the sound of a fanfare * thud; the sound of something heavy falling on the ground * tick-tock; the sound of time passing * zoom; the sound of something rushing past, with doppler effect * helter-skelter; hurriedly, recklessly Other ideophones can appear in cartoons; in particular, the words in jagged balloons usually called sound effects are typically ideophones. =German= * Zickzack; (in) a zigzag line or shape * ratzfatz; very fast * zack, zack!; quickly, immediately, promptly * holterdiepolter; helter-skelter, pell-mell * pillepalle; pish-posh, petty, irrelevant * plemplem; crazy, gaga, cuckoo * tick, tack; the sound of time passing by * bumm; the sound of an explosion =Tamil= The Tamil language uses a lot of ideophones, both in spoken (colloquial) and in formal usage.

The constructions are quite metrical 2-2, or 3-3, where morae play a role in the symmetry. The first consonant of the second item of the reduplication may become voiced if phonological conditions allow. Japanese ideophones are used extensively in daily conversations as well as in the written language. * doki doki () -- heartbeat: excitement * kira kira () -- glitter * shiin () -- silence * niko niko () -- smile * Jii () -- stare =Xhosa= In Xhosa, as in closely related Zulu, ideophones can convey very complex experiential impressions or can just strengthen meanings of other words.

This federation was powerful enough to counter the Assyrian forays, although in 1112 BC its king, Sien, was defeated by Tiglath-Pileser I (who listed the kingdom as the northernmost point of Nairi). He was captured and later released on terms of vassalage. In 845 BC, Shalmaneser III finally subdued Diauehi and downgraded its king, Asia, to a client ruler. King Asia of Diauehi (850‚Äì825 BC) was forced to submit to the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III in 845 BC, after the latter had overrun Urartu and made a foray into Diauehi. In the early 8th century, Diauehi became the target of the newly emerged regional power of Urartu. Both Menua (810‚Äì785 BC) and Argishti I (785‚Äì763 BC) campaigned against the Diauehi kingdom. Argishti I defeated King Utupursini, annexing his possessions and in exchange of his life, Utupursini was forced to pay a tribute including a variety of metals and livestock. Diauehi was finally destroyed by Colchian incursions by about the 760s BC, the date of the last recorded references to Diauehi.

A bipod is an attachment, usually to a weapon, that helps support and steady it. The bipod provides significant stability along two axes of motion (side-to-side, and up-and-down). Bipod comes from the Latin and Greek roots bi and pod, meaning \\"two\\" and \\"foot, or feet\\" respectively.  Firearms  A Sako TRG sniper rifle on its standard factory bipod and its monopod under the stock On firearms, bipods are commonly used on rifles and machine guns to provide a forward rest and reduce motion. They are also seen on other long-barrelled weapons. Bipods permit operators to easily rest a weapon on objects, like the ground or a wall, reducing their fatigue and increasing accuracy and stability. Bipods can be of fixed or adjustable length. Some can be tilted and also have their tilting point close to the barrel's central axis, allowing the weapon to tilt left and right. Some designs also allow the weapon to be rotated side-to-side. There are three ways for bipods to be folded: away from the shooter, towards the shooter, or into a vertical foregrip. = History = The first known use of bipods on firearms can be traced back to hand cannons of the 12th century which were cast iron barrels laid on top of short poles.BLK LBL Bipod  Two legs are better than one‚Äìthe evolution and history of bipods Bipods on rifles are first known to have been used in an improvised fashion during the mid-19th century, particularly by frontiersmen hunting American bison and other wild animals. For example, the painting \\"The Long Shot\\" by Howard TerpningThe painting \\"The Long Shot\\" by Howard Terpning shows native American hunters shooting a rifle with an improvised bipod consisting of two crossed arrows. During the 20th century, use of dedicated bipods increased, and was seen on different types of rifles during wars. For example the Lewis gun (1914) was fitted with an adjustable bipod.Weapons History - Lewis Gun The technology became more advanced, with hinged legs and even extendable or retractable legs. One of the first companies to manufacture commercially successful bipods was Harris Engineering, Inc founded in 1979 in Barlow, Kentucky by Gerald Harris, Margaret Harris, and Susan Wilkerson.

The culture arose about 900 AD, succeeding the Moche culture, and was later conquered by the Inca emperor Topa Inca Yupanqui around 1470, fifty years before the arrival of the Spanish in the region.Kubler, George. (1962). The Art and Architecture of Ancient America, Ringwood: Penguin Books Australia Ltd., pp. 247-274 Chimor was the largest kingdom in the Late Intermediate Period, encompassing 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) of coastline. The Chim√∫ resided on a strip of desert on the northern coast of Peru. The rivers in the region carved a series of fertile valley plains, which were very flat and well-suited to irrigation. Agriculture and fishing were both very important to the Chim√∫ economy. Worshipping the moon, the Chim√∫, unlike the Inca, considered it more powerful than the sun. Offerings played an important role in religious rites. A common object for offerings, as well as one used by artisans, was the shell of the Spondylus shellfish, which resides only in the warm coastal waters off present-day Ecuador. Associated with the sea, rainfall, and fertility, Spondylus shells were highly valued and traded by the Chim√∫ people, and the exchange of the shells played a significant economic and political role in the empire. The Chim√∫ people are best known for their distinctive monochromatic pottery and fine metal working of copper, gold, silver, bronze, and tumbaga (copper and gold). The pottery is often in the shape of a creature or has a human figure sitting or standing on a cuboid bottle. The shiny black finish of most Chim√∫ pottery was achieved by firing the pottery at high temperatures in a closed kiln, which prevented oxygen from reacting with the clay.  History  =Early Chim√∫ (Moche civilization)= The oldest civilization present on the north coast of Peru is the Moche or Mochica civilization, which is identified as Early Chim√∫. The start of this period is not known for certain, but it ended around 700 AD. It was centered in the Chicama, Moche, and Viru Valleys. \\"Many large pyramids are attributed to the Early Chim√∫ period.\\" (37)Holstein, Otto. 1927. \\"Chan-chan: Capital of the great Chimu\\", Geographical Review 17, (1) (Jan.): 36-61. These pyramids are built of adobe in rectangular shapes made from molds. \\"Early Chim√∫ cemeteries are also found without pyramid associations. Burials are usually in extended positions, in prepared tombs. The rectangular, adobe-lined and covered tombs have niches in their walls in which bowls were placed.\\" (39) The Early pottery is also characterized by realistic modeling and painted scenes. =Expansion and rule= Map of the area of control and influence of the Chimor culture. Expansion During the reign of the Wari Empire over Peru, the mature Chim√∫ culture developed in roughly the same territory where the Mochica had existed centuries before. The Chim√∫ was also a coastal culture - according to legend, its capital of Chan Chan was founded by Taycanamo, who arrived in the area by sea. It was developed in the Moche Valley north of present-day Lima, northeast of Huarmey, and finishing in central present-day Trujillo. Later, it expanded to Arequipa. The Chim√∫ appeared in the year 900: Chimor, also known as the Kingdom of Chimor, had its capital \\"at the great site now called Chanchan, between Trujillo and the sea, and we may assume that Taycanamo founded his kingdom there. His son, Guacri-caur, conquered the lower part of the valley and was succeeded by a son named Nancen-pinco who really laid the foundations of the Kingdom by conquering the head of the valley of Chimor and the neighboring valleys of Sana, Pacasmayo, Chicama, Viru, Chao and Santa.\\"Rowe, John H. (1948) \\"The kingdom of Chimor\\", Aus Acta Americana 6, (1-2): 27. The estimated founding date of the last Chim√∫ kingdom is in the first half of the fourteenth century. Nacen-pinco was believed to have ruled around 1370 and was followed by seven rulers whose names are not yet known. Minchancaman followed these rulers, and was ruling around the time of the Inca conquest (between 1462 and 1470). This great expansion is believed to have occurred during the late period of Chim√∫ civilization, called: Late Chim√∫,Bennett, Wendell C. (1937). \\"Chimu archeology\\", The Scientific Monthly 45, (1) (Jul.): 35-48. but the development of the Chim√∫ territory spanned a number of phases and more than a single generation. Nacen-pinco, \\"may have pushed the imperial frontiers to Jequetepeque and to Santa, but conquest of the entire region was an agglutinative process initiated by earlier rulers.\\" (17)Mosely, Michael E. (1990). \\"Structure and history in the dynastic lore of Chimor\\", in The Northern Dynasties Kingship and Statecraft in Chimor, eds. Maria Rostworowski and Michael E. Mosely. Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks, 1st ed., p. 548 The Chim√∫ expanded to include a vast area and many different ethnic groups. The first valleys seem to have joined forces willingly, but the Sican culture was assimilated through conquest. At its peak, the Chim√∫ advanced to the limits of the desert coast to the valley of the Jequetepeque River in the north. Pampa Grande in the Lambayeque Valley was also ruled by the Chim√∫. To the south, they expanded as far as Carabayllo. Their expansion southward was stopped by the military power of the great valley of Lima. Historians and archeologists contest how far south they managed to expand. Rule The Chim√∫ society was a four-level hierarchical system,Christie, J. J. & Sarro, P. J (Eds). (2006). Palaces and Power in the Americas. Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press with a powerful elite rule over administrative centers. The hierarchy was centered at the walled cities, called ciudadelas, at Chan Chan. The political power at Chan Chan is demonstrated by the organization of labor to construct the Chim√∫'s canals and irrigated fields. Gold adornments of the Chim√∫ dated to about 1300 - Larco Museum Chan Chan was the top of the Chimu hierarchy, with Farf√°n in the Jequetepeque Valley as a subordinate. This organization, which was quickly established during the conquest of the Jequetepeque Valley, suggests the Chim√∫ established the hierarchy during the early stages of their expansion. The existing elite at peripheral locations, such as the Jequetepeque Valley and other centers of power, were incorporated into the Chim√∫ government on lower levels of the hierarchy. These lower-order centers managed land, water, and labor, while the higher-order centers either moved the resources to Chan Chan or carried out other administrative decisions. Rural sites were used as engineering headquarters, while the canals were being built; later they operated as maintenance sites. The numerous broken bowls found at Quebrada del Oso support this theory, as the bowls were probably used to feed the large workforce that built and maintained that section of canal. The workers were probably fed and housed at state expense.  Downfall  The state governed such social classes until the empire of the Sican culture conquered the kingdom of Lambayeque, Peru. The legends of war were said to have been told by the leaders Naylamp in the Sican language and Tacayanamo in Chim√∫. The people paid tribute to the rulers with products or labor. Chimor was the last Andean kingdom capable of stopping the Inca Empire, but the Inca conquest began in the 1470s by Topa Inca Yupanqui, defeating the emperor Minchancaman, and was nearly complete when Huayna Capac assumed the throne in 1493. They moved Minchancaman, the final Chim√∫ emperor, to Cusco and redirected gold and silver there to adorn the Qurikancha.  Economy  Chan Chan could be said to have developed a bureaucracy due to the elite's controlled access to information.Topic, J. R. (2003). \\"From stewards to bureaucrats: architecture and information flow at Chan Chan, Peru\\", Latin American Antiquity, 14, 243-274. The economic and social system operated through the import of raw materials, where they were processed into prestige goods by artisans at Chan Chan. The elite at Chan Chan made the decisions on most other matters concerning organization, monopolizing production, storage of food and products, and distribution or consumption of goods. Chim√∫ vessel representing a fisherman on a caballito de totora (reed watercraft), 1100‚Äì1400 - Museum of the Americas (Madrid) The majority of the citizens in each ciudadela were artisans. In the late Chim√∫, about 12,000 artisans lived and worked in Chan Chan alone.Moseley, M. E. & Cordy-Collins, A. (Ed.) (1990). The Northern Dynasties: Kingships and Statecraft in Chimor. Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks. They engaged in fishing, agriculture, craft work, and trade. Artisans were forbidden to change their profession, and were grouped in the ciudadela according to their area of specialization. Archeologists have noted a dramatic increase in Chim√∫ craft production, and they believe that artisans may have been brought to Chan Chan from another area taken as a result of Chim√∫ conquest. As there is evidence of both metalwork and weaving in the same domestic unit, it is likely that both men and women were artisans. They engaged in fishing, agriculture, and metallurgy, and made ceramics and textiles from cotton and the wool of llama, alpaca, and vicu√±a. People used reed fishing canoes (displayed in the image on the right), hunted, and traded using bronze coins. = Subsistence and agriculture = The Chim√∫ developed mainly through intensive farming techniques and hydraulic work, which joined valleys to form complexes, such as the Chicama-Moche complex, which was a combination of two valleys in La Libertad. The Lambayeque linked the valleys of La Leche, Lambayeque, Reque, and Sa√±a Jequetepeque. They developed an excellent agricultural techniques which expanded the strength of their cultivated areas. Huachaques were sunken farms where land was withdrawn to work the moist, sandy soil underneath, an example of which is Tschudi. Museum of the Americas, Madrid The Chim√∫ used walk-in wells, similar to those of the Nazca, to draw water, and reservoirs to contain the water from rivers. This system increased the productivity of the land, which increased Chim√∫ wealth, and likely contributed to the formation of a bureaucratic system. The Chim√∫ cultivated beans, sweet potato, papaya, and cotton with their reservoir and irrigation system. This focus on large-scale irrigation persisted until the Late Intermediate period. At this point, there was a shift to a more specialized system that focused on importing and redistributing resources from satellite communities.Mosely, Michael E., and Kent C. Day. 1982. Chan Chan: Andean desert city. 1st ed. United States of America: School of American Research. There appears to have been a complex network of sites that provided goods and services for Chim√∫ subsistence. Many of these sites produced commodities that the Chim√∫ could not. Many sites relied on marine resources, but after the advent of agriculture, there were more sites further inland, where marine resources were harder to attain. Keeping llamas arose as a supplemental way of attaining meat, but by the Late Intermediate period and Late Horizon, inland sites used llamas as a main resource, although they maintained contact with coastal sites to use supplemental marine resources. They also made masks. Technology One of the earliest known examples of distance communication is a Chim√∫ device consisting of two resin-coated gourds connected by a 75-foot length of twine. Only one example has been found, and nothing is known about its originator or use.Baldwin, Neil. \\"Can You Hear Me Now?\\" Smithsonian, Dec 2013: 66-67.  Split inheritance  The Chimu capital, Chan Chan, had a series of elite residential compounds or cuidadelas that were not occupied simultaneously, but sequentially. The reason for this is that Chimu rulers practiced split inheritance, which dictated that the heir to the throne had to build his own palace. After the death of a ruler, all the ruler's wealth would be distributed to more distant relatives.  Visual arts  = Shell = The Chim√∫ people highly valued mollusk shell for its economic and political significance as a luxury good traded over long distances, and the shell was often viewed as a symbol of elite status and divine power. Using shell as a medium for their art and artifacts, the Chim√∫ frequently employed the shell of Spondylus, a type of marine bivalve mollusk. The most abundant Spondylus species present in Peru are Spondylus calcifer Carpenter and Spondylus princeps Broderip. Spondylus calcifer has red and white hues, primarily used for beads and artifacts. While this species resides in shallower waters and is easier to obtain, the Spondylus princeps, known as the ‚Äúthorny oyster‚Äù for its characteristic spines, is a solid red color and can only be harvested by experienced divers. Thus, this shell is more highly desired and traded by the Chim√∫ people.  Uses and symbolism  Chim√∫ collar, twelfth-fourteenth century, made of Spondylus beads, stone beads, and cotton - Metropolitan Museum of Art Spondylus shell had a wide variety of uses in Andean culture and took a variety of forms, ranging from whole shells to fragments to ground shell powder. This material was worked to create intricately carved ornaments, tools, and goods reserved for the nobles and deities. Shell fragments have been found as inlays for body ornaments and as beads for pieces of jewelry. The image to the right displays a Chim√∫ collar made of cotton, red Spondylus shell beads, and black stone beads, and the image below displays a sling shot made of shell. Representing wealth and power, the shell was ground into powder and spread out before the Chimor king by an official called the Fonga Sigde, forming a ‚Äúred carpet‚Äù for the ruler as he walked. Shell were likewise used for ornamentation of certain buildings and architectural structures. Found in the tombs of nobles, these artifacts were often used as burial goods and played a role in sacrificial practices. Due to its aquatic origins, shells were prized for their connection to the sea and role in water and fertility rituals, used as offerings in agricultural fields to promote abundant crop yields. The Chim√∫ also placed shells in sources of water, such as wells and springs, to bring rain to their fields, especially in times of drought. Chim√∫ or Chancay sling shot with shells made of shell, wool, cotton, and beads - fourteenth-fifteenth century - Metropolitan Museum of Art The symbolic significance of the Spondylus shell is closely related to the physical attributes and biological properties of the bivalve. Its characteristic morphology contributed to the association of the shell with divine power and the supernatural world. The external spines of Spondylus lend to the shell its ties to strength and protection. Because of its shape and red blood-like color, the shell often represents death, sacrifice, and ritual bloodletting practices, as well as female reproductive body parts. Known as the \\"daughter of the sea,\\" the Spondylus shell has also been linked to femininity, with the univalve embodying masculinity. Spondylus has specialized sensory organs, in particular sensitive eyes and papillae, that Andean cultures associate with extra sensory protection. Sensitive to temperature changes in water and thriving in warmer waters, the shell was thought to have divinatory powers, and because its migratory patterns are related to El Ni√±o conditions, its presence is seen as an omen for disaster. Moreover, Spondylus exhibits seasonal toxicity, known as Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). Twice a year, the mollusk tissue contains substances that are toxic to humans, caused by poisonous algae that the mollusks consume. During these months, the shells are offered to weather and fertility deities as ‚Äúfood for the gods‚Äù, as it was thought that only deities were powerful enough to eat the flesh of the bivalve. At tolerable levels, human consumption of this toxic flesh may result in muscle weakness, mind-altering states, and euphoria, but in more concentrated doses, may lead to paralysis and death. Because of these hallucinogenic effects, Spondylus was a symbol of spiritual transcendence and was viewed as bridge between physical and supernatural worlds.  Diving  Chim√∫ or Lambayeque earspool, Late Intermediate Period, Central Andes, made of gold-copper alloy and silver alloy - Michael C. Carlos Museum Though the remains of shell workshops and artifacts are abundant in Chimor, the Spondylus shell originates in the warm waters of Ecuador. Harvesting the shell is both a time and labor-intensive process, requiring experienced divers to free dive to depths of up to 50 meters and pry the shells off of rocks. The difficult task of shell diving is captured in the imagery of many portable Andean artifacts, such as bowls, earspools, and textiles. Many of these images are similar, illustrating a boat with sailors holding cords attached to the divers in the water. Stone weights are suspended from the divers as they gather shells, and portrayals of Spondylus often emphasize their characteristic spines. The image to the right features a Chim√∫ earspool, which was molded from gold-copper and silver alloys and depicts a shell diving scene. The rectangle in the upper half of the earspool is a boat with large sails, and birds reside at the top of the piece. Four divers swim beneath the boat and are near spiky eggshell-shaped shells. Sections of ciudadelas, large compounds often reserved for the kings and elite individuals, were used as storage areas for shell artifacts, and the architecture and ornamentation of these structures symbolize the treasures of the sea. Los Buceadores (the Divers), a relief in Chan Chan in Ciudadela Uhle, displays imagery of a pair of figures in a tule boat, one of whom holds a paddle, and another pair of shell divers beneath the boat and connected to ropes. The relief also features a net-like semicircle, as well as spiny figures that represent shells.  Production and trade  Andean civilizations of the Late Intermediate Period Much of the existing evidence for shell-working in the Andes stems from archaeological findings and colonial texts. Spondylus is abundant in sites across Peru, discovered in burial sites and with the remains of shell workshops. The high level of uniformity in these shell objects, combined with the technical nature of shell-working, indicate that Spondylus production was domestic and carried out by independent craftsmen. Many collections of Spondylus artifacts contain objects from various stages of shell production: whole shells, fragments, worked pieces, and debris from shell reduction. Though researchers have uncovered worked shell debris and ample proof for the presence of shell workshops, they have only identified and discussed very few specific shell workshops. One workshop, which was thought to be maintained by the Chim√∫ people, was identified at T√∫cume in the Lambayeque Region of Peru by archaeologist and researcher Daniel Sandweiss. Dating back to around 1390-1480 A.D., the workshop comprised various small rooms and contained evidence for the production of Spondylus beads. Shell debris from all stages of production, ranging from cut pieces to finished beads, along with the stone tools used to work the shell, were excavated from the site. Chim√∫ pendant, 900-1470 AD, made of Spondylus shell and turquoise - Dumbarton Oaks While many archaeological sources point to the abundance of shell-working, as the remains of shell workshops and artifacts were uncovered widely in Peru, little evidence documents the movement of Spondylus from its source in Ecuador to workshops in Chan Chan. The archaeological record indicates that Chimor was an important center for the exchange of trade, and shell often traveled long distances from its geographic source to reach the empire of Chimor. The trade of Spondylus was integral to the expanding political power and economy of the Chim√∫. The shell was viewed as an exotic material, and the Chimor control of the exchange of the imported luxury good served as a means of political control, establishing and legitimizing the rule of the nobles. Unlike the Inca Empire, the Chim√∫ did not attempt to expand its command of the Spondylus trade through imperial conquests of neighboring states, but rather, used its existing access to the trade as a religious and financial justification for power. Little information exists about the means by which Spondylus was acquired and exchanged along trade routes, and many scholars have proposed various models for Spondylus movement. The marine bivalve was likely traded either through independent merchants or state-administered long-distance trade, with a north- south movement of the items. One of the first accounts of exchange of Spondylus is a report written by Spanish colonist Francisco Xerez, who was a member of the expedition led by Francisco Pizarro, and describes a raft of luxury goods, such as textiles, emeralds, and gold and silver objects, which were to be traded for Spondylus shells. Researchers likewise disagree on the transportation methods of shells and whether they were exported via sea or land. Imagery in Andean pottery and reliefs depict llama caravans carrying shell, providing evidence that the transportation of shell was at least in part overland. = Textiles = Spinning is the practice of combining a small set of threads to achieve a long and continuous thread with the use of an instrument called a spindle. The zone is an instrument made of a small wand that usually gets thinner at both ends; that was used alongside a tortera or piruro. The spindle is inserted into the bottom to make a counterweight. It starts spinning, taking the rueca (where the fiber was set to be spun). Fibers that are laid down in the zone are quickly turned between the thumb and index fingers and twisted to interlock the fibers, creating a long thread. After the desired lengths of threads are attained, the threads are intersected and woven in various combinations to make fabrics. The Chim√∫ embellished their fabrics with brocades, embroidery, fabrics doubles, and painted fabrics. Sometimes textiles were adorned with feathers and gold or silver plates. Tropical feathers used in such textiles are evidence of long-distance trade. Colored dyes were created from plants containing tannin, mole, or walnut; and minerals, such as clay, ferruginosa, or mordant aluminum; as well as from animals, such as cochineal. The garments were made of the wool of four animals: the guanaco, llama, alpaca, and vicuna. The people also used varieties of cotton, that grows naturally in seven different colors. The clothing consisted of the Chim√∫ loincloth, sleeveless shirts with or without fringes, small ponchos, and tunics. The majority of Chim√∫ textiles were made from alpaca wool and cotton. Judging from the uniform spin direction, degree of the twist, and colors of the threads, it is likely that all of the fibers were pre-spun and imported from a single location.mantle, Late Intermediate Period, 1250-1350, Camelid fiber and cotton tapestry weave - Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA)664x664pxcenter = Ceramics = The civilisation is kknown for its exquisite and intricate metalworking, one of the most advanced of the pre-Columbian era. Chim√∫ ceramics were crafted for two functions: containers for daily domestic use and those made for ceremonial use for offerings at burials. Domestic pottery was developed without higher finishing, while funeral ceramics show more aesthetic refinement. Earthenware jar, between 1100 and 1550 - Walters Art Museum The main features of Chim√∫ ceramics were small sculptures, and manufacturing molded and shaped pottery for ceremonial or daily use. Ceramics were usually stained black, although there are some variations. Lighter ceramics were also produced in smaller quantities. The characteristic brightness was obtained by rubbing with a rock that previously had been polished. Many animals, fruits, characters, and mystical entities have been represented pictorially on Chim√∫ ceramics. Archaeological evidence suggest that Chimor grew out of the remnants of the Moche, as early Chim√∫ pottery had some resemblance to that of the Moche. Their ceramics are all black, and their work in precious metals is very detailed and intricate. = Metallurgy = Chim√∫ beaker with face, Central Andes, 1100‚Äì1536 A.D., made of hammered silver - Yale University Art Gallery Metalworking picked up quickly in the Late Chim√∫ periods. The Chim√∫ worked with metals such as gold, silver, and copper. Some Chim√∫ artisans worked in metal workshops divided into sections for each specialized treatment of metals: plating, gold, stamping, lost-wax, pearl, the watermark, and embossing wooden molds. These techniques produced large variety of objects, such as cups, knives, containers, figurines, bracelets, pins, and crowns. They used arsenic to harden the metals after they were cast. Large-scale smelting took place in a cluster of workshops at Cerro de los Cemetarios. The process starts with ore extracted from mines or a river, which is heated to very high temperatures and then cooled. The result is a group of prills, such as small round sections of copper, in a mass of slag, which are other materials which are not useful for metallurgy. The prills are then extracted by crushing the slag, and then melted together to form ingots, which were fashioned into various items. The Chim√∫ also shaped metals through hammering, as displayed in the image on the right of the silver Chim√∫ beaker. Chim√∫ metalsmiths achieved this technique with simple tools and a single sheet of gold. The artist would first carve a wooden mold. Then they would carefully hammer the paper-thin sheet of gold around the wooden base.Emmerich, Andr√©. \\"IV: The Horizon of the City Builders.\\" In Sweat of the Sun and Tears of the Moon: Gold and Silver in Pre- Columbian Art. Seat tle: University of Washington Press, 1965. Although copper is found naturally on the coast, it was mostly attained from the highlands in an area about 3 days away. Since most of the copper was imported, it is likely that most of the metal objects that were made were likely very small. The pieces, such as wires, needles, digging stick points, tweezers, and personal ornaments, are consistently small, utilitarian objects of copper or copper bronze. The Tumi is one well-known Chim√∫ work. They also made beautiful ritual costumes of gold compounds with plume headdresses, earrings, necklaces, bracelets, and breastplates.  Religion  Deities In Pacasmayo, the Moon deity (Si or Shi) was the greatest divinity. It was believed to be more powerful than the Sun, as it appeared by night and day, and it also controlled the weather and growth of crops. Devotees sacrificed animals and birds to the Moon, as well as their own children on piles of colored cottons with offerings of fruit and chicha. They believed the sacrificed children would become deified and they were usually sacrificed around age five.Chim√∫ gold plaque, displays god Naymlap on his boat - Lombards Historical Society MuseumThe Chim√∫ worshipped Mars (Nor) and Earth (Ghisa) deities, as well as the Sun (Jiang) and the Sea (Ni) deities. Jiang was associated with stones called alaec-pong (cacique stone), which were believed to be ancestors of the people in whose area they stood and sons of the Sun. The Chim√∫ made offerings of maize flour of red ochre to Ni for protection against drowning and bountiful catches of fish. Several constellations were also viewed as important. Two of the stars of Orion's Belt were considered to be the emissaries of the Moon. The constellation Fur (the Pleiades) was used to calculate the year and was believed to watch over the crops. Each district had local shrines that varied in importance. These shrines, called huacas, were also found in other parts of Peru, and had a sacred object of worship (macyaec) with an associated legend and cult. Sacrifice In 1997, members of an archaeological team discovered approximately 200 skeletal remains on the beach at Punta Lobos, Peru. These figures were blindfolded and had their hands bound behind their backs, their feet bound together, and their throats slashed. Archaeologists suggest these figures, likely bodies of fishermen, may have been killed as a sign of gratitude to the sea god Ni after they conquered the fishermen's fertile seaside valley in 1350 A.D. Tombs in the Huaca of the Moon belonged to six or seven teenagers from 13‚Äì14 years of age. Nine tombs belonged to children. In 2011, archaeologists uncovered human and animal skeletons in the village of Huanchaco. After years of excavation, they identified more than 140 human (and more than 200 llama) skeletons from children between the ages of 6 and 15, all of whom had deep slashes across the sternum and broken rib cages indicating that their hearts may have been removed. According to National Geographic, if the analysis is correct, the discovery constitutes \\"the largest single mass child sacrifice event known in world history\\". The burial is dated at 1400-1450 A.D. Anthropologist Haagen Klaus speculates that Chim√∫ might have turned to children when the sacrifice of adults was not enough to stop torrential rain and flooding caused by El Ni√±o. In August 2019 the archaeological team working at this site revealed that the bodies of 227 victims, aged between four and 14, had been excavated, further establishing this as the largest-ever known example of child sacrifice.  Architecture  Carvings of fish in the Tschudi Complex, Chan Chan Differential architecture of palaces and monumental sites distinguished the rulers from the common people. At Chan Chan, there are ten large, walled enclosures called ciudadelas, or royal compounds, thought to be associated with the kings of Chimor. They are surrounded by adobe walls that are nine meters high,Moore, Jerry D. 1992. Pattern and meaning in prehistoric Peruvian architecture: The architecture of social control in the Chim√∫ state. Latin American Antiquity 3, (2) (Jun.): 95-113. giving the ciudadela the appearance of a fortress. The bulk of the Chim√∫ population (approximately 26,000 people) lived in barrios on the outer edge of the city. They consisted of many single-family domestic spaces with a kitchen, work space, domestic animals, and storage area. Ciudadelas frequently have U-shaped rooms that consist of three walls, a raised floor, and frequently, a courtyard,Topic, J. R. (2003). From stewards to bureaucrats: architecture and information flow at Chan Chan, Peru. Latin American Antiquity, 14, 243-274. and there were often as many as 15 in one palace. In the early Chim√∫ period, the U-shaped areas were found in strategic places for controlling the flow of supplies from storerooms, but it is unlikely that they served as storage areas. They are described as mnemonic devices for keeping track of the distribution of supplies. Over time, the frequency of the U-shaped structures increased, and the distribution of the structures changed, becoming more grouped, rather than dispersed, and occurring further away from access routes to resources. The architecture of the rural sites also supported the idea of a hierarchical social order. They have similar structural components, making them mini-ciudadelas with rural adapted administrative functions. Most of these sites have smaller walls, with many audiencias as the focal point of the structures. These would be used to restrict access to certain areas and are often found at strategic points.Keatinge, Richard W. 1974. Chimu rural administrative centers in the Koche valley, peru. World Archaeology 6, (1, Political Systems) (Jun.): 66-82. Chan Chan shows a lack of a unifying plan or a discernible pattern.

He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003, and served as a cabinet minister in the government of Mike Harris. Background His father, Gordon Gilchrist, was a Progressive Conservative member of the House of Commons of Canada. Gilchrist was educated at Queen's University, receiving a Bachelor of Commerce degree in 1975. Prior to entering elected office, he operated a number of Canadian Tire franchise stores from 1971 to 1995, including one of the largest stores in the chain. Gilchrist was involved in several other business ventures, including the construction of a shopping centre (The Town & Country Centre) in Cobourg, Ontario in 1989. Politics Active in the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party since 1970, Gilchrist first ran for the Ontario legislature in the 1990 provincial election in the riding of Scarborough East, but placed third behind incumbent Liberal Ed Fulton and the winner, New Democrat Bob Frankford. Later that year, he was elected third vice president of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party. Two years later, he was elected, unanimously, as president of party and served from 1992 to 1994, succeeding Tony Clement. From 1990 to 1994, Gilchrist hosted various cable television shows on Trillium Cable in Scarborough. The Tories won a majority government in the 1995 election under Mike Harris. In a rematch from 1990, Gilchrist easily defeated Frankford by almost 12,000 votes, the highest plurality of any Toronto riding. He was immediately elected chair of the Standing Committee on Resources Development and he was named a parliamentary assistant to the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing in 1997. Gilchrist was re-elected in the 1999 provincial election, defeating Liberal candidate Peter Vanderyagt by about 3,500 votes. On June 17, 1999, Gilchrist was named Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, but stepped aside to defend himself from allegations by the development industry in October 1999 after he had announced his intention to ban all development on the Oak Ridges Moraine. The allegations were proved to be unfounded and he was exonerated, but was not returned to cabinet. Shortly thereafter, he was appointed as co-chair of the Red Tape Commission and as a Commissioner on the Board of Internal Economy, the all-party committee that oversees the operation of the Ontario Parliament building. While serving as a cabinet minister, Gilchrist was responsible for co-ordinating the forced amalgamation of municipal governments in Ottawa, Hamilton and Sudbury. The political debate on the future of the Oak Ridges Moraine also began during his tenure. He remained active on the file after his resignation until the passage of the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act in 2001.http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&BillID;=866&ParlSessionID;=37:2&isCurrent;=false, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2001 Gilchrist was elected as Chair of the Standing Committee on General Government and, on April 25, 2002, he was appointed as parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Energy and Environment. On June 28, 2001, Gilchrist was put in charge of a commission looking into alternative fuel sources. In the same year, he backed Jim Flaherty's unsuccessful bid to succeed Mike Harris as party leader. In 2002, he was appointed as the first commissioner of alternative energy for the province of Ontario, a position he held until December 2003. During his time in office, Gilchrist introduced many private member's bills which were passed into law, including Bill 20, the Good Samaritans Act of 2001http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&BillID;=935&ParlSessionID;=37:2&isCurrent;=false, Bill 20. This act guarantees protects anyone who competently attempts to give first aid or render other medical assistance is protected from any legal liability. In December 2001, Gilchrist's youngest sister underwent a successful heart transplant and, in response to the significant waiting times faced by patients hoping for organ donation, on May 5, 2003, Gilchrist introduced Bill 17, the Organ or Tissue Donation Statute Law Amendment Act, 2003.http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&BillID;=1240&ParlSessionID;=37:4&isCurrent;=false, Bill 17 The bill would have required anyone obtaining a provincial license or health card to complete an organ donation form and would have prevented any other person from overturning the decision of the donor, after death. Other private member's bill's which were passed into law included Bill 172, the Toronto Hospital Act, 1997,http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&BillID;=1640&ParlSessionID;=36:1&isCurrent;=false, Bill 172. which merged the Toronto Hospital and the Ontario Cancer Institute, at their request; Bill 110, the Professional Foresters Act, 2000;http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&BillID;=654&BillStagePrintId;=1195&btnSubmit;=go, Bill 110 and the Act that created the Ontario Association of Former Parliamentarians, Bill 65, the Ontario Association of Former Parliamentarians Act, 2000.http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&BillID;=571&BillStagePrintId;=1050&btnSubmit;=go, Bill 65 He also introduced Bills which would have raised the minimum smoking age in Ontario, formally designated the August Civic Holiday as \\"Simcoe Day', prevented the demolition of any buildings designated as \\"heritage buildings\\" and one which would have required the paying of Ontario income tax on the benefits received by federal Senators and Members of Parliament. His most notable bill was Bill 17, the Ontario Natural Heritage Act, 2002,http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&BillID;=932&isCurrent;=false&detailPage;=bills_detail_about, Bill 17 which became the basis of the government bill, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act, 2002, which put in place the long-term protection for the Oak Ridges Moraine. He lost his seat in the 2003 provincial election, falling to Liberal Mary Anne Chambers by almost 7,000 votes. In addition to his public activism within the PC Party and as a Member of Provincial Parliament, Gilchrist was very active in the community, serving as a governor of the Central Ontario YMCAs for 11 years; vice-chair of the Rouge Park Alliance; director of the Oak Ridges Moraine Foundation; director of the Oak Ridge Moraine Land Trust; director of the East Scarborough Boys & Girls Club and a member of a number of local ratepayers associations in Scarborough. For over twenty years, Gilchrist annually funded \\"Gilchrist Science Scholarships\\" at the University of Toronto Scarborough and various local high schools. =Cabinet positions= After politics After the election, Gilchrist became involved with a wide range of projects and companies involved in different forms of renewable energy generation. He became the Vice-President of Canadian Hydrogen Energy Company, the world's largest manufacturer of hydrogen-based emissions reduction and fuel saving devices. In 2007, he was elected as a director of the National Hydrogen Association, in Washington, D.C., and has served as a special advisor to the board of Skypower Ltd., one of Canada's largest wind and solar power companies. He also developed a company which has worked with governments in Africa, the Caribbean, South America and Asia to raise awareness of biomass-to-energy power generation opportunities. From 2001 to 2011, Gilchrist served as a Director and then Vice-President of the Oak Ridges Moraine Land Trust, a volunteer organization whose goal is to place conservation easements over private and publicly held land on the Oak Ridges Moraine. Since 2005, Gilchrist has also served as a director of the Ontario Association of Former Parliamentarians and, in August 2015, he was elected as the Chair of that organization. He has been active in a wide range of media, including serving as the alternate host for Politically Speaking on Rogers Television in Durham Region, a frequent guest of TV shows such as the Michael Coren Show on CTS and a contributor of many newspaper articles dealing with environmental and energy topics. In June 2007, Gilchrist was nominated as the Conservative Party of Canada's candidate in Ajax‚ÄîPickering for the next federal election. In March 2008, Gilchrist announced that he was stepping down as the candidate in order to return his full attention to his alternative energy business interests, including a proposed waste-to-energy facility in Ghana and an advanced recycling technology for municipalities in Canada.Abbas Rana, \\"Tory candidate in Ajax- Pickering, Ont. steps down\\", The Hill Times, April 14, 2008.

Heraclius died in 1798, leaving the throne to his moribund heir, George XII.  Early years  Erekle II in childhood wearing Chokha. Monument of Erekle II in Telavi. = Service under Nader Shah = Born in Telavi, the center of Kakheti region of Georgia, Heraclius was a son of Teimuraz II of Kakheti and his wife Tamar, daughter of Vakhtang VI of Kartli. His childhood and early teens coincided with the occupation of Kakheti by the Ottomans from 1732 until 1735, when they were ousted from Georgia by Nader Shah of Iran, in his two successive campaigns of 1734 and 1735, by which the latter quickly reestablished Persian rule over Georgia. Teimuraz sided with the Persians and was installed as a Persian vali (governor) in Kakheti, while Kilij Ali-Khan (Khanjal) was made that of neighboring Kartli. However, many Georgian nobles refused to accept the new regime and rose in rebellion in response to heavy tribute levied by Nader upon the Georgian provinces. Nonetheless, Teimuraz and Heraclius remained loyal to the shah, partly in order to prevent the comeback of the rival Mukhrani branch, whose fall early in the 1720s had opened the way to Teimuraz's accession in Kartli. From 1737 to 1739, Heraclius commanded a Georgian auxiliary force during Nader's expedition in India and gained a reputation of an able military commander.David Marshall Lang. Russia and the Armenians of Transcaucasia, 1797-1889: a documentary record Columbia University Press, 1957 (digitalised March 2009, originally from the University of Michigan) p 142 He then served as a lieutenant to his father and assumed the regency when Teimuraz was briefly summoned for consultations in the Persian capital of Isfahan in 1744. In the meantime, Heraclius defeated a coup attempt by the rival Georgian prince Abdullah Beg of the Mukhrani dynasty and helped Teimuraz suppress the aristocratic opposition to the Persian hegemony led by Givi Amilakhvari. As a reward, Nader granted the kingship of Kartli to Teimuraz and of Kakheti to Heraclius in 1744, and also arranged the marriage of his nephew Ali-Qoli Khan, who eventually would succeed him as Adil Shah, to Teimuraz's daughter Kethevan. =Nader's death and reign in Kakheti= Yet, both Georgian kingdoms remained under heavy Persian tribute until Nader was assassinated in 1747. Teimuraz and Heraclius took advantage of the ensuing political instability in Persia to assert their independence and expelled Persian garrisons from all key positions in Georgia, including Tbilisi. In close cooperation with each other, they managed to prevent a new revolt by the Mukhranian supporters fomented by Ebrahim Khan, brother of Adel Shah, in 1748. They concluded an anti-Persian alliance with the khans of Azerbaijan who were particularly vulnerable to the aggression from Persian warlords and agreed to recognize Heraclius's supremacy in eastern Transcaucasia. In 1749, he occupied Yerevan, and in June 1751, Heraclius defeated a large army commanded by a pretender to the Persian throne and his former ally, Azat-Khan in the Battle of Kirkhbulakh. After these particular events, Heraclius could largely afford to ignore the changing situation to the south of the Aras River. In 1752, the Georgian kings sent a mission to Russia to request 3,000 Russian troops or a subsidy to enable them to hire Circassian mercenaries in order to invade Persia and install a pro-Russian government there. The embassy failed to yield any results, however, for the Russian court was preoccupied with European affairs.

Around the same time, it had become apparent that Mashhad, a minor Afsharid remnant, was no longer functioning as the seat of the Iranian government. In 1762, Teimuraz II died while on a diplomatic mission to the court of St. Petersburg, and Heraclius succeeded him as King of Kartli, thus uniting eastern Georgia politically for the first time in three centuries. In 1762-1763, during Karim Khan Zand's campaigns in Azerbaijan, Erekle II tendered his de jure submission to him and received his investiture as vali (\\"governor\\", \\"viceroy\\") of Gorjestan (Georgia), the traditional Safavid office, which by this time however had become an \\"empty honorific\\". = Alliance with Russia = In foreign policy, Heraclius was primarily focused on seeking a reliable protector that would guarantee Georgia's survival. He chose Russia not only because it was Orthodox Christian, but in Lang's account also because it would serve as a link to Europe, which he thought a model for Georgia's development as a modern nation. Yet, Heraclius's initial cooperation with Russia proved disappointing. His participation in the Russo-Turkish War (1768‚Äì1774) did not lead to an anticipated reconquest of the Ottoman-held southern Georgian lands, for the Russian commanders in Georgia behaved in a highly condescending, often treacherous way, and Empress Catherine II treated the Caucasus front as merely a secondary theater of military operations. Still, Heraclius continued to seek firmer alliance with Russia, his immediate motivation being the Persian ruler Karim Khan's attempts to bring Georgia back into the Persian sphere of influence. Karim Khan's death in 1779 temporarily relieved Heraclius of these dangers, as Persia again became engulfed in chaos. In 1783, the Russian expansion southward into the Crimea brought the Caucasus into Catherine II's area of interest. In the Treaty of Georgievsk of 1783, Heraclius finally obtained the guarantees he had sought from Russia, transforming Georgia into a Russian protectorate, as Heraclius formally repudiated all legal ties to Persia and placed his foreign policy under the Russian supervision. However, during the Russo-Turkish War (1787‚Äì1792), a Tbilisi-based small Russian force evacuated Georgia, leaving Heraclius to face new dangers from Persia alone. In 1790 Heraclius concluded the Treaty of the Iberians with western Georgian polities. = Qajar invasion = Mohammad Khan Qajar, who had managed to bring most of central Iranian plateau under his firm control by 1794, was inclined to revive the Persian Empire with the Caucasus again as its part. In 1795, after a swift reconquest of much of southeastern Caucasus, he demanded that Heraclius reacknowledged Persian suzerainty, promising in return to confirm him as vali. Heraclius refused, and in September 1795, the Persian army of 35,000 moved into Georgia. After the valiant defense of Tbilisi at the Battle of Krtsanisi, in which the king participated personally in the advance guard, Heraclius's small army of 5000 men was almost completely annihilated and Tbilisi completely sacked. While becoming a witness of the fearful devastation of his capital and slaughter of its civilians, king Heraclius, who did not want to leave the battlefield and the city was spirited away by the very last of his bodyguards and a few family members. The Persian invasion delivered a hard blow to Georgia from which it was not able to recover. Despite being abandoned at the critical moment, he still had to rely on belated Russian support and fought, in 1796, alongside the Russian expeditionary forces sent by Catherine into the Persian territories. But her death that year brought an abrupt change of policy in the Caucasus, and her successor Paul I again withdrew all Russian troops from the region. Agha Mohammad launched his second campaign to punish the Georgians for their alliance with Russia. However, his assassination in 1797 spared Kartli-Kakheti more devastation. = Coinage = Erekle II's \\"curiously ambivalent position\\" in these decades is reflected in the coins issued by him in his realm. Silver coins were struck with the name of Ismail III on it, or with the Zand-style inscription ya karim (\\"O Gracious One\\"), whereby an epithet to God was invoked, which actually referred to Karim Khan Zand. These coins were minted in Tbilisi up until 1799 ‚Äì some twenty years after Karim Khan Zand's death. In the same decades, the copper coins struck at Tbilisi bore three types of iconography; Christian, Georgian, \\"and even\\" Imperial Russian (such as the double-headed eagle). By minting the silver coins with a reference to Karim Khan Zand on it they were usable for trade in Iran, whereas the copper coins, struck for only local use, reflected Erekle II's political orientation towards Russia. = Court, efforts and final years = While maintaining certain Persian-type pomp at his court, he launched an ambitious program of \\"Europeanization\\" which was supported by the Georgian intellectual √©lites, but was not overwhelmingly successful because Georgia remained physically isolated from Europe and had to expend all available resources on defending its precarious independence. He strove to enlist the support of European powers and to attract Western scientists and technicians to give his country the benefit of the latest military and industrial techniques. His style of governing resembled that of contemporary enlightened despots in Central Europe. He exercised executive, legislative, and judicial authority and closely supervised the activities of government departments. Heraclius's primary objective in internal policy was to further centralize the government through reducing the powers of the aristocracy. For this purpose, he attempted to create a governing √©lite composed of his own agents to replace the self-minded aristocratic lords in local affairs. At the same time, he encouraged peasant-vassals to supply the military force necessary to overcome the aristocracy's resistance and protect the country from incessant marauding assaults from Dagestan known to Georgians as Lekianoba. In the words of the British historian David Marshall Lang, \\"his vigilance in the care of his people knew no bounds. On campaign, he would sit up at night watching for the enemy, while in time of peace, he spent his life in transacting business of state or in religious exercise, and devoted but a few hours to sleep.\\"Lang, David Marshall (1962). A Modern History of Georgia, p. 35-6. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. Heraclius died in 1798 still convinced that only Russian protection could ensure the continued existence of his country. He was succeeded by his weak and sickly son, George XII, after whose death Tsar Paul I annexed, in 1801, Kartli-Kakheti to Russia, terminating both Georgia's independence and a millennium-long rule of the Bagrationi Dynasty.  Family  The tomb of Heraclius II in Svetitskhoveli cathedral. Heraclius II was married three times; first, he married Princess Ketevan n√©e Orbeliani in 1738 or Princess Ketevan n√©e Mkheidze in 1740.Montgomery-Massingbird, Hugh, editor. Burke's Royal Families of the World, Volume II, 1980. The Royal House of Georgia, p.66-69.. According to a relatively recently established version, Princess Orbeliani was repudiated by Heraclius before the marriage actually took place. Instead, he married Princess Mkheidze, who died in 1744. Of his first marriage, Heraclius two children: *Vakhtang (b. 1742 ‚Äì d.

In 2007, he was regarded by the national broadcaster as \\"the greatest swimmer in Canadian history\\", as the twin Olympic gold medals were Canada's first in swimming since 1912. Since he retired from competitive swimming, he has worked as an administrator in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Early years Born in Prague (former Czechoslovakia), Baumann was raised in Canada after his family moved there in 1969 following the Prague Spring. The family settled in Sudbury, Ontario, where, at the age of nine, Baumann became involved in competitive swimming, training at Laurentian University. Olympic career By the time he was seventeen, Baumann owned 38 Canadian swimming records and the world record in the 200-metre individual medley. He accepted a swimming scholarship and entered Indiana University to train under its legendary coach James \\"Doc\\" Counsilman; however with chronic pain in his shoulder, he made the decision to return to Sudbury to continue physical therapy and training under the direction of his long-time coach, Dr. Jeno Tihanyi. Forced to sit out the 1982 World Aquatic Championships in Ecuador due to his injury, Baumann's training progressed enough that he was able to win gold in both 200 and 400-metre individual medley events at the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, Australia, lowering his world record in the 200-metre event to 2:02.25 in the process. It was here that he met his future wife Australian swimmer Tracey Taggart. He also won the 400-metre individual medley event at the 1983 World University Games. Prior to the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Baumann's father died of complications from diabetes and his brother, Roman, died by suicide. Baumann persevered through these tragedies, as well as his lingering tendinitis and shoulder injuries, to enter the Olympics as one of Canada's best Olympic hopes. At the 1984 Olympics, Baumann was selected as Canada's flagbearer for the opening ceremonies. He won gold medals in the 400-metre individual medley, setting a world record time of 4:17.41, and the 200-metre race, lowering the world mark to 2:01.42. The 400-metre gold was Canada's first in swimming since 1912. Baumann continued his swimming career with three gold medals at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh in the two individual medley events, and swimming anchor on Canada's 4 √ó 100 m medley relay team. However, later that year, he won a silver and a bronze at the 1986 World Aquatics Championships in Madrid, Spain losing to a 19-year-old Hungarian swimmer, Tam√°s Darnyi. Baumann shared a close bond with his coach of 14 years, Dr. Jeno Tihanyi. After the 1984 Olympics, the two authored a book titled Swimming with Alex Baumann: A Program for Competitive and Recreational Swimmers. Sports administration Subsequent to the 1987 Pacific Championships in Australia, Baumann retired from competitive swimming, initially working with Canadian broadcaster CBC for the 1988 Olympics, and also returning to Sudbury as a coach until 1991. Some speculated that Baumann was unable to find a coaching position due to his outspokenness. He criticized the Canadian Olympic Committee for dismissing Don Talbot and replacing him with Dave Johnson, as it was widely alleged that Talbot was fired for refusing to put the daughter of a Committee member on the national team. Baumann also criticized Swimming Canada for its subpar performances at the Commonwealth Games in Auckland in 1990. =1996-2006: In Queensland Australia= Baumann moved to Australia to enter graduate studies at the University of Queensland before becoming manager of sport programs with the Queensland Academy of Sport between 1996 and 1997. He then held various positions with the Queensland Government before becoming CEO of Queensland Swimming in 1999. After a poor showing by Canada at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Baumann felt he had more to offer Canadian sport, and expressed interest in taking on the vacant leadership position at the Canadian Olympic Committee; however, the COC felt he did not have the business background to handle the job. Ultimately, Baumann was not offered the Canadian Olympic Committee position. This caused some controversy and criticism in Canada as many Canadian athletes and citizens felt he was the best choice for the job. A number of foreign sports organizations felt the same way, and he was courted heavily by the English Institute of Sport and the Queensland Academy of Sport, ultimately accepting the position of executive director for the Queensland Academy of Sport in 2002. In 2004, after a dismal showing by Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, in which they failed to medal and their best finish was sixth place, head coach Dave Johnson was fired. The COC offered Baumann the CEO or head coaching position of Swimming Canada (Karen Spierkel had resigned as CEO on 3 May 2003 after the controversy surrounding Jennifer Carroll waving a Quebec flag on the podium during the 2002 Commonwealth Games) but he turned both down, saying that he would remain with the Queensland Academy. Several commentators panned Baumann as hypocritical as he was publicly critical of the Canadian swim program for several years from 2000 to 2004, right up to the Athens Olympics. In response, Baumann toned down his criticism. =2006-2012: Head of Canada's Summer Olympic Program= On 27 September 2006, the Canadian Olympic Committee announced that Baumann was hired to take over Canada's Road to Excellence initiative beginning in January 2007. Canada had achieved mediocre results at the 2004 Athens Olympics with a tally of only 12 medals in all events, which resulted in an overall 21st place national showing. These poor results prompted much criticism from Canadians. At that time, Baumann announced a goal for Team Canada: a top 16 finish in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and a top 12 finish at the 2012 London Games. In the Beijing event, for the first time Canadian athletes were paid for medals earned. Gold medalists earned $20,000; silver medalists were paid $15,000; and bronze medalists $10,000. A total of $515,000 from the Athlete Excellence Fund was given to the medal winning athletes. At the Beijing Olympiad, Canada wound up finishing 19th in gold medals and 14th in total medals, and Baumann's methods were vindicated. In the 2012 London Olympic Games with the initiation of its \\"Own the Podium\\" programme, Canada finished 13th in total medals, thus improving on its performance in Beijing while falling somewhat short of its self-declared goal of 12th position. It finished the event with 18 medals: one gold, five silver and 12 bronze. =2012-2017: Head of High Performance Sport New Zealand= On 15 January 2012, High Performance Sport New Zealand announced the appointment of Baumann to the role of Chief Executive, effective 31 January 2012. Baumann resigned in June 2017 due to the desire to move back to Australia to be closer to his children and extended family. Whilst he was in this position at the 2016 Rio Olympics, New Zealand won 18 medals in nine different sports, of which four were gold. =Swimming Australia= In December 2017, Swimming Australia announced that it had appointed Baumann to the new role as Swimming Australia's Chief Strategist, High Performance. Awards and honours Baumann was named Canada's male athlete of the year for 1984 and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. He was also named as the Male World Swimmer of the Year by Swimming World magazine in the same year. In 1988, he was awarded the Order of Ontario. Baumann was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1999. Baumann was named Honorary Colonel of 412 VIP Transport Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force based in Ottawa in June 2011. In 2012, Baumann received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal. Personal life Baumann is married to Tracey Taggart, an Australian swimmer he met during the Brisbane 1982 Commonwealth Games. They married on 30 April 1988, and have two children: Tabitha and Ashton Baumann. In March 2009, Baumann swam at the Ontario Masters Swim Championships. It was his first swim meet in 22 years. He continued where he left off, beating the world record in the 200 metre individual medley in the 45-49 age group category by more than 3.3 seconds with a time of 2:12.01. On April 7, 2016 his son Ashton Baumann won the 200m breaststroke final at the Canadian Olympic Swimming Trials on April 7, finishing the race under the Olympic qualifying time, earning a spot on Canada's Olympic team.

In college, he was in a group known as the Travellers, and they sang in an off-campus coffeehouse.Tom Paxton, The Honor of Your Company (2000) pp. 18‚Äì19 Career =Early career= Upon graduating in 1959 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree, Paxton acted in summer stock theatre and briefly tried graduate school before joining the Army. While attending the Clerk Typist School in Fort Dix, New Jersey, he began writing songs on his typewriter and spent almost every weekend visiting Greenwich Village in New York City during the emerging early 1960s folk revival.Tom Paxton, The Honor of Your Company (2000) pp. 20‚Äì21. Shortly after his honorable discharge from the Army, Paxton auditioned for the Chad Mitchell Trio via publisher Milt Okun in 1960. He initially received the part, but his voice did not blend well enough with those of the group members. However, after singing his song \\"The Marvelous Toy\\" for Okun, he became the first writer signed to Milt's music publishing company, Cherry Lane Music Publishing.Tom Paxton, The Honor of Your Company (2000) p.22 Paxton soon began performing at The Gaslight Cafe in Greenwich Village, where he became a mainstay. In 1962, he recorded a privately produced live album at the Gaslight entitled, I'm the Man That Built the Bridges. During his stay in Greenwich Village, Paxton published some of his songs in the folk magazines Broadside and Sing Out!, and performed alongside such folksingers as Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs, Eric Andersen, Dave Van Ronk, and Mississippi John Hurt. Paxton met his future wife, Margaret Ann Cummings (known as \\"Midge\\"), at the Gaslight one night in January 1963 after being introduced to her by David Blue.Tom Paxton, The Honor of Your Company (2000) p.26 Pete Seeger picked up on a few of Paxton's songs in 1963, including \\"Ramblin' Boy\\" (which Seeger performed at The Weavers reunion concert at Carnegie Hall) and \\"What Did You Learn in School Today?\\" Paxton increased his profile as a performer, appearing at the 1963 Newport Folk Festival, which was recorded by Vanguard Records. A month after Newport in 1963, Paxton married Midge. He began traveling the country on the coffeehouse and small-venue circuit before returning to New York.Tom Paxton, The Honor of Your Company (2000) pp. 26‚Äì29. Paxton became involved with causes that promoted human rights, civil rights and labor rights. In 1963, Paxton and a group of other folk musicians performed and offered moral support to striking coal miners in Hazard, Kentucky. After returning to New York in 1964, Paxton signed with Elektra Records, a label which at that time featured a distinguished roster of folk musicians. He would go on to record seven albums for Elektra. As the folk revival hit its peak, Paxton began getting more work outside of New York City, including benefit concerts and college campus visits. In 1964, he took part in the Freedom Summer and visited the Deep South, with other folk musicians, to perform at voter registration drives and civil rights rallies. His civil rights song \\"Beau John\\" was written after attending a Freedom Song Workshop in Atlanta, Georgia, and the song \\"Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney\\" was written about the murders of three civil rights activists (Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner, and James Chaney) in the summer of 1964 by members of the Ku Klux Klan near Philadelphia, Mississippi. Paxton's own compositions began to be increasingly recognized within folk music circles, and in other genres. Of the songwriters on the Greenwich Village scene of the 1960s, Dave Van Ronk said, \\"Dylan is usually cited as the founder of the new song movement, and he certainly became its most visible standard-bearer, but the person who started the whole thing was Tom Paxton ... he tested his songs in the crucible of live performance, he found that his own stuff was getting more attention than when he was singing traditional songs or stuff by other people ... he set himself a training regimen of deliberately writing one song every day. Dylan had not yet showed up when this was happening, and by the time Bobby came on the set, with at most two or three songs he had written, Tom was already singing at least 50 percent his own material. That said, it was Bobby's success that really got the ball rolling. Prior to that, the folk community was very much tied to traditional songs, so much so that songwriters would sometimes palm their own stuff off as traditional.\\"Dave Van Ronk, The Mayor of MacDougal Street (2006) p. 197 In 1965, Paxton made his first tour of the United Kingdom. The tour was the beginning of a still-thriving professional relationship that has included yearly performances there. He met Bruce Woodley, one of the founding members of the Australian folk group The Seekers and they collaborated on the song \\"Angeline (Is Always Friday)\\" which The Seekers recorded and featured in their concerts, TV shows and a DVD. In 1967, the rock group Clear Light recorded a menacing and lengthy psychedelic version of Paxton's song \\"Mr. Blue\\" on their only album Clear Light. Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton's recording of \\"The Last Thing on My Mind\\" reached the top ten on the U.S. country singles charts in December 1967. Then in 1968, Paxton scored a Top 10 radio hit when The Fireballs recorded his song \\"Bottle of Wine\\". In the 1960s, Paxton licensed one of his songs, \\"My Dog's Bigger than Your Dog\\", for use in a Ken-L Ration dog food commercial. Not too fazed by the success of some of his songs, Paxton continued writing and performing. He was not interested in jumping on the folk rock (or, as he once joked, \\"folk rot\\"Tom Paxton, \\"Folk Rot\\", Sing Out! (Autumn 1965)) bandwagon though, and continued his folk singer-songwriter style on albums like Outward Bound (1966) and Morning Again (1968). On January 20, 1968, three months after the death of Woody Guthrie, Paxton and a number of other prominent folk musicians performed at the Harold Leventhal produced \\"A Tribute to Woody Guthrie\\" concert at New York City's Carnegie Hall. Paxton decided to try some more elaborate recording techniques, including neo-chamber music with string sections, flutes, horns, piano, various session musicians, as well as his acoustic guitar and vocals, similar to what his labelmate Judy Collins and his friend Phil Ochs were experimenting with around this time. Paxton finally broke into the album pop charts himself with The Things I Notice Now in the summer of 1969, and also charted with Tom Paxton 6 in the spring of the following year. His song \\"Whose Garden Was This,\\" an environmentalist anthem written for the first Earth Day, was later recorded by John Denver and became the title track of Denver's 1970 album. Another Paxton song Denver recorded was \\"Forest Lawn,\\" in whose lyrics Paxton satirized the \\"theme park approach\\" to death that Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California has been accused of having taken. The diverse \\"Baroque Folk\\" experimentation on Paxton's recordings was basically short-lived though, and he tended to think that the music was becoming too overproduced and away from the more natural acoustic roots that he loved best. Regarding this time, he said, \\"the acoustic guitar has always been what I loved the most ... I know I didn't have that rock mentality or anything. I was still a kid from a small town in Oklahoma. And I just wanted to hear folk songs.\\" Paxton continued to sing and perform his songs on acoustic guitar at his live performances, and it was not too long before his albums would once again generally reflect his original traditional-sounding style. =Middle career= Paxton, his wife and their two daughters lived in Holland Park, London, for about four years in the early 1970s. After a stay in England due to professional success and love of the country, Paxton and Midge went on a tour of New Zealand and China and even appeared on a Chinese talk show. Paxton released How Come the Sun in 1971. The album gave him his highest chart ranking in the U.S. but it only reached number 120 and his next album, Peace Will Come (1972), barely even reached the charts. He soon returned to New York City and the Long Island town of East Hampton before moving to the Washington, D.C. area around 1977. After recording three albums for Reprise Records and a few for \\"an English label that didn't pan out well\\",Tom Paxton, The Honor of Your Company (2000) p. 49 Paxton signed with Vanguard Records, with whom he recorded a live album with Steve Goodman, New Songs From the Briarpatch (1977), which contained some of Paxton's topical songs of the 1970s, including \\"Talking Watergate\\" and \\"White Bones of Allende\\" as well as a song dedicated to Mississippi John Hurt entitled \\"Did You Hear John Hurt?\\" In 1978, Paxton released his album Heroes, which contained a song, \\"Phil\\", about his friend Phil Ochs, who had taken his own life in 1976. The album also includes the song \\"The Death of Stephen Biko\\", which details the murder of anti-apartheid activist Stephen Biko in South Africa. Paxton's 1979 album, Up and Up, contains the song \\"Let the Sunshine\\", which addresses issues concerning environmentalism and solar energy. Paxton has also performed at the Clearwater Festival, an annual event, started by Pete Seeger, dedicated to environmentalism and cleaning up the Hudson River. His 1983 album Bulletin includes a song about Woody Guthrie entitled \\"They Couldn't Take the Music.\\"ArtistDirect, Tom Paxton: Bulletin. Retrieved November 14, 2007 After recording for labels such as Mountain Railroad and Flying Fish in the 1980s, Paxton started his own label, Pax Records, in 1987. It was during this time that Paxton continued to suffer from an undiagnosed and deepening depression that affected his work. With some advice from Midge, he began to look for a solution and was eventually diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder, for which he received ongoing treatment.Tom Paxton, The Honor of Your Company (2000) p. 50 =Later career= In the 1990s, Paxton began delving deeply into children's music, recording nine children's albums during the decade. In July 1994, Paxton was invited to perform at a folk festival in Israel, \\"Jacob's Ladder\\", and he played there and a series of concerts around Israel accompanied by folk guitarist and harmonica player Shay Tochner. Paxton recorded a live album in 1996 with his good friend Jim Rooney, and it contained some new comical songs about current events. Eric Weissberg, John Gorka, Robin and Linda Williams, among others, also performed; and the album was titled Live: For the Record. In the mid-1990s, Paxton also began to give more workshops in songwriting. In 2000, Paxton once again began to write more of the topical songs that had been prominent during his early career. In 2001, he released an album with Anne Hills entitled Under American Skies, and in 2002, he released an album of all new songs entitled Looking for the Moon (Appleseed Recordings). At the time of its release, Paxton was quoted saying that it might be his best album so far.Behind the Beat audio interview (2002) Looking for the Moon contains the song \\"The Bravest\\", which is about the firefighters who gave their lives while trying to save others in New York City on September 11, 2001. Around this time, Paxton began writing and releasing his \\"Short Shelf Life Songs\\" about current events for free download on his website.Short Shelf Life Songs ; accessed June 12, 2014. Paxton wrote a number of topical protest songs that were critical of the Bush administration's actions. In 2007, he rewrote a song of his from 1965 entitled \\"Lyndon Johnson Told The Nation\\", about the escalation of the war in Vietnam, and transformed it into \\"George W. Told The Nation\\", about the surge in the Iraq war. In 2007, Tom Paxton became one of the founding members of the Copyright Alliance, whose purpose is to promote the cultural and economic benefits of copyrights. In 2008, Paxton rewrote his song \\"I'm Changing My Name to Chrysler\\", about the federal loan guarantee to Chrysler in 1979, as \\"I Am Changing My Name to Fannie Mae\\", about the 700 billion dollar \\"bailout of the U.S. financial system\\". He continues to perform yearly tours of the United States and UK. In March 2015, Paxton released the studio album Redemption Road. In January 2017, Paxton released Boat in the Water, his sixty-third album. Paxton is now in \\"semi-retirement,\\" though he still performs occasional shows and did a 10 venue UK tour in 2017. Paxton toured the UK in 2018 and 2019 (11 venues), accompanied by The Don Juans. His shows featured his 2011 song \\"What if, no matter\\" (\\"He couldn't lay his hands on a gun\\"). Personal life and family Paxton married his wife, Midge (born Margaret Anne Cummings, February 23, 1945), in 1963. They have two daughters, Jennifer and Kate, and three grandsons. Jennifer is a history professor who has published courses for The Teaching Company. Midge Paxton died June 1, 2014 after a long illness. He has described his political views in the following way: \\"My own politics more or less resembled Will Rogers's politics. He had said that he belonged to no organized political party ‚Äî he was a Democrat ... being young and impassioned almost automatically put me over on the radical side of most issues. Being older, I find myself still more or less there, somewhat to my surprise.\\"Tom Paxton, The Honor of Your Company (2000), p. 40 Awards, honors, and nominations Tom Paxton with Ralph McTell (left) in the Palace of Westminster in 2007 In February 2002, Paxton was honored with the ASCAP Lifetime Achievement Award in Folk Music. A few days later, he received three Wammies (Washington, DC, Area Music Awards); as Best Male Vocalist in the \\"traditional folk\\" and \\"children's music\\" categories, and for Best Traditional Folk Recording of the Year for \\"Under American Skies\\" (2001). Paxton has been nominated four times for Grammy Awards, all since 2002. He was first nominated in 2002 for his children's album, Your Shoes, My Shoes. The following year, Looking for the Moon received a 2003 nomination for \\"Best Contemporary Folk Album\\". Live in the UK (2005), received a 2006 Grammy nomination in the \\"Best Traditional Folk Album\\" category. Most recently, his 2008 album Comedians and Angels received a 2009 nomination, also in the \\"Best Traditional Folk Album\\" category. Paxton was honored with a 2009 Lifetime Achievement Award from the Recording Academy, and the formal announcement was made during the 51st Annual Grammy Awards telecast, which aired on February 8, 2009. In 2004, the Martin Guitar Company introduced the HD-40LSH Tom Paxton Signature Edition acoustic guitar in his honor. In 2005, Paxton received a Lifetime Achievement Award for Songwriting at BBC Radio 2's Folk Awards at London's Brewery Arts Centre. In 2006, Paxton received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the North American Folk Music and Dance Alliance. On January 22, 2007, Paxton was honored with an official Parliamentary tribute at the House of Commons of the United Kingdom at the start of his 2007 UK tour. On May 3, 2008, Paxton was honored with a special lifetime tribute from the World Folk Music Association, and a concert was held at the Rachel M. Schlesinger Concert Hall and Arts Center at Northern Virginia Community College, Alexandria Campus, in Alexandria, Virginia.

Located in Beltsville, Maryland, it is one of five national libraries of the United States (along with the Library of Congress, the National Library of Medicine, the National Transportation Library, and the National Library of Education). It is also the coordinator for the Agriculture Network Information Center (AgNIC), a national network of state land-grant institutions and coordinator for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) field libraries. NAL was established on May 15, 1862, by the signing of the Organic Act by Abraham Lincoln. It served as a departmental library until 1962, when the Secretary of Agriculture officially designated it as the National Agricultural Library. The first librarian, appointed in 1867, was Aaron B. Grosh, one of the founders of the National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry. History NAL's Abraham Lincoln Building in Beltsville, Md. Fa√ßade of the Abraham Lincoln Building Lobby of the Abraham Lincoln Building NAL was established as the U.S. Department of Agriculture Library on May 15, 1862, by the signing of the Organic Act by Abraham Lincoln. In 1863, the library's collection comprised 1,000 volumes that had been transferred from the U.S. Patent Office's Agricultural Division. By 1889, the library's collection had increased to 20,000 volumes, and a librarian from Amherst College was hired to create a classification system for the library's collection. At this time, the library was located on the second floor of the Department of Agriculture's main building. In 1893, William Cutter was hired as Librarian of the Department, and he began a reorganization effort to modernize the library and improve its effectiveness. His primary achievement was consolidating the library's collection of 38,000 volumes into one central library; previously, more than half of the library's collection was held in divisional libraries across the United States. By 1900, the library's collection contained 68,000 volumes, and in 1915, the library was moved to a larger facility in the Bieber Office Building at 1358 B Street SW, Washington, DC. The library moved again in 1932 to facilities in the USDA's South Building on Independence Avenue.Fusione, Alan E. 1988. The history of the National Agricultural Library. Agricultural History 62(2):189-207. In 1934, the collection reached 250,000 volumes in size, and the library began participating in the Bibliofilm Service, which, along with the American Documentation Institute and the Science Service, supplied microfilm copies of articles to scientists. This was the first large-scale attempt by a library to provide copies of library materials to patrons rather than the original documents, and during its first year, over 300,000 copies were distributed. During World War II, the Department of Agriculture underwent reorganization to address wartime needs. The library, which had been decentralized since 1920, was consolidated into a central facility under the direction of Department Librarian Ralph R. Shaw. On May 23, 1962, the 100th anniversary of the library's establishment, Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman officially designated the library as the National Agricultural Library, making it the third national library in the United States. In 1964, funds were appropriated by Congress to begin planning for a new library facility in Beltsville, Maryland, on the grounds of the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center. Construction on the new facility began in 1965, and it first opened in 1969. In 2000, Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman designated the building as the Abraham Lincoln Building. =Librarians of the Department of Agriculture= *Aaron B.

Georgia in the Beginning of Feudal Decomposition. (XVIII cen.). Retrieved 5 April 2012. By this, eastern Georgia abjured any form of dependence on Persia (who had been its suzerain for centuries) or another power, and every new Georgian monarch of Kartli-Kakheti would require the confirmation and investiture of the Russian tsar. Terms Under articles I, II, IV, VI and VII of the treaty's terms, Russia's empress became the official and sole suzerain of Kartli-Kakheti's rulers, guaranteeing the Georgians‚Äô internal sovereignty and territorial integrity, and promising to \\"regard their enemies as Her enemies\\" Treaty of Georgievsk, 1783. PSRZ, vol. 22 (1830), pp. 1013‚Äì1017. Translated from the Russian by Russell E. Martin, Ph.D., Westminster College. Each of the Georgian kingdom's tsars would henceforth be obliged to swear allegiance to Russia's emperors, to support Russia in war, and to have no diplomatic communications with other nations without Russia's prior consent. Given Georgia's history of invasions from the south, an alliance with Russia may have been seen as the only way to discourage or resist Persian and Ottoman aggression, while also establishing a link to Western Europe. In the past, Georgian rulers had not only accepted formal domination by Turkish and Persian emperors, but had also often converted to Islam, and sojourned at their capitals. Thus it was neither a break with Georgian tradition nor a unique capitulation of independence for Kartli-Kakheti to trade vassalage for peace with a powerful neighbor. Though Russia was culturally alien, in the treaty's preamble and article VIII the bond of Orthodox Christianity between Georgians and Russians was acknowledged, which tied the two, and Georgia's primate, the Catholicos, became Russia's eighth permanent archbishop and a member of Russia's Holy Synod. Other treaty provisions included mutual guarantees of an open border between the two realms for travelers, emigrants and merchants (articles 10, 11), while Russia undertook \\"to leave the power for internal administration, law and order, and the collection of taxes [under the] complete will and use of His Serene Highness the Tsar, forbidding [Her Majesty‚Äôs] Military and Civil Authorities to intervene in any [domestic laws or commands]\\". (article VI). Article III created an investiture ceremony whereby the Georgian kings of Kartli-Kakheti, upon swearing fealty to Russia's emperors, would receive the royal regalia. The treaty was negotiated on behalf of Russia by Lieutenant-General Pavel Potemkin, commander of Russia's troops in Astrakhan and a delegate and cousin of General Prince Grigori Alexandrovich Potemkin, who was the official Russian plenipotentiary. Kartli-Kakheti's official delegation consisted of a Kartlian and a Kakhetian, both of high rank: Ioane, Prince of Mukhrani, (referred to in the Russian version of the treaty as \\"Prince Ivan Konstantinovich Bagration\\"), Constable of the Left-Hand Army and son-in-law of the Georgian king, and Adjutant-General Garsevan Chavchavadze, Governor of Kazakhi (aka Prince Garsevan Revazovich Chavchavadze, member of a Kakhetian princely family of the third rank, vassals of the Abashidze princes). These emissaries officially signed the treaty at the fortress of Georgievsk in the North Caucasus on July 24, 1783. The Georgian King Erekle II and the Empress Catherine the Great then formally ratified it in 1784. Aftermath Entrance of the Russian troops in Tiflis on November 26, 1799. A painting by Franz Roubaud, 1886. The Caucasian states and territories in 1799. The results of the Treaty of Georgievsk proved disappointing for the Georgians. King Erekle's adherence to it prompted Persia's new ruler, Agha Mohammad Khan, who had sent several ultimatums, to invade, as he sought to re-establish Persia's traditional suzerainty over the region. Russia did nothing to help the Georgians during the disastrous Battle of Krtsanisi in 1795, which left Tbilisi sacked and Georgia ravaged (including the west Georgian kingdom of Imereti, ruled by Erekle II's grandson, King Solomon II). Belatedly, Catherine declared war on Persia and sent an army to Transcaucasia. But her death shortly thereafter (November 1796) put an end to Russia's Persian Expedition of 1796, as her successor, Paul, turned to other strategic objectives. Persia's Shahanshah next contemplated the removal of the Christian population from eastern Georgia and eastern Armenia, launching the campaign from Karabagh. His goal was frustrated not by Russian resistance, but by a Persian assassin in 1797. On January 14, 1798, King Erekle II was succeeded on the throne by his eldest son, George XII (1746‚Äì1800) who, on February 22, 1799, recognized his own eldest son, Tsarevich David (Davit Bagrationi-batonishvili), 1767‚Äì1819, as official heir apparent. In the same year Russian troops were stationed in Kartli-Kakheti. Pursuant to article VI of the treaty, Emperor Paul confirmed David's claim to reign as the next king on April 18, 1799. But strife broke out among King George's many sons and those of his late father over the throne, Erekle II having changed the succession order at the behest of his third wife, Queen Darejan Dadiani, to favor the accession of younger brothers of future kings over their own sons. The resulting dynastic upheaval prompted King George to secretly invite Paul I to invade Kartli-Kakheti, to subdue the Bagratid princes, and to govern the kingdom from St. Petersburg, on the condition that George and his descendants be allowed to continue to reign nominally ‚Äì in effect, offering to mediatize the Bagratid dynasty under the Romanov emperors.Montgomery-Massingberd, Hugh, 1980, \\"Burke's Royal Families of the World: Volume II Africa & the Middle East, page 59 Continued pressure from Persia, also prompted George XII's request for Russian intervention. Paul tentatively accepted this offer, but before negotiations could be finalized changed his mind and issued a decree on December 18, 1800 annexing Kartli-Kakheti to Russia and deposing the Bagratids.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"Treaty of Georgievsk\\", 2008, retrieved 2008-6-16 Paul himself died shortly thereafter. It is said that his successor, Emperor Alexander I, considered retracting the annexation in favor of a Bagratid heir, but being unable to identify one likely to retain the crown, on September 12, 1801 Alexander proceeded to confirm annexation. Meanwhile, King George had died on December 28, 1800, before learning that he had lost his throne. By the following April, Russian troops took control of the country's administration and in February 1803 Tsarevich David Bagrationi was escorted by Russian troops from Tbilisi to St. Petersburg. He was pensioned, joined the Russian Senate, and retained his royal style until May 6, 1833 when he was demoted from tsarevich (the Russian equivalent of batonishvili) to \\"prince\\" (knyaz), along with other members of the deposed dynasty, following an abortive uprising in Georgia led by David's uncle, Prince Alexandre Bagrationi. The Russians then ended the Russo-Persian War of 1804‚Äì1813 with a victory. By the Treaty of Gulistan (1813), Qajar Persia was forced to officially cede eastern Georgia to the Russian Empire. Paul's annexation of east Georgia and exile of the Bagratids remain controversial: Soviet historians would later maintain that the treaty was an act of \\"brotherhood of the Russian and Georgian peoples\\" that justified annexation to protect Georgia both from its historical foreign persecutors and its \\"decadent\\" native dynasty. Nonetheless, no bilateral amendment had been ratified altering article VI sections 2 and 3 of the 1784 treaty, which obligated the Russian emperor \\"to preserve His Serene Highness Tsar Irakli Teimurazovich and the Heirs and descendants to his House, uninterrupted on the Throne of the Kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti...forbidding [Her Majesty‚Äôs] Military and Civil Authorities to intervene in any [domestic laws or commands].\\" Legacy A 1790 Russian medal commemorating the treaty. A 1983 Soviet stamp commemorating the 200-years anniversary of the treaty and celebrating it as \\"the first manifesto of the friendship and brotherhood between the Russian and Georgian peoples.\\" Ironically, that clause of the treaty would also be recalled during obscure late 20th century debates about restoration of the Russian monarchy.Eilers, Marlene A., Queen Victoria's Descendants, Companion Volume. Rosvall Royal Books, Falk√∂ping, Sweden, 2004. pp. 79‚Äì84. . In 1948, Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov, (1917‚Äì1992), pretender to Russia's throne, married Princess Leonida Georgievna Bagration-Moukhranskaya, (born 1914), a descendant of the Mukhranbatoni who negotiated the 1783 treaty, and thus a member of the once royal House of Bagrationi. The marriage produced an only child, Maria Vladimirovna, (born 1956), who has taken up her father's claim as Russia's de jure monarch. She and her son, George (born of her former marriage to Prince Franz Wilhelm of Prussia), have pretended to the Romanovs‚Äô old grand ducal title. Her supporters argue that her father's marriage to Leonida, alone among those contracted by Romanov males in exile since 1917, complied with the Romanov house law that required marriage to a princess of a \\"royal or ruling family\\" in order for descendants to claim the throne. That law also provided that upon extinction of all male dynasts, female Romanovs born of dynastic mothers become eligible to inherit the crown. Based on this rationale, Maria purports to have the strongest legal claim to the Russian throne in the event that Russia ever restores its monarchy. Critics deny that Princess Leonida could be reckoned of royal rank by Romanov standards (the title of prince was one of nobility, not dynasty in Russia, except in the imperial family). They point out that the Bagration-Mukhranskys were demoted from dynastic status and incorporated into Russia's ordinary nobility by 1833: Though the princess descended patrilineally from a dynasty that had ruled as kings in Armenia and Georgia since the Middle Ages, it had been reduced to the status of Russian nobility for over a century prior to the Russian Revolution. Leonida's branch of the Bagratids, although genealogically senior, had not been regnant in the male line as kings of Georgia since 1505.Cyril Toumanoff, \\"The Fifteenth- Century Bagratides and the Institution of Collegial Sovereignty in Georgia\\". Traditio. Volume VII, Fordham University Press, New York 1949‚Äì1951, pp. 169‚Äì221 Members of the family accepted court appointments under Russia's emperors incompatible with claims to dynastic dignity. Moreover, when an imperial Romanov princess wed Prince Constantine Bagration-Mukhransky in 1911, the marriage was officially deemed non-dynastic by Nicholas II,Frederiks, Baron V., Letter to Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich, 1911-06-04, State Archives of the Russian Federation, Series 604, Inventory 1, File 2143, pages 58‚Äì59, retrieved 2008-11-04 and the bride, Tatiana Konstantinova Romanova, was obliged to renounce her succession rights. While these facts are admitted, it is counter-argued that the demotion of the Bagratids, including the Mukhrani branch, violated the Treaty of Georgievsk and therefore failed to legally deprive any Bagrationi of royal rank. That fact, it is claimed, distinguishes Leonida from princesses of other once-sovereign families of the Russian Empire who married Romanovs. Nonetheless, it was the agnatic seniority of the Mukhranbatoni‚Äôs descent from Georgia‚Äôs former kings, rather than the broken treaty, that Vladimir Kirilovich cited in a 1946 decree recognizing the Bagration-Mukhranskys as dynastic for marital purposes, presumably so as to avoid repudiating the Russian Empire's annexation of Georgia. The language of article VI guaranteed the Georgian throne not only to King Erekle II and his direct issue, but also embraced \\"the Heirs and descendants to his House\\". On the other hand, article IX offered to extend no more than \\"the same privileges and advantages granted to the Russian nobility\\" to Georgia's princes and nobles. Yet first on the list of families submitted to Russia to enjoy noble (not royal) status was that of the Mukhranbatoni. That list included twenty- one other princely families and a larger number of untitled nobles, most of whom were enrolled in Russia's nobility during the 19th century. The claims made on Maria's behalf have long embittered Romanov descendants who belong to the Romanov Family Association. Many of them descend matrilineally from noble Russian princesses, some of whose families were also of \\"dynastic\\" origin, but cannot claim that a Treaty of Georgievsk has \\"preserved\\" their \\"dynasticity\\". the Russia‚ÄìGeorgia Friendship Monument, built for the bicentennial of the treaty In 1983, the Soviet authorities celebrated the bicentennial of the Treaty of Georgievsk, provoking protests from anti-Soviet Georgian dissidents. In this period, several monuments to commemorate the treaty, among them the Russia‚ÄìGeorgia Friendship Monument along the Georgian Military Road. Georgia's underground Samizdat publication, Sakartvelo (·É°·Éê·É•·Éê·É†·Éó·Éï·Éî·Éö·Éù), dedicated a special issue to the event, emphasizing imperial Russia's disregard of the key agreements in the treaty. Underground political groups disseminated leaflets calling on Georgians to boycott the celebrations, and several young Georgian activists were arrested by the Soviet police. –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–µ–≤–∞, –õ—é–¥–º–∏–ª–∞ (1983), –ì—Ä—É–∑–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–µ –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –¥–≤–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ.

He has realized more than 80 such public projections in Australia, Austria, Canada, England, Germany, Holland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. War, conflict, trauma, memory, and communication in the public sphere are some of the major themes of his work. His practice, known as Interrogative Design, combines art and technology as a critical design practice in order to highlight marginal social communities and add legitimacy to cultural issues that are often given little design attention.Interrogative Design Group, . He lives and works in New York City and teaches in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he is currently professor in residence of art and the public domain for the Harvard Graduate School of Design (GSD). Wodiczko was formerly director of the Interrogative Design Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he was a professor in the Visual Arts Program since 1991. He also teaches as Visiting Professor in the Psychology Department at the Warsaw School of Social Psychology. Early life Wodiczko, son of Polish orchestra conductor Bohdan Wodiczko,Douglas Crimp, Rosalyn Deutsche, Ewa Lajer-Burcharth, Krzysztof Wodiczko, \\"A Conversation with Krzyzstof Wodiczko\\" in October 38 (Autumn 1986): 36. was born in 1943 during the Warsaw Ghetto uprising and grew up in post-war, Soviet-occupied Poland. In 1967 while still a student at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, he began collaborating with director Jozef Patkowski and the Experimental Studio on sound performances. He graduated in 1968 with an M.F.A. degree in industrial design and worked for the next two years at UNITRA, Warsaw, designing popular electronic products. From 1970 until his emigration to Canada in 1977, he designed professional optical, mechanical, and electronic instruments at the Polish Optical Works.\\"Biography\\" in Krzysztof Wodiczko, Wodiczko (De Appel Amsterdam, 1996), 76. (Most biographical information for \\"Early life\\" comes from the biographical data in this catalog.) In 1969, Wodiczko collaborated with Andrzej Dluzniewski and Wojciech Wybieralski on a design proposal for a memorial to victims of Majdanek concentration camp in Poland. He also performed with Personal Instrument in the streets of Warsaw and participated in the Biennale de Paris as a leader of a group architectural project. He was a teaching assistant for two years, 1969‚Äì70, in the Basic Design Program at the Academy of Fine Arts before moving to the Warsaw Polytechnic Institute, where he taught until 1976. Throughout the 1970s he continued his collaborations on sound and music performances with various musicians and artists. In 1971, Wodiczko began work on Vehicle, which he tested the following year on the streets of Warsaw. In 1972 he created his first solo installation: Corridor at Galeria Wspolczesna, Warsaw. The following year he began exhibiting with Galeria Foksal, Warsaw. In 1975, Wodiczko traveled for the first time to the United States where he was artist-in-residence at the University of Illinois, Urbana and exhibited at N.A.M.E. Gallery, Chicago. He participated again in the Biennale de Paris, this time as a solo artist. In 1976, Wodiczko began a two-year artist-in- residence program at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. He emigrated from Poland in 1977, establishing residency in Canada teaching at the University of Guelph in Ontario, and began working with New York art dealer Hal Bromm. In 1979 he taught at the Ontario College of Art in Toronto and continued teaching at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design until 1981. From 1981-1982 he was artist in residence at the South Australian School of Art (currently part of the University of South Australia in Adelaide). In 1983, Wodiczko established residency in New York City teaching at the New York Institute of Technology, Old Westbury. The following year, he received Canadian citizenship and in 1986 resident-alien status in the United States. He began teaching at MIT in 1991, maintaining his residence in New York City while working in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Work  =Projections= Wodiczko began developing his public projections in 1980 interfacing the facades of urban architecture ‚Äì whether public monuments, public buildings, or corporate architecture ‚Äì with images of the body to juxtapose the physical space of architecture with the psycho-social space of the public realm. \\"In the process of our socialization,\\" the artist writes, \\"the very first contact with a public building is no less important than the moment of social confrontation with the father, through which our sexual role and place in society [are] constructed. Early socialization through patriarchal sexual discipline is extended by the later socialization through the institutional architecturalization of our bodies. Thus the spirit of the father never dies, continuously living as it does in the building which was, is, and will be embodying, structuring, mastering, representing, and reproducing his 'eternal' and 'universal' presence as a patriarchal wisdom- body of power.\\"Krzysztof Wodiczko, \\"Public Projections,\\" Canadian Journal of Political and Social Theory 7 (Winter-Spring, 1983) quoted in Krzysztof Wodiczko, Public Address (Minneapolis: The Walker Art Center, 1992), 89. In an often cited example, Wodiczko projected an image of the hand of Ronald Reagan, in formal dress shirt with cufflinks, posed in the pledge of allegiance, onto the north face of the AT&T; Long Lines Building in the financial district of New York City four days before the presidential election of 1984. \\"By creating a spectacle in which a fragment of the governing body, the presidential hand, was asked to stand for corporate business,\\" writes Ewa Lajer-Burcharth, \\"Wodiczko offered a suggestion about the class identity of those forces that ‚Äì hidden under the guise of God, State, and Nation ‚Äì are the actual receivers of the pledge of allegiance.\\"Ewa Lajer-Burcharth, \\"Understanding Wodiczko,\\" Counter-Monuments: Krzysztof Wodiczko's Public Projections (Cambridge, MA: Hayden Gallery, List Visual Arts Center, MIT, 1987). In subsequent projections, the artist layered iconic representations of global capitalism, militarism, and consumerism with images of fragments of the body to suggest a consideration of our relation to public space that is contingent both to history and social and political ideologies of the present. Art historian Patricia C. Phillips writes of the artist's work: \\"In his public projects of the past decade, Wodiczko has conducted a series of active mediations that combine significant public sites, tough subjects, and aggressive statements that are only possible because of their temporality. He applies the immediate force of performance to social and political problems. The rhythms of extenuating events and the brevity of each installation give his projected episodes the intensity of public, political demonstrations. His thoroughly staged, illuminated images often require months of preparation, yet they seem like surprise attacks ‚Äì fiercely focused parasitic invasions of renowned institutional hosts.\\"Patricia C. Phillips, \\"Images of Repossession,\\" Public Address, 44. Perhaps the best-known and most popular intervention of this nature was performed when the artist created a projection for Nelson's column in Trafalgar Square, London in 1985. The South African government was at that time petitioning the British government for financial support. Wodiczko turned one of his projectors away from Nelson's column projecting a swastika onto the tympanum of the temple-like fa√ßade of South Africa House, the South African diplomatic mission to the United Kingdom. Though the image remained only two hours before the police suspended the intervention as a \\"public nuisance\\" it lingered in public awareness much longer.Krzysztof Wodiczko, \\"Projections,\\" Perspecta 26, Theatre, Theatricality, and Architecture (1990): 273. It is frequently cited at conferences, in classroom discussions, and other forum as an example of successful urban guerrilla cultural tactics ‚Äì that is, art and/or performance that is waged by unexpected means for the purpose of engaging an active response. Tijuana Projection, 2001. Public video projection at the Centro Cultural Tijuana, Mexico. Organized as part of the event InSite 2000. In explaining the potential of cultural projects in the public sphere, the artist writes: \\"I try to understand what is happening in the city, how the city can operate as a communicative environment‚Ä¶ It is important to understand the circumstances under which communication is reduced or destroyed, and under what possible new conditions it can be provoked to reappear. How can aesthetic practice in the built environment contribute to critical discourse between the inhabitants themselves and the environment? How can aesthetic practice make existing symbolic structures respond to contemporary events?\\"Wodiczko, Perspecta 26 (1990): 273. For Wodiczko, disrupting the complacency of perception is imperative for passersby to stop, reflect, and perhaps even change their thinking; so he built his visual repertoire to evoke both the historical past and the political present. In this way, Wodiczko's visual repertoire for his projections expanded beyond the body (ears, eyes, and hands as indicators of human sensibility) to include chains, missiles, tanks, coins, cameras, boots, swastikas, guns, candles, food baskets, and corporate logos. \\"In these projections,\\" writes Kathleen MacQueen, \\"the artist alternates between symbolic, iconic, and indexical images ‚Äì the principal relations an image can have to its subject, according to the writings of Charles Sanders Peirce ‚Äì that is, predicated on a cultural reference, a physical resemblance, or a physical relation respectively. In many instances they scramble all relations: the hand, an index of the body ‚Äì someone's body ‚Äì is also an iconic representation of communication that might symbolically represent an open or closed ideological position.\\" The reductive, visual signs monumentally-sized to fit the facades on which they are projected, are not meant to read as logos for a political agenda, instead they suggest a perceptual contradiction to disrupt the kind of assumptions that beset the casual passerby.Kathleen MacQueen, Tactical Response: Art in an Age of Terror (New York: Agon Press, 2014), 119-120. Wodiczko's visual interventions into public space are intended to alter what Jacques Ranci√®re would later term the realm of the sensible.Jacques Ranci√®re, The Politics of Aesthetics (2000), trans. Gabriel Rockhill (London and New York: Continuum, 2004). When the public views its urban monuments with sidelong glances out of the corners of its eyes, it accepts the monuments as natural and uncoded. By intercepting vision with projections, Wodiczko replaces an unconsidered reception with a critical one.MacQueen, Tactical Response, 120 and Krzysztof Wodiczko, \\"Designing for a City of Strangers\\" (1997) in Critical Vehicles: Writings, Projects and Interviews (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1999), 4-15. This is the lesson of the Russian Formalists, of Bertolt Brecht's Verfremdungseffekt and of Friedrich Nietzsche's understanding of Goethe's belief that knowledge must quicken activity rather than lead to complacence.Friedrich Nietzsche, On the Advantage and Disadvantage of History for Life, trans. Peter Preuss (Indianapolis and Cambridge: Hackett Publishing Company, 1980). The artist began to integrate direct activism into his projects in the late 1980s with his vehicles and his instruments, articles of design that would act as band- aids ‚Äì not only healing social wounds but perhaps more importantly calling attention to them. =Vehicles= Homeless Vehicle, 1988-89, New York City While the artist had produced his first vehicle in Poland with additional conceptual versions designed when he lived in Canada, it was with his Homeless Vehicle Project of 1987-89, that he redirected \\"attention from the work of art as dissent to the work of art as social action: in this case, the discussions and design collaboration with members of the homeless community to develop both a physical object and a conceptual design that would make their participation in the urban economy visible and self-directed.\\"MacQueen, Tactical Response, 116. The Homeless Vehicle Project was both symbolic and useful: the artist's first work to use a collective process to legitimize the problems of a marginal community \\"without legitimating the crisis of homelessness.\\"Krzysztof Wodiczko, \\"An Interview by Jean-Christophe Royoux\\" in Critical Vehicles, 177. While the public was cautious, the operators of the vehicles took the project seriously. According to Wodiczko, \\"You see this in certain gestures, certain ways of behaving, speaking, dialoguing, of building up stories, narratives: the homeless become actors, orators, workers, all things which they usually are not. The idea is to let them speak and tell their own stories, to let them be legitimate actors on the urban stage.\\"Wodiczko, Critical Vehicles, 177. The attention to testimony as a transformative process while still tentative in the Homeless Vehicle Project became a significant performative process in the artist's Instruments and eventually part of his projections as well.MacQueen, Tactical Response, 118. Wodiczko created Poliscar in 1991 as a kind of \\"command center\\" for communication and community activism ‚Äì a vehicle equipped with first-aid supplies, video and radio transmission equipment, and tools for everyday survival, it could support legal, medical, and social crisis aid, the mobile units ranging from three to ten miles from a base station. Poliscar was a technological design for the disenfranchised public of the polis or public sphere. Later Wodiczko would merge his vehicles with his projections when working with war veterans (see \\"Recent Work\\"). =Instruments= Wodiczko created the Personal Instrument in 1969, his first conceptual design work taken into the public sphere. Though he had a degree in industrial design and created popular electronics for a Polish manufacturer, his design philosophy was influenced by Russian constructivism epitomized by the poet/artist Vladimir Mayakovsky's statement, \\"the streets our brushes, the squares our palettes.\\" The Personal Instrument consisted of a microphone, worn on the forehead, which retrieved sound while photo-receivers in gloves isolated and filtered the sound through the movement of the hand, which was then perceived discriminately by the artist, perceptually confined by the sound-proof headphones. By emphasizing selective listening, vital (under authoritarian restrictions) to a Polish citizen's survival, Wodiczko intimated the prevalence of censored speech, registering \\"dissent of a system that fostered one-directional critical thinking ‚Äì listening over speech.\\"MacQueen, Tactical Response, 112. After his work with the homeless community in New York City and Philadelphia, Wodiczko returned to the possibilities of smaller, personal instruments as conceptual and functional objects to offset the problems of communication for urban migrants. Initially based on the iconic staff of the wandering prophet, the Alien Staff (1992 and its variant, 1992/93) was designed to mediate conversation between aliens (the juridical term designating all immigrants whether of legal or illegal status) and the franchised population of an urban environment. The staff not only presented an object of curiosity to passersby, causing them to interrupt their pace long enough to ask questions, it also became a repository of narrative recording and objects both sacred or necessary (e.g., green cards or family mementoes) to the lives of the immigrants. Influenced by Julia Kristeva's Strangers to Ourselves (1991), Wodiczko developed new equipment in 1993 that focused even more directly on democratic speech rights for the performative stranger. Mouthpiece (Porte-parole) was intended to act as a protective zone so that the immigrant could expand her narrative outward into a collective experience thereby pulling her out of isolation. The video technology, to be worn over the mouth, makes strange the familiar thereby creating a point of entry for passersby to enter into conversation with the immigrant. Between 1993 and 1997, thirteen culturally displaced persons used variants of the Mouthpiece in Paris, Malm√∂, Helsinki, Warsaw, Amsterdam, Tr√©laz√©, and Angers. = Xenology = In its earliest sense, the ancient Greek xeinosXeinos is the form of xenos found in Homer (e.g. Odyssey, I, 313) and Pindar. was the guest who received hospitality, as opposed to the xeinodokos or \\"host\\", who welcomed strangers and provided them with hospitality.Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, new (ninth) edition, with a supplement, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1968, p. 1189. It is from this perspective, that of the immigrant, the stranger within a society, as opposed to that of society or the xeinodokos viewing the outsider, that Wodiczko employs the term xenology: \\"Xenology is the art of refusal to be fused, an art of delimitization, deidentification, and disintegration\\" (\\"Xenology: Immigrant Instruments\\", exhibition statement distributed at the Galerie Lelong, New York, 1996).Krzysztof Wodiczko, Critical Vehicles: Writings, Projects, Interviews, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1999, p. 131. Wodiczko calls xenology \\"a new, nomadic, and yet undeveloped form of understanding and expression\\".\\"Beyond the Hybrid State?\\" (1992) Critical Vehicles: Writings, Projects, Interviews, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1999, p. 18. Like the Eleatic Stranger (Xenos) in Plato's The Sophist, the vehicle of Wodiczko's xenology is a \\"nomadic Sophist\\", a \\"practitioner of democracy\\" who \\"recreate[s] an agora or forum each time he or she wishes to speak or listen.\\"Critical Vehicles: Writings, Projects, Interviews, p. 25. Recent work ‚Ä¶OUT OF HERE: The Veterans Project, 2009‚Äì2011. Seven-channel color video with sound. Installation view, Galerie Lelong, New York, 2011. While working on Porte-parole in Europe, Wodiczko received an invitation from the filmmaker Andrzej Wajda to participate in an urban festival in Krak√≥w using for the first time powerful Barco NV video projectors. Working with the Women's Center, he merged for the first time the testimonial work that had evolved from his work with instruments with the visual impact of his well- known large-scale public projections. Testimony of domestic abuse spoken from the City Hall Tower created shockwaves in an overwhelmingly Catholic culture of denial. In this way, Wodiczko continued in his testimonial video projections to respond to the needs of urban society's marginal citizens who frequently survive outside the usual boundaries of juridical and social resources. In 2001, he merged the means of his instruments with the purpose of the projections in his Tijuana Projection executed for InSite 2000. In this public intervention, women working in the \\"maquiladora\\" industry of Tijuana, Mexico wore media technology designed to project their faces onto El Centro Cultural as they spoke emotionally of incest, police abuse, and work place discrimination in real time. As participants, their parrhesiastic speech was courageously offered at great risk to themselves for the purpose of moral and political change. Through the video projections, Wodiczko continues to develop the potential for aesthetic practice to effect social change as part of a wider discourse on agonistic pluralism prompted by such influences as Chantal Mouffe and Ludwig Wittgenstein. The role of art in understanding and confronting conflict becomes an increasingly significant aspect of both Wodiczko's aesthetic and pedagogical practices. This is true in his continued work with immigrants and his recent work with war veterans in the Veteran Vehicle Project as well as his public lectures and teaching seminars worldwide including his seminar on \\"Trauma, Conflict, and Art\\" for the Warsaw School of Social Psychology. Recently, Wodiczko has also created projections for the interiors of cultural spaces as a metaphor for our psychological isolation from broader social and political experience. His 2005 exhibition at Galerie Lelong in New York City, If you see something‚Ä¶, his 2009 installation in the Polish Pavilion for the 53rd Venice Biennale, Guests, position the viewer in relation to the consequences of global capitalism and the conflict produced as a result of the inequitable distribution of resources and opportunities. Krzysztof Wodiczko believes in the necessity for intellectuals to participate actively in society forging, as critic Jan Avgikos points out, \\"a commitment to resistance and truth-telling that, while often derided as outmoded or impossible, remains a basic human impulse.\\"Jan Avgikos, \\"Kryzysztof Wodiczko: Galerie Lelong.\\" In Artforum International (December 1, 2005), 278. =\\"...Out of Here: The Veterans Project\\"= In 2009, the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston exhibited ‚Ä¶Out of Here: The Veterans Project. The multimedia installation, which ran from November 4, 2009, to March 28, 2010, filled a dark and empty museum gallery with recorded voices and explosions, along with flashes of light, simulating the experience of a mortar attack in Iraq. On three walls of the gallery, projectors cast two horizontal rows of windows, creating the illusion that viewers were inside a darkened warehouse. The eight-minute audio track started with the bustle of traffic and citizens in an Iraqi city, brought in children's laughter, and subtly overlapped an excerpt from an Al Jazeera broadcast of President Obama speaking about the need to endure in Iraq. Listeners also noted an Islamic call to prayer, forebodingly drowned out by the approach of a helicopter. Without much warning, soldiers began yelling and shooting. When the gunfire ceased, a mother was heard wailing, and the episode ended in ominous silence (voices recorded for Out of Here belonged to a mixture of Iraqi-Americans, United States soldiers, and actors).Blake J. Ruehrwein, \\"Wodiczko's Veterans: Artist, Institution, and Audience in ...Out of Here: The Veterans Project,\\" M.A. Thesis, City College of New York, Dec 2012. In the process of creating Out of Here, Wodiczko opted to expand the dictionary definition of veteran. Traditionally, the term is described as \\"a person who has served in a military force.\\"The American Heritage Dictionary, 4th ed., s.v. \\"Veteran.\\" Wodiczko has redefined veteran to include anyone who has lived in an area where war was fought at the time they lived there, for example, residents of Iraq from 2003-2011, or residents of Germany, England, France, etc. during World War II. The Iraqi-born civilians (veterans, by the artist's definition) who contributed to Out of Here, including the woman who lent her voice to the audio track, offered a perspective altogether different from those of the American military who had been in Iraq. This careful manipulation of the term foreshadows the artist's choice to insert his own thoughts in Out of Here, in addition to culling the testimonies of soldiers and Iraqis. Having lived through World War II in Poland and served in the Polish military during the cold war, Wodiczko is not merely working with veterans; he is one. The artist fulfills both old and new definitions of the word veteran. One year later, Out of Here was shown at Galerie Lelong in New York City. This second iteration contained an excerpt from a different speech by the President, and mentioned the end of the war and the gradual withdrawal of troops. Speaking on the changes, the artist commented, \\"It made the work more up to date‚Ä¶but the irony is that this project didn't have to change much.\\"Krzysztof Wodiczko, interview by Blake Ruehrwein, April 29, 2011. Wodiczko cited the locations, Boston and New York, as sufficient to garner different readings of the work. \\"The works in Boston and New York have different publics. New York's character and the [art] shows gave Out of Here a big international audience as opposed to the more local audience in Boston.\\"Wodiczko, interview by Blake Ruehrwein, April 29, 2011. Collectively, these narratives paint a picture of the individual veterans who told them, the larger picture of the Iraq War, and the more subtle clues to the war's repercussions.Blake J. Ruehrwein, \\"Wodiczko's Veterans: Artist, Institution, and Audience in ...Out of Here: The Veterans Project,\\" M.A. Thesis, City College of New York, Dec 2012. =\\"Abraham Lincoln: War Veteran Projection\\"= For Abraham Lincoln: War Veteran Projection, presented by More Art, Wodiczko engaged with dozens of American war veterans and their family members to explore the traumatic consequences of war. The artist interviewed a total of fourteen participants, recording conversations about war experiences, the difficult return to civilian life, loss, and guilt. These interviews were then edited into a video that was projected on the statue of Abraham Lincoln In Union Square Park.Hoban, Phoebe. \\"Emancipation From War's Horrors,Wall Street Journal, November 12, 2012.

Prior to Ministry, Barker provided bass for the Seattle post-punk ensemble The Blackouts alongside future Ministry drummer Bill Rieflin and his brother, one-time Ministry touring keyboardist/saxophonist Roland Barker, from 1979 until 1985. Ministry Beginning as touring bassist for Ministry's 1986 Twitch tour, Barker collaborated with frontman Al Jourgensen and collectively released The Land of Rape and Honey in 1988. Although many musicians briefly contributed to Ministry in the nearly two-decade period after Barker joined the band, he and Jourgensen were the only continuous members. The dynamics between these two different personalities came to shape Ministry's sound, along with a number of side-projects which they were involved in together. In 2003, Barker left the band a year after the release of their eighth album Animositisomina. The decision was made officially after the death of his father. Despite being in Ministry for almost 18 years, Jourgensen did not do anything to spur his departure. \\"Over the years we've had strained relations as well as good times, and the last tour was no different than any other tour. That means it was extremely difficult and very intense and lots of fun,\\" Barker had said. It is often believed that Jourgensen and Barker were close bandmates and the latter played a huge creative role in the band. Jourgensen rebuffed these claims saying that their relationship was more like an arranged marriage and \\"acrimonious.\\" He said that they were never friends but business partners. Since leaving Ministry, Barker has distanced himself from Jourgensen and the two almost have nothing good to say about their relationship in the band. Barker was quoted in a 2011 interview that it was \\"tough to watch\\" the band's Fix: The Ministry Movie documentary as he could no longer associate himself with the band. When asked in a 2015 interview if he will ever work with Jourgensen again, he replied, \\"I'm fairly confident we will not work together. We have zero relationship now.\\" When asked why he left Ministry, he said because he was no longer willing to put up with the stupidity and decided that it was enough. Barker has since moved on to other things and in 2016, he seems to have made peace with Ministry more or less. \\"Of course, that was a very intense time and extremely rewarding. That was quite a while ago and I rarely think about it. I'm still fascinated with the heaviest, ugliest music and it's now hard to find the time for those pursuits. I am not in direct contact with Al these days.\\" In 2018, Jourgensen got back in touch with Barker. He contacted Barker while they both made appearances at screenings for the documentary Industrial Accident: The Story of Wax Trax! Records. Jourgensen has stated he is eager to collaborate with Barker very soon. Post-Ministry Since 2003, Barker has spent his time recording new material, producing such acts as I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness and collaborating with artists such as Stayte (on their 2007 Cognitive Dissonance (The Art of Lying To Yourself) EP). He joined U.S.S.A. with Duane Denison (Tomahawk, ex-The Jesus Lizard) as bassist. The first album from his solo project Flowering Blight, entitled The Perfect Pair, was released on November 19, 2008 via the official website. In 2011, Barker remixed the Deadly Apples song Self Inflicted Oppression with samples from Ministry's Psalm 69. The remix was featured on the soundtrack for the documentary film Fix: The Ministry Movie. Barker released Fix This!!! on April 10, 2012. This album features guests such as Chris Connelly, Ogre, Taylor Momsen, Puscifer, Deadly Apples, Alexis S.F. Marshall, Joshua Bradford, and Devix Szell. In 2015, Barker joined the touring lineup of rock supergroup Puscifer as their bassist. Paul is also one of the founders of Malekko Heavy Industry Corporation, a manufacturer of synthesizer modules and guitar effect pedals.

London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. as well as the temporary absorption of eastern parts of Georgia into the Iranian Empire. Although the Qajars were victorious and Agha Mohammad Khan kept his promise to Heraclius (Erekle) that if he would not drop the alliance with Russia and voluntarily reaccept Iranian suzerainty they would invade his kingdom, it also showed that Russia's own ambitions and agenda were set as the most important reason for Russia not to intervene at Krtsanisi, even though the latter had officially declared in the Treaty of Georgievsk of 1783 that it would protect Erekle's kingdom against any new Iranian ambitions to re-subjugate Georgia. Subsequently, in order to restore Russian prestige, Catherine would launch a punitive campaign against Iran the next year, but it was shortly recalled after her death. The following years remained turbulent and were known as a time of muddle and confusion. Reestablishment of Iranian rule over Georgia did not last long, for the shah was assassinated in 1797 in Shusha, and the Georgian king had died the year after. With Georgia laying in ruins and the central rule in Iran being concerned with the next heir to the throne, it opened the way for Georgia's annexation by Russia several years later by Tsar Paul. As Iran could not permit or allow the cession of Transcaucasia and Dagestan, which were integral parts of Iran for centuries, the consequences of the Krtsanisi battle directly led to the bitter Russo-Persian War (1804-1813) and Russo-Persian War (1826-1828), in which Fath Ali Shah, Agha Mohammad Khan's successor, attempted to reverse Russian military advances and restore Iranian authority north of the Aras and Kura rivers. After these wars, Iran ceded Transcaucasia and Dagestan to imperial Russia per the Treaty of Gulistan (1813) and the Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828).  Background  Eastern Georgia, composed of the kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti, had been in the early modern era under Iranian suzerainty since the 1510s. In 1744, Nader Shah had granted the kingship of Kartli and Kakheti to Teimuraz II and his son Erekle II (Heraclius II) respectively, as a reward for their loyalty. When Nader Shah died in 1747, they capitalized on the chaos that had erupted in mainland Iran, and declared de facto independence. After Teimuraz II died in 1762, Erekle II assumed control over Kartli, and united the two kingdoms in a personal union as the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti, becoming the first Georgian ruler to preside over a politically unified eastern Georgia in three centuries. At about the same time, Karim Khan Zand had ascended the Iranian throne; Erekle II quickly tendered his de jure submission to the new Iranian ruler, however, de facto, he remained autonomous. In 1783, Heraclius placed his kingdom under the protection of the Russian Empire in the Treaty of Georgievsk. In the last few decades of the 18th century, Georgia had become a more important element in Russo-Iranian relations than some provinces in northern mainland Persia, such as Mazandaran or even Gilan. Unlike Peter I, Catherine, the then ruling monarch of Russia, viewed Georgia as a pivot for her Caucasian policy, as Russia's new aspirations were to use it as a base of operations against both Iran and the Ottoman Empire, both immediate bordering geo-political rivals of Russia. On top of that, having another port on the Georgian coast of the Black Sea would be ideal. A limited Russian contingent of two infantry battalions with four artillery pieces arrived in Tbilisi in 1784, but was withdrawn, despite the frantic protests of the Georgians, in 1787 as a new war against Ottoman Turkey had started on a different front. In the next several years, Russia would be too occupied with Turkey (due to the 1768-74 war), Poland, and the European consequences of the French Revolution to give Georgia much attention. Even the consolidation of the Qajar dynasty under Agha Mohammad Khan, who had become the new owners to the Iranian throne and therefore the new heirs to the geo-politically rivalling empire that had been bordering Russia for centuries, did not divert Catherine from preoccupations in the west. In 1791, when Agha Mohammad Khan was in Tabriz, Erekle asked General Gudovich, commander of the Russian Caucasian Line, for renewed military aid, but the government in St.Petersburg did not judge it expedient to send troops again to Georgia. In 1792, Gudovich told Erekle that he would receive only diplomatic support in the advent of any Iranian onslaught. Despite being left to his own devices, Heraclius still cherished a dream of establishing, with Russian protection, a strong and united monarchy, into which the western Georgian Kingdom of Imereti and the lost provinces under Ottoman rule would all eventually be drawn. The consequences of these events came a few years later, when a new dynasty, the Qajars, emerged victorious in the protracted power struggle in Persia. Their head, Agha Mohammad Khan, as his first objective, resolved to bring the Caucasus again fully under the Persian orbit. For Agha Mohammah Khan, the resubjugation and reintegration of Georgia into the Iranian Empire was part of the same process that had brought Shiraz, Isfahan, and Tabriz under his rule. He viewed, like the Safavids and Nader Shah before him, the territories no different than the territories in mainland Iran. Georgia was a province of Iran the same way Khorasan was. As the Cambridge History of Iran states, its permanent secession was inconceivable and had to be resisted in the same way as one would resist an attempt at the separation of Fars or Gilan. It was therefore natural for Agha Mohammad Khan to perform whatever necessary means in the Caucasus in order to subdue and reincorporate the recently lost regions following Nader Shah's death and the demise of the Zands, including putting down what in Iranian eyes was seen as treason on the part of the wali of Georgia. Finding an interval of peace amid their own quarrels and with northern, western, and central Persia secure, the Persians demanded Heraclius II to renounce the treaty with Russia and to reaccept Persian suzerainty, in return for peace and the security of his kingdom. The Ottomans, Iran's neighboring rival, recognized Iran's rights over Kartli and Kakheti for the first time in four centuries. Heraclius appealed then to his theoretical protector, Empress Catherine II of Russia, pleading for at least 3,000 Russian troops, but he was not listened to, leaving Georgia to fend off the Persian threat alone. Nevertheless, Heraclius II still rejected the Khan's ultimatum.Suny, Ronald Grigor (1994), The Making of the Georgian Nation, p. 59.

In August 1795, Agha Mohammad Khan crossed the Aras river with a 70,000-strong army.Donald Rayfield. Edge of Empires: A History of Georgia Reaktion Books, 15 feb. 2013 p 255 This force was divided in three: the left wing was sent in the direction of Erivan, the right one parallel to the Caspian Sea into the Mughan across the lower Aras towards Dagestan and Shirvan, while the Shah headed the centre force himself, advancing towards the fortress of Shusha in the Karabakh Khanate, which he besieged between 8 July and 9 August 1795. His right and left wing forced the Khans of Ganja and Erivan into alliance respectively.Tapper, Richard (1997), Frontier Nomads of Iran: A Political and Social History of the Shahsevan, p. 122. Cambridge University Press, . Having abandoned the siege of Shusha due to stiff resistance, which was further aided by Georgian crown prince Aleksandre, the Khan of Karabakh, Ibrahim Khan, eventually surrendered to Mohammad Khan after discussions, including the paying of regular tribute and to surrender hostages, though the Qajar forces were still denied entrance to Shusha. Since the main objective was Georgia, Mohammad Khan was willing to have Karabakh secured by this agreement for now, for he and his army subsequently moved further. While at Ganja, having secured Shirvan, he was joined by Javad Khan Qajar and the rest of his right wing contingent. At Ganja, Mohammad Khan sent Erekle his last ultimatum, who received it in September 1795: According to the author of the FƒÅrsnƒÅma-ye NƒÅ·π£eri, ·∏§asan-e FasƒÅ ºi, a contemporary Qajar era historian, Agha Mohammad Khan had declared in the letter: His advisors divided, Erekle ignored the ultimatum, but, sent couriers to St.Petersburg. Gudovich, who sat in Georgievsk at the time, instructed Erekle to avoid \\"expense and fuss\\", while Erekle, together with Solomon II and some Imeretians headed southwards of Tbilisi to fend off the Iranians. Agha Mohammad Khan at the same time marched directly on Tbilisi, with half of the army he crossed the Aras river with, though other estimations mention 40,000 instead of 35,000, and attacked the heavily fortified Georgian positions of Erekle and Solomon on the southwestern limits of the city. Abandoned by several of his nobles, Heraclius II managed to mobilize around 5,000 troops, including some 2,000 auxiliaries from neighbouring Imereti under its King Solomon II, a member of the Georgian Bagrationi Dynasty and thus distantly related to Heraclius II. The Georgians offered a desperate resistance and succeeded in rolling back a series of Persian attacks on September 9 and 10. After that, it is said that some traitors informed the Persians that the Georgians had no more strength to fight and the Qajars army cancelled their plan of going back to Persia, which they previously had. Early on September 11, Agha Mohammad Khan personally led an all-out offensive against the Georgians. Amid an artillery duel and a fierce cavalry charge, the Persians managed to cross the Kura River and outflanked the decimated Georgian army. Heraclius II attempted to mount a counterattack, but he had to retreat to the last available positions in the outskirts of Tbilisi. By nightfall, the Georgian forces had been exhausted and almost completely destroyed. The last surviving Georgian artillery briefly held the advancing Persians to allow Heraclius II and his retinue of some 150 men to escape through the city to the mountains. The fighting continued in the streets of Tbilisi and at the fortress of Narikala. In a few hours, Agha Mohammad Khan was in full control of the Georgian capital which was completely sacked and its population massacred. Among those killed in the city was the archbishop of Tbilisi, Doistheus. The Persian army marched back laden with spoil and carrying off some 15,000 captives.Malcolm, Sir John (1829), The History of Persia from the Most Early Period to the Present Time, pp. 189-191. London: John Murray. The Georgians had lost 4,000 men in the battle, the Iranians 13,000; a third of their total force. An eye-witness, having entered the city several days after the bulk of the Iranian troops had withdrawn, described what he saw:  Aftermath  Entrance of the Russian troops in Tiflis, 26 November 1799, by Franz Roubaud, 1886 On his return, after the conquest of Tbilisi and being in effective control of eastern Georgia, Agha Mohammad was formally crowned Shah in 1796 in the Mughan plain, just like his predecessor Nader Shah was about sixty years earlier. As The Cambridge History of Iran notes; \\"Russia's client, Georgia, had been punished, and Russia's prestige, damaged.\\" Heraclius II returned to Tbilisi to rebuild the city, but the destruction of his capital was a death blow to his hopes and projects. Upon learning of the fall of Tbilisi General Gudovich put the blame on the Georgians themselves. To restore Russian prestige, Catherine II declared war on Persia, upon the proposal of Gudovich, and sent an army under Valerian Zubov to the Qajar possessions on April of that year, but the new Tsar Paul I, who succeeded Catherine in November, shortly recalled it. Agha Mohammad Shah was later assassinated while preparing a second expedition against Georgia in 1797 in Shusha and the seasoned king Heraclius died early in 1798. Reassessment of Iranian hegemony over Georgia did not last long; in 1799 the Russians marched into Tbilisi.Alekseƒ≠ I. Miller. Imperial Rule Central European University Press, 2004 p 204 The next two years were a time of muddle and confusion, and the weakened and devastated Georgian kingdom, with its capital half in ruins, was easily absorbed by Russia in 1801. As Iran could not permit or allow the cession of Transcaucasia and Dagestan the consequences of the Krtsanisi battle would also directly lead up to two wars between the nations. The Russo-Persian War (1804-1813) and Russo-Persian War (1826-1828) would eventually forced the cession of the aforementioned regions to Imperial Russia per the Gulistan and Turkmenchay of 1813 and 1828 respectively.

Black is the author of The Behavior of Law, The Manners and Customs of the Police, and Sociological Justice, all of which present various aspects of his theory of law. More recently, The Social Structure of Right and Wrong extends the theory to address conflict management more broadly. It thus focuses on instances where people handle conflicts through means other than the law, such as through gossip, avoidance, suicide, or feuding. Black's latest book, Moral Time, identifies the causes of moral conflict in all human relationships. Black is also the founder of pure sociology, a distinctive theoretical approach that explains human behavior with its social geometry. Since pure sociology is a general sociological paradigm, it may be applied to subjects other than law, conflict, and conflict management‚Äîfor example, art,Black, Donald. 1998.

The customary attribute or form of address for a Batonishvili was \\"·É£·Éí·Éê·Éú·Éê·Éó·Éö·Éî·Éë·É£·Éö·Éî·É°·Éò\\" (uganatlebulesi) (\\"Most Brilliant\\" or \\"Most High\\").·ÉÆ·Éê·Éú·Éó·Éê·É´·Éî ·É®., ·É•·Éê·É†·Éó·É£·Éö·Éò ·É°·Éê·Éë·É≠·Éù·Éó·Éê ·Éî·Éú·É™·Éò·Éô·Éö·Éù·Éû·Éî·Éì·Éò·Éê, ·É¢·Éù·Éõ·Éò 2, ·Éí·Éï·Éî·É†·Éì·Éò 229‚Äî230, ·Éó·Éë·Éò·Éö·Éò·É°·Éò, 1977 Khantadze Sh., Georgian Soviet Encyclopedia, Volume 2, page 229-230, Tbilisi, 1977·É£·É§·Éö·Éò·É°-·É¨·É£·Éö·Éò National Parliamentary Library of Georgia There were several types of noble in the monarchies of the Caucasus, some exercising more or less sovereign authority at times, whose titles are prone to be confused with the title and rank of Batonishvili when translated from Georgian into other languages. This is partially because there were no precise Western equivalents for those titles, and partially because they all came to be translated by the Russian word for prince, Knyaz, as Russia increasingly dominated the region. A list of Georgian titled families was attached to the 1783 Treaty of Georgievsk between Georgia and Russia pursuant to Article IX's promise that Russia would allow those families to \\"...enjoy all the same privileges and advantages granted to the Russian nobility\\". Inexplicably, the list did not differentiate among the ranks of the families included therein (although they were apparently listed in descending order of rank). Russia eventually added all of them to the Fifth Book of Nobility, wherein were already included nobles that held the title of prince but who had no claim to sovereign or quasi-sovereign rank. The first family named on the treaty's list was that of Bagrationi, to which belonged Georgia's king and agnates, but henceforth they and all of the other families were accorded the title of Knyaz and the rank of ordinary nobleman in Russia. In fact, members of the Kartli, Kakheti, Mukhrani and Imereti branches of the Bagratid dynasty all bore the title of Batonishvili in Georgia and had descendants living in Russia in the 19th century. The heirs of Kakheti and Imereti had been deported to Russia after their kingdoms were annexed in 1801 and 1810 respectively. Yet at the Russian court they were allowed to bear the Russian title equivalent to Batonishvili, Tsarevich, until 1833, the year following the abortive coup to restore the Georgian crown which had been led by Alexandre Batonishvili. Henceforth Georgia's royal heirs and their descendants were demoted to Knyaz, as Prince Gruzinsky and Prince Imeretinsky, respectively.

The treaty brought about an alliance between the two powers, as well as a guarantee that the Ottomans would close the Dardanelles to any foreign warships if the Russians requested such action. The treaty would have significant consequences regarding the Ottoman Empire's foreign relations, especially with Great Britain and Ireland, as the terms of the treaty worried the other great powers of Europe. Background Mehmed Ali, ostensibly only a vassal of the Ottoman Empire, was seeking to increase his personal power and gain control over Palestine, Syria, and Arabia. In order to justify the assault on his liege, he used the pretext of a personal dispute with the pasha of Acre.Lord Kinross, The Ottoman Centuries: The Rise and Fall of the Turkish Empire, (New York: William Morrow and Company, Inc., 1977), 467. =Egyptian advance= In late 1831, he sent his newly reformed army towards Syria, under the command of his son Ibrahim Pasha, resulting in the Egyptian‚ÄìOttoman War (1831‚Äì1833) against the Ottoman sultan, Mahmud II. Ibrahim's forces quickly captured Gaza and Jerusalem, and successfully laid siege to Acre before marching on to Aleppo and Damascus, ‚Äúwinning successive battles against Mahmud‚Äôs new troops, which were not yet a match for so practiced an enemy‚Äù; by June 18, 1832, Ibrahim had managed to seize control of all of Syria.Lord Kinross, 467. For a time, the Egyptian army halted while Mehmed Ali attempted to negotiate with the Sultan. However, once it became clear that diplomacy had failed, Ibrahim led his forces into Anatolia itself where he rallied opponents of the Sultan and captured the city of Konya on November 21.Stanford J. Shaw and Ezel Kural Shaw, History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey, Volume II: Reform, Revolution, and Republic: The Rise of Modern Turkey, 1808-1975, (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1977), 33. Mahmud II dispatched a large army to try to halt the Egyptian advance, but it was crushed in the Battle of Konya on December 21 and ‚Äúin a single blow [opened] the way for a complete conquest of Anatolia.‚ÄùShaw and Shaw, 33. Ibrahim continued his advance until he was within striking distance of Istanbul, the Ottoman capital. =Response= Panic spread through the imperial city as the Egyptian army pushed closer to the seat of Ottoman authority. Mahmud II urgently dispatched pleas for assistance to both Britain and France, but was turned down due to domestic concerns as well as the involvement of both nations in managing the state of affairs after the recently ended Belgian Revolution. Lord Kinross argues that this left the Sultan no choice but to call upon his former enemy, Russia, for assistance.Lord Kinross, 468. According to Bailey, the response from the Tsar was so positive and swift, that Mahmud II hesitated in accepting, believing it might be a trap.Frank Edgar Bailey, British Policy and the Turkish Reform Movement: A Study in Anglo-Turkish Relations, 1826-1853, (Cambridge, MA: The Harvard University Printing Office, 1942), 48. Nevertheless, the Sultan was willing to welcome any help he could receive, and accepted the Russian offer. The Tsar immediately dispatched a sizeable force of troops to block the potential Egyptian advance on Istanbul. It is unclear exactly how many troops the Tsar sent; Lord Kinross claims it was an army of approximately 18,000 men in total while Bailey suggests it may have been a force more than twice that size of nearly 40,000 troops.Lord Kinross, 468.Bailey, 48. Regardless of the exact size of the Russian host, it was formidable enough to cause Ibrahim to decide to begin negotiating with the Sultan rather than risk a battle with the Russians.Lord Kinross, 468. Thus, the mere presence of Russian troops was enough to halt the Egyptian onslaught. =European reaction= The presence of Russian troops so close to the Ottoman capital also worried Britain and France considerably. Seeing this potential threat forced the two nations into action. Lord Palmerston, the British Foreign Secretary, led the effort and brought strong diplomatic pressure ‚Äúto bear upon the Sultan to insist on the Russian withdrawal, in return for concessions to Mehmed Ali and an Anglo-French guarantee against his further invasion.‚ÄùLord Kinross, 468. Diplomacy was not the only tool they employed however, as both the British and the French dispatched fleets to the Dardanelles.Virginia H. Aksan, Ottoman Wars 1700-1870: An Empire Besieged, (London: Pearson Education Limited, 2007), 375. This action served the dual purpose of coercing the Sultan to accept their demanding proposal, while also threatening the Russians and checking any further military action they might take. =Consequences of the conflict and intervention= The Sultan finally submitted, which led to the Convention of K√ºtahya in May 1833, which officially granted Mehmed Ali control of Syria, Adana, Tripoli, Crete, and Egypt, though these titles were not guaranteed to be hereditary upon his death.Lord Kinross, 468. As soon as this peace was established, the Russians began the process of removing their troops from Ottoman territory. It seemed as though things had come to a reasonable end, but soon after the withdrawal of all Russian troops, the British government learned that two days prior to the completion of this evacuation, the Sultan Mahmud II had signed the Treaty of H√ºnk√¢r ƒ∞skelesi with Tsar Nicholas I.Bailey, 49. This realization alarmed British leaders, as it seemed to indicate that Russia now held an enormous amount of influence over the Ottoman Empire and its affairs. Treaty The quickly negotiated treaty, signed on July 8, 1833, consisted primarily of a defensive alliance between Russia and the Ottoman Empire which was to initially last for eight years, and included pledges to discuss matters of security with one another.Aksan, 375. This bound the two empires together in a significant way and seemed to give the Russians the opportunity for future military interventions in the Ottoman Empire, effectively making it a protectorate of the Russian state. While this portion of the treaty was itself important, the most significant feature was its secret article. =Secret Article= The Bosporus (red), the Dardanelles (yellow), and the Sea of Marmara in between, are known collectively as the \\"Turkish Straits\\". Modern borders are shown. This article called for an alternative to Ottoman military support per the terms of the treaty; rather than sending troops and arms in support of their Russian allies, the Ottomans would close the Dardanelles to all foreign warships at Russia's command. Below is the full text of the secret article: > ‚ÄúIn virtue of one of the clauses of Article I of the Patent Treaty of > Defensive Alliance concluded between the Imperial Court of Russia and the > Sublime Porte, the two High Contracting Parties, are bound to afford to each > other, mutually substantial aid, and the most efficacious assistance, for > the safety of their respective dominions. Nevertheless, His Majesty the > Emperor of all the Russias, wishing to spare the Sublime Ottoman Porte the > expense and inconvenience which might be occasioned to it by affording such > substantial aid, will not ask for that aid, if circumstances should place > the Sublime Porte under the obligation of furnishing it. The Sublime Porte, > in place of aid which it is bound to furnish in case of need according to > the principal of reciprocity of the Patent Treaty, shall confine its action > in favour of the Imperial Court of Russia to closing the Strait of the > Dardanelles, that is to say, to not allowing any foreign vessel of war to > enter therein, under any pretext whatsoever.‚ÄùBailey, 49-50. =Interpretations of the Secret Article= This article was highly controversial and its true meaning is still a matter of debate. There is disagreement over what exactly the terms of the closing of the Dardanelles would be. Some interpret the lack of any specific mention of Russian warships to mean that their ships were not included with those to be barred passage through the Dardanelles. Others point out that this same lack of any specific provision for Russian warships indicates that the treaty did not grant them any special rights. There is also debate over what is meant by the phrase ‚Äúin case of need.‚Äù Some believe this meant only while Russia was at war, while others interpreted it to mean that the Dardanelles would be closed to foreign warships at all times. These speculations began when the British discovered the full scope of the treaty. The secret article was not officially communicated to the British government until January 16, 1834, but they were aware of it several months before that point.Bailey, 49. The British interpreted the treaty and its secret clause to have a potentially great impact on their relations with Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and the established balance of power. Hale argues that Lord Palmerston was stung into action ‚Äúsince he mistakenly believed that [the treaty‚Äôs] secret clause had given Russian warships free passage through the straits.‚ÄùWilliam Hale, Turkish Foreign Policy 1774-2000, (London: Frank Cass Publishers, 2000), 25. Additionally, Palmerston and the rest of the British government saw that ‚Äúwhile the immediate advantages of the treaty were slight, the ‚Äòpotential advantage to Russia‚Äô was very great, in that ‚Äòin accustoming the Porte to the position of vassal‚Äô Russia had ‚Äòprepared the way for a repetition of the 1833 expedition.‚Äô‚ÄùBailey 53. They feared that this potential for future Russian intervention in the Ottoman Empire would threaten British connections with India and trade in the Near East as a whole, though as Bailey puts it, ‚ÄúThe Foreign Secretary‚Äôs immediate concern, however, was the problem of the Straits.‚ÄùBailey, 53. This interpretation of the treaty was to shape British foreign policy towards the Ottoman Empire for decades to come. Consequences of the Treaty According to Bailey, the signing of the Treaty of H√ºnk√¢r ƒ∞skelesi was what fully awakened Britain to ‚Äúthe importance of the Ottoman Empire‚Äôs geographical, political, and economic position in Europe.‚ÄùBailey, 38. In the short term, the British protested the treaty, claiming that it violated the Anglo-Ottoman Treaty of 1809, which set forth terms that no foreign warship would be allowed to enter the straits. Their formal protest concluded ‚Äúif the stipulations of that treaty (Unkiar Skelessi) should hereafter lead to the armed interference of Russia in the internal affairs of Turkey, the British government will hold itself at liberty to act upon such an occasion, in any manner which the circumstances of the moment may appear to require.‚ÄùBailey, 53. The French also issued a similar statement regarding their concerns about possible Russian military interference. These two statements were indicative of how seriously the terms of the treaty were taken by the Western powers. In the longer term, the British became convinced that a different approach was needed, and committed to a policy that ‚Äúthe Ottoman Empire was to be preserved, supported, reformed, and strengthened.‚ÄùAksan, 375. From that point forward, the British, under Palmerston's leadership, took a number of actions to enact this new policy towards the Ottoman Empire. These ranged from increased trade with the Ottomans to a strengthening of the British fleet in the Levant and offers of both military and naval missions to Mahmud II both to aid the Sultan should Mehmed Ali threaten further military action, and ‚Äúas a gesture to redress Britain‚Äôs former neglect.‚ÄùAksan, 375. While Britain certainly took the most active role, it was not the only European power which took an interest in the Ottoman Empire as a result of this treaty. Not long after the signing of the treaty, Austria and Prussia joined Russia in the M√ºnchengr√§tz Convention of September 18, 1833,http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3446900565/mnchengrtz-treaty.html which committed the powers to opposing further expansion by Mehmed Ali and to ‚Äúmaintain[ing] Ottoman integrity.‚ÄùAksan, 375. In July 1840, a broader coalition was formed including Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia, which agreed to protect the Sultan's government against Mehmed Ali; this agreement, known as the Convention of London (1840) also required that the Ottomans declare that the straits would be closed to all non-Ottoman warships in peacetime.Hale, 25. European support, specifically that of the British, also aided in the ultimate submission of Mehmet Ali; in an agreement signed in June 1841, he accepted the limitation of his army in exchange for guarantees of hereditary governorship of Egypt for his family.Hale, 25. This marked ‚Äúthe emergence of Britain as a more active player in the Near Eastern power game, and the Ottoman Empire‚Äôs main ally for the next 37 years.‚ÄùHale, 25. Thus, the Treaty of H√ºnk√¢r ƒ∞skelesi had long-lasting effects on the future of the Ottoman Empire, and especially on European outlooks towards that same future. End of the Treaty It is difficult to say exactly when the treaty ceased to be valid. Other treaties and agreements certainly began to chip away at its terms not long after its signing. The Convention of London (1840) took the first big step by compelling the Ottomans to keep the straits closed to all non-Ottoman warships in peacetime. This helped assuage the British fear that the Treaty of H√ºnk√¢r ƒ∞skelesi had effectively granted the Russian fleet free passage through the straits and into the Mediterranean. Another step towards nullifying the treaty came in the form of the London Straits Convention the following year. This agreement barred all warships from entering the straits, save those of allies of the Sultan in wartime. While it may seem that this agreement does not change much, it is important to remember that at this point, Britain was one of the Sultan's allies. Thus, this would allow the British fleet to enter the straits in times of war, eliminating the perceived exclusive right of the Russians to do so. By this point, the most important aspect of the treaty had effectively been negated. Russo-Ottoman relations continued to deteriorate in the following decade, and while it is unclear when the Treaty of H√ºnk√¢r ƒ∞skelesi was entirely invalidated, it can be said with certainty that the coming of the Crimean War meant the end of any potential for the continuation of the Russo-Ottoman alliance set out in the treaty.

Cathars believed in original sin, and‚Äîlike Gnostics‚Äîbelieved temporal pleasure to be sinful or unwise. The process of living thus inevitably incurred \\"regret\\" that required \\"consolation to move nearer to God or to approach heaven. It occurred only twice in a lifetime: upon confirmation in the faith and upon impending death. It was available to both men and women who made a commitment to the faith. Following the ceremony the consoled individual became a \\"Cathar Perfect\\". According to the Albigenses and other Cathars, the consolamentum was an immersion (or baptism) in the Holy Spirit. It implied reception of all spiritual gifts including absolution from sin, spiritual regeneration, the power to preach and elevation to a higher plane of perfection. The ritual Reference to the trinity was systematically replaced with the name of Christ since the doctrine of the Albigenses and Cathars professed a single unified deity (their Christology resembled modalistic monarchism in the West and adoptionism in the East). The ritual took various forms; some used the entire New Testament scripture whilst others relied on extracts such as the Gospel attributed to John while administering consolation. There were reportedly some remote cases where holy water was used as a cleansing agent during consolamentum being profusely poured over the recipient's head until he/she was completely wet (as opposed to sprinkling). In contrast to Catholic ceremonies, the form used by the majority of Cathars only required verbal blessings and scriptures administered to the person to be consoled, and did not involve tokens such as consecrated bread or wine because these would pass through the body and become befouled. Dying persons might abstain from food in order that their bodies be as pure as possible as it passed into eternity. According to a few known cases in the latter years of Catharism, the terminally ill would voluntarily undertake a complete fast known as the endura. It was only undertaken when death was clearly inevitable. It was a form of purification and separation from the material world which was controlled by the evil one. They believed that this final sacrifice ensured their reunification with the Good God. Laying on of hands was always part of the ceremony. Some historians have stated that incidents of ecstatic utterances during consolamentum was actually glossolalia, or \\"speaking in tongues,\\" which demanded that the rite be even more secretly guarded since this phenomenon occurring outside of the Catholic Church was considered witchcraft and was punishable by death. Once consoled, Parfaits were required to be pescatarian, to be celibate, and to dedicate their lives to travelling and teaching Albigensian and Cathar doctrines. These Parfaits were the leaders of the Albigensian and other Cathar communities (Albigenses were a branch of Cathari in what was to later become southern France. Most people use the term Albigenses when referring to those that adhered to a branch of Cathari that was less dualistic and more closely resembled orthodoxy). The vast majority of the population did not receive consolamentum until on the verge of death. Once given the consolamentum, the same rules applied to them, though they were obviously not expected to travel or preach from their deathbed. This allowed most believers to live somewhat normal lives and receive consolamentum shortly before passing away.

Dry transfers (also called rub-ons or rubdowns) are decals that can be applied without the use of water or other solvent. The decal itself is on a backing material such as paper or plastic sheeting much like a transparency. The dry transfer is placed in the desired location with the backing side up. The decal is then applied by burnishing the backing with a stylus or similar object such as a ballpoint pen. The contact side of the decal includes a pressure-sensitive adhesive; the combination of heat and pressure causes the decal to stick more strongly to the new surface than to the backing. When the backing is removed, the decal remains. This allows for ink only where needed even if the pattern is delicate, because the backing supports the decal while it is being applied. Dry transfers are used in manual technical drawing when standard graphic elements such as title blocks, forms, patterned lines, shading, piping or electronic schematic symbols need to be repetitively used. Use of a dry transfer reduces drawing time and standardizes appearance. David L.

He produced several anti-evolution and creationist works, particularly on the subject of flood geology. His views did not become common among creationists until after his death, particularly with the modern creation science movement starting in the 1960s.  Personal life  Price was the father of Ernest Edward Pricehttps://www.geni.com/people/Ernest- Price/6000000011555505593 and grandfather of actor John Shelton, who named one of his sons Darwin to \\"balance everything out\\".  Biography  Price was born in Havelock, New Brunswick, Canada.\\"Who was who in America\\", Marquis-Who's Who, 1968, p 766 His father died in 1882, and his mother joined the Seventh- day Adventist Church. Price attended Battle Creek College (now Andrews University) between 1891 and 1893. In 1896, he enrolled in a one-year teacher training course at the Provincial Normal School of New Brunswick (now the University of New Brunswick), where he took some elementary courses in some of the natural sciences, including some mineralogy. Price taught at a series of small-town schools from 1897 onwards, including at a high school in Tracadie between 1899 and 1902. While there, socially, he met Alfred Corbett Smith (head of the medical department at a local leprosarium) who loaned him scientific literature. Believing the Earth was young, Price concluded that geologists had misinterpreted their data. In 1902, Price completed the manuscript Outlines of Modern Christianity and Modern Science before leaving Tracadie to serve brief stints as an Adventist evangelist on Prince Edward Island and the head of a new Adventist boarding academy in Nova Scotia. He briefly returned to book-selling in 1904, and then moved to New York City in an attempt to become a magazine and newspaper writer. In a response to a plea from his wife, the Adventist church first employed Price as a construction worker in Maryland. He then was principal of a small Adventist school in Oakland, California, before becoming a construction worker and handyman at a newly purchased Adventist sanitarium in Loma Linda, California, where he published Illogical Geology: The Weakest Point in the Evolution Theory in 1906. In Illogical Geology, Price offered $1000 \\"to any one who will, in the face of the facts here presented, show me how to prove that one kind of fossil is older than another.\\"God and Nature: Historical Essays on the Encounter between Christianity and Science, p400, David C. Lindberg, Ronald L. Numbers From 1907 to 1912, Price taught at the Seventh-day Adventist-run College of Medical Evangelists, now known as Loma Linda University, which awarded him a B.A., based partially on his authorship and independent study. From 1912 to 1914, he taught at the San Fernando Academy in San Fernando, California, and from 1914 to 1916 at Lodi Academy, Lodi, California. Beginning in 1920, Price taught at Pacific Union College, Angwin, California, where he was awarded an M.A. (described by Ronald L. Numbers as a \\"gift\\"). From 1924 to 1928, Price taught at Stanborough Missionary College in Watford, England, where he served as president from 1927 to 1928. He then taught at Emmanual Missionary College (now Andrews University) in Berrien Springs, Michigan from 1929 to 1933, and Walla Walla College near Walla Walla, Washington from 1933 to 1938. While Price claimed that his book-selling travels gave him invaluable \\"firsthand knowledge of field geology\\", his \\"familiarity with the outside world\\" remained rudimentary, with even his own students noting that he could \\"barely tell one fossil from another\\" on a field trip shortly before he retired. In 1943, he moved to Loma Linda, California, where he died 20 years later at the age of 92.Register of George McCready Price Papers (Collection 2) Adventist Heritage Center, p3  Reception  In 1906 David Starr Jordan, president of Stanford University, and a leading American expert on fossil fishes, wrote a review of Price's Illogical Geology, in which he stated that Price should not expect \\"any geologist to take [his work] seriously.\\"D. S. Jordan to G. M. Price, 28 August 1906 (Price Papers, Andrews University, Berrien Springs, Mich.). This led to a correspondence over the next twenty years in which Price once promised \\"to become an evolutionist within twenty-four hours\\" if \\"the foremost ichthyologist in the world\\" could prove that one fossil was older than another, and Jordan attempted to enlighten Price that his views were: Jordan also unsuccessfully urged Price to \\"undertake some constructive work in Paleontology in the field and in laboratories.\\" Numbers says that Seventh-day Adventism is grounded on the Sabbath doctrine of a literal Creation week. To Price, the Sabbath doctrine is what saved Adventists from evolutionism. He adopted Ellen G. White's position on creationism as his own and he sought to persuade the world that a recent creation was required by the Bible and science. Price criticized the 'geologic ages' and strict Lyellian uniformitarianism on which he thought they were based. As an alternative explanation of the geology of the earth, he re-invented Flood geology. He pondered ways to reinterpret the apparent order of the fossils that seemingly implied ancient bygone eras. After studying a wide variety of geologic literature, Price deduced that the \\"facts of the rocks and fossils, stripped of mere theories, splendidly refute this evolutionary theory of the invariable order of the fossils, which is the very backbone of the evolutionary doctrine.\\" He had read of strata containing fossils of a young era lying conformably on strata containing fossils of very old eras. The geologist who described these lithically identical layers said that \\"one would naturally suppose that a single formation was being dealt with, were it not for fossil evidence.\\" To Price, that, and the lack of any evidence of erosion between the strata, implied that little time could have occurred between the two layers of rock. Price also discovered in the literature examples of similar conformable strata, but in the reverse order, the old rocks on top and the young strata below according to interpretation of the fossils. Although appearing \\"to succeed one another conformably\\" the Canadian Geologic Survey contended for over-thrusting principally based on the fossil content. Price's interpretation of the evidence was that \\"the geological record does not prove succession of ages, but rather shows a \\"taxonomic\\" series representing different but contemporaneous zones of antediluvian life.\\" So, in Price's 1913 book, The Fundamentals of Geology, an expanded version of Illogical Geology, he presented the \\"Law of Conformable Stratigraphic Sequences\\" which states \\"any kind of fossiliferous rock may occur conformably on any other kind of fossiliferous rock, old or young.\\" To Price this law was \\"by all odds the most important law ever formulated with reference to the order in which the strata occur.\\"Numbers(2006) p 97 Yale geologist Schuchert's review of The New Geology for the magazine Science stated that Price was \\"harboring a geological nightmare\\".C. Schuchert, Science 59, 486 (1924) However, the creationists welcomed the new book. Harry Rimmer claimed that it was \\"a masterpiece of REAL science [that] explodes in a convincing manner some of the ancient fallacies of science 'falsely so called'\\".H. Rimmer, Modern Science, Noah's Ark and the Deluge (Research Science Bureau, Los Angeles, 1925), p. 28. Within a couple of years, Price appeared prominently in several conservative religious periodicals. A Science editor described him as \\"the principal scientific authority of the Fundamentalists\\".Science 63, 259 (1926) Price, concerned about scientific methodology, had read Whithead and other philosophers and understood that facts were always subject to interpretation. While Price was confident that \\"inductive geology\\" inferred a recent Creation, he acknowledged that debate between creationism and naturalism lay outside of science, \\"across the boundary-line in the domain of philosophy and theology.\\" Just as naturalists regarded facts \\"through the colored spectacles of Darwin and Lyell\\" Creationists used the Bible to interpret the natural world. He said that the Creationary account of origins could never have been developed as a hypothesis from the study of nature alone, rather it was \\"suggested by our religion.\\" In choosing between \\"the two alternatives now before the world,\\" naturalistic geology versus world-catastrophe, there was but one suitable inquiry: \\"Will it give the most rational account nature's evidence?\\" Price's defense of creation science (and attacks on evolution) first achieved wide notability in 1925 when his theories and arguments were utilized heavily by William Jennings Bryan in the famous Scopes Trial. Bryan had appealed to Price for assistance, but Price was busy teaching in England. Price advised Bryan to avoid science during the trial if possible.R. L. Numbers, Spectrum 9, 22 (January 1979). During the trial, defense counsel Clarence Darrow, sneered \\"You mentioned Price because he is the only human being in the world so far as you know that signs his name as a geologist that believes like you do . . . every scientist in this country knows [he] is a mountebank and a pretender and not a geologist at all.\\" Price's ideas were borrowed again in the early 1960s by Henry M. Morris and John Whitcomb in their book The Genesis Flood, a work that skeptic Martin Gardner calls \\"the most significant attack on evolution...since the Scopes trial\\". Morris, in his 1984 book History of Modern Creationism, spoke glowingly of Price's logic and writing style, and referred to reading The New Geology as \\"a life-changing experience for me\\".  Comments about Old Earth creationists  Price was more conservative in his views than Old Earth creationists such as William Jennings Bryan, Harry Rimmer or William Bell Riley. Contrary to Bryan, Rimmer and Riley, Price rejected the idea of a local flood and insisted on a pure literal 6-day creation consisting of six 24-hour days. He felt that Riley's day-age creationist views were \\"the devil's counterfeit\\".G. M. Price. The Story of the Fossils (Pacific Press, Mountain View. Calif., 1954), p 39. Price was equally dismissive of Rimmer, and his gap creationism for most of his career.G. M. Price, Outlines of Modern Christianity and Modern Science (Pactfic Press.

Initially established and owned by the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, the paper has been published by Martin Cauchon and his company, Capitales M√©dias, since 2015. History The newspaper was launched on March 27, 1913 as a tool to condemn Regulation 17, an Ontario law that restricted education in French at that time. Today, it defends federalism in Canada as well as provincial jurisdictions. It is still involved in the protection of francophone rights in Ontario, notably advocating for the survival of the Montfort Hospital during the government of Ontario premier Mike Harris. Match- workers on strike in 1924, seen in front of the offices of Le Droit. In the 1960s, Le Droit tried to extend its market into Northeastern Ontario, including the North Bay, Timmins and Sudbury areas, all of which have large francophone populations. However, it quickly abandoned the project due to high costs. Originally published as a broadsheet, it switched to tabloid format in 1988, following an 11-week strike by the pressmen. The newspaper also had a previous strike in 1982. In 2001, Gesca, a subsidiary of Power Corporation owned by Franco-Ontarian Paul Desmarais acquired the paper from Conrad Black's Hollinger, who owned it between 1987 and 2001. In the eighties, it belonged to Montreal-based Jacques Francoeur, the founder of Sunday weekly Dimanche-Matin, who built the Unimedia chain which included Le Soleil (Quebec City) and Le Quotidien (Chicoutimi, now Saguenay). He acquired Le Droit from the Oblates. In 2015, Gesca sold six of its francophone titles, including Le Droit, to Martin Cauchon, a former minister in the Jean Chr√©tien government. Terms were not disclosed. The publisher is Jacques Pronovost since 2007. Before him, it was led by Claude Gagnon (2002‚Äì2007), Pierre Bergeron (1993‚Äì2002), Gilbert Lacasse (1987‚Äì1993) and Jean-Robert B√©langer ( ‚Äì 1987). Managing editors: Jean Gagnon (at present), Andr√© Larocque (2006‚Äì2010), Michel Gauthier (2001‚Äì2006), Fran√ßois Roy (1994‚Äì2001), Claude Beauregard (1994), Gilbert Lavoie (1991‚Äì1994), Andr√© Pr√©fontaine (1989‚Äì1991), etc. Today It is the only francophone daily newspaper currently published in Ontario for the Franco- Ontarian community and was the fourth all-time (the previous three existed in the 19th century). It is also read by francophones who live in and around Gatineau, Quebec, directly across the Ottawa River from Ottawa. Its articles can also be read on the internet in the Cyberpresse network, which also includes La Presse in Montreal, Le Soleil in Quebec City, Le Nouvelliste in Trois-Rivi√®res, La Tribune in Sherbrooke, La Voix de l'Est in Granby and Le Quotidien in Saguenay. Its main offices are located near the ByWard Market with a second office located at Les Promenades de l'Outaouais in Gatineau. It currently has about 150 employees. Controversy In 2008, Sudbury's francophone community newspaper Le Voyageur published an editorial criticizing the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission for its handling of Le5 Communications' application to acquire two francophone radio stations, CHYC-FM in Sudbury and CHYK-FM in Timmins. The paper took issue with the fact that the CRTC's original notice of hearing was published only in Le Droit, and not in any of the region's local media‚Äîthereby giving the francophone community in Northeastern Ontario little notice of either the pending transaction or the deadlines for reviewing and submitting comments regarding the application. \\"Le CRTC au service des gens, vraiment?\\", Le Voyageur, September 24, 2008.

The war's name is derived from the Danish tactic of employing small gunboats against the conventional Royal Navy. In Scandinavia it is seen as the later stage of the English Wars, whose commencement is accounted as the First Battle of Copenhagen in 1801. Background The naval conflict between Britain and Denmark-Norway commenced with the First Battle of Copenhagen in 1801 when Horatio Nelson's squadron of Admiral Parker's fleet attacked the Danish capital. This came as a basis of Denmark-Norway's policy of armed neutrality during the latter stages of the French Revolutionary Wars, where Denmark used its naval forces to protect trade flowing within, into and out of the Danish-Norwegian waters. Hostilities between Denmark-Norway and the United Kingdom broke out again by the Second Battle of Copenhagen in 1807, when the British attacked the Danish capital to ensure that the Danish-Norwegian fleet did not fall into the hands of Napoleon. Danish boat design As a result of the British confiscation and destruction of large parts of the Danish-Norwegian fleet during the assault on Copenhagen, the Dano-Norwegian government decided to build gunboats in large numbers to compensate the loss. The gunboats were originally designed by a Swede, Fredrik Henrik af Chapman, and the strategic advantage of gunboats lay in the fact that they could be produced rapidly and inexpensively throughout the kingdom. The tactical advantages were that they were highly manoeuvrable, especially in still and shallow waters and presented small targets. On the other hand, the boats were vulnerable and likely to sink from a single hit. They therefore could not be used in rough seas, and they were less effective against large warships. Still, the Danish-Norwegian government produced more than 200 gunboats in two models: the shallop gunboat which had a crew of 76 men, with an 18- or 24-pounder cannon in the bow and another in the stern, and the smaller barge type that had a total crew of 24 men, armed with a single 24-pounder. Danish shallop gunboat The Danish Commodore (later, Admiral) Steen Andersen Bille (1751‚Äì1833) is credited with being the driving force behind the post-1807 Dano-Norwegian strategy of gunboat warfare. Below Danish Naval Museum - Nestved but see note below is a description of each of the four classes of gunboats according to Junior Lieutenant Hans Georg Garde, himself a commander of one of the larger types of gunboats.H G Garde *Kanonchaluppen: These were the larger type of gunboat. Each was armed with two 24-pounder cannon and four 4-pounder howitzers and had a wartime establishment of 69 ‚Äì 79 men. *Kanonjollen: These were the smaller type of gunboat. Each was armed with one 24-pounder cannon and two 4-pounder howitzers, and had wartime establishment of 41 men. *Morterchaluppen: These were the larger, mortar-armed gunboats. Each was armed with one 100-pounder mortar and two 4-pounder howitzers, and had a wartime establishment of 40 men. *Morterbarkasserne: These were smaller, mortar-armed gunboats. Each was armed with one mortar and had a wartime establishment of 19 men. They were little more than ordinary ships‚Äô boats into which a mortar had been set. They had a tendency to leak badly after 5 ‚Äì 7 mortar shells had been fired. Their crews then had to bring them back into harbour, remove the mortar, and recaulk their vessels. Reserve crew who could not be accommodated on board were quartered in buildings on land or in the frigate Triton which was in ordinary. Battle-ready gunboats had their crews on board. Defences on the Norwegian coast in 1808 are listed at Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy order of battle in Norway (1808). Ten schooner- rigged gunboats capable of operating in the rougher Norwegian Sea were built in Bergen and Trondheim in the years 1808 to 1811. War In the first three years of the Gunboat War, these boats were on several occasions able to capture cargo ships from the convoys and to defeat British naval brigs, though they were not strong enough to overcome larger frigates and ships of the line. The British had control of Danish waters during the whole of the 1807‚Äì1814 war, and when the season was suited to navigation they were regularly able to escort large merchant convoys out through the Sound and the Great Belt. Although the discussion below focuses on armed encounters involving an exchange of fire, one must keep in mind that the British also captured numerous Danish privateers without firing a shot, and conducted an economic war, regularly seizing merchant vessels as prizes. Further economic damage was done by raids on the smaller islands,In Danish: Steffen Hahnemann og Mette Roepstorff: Endelave og den Engelske Fregat 1994In Danish: Sams√∏s Historie samt Tun√∏s Historie‚Äù by J P Nielsen in 1946 many populated but undefended. British warships landed to replenish firewood and water supplies, and forcibly to buy, commandeer or simply take livestock to augment their provisions. The war overlapped, in time, the Anglo-Russian War. As a result, the British expanded their trade embargo to Russian waters and the British navy conducted forays northwards into the Barents Sea. The navy conducted raids on Hasvik and Hammerfest and disrupted the Pomor trade, the Norwegian trade with Russia. =1807‚Äì08= On 12 August 1807, even before the war had been declared, the British sixth-rate took part in a notable, illegal, and ultimately one-sided single-ship action when she captured the 32-gun Danish frigate (fregat) Friderichsv√¶rn. In the engagement the British suffered only one man wounded; the Danes lost 12 men while 20 were wounded, some mortally. Lloyd's List described the Danish vessel as a \\"Danish Frigate, of 32 Guns, late Guardship\\", and reported that the action, near Elsinor, had been short.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4184. The Royal Navy took Frederiksv√¶rn into service as . bombardment of Copenhagen in September 1807 On 23 August, the British fired Congreve rockets from her decks against a Danish gunboat flotilla, but the attack had little effect.Munch-Petersen, p.201. The British were instead more successful on 11 September when brought to the British Admiralty the despatches from Admiral Thomas McNamara Russell announcing the capitulation of the small island of Heligoland to the British. Heligoland later also became a centre for smuggling and for espionage against Napoleon. In the East Indies, troops from the 14th Regiment of Foot landed from on the Coromandel Coast on 13 February 1808 and took over the Danish possessions at Tranquebar. On 14 March, the 14-gun and the Danish 20-gun sloop HDMS Lougen engaged in an inconclusive single-ship action.Cust (1862), Vol. 2, p. 132. Childers lost two men killed and nine wounded before she could escape and return to Leith.Brett (1871), p.256. On 22 March the British ships of the line HMS Nassau and destroyed the last Danish ship of the line, HDMS Prinds Christian Frederik, commanded by Captain C.W. Jessen, in the Battle of Zealand Point. Nassau was herself a former Danish vessel. Nassau had one man killed and 16 men wounded, while Stately had four killed and 27 wounded. The Danes lost 55 men killed and 88 wounded.Brett (1871), p.256. Battle of Zealand Point Boats from and , supported by the brig , drove ashore a Dano-Norwegian convoy at Flodstrand, near The Skaw on 22 April. The convoy was taking supplies for the relief of Norway as a result of food shortages that had occurred there after the British had begun their blockade between Denmark and Norway in 1807. The British went in under heavy fire from the shore and a castle there and brought out five brigs, three galliots, a schooner, and a sloop (totalling some 870 tons burthen), for the loss of five men wounded. The British frigate also approached Bergen under Dutch colours on 15 May in order to attack the Dutch frigate Guelderland, which had been undergoing repairs there. Unfortunately for the British the Guelderland had already sailed, so during the night the British sent in boats in an attempt to attack other shipping in the harbour. When the boats came under heavy fire, Tartar came in to cover them, only to come under attack by the schooner Odin and five gunboats. During the Battle of Alv√∏en Tartars captain and another seaman were killed and twelve men were wounded before Tartar was able to make her escape. The Spanish Division of the North sent to fight the British in Denmark pledging to turn against France and side with the British The hired armed cutter Swan found herself in action off the island of Bornholm with a Danish 8-gun cutter-rigged vessel on 24 May.James (1837), Vol 5, pp.33‚Äì4. Swan had been carrying despatches when she had spotted the Danish vessel and lured her out. The engagement ended with the Danish vessel exploding, while Swan suffered no casualties despite coming under fire both from the Danish vessel and the batteries on Bornholm. The fire from the batteries and the sighting of more Danish vessels forced Swan to withdraw after the battle without being able to make efforts to rescue survivors. On 4 June four Danish gunboats attacked and captured her after a four-hour fight. Tickler had lost her captain and 14 other men killed, and 22 other officers and men killed and wounded out of her crew of 50 men; the Danes had one man wounded.Brett (1871), p.256. The Danes would later use Tickler as a cadet training ship.Wandell (1915), p.260. The Danes were also victorious on 19 June, when the brig pursued and caught up with the Danish brig HDMS Lougen, which was armed with eighteen short 18-pounder guns and two long 6-pounder guns. About 20 minutes into the engagement six Danish gunboats arrived from behind some rocks and in two divisions of three each took up positions on Seagulls quarter and fired on her with their 24-pounder guns while Lougen fired on her larboard bow. Within half an hour the Danish fire had badly damaged Seagulls rigging and dismounted five of her guns. Eventually Seagull struck, having lost eight men killed and 20 wounded, including her captain, R.B. Cathcart. Seagull sank soon after the Danes captured her, drowning several of her captors who were aboard. The Danes later recovered Seagull and added her to their navy. The Danes also captured . Sixteen Danish gunboats captured her off Langeland in the Great Belt on 2 August.

The British, however, were less fortunate on 5 December, when the bomb vessel was wrecked on Anholt Reef while caught in the ice. The reason that the vessel sank in that area was because the Danes had closed the lighthouse on the island of Anholt, in the Kattegat early during the war, and the Admiralty had ordered her to station herself off the island on 9 November to carry a light for the safety of passing convoys. All her crew was however saved. =1809‚Äì10= The British 64-gun third rate , under Captain Aiskew Paffard Hollis, and the 18-pounder 36-gun frigate captured the island of Anholt on 18 May 1809. A party of seamen and marines under the command of Captain William Selby of Owen Glendower, with the assistance of Captain Edward Nicolls of the Standards marines, landed. The Danish garrison of 170 men put up a sharp, but ineffectual resistance that killed one British marine and wounded two before the garrison then surrendered and the British took immediate possession of the island. The principal objective of the mission was to restore the lighthouse on Anholt to its pre-war state to facilitate the movement of British men of war and merchantmen navigating the dangerous seas there.James (1827), 130. Danish gunboats seizing , 9 June 1808. On 9 June a Danish and Norwegian flotilla of twenty-one gunboats and seven mortar boats attacked a British convoy of 70 merchant ships off the island of Saltholm in √òresund Strait near Copenhagen. The Dano-Norwegian flotilla was able to capture 12 or 13 merchant vessels, plus , one of the escorts. The Danes also captured HMS Allart during the Battle of Saltholm on 10 August. During the battle HMS Allart, a former Danish Navy brig, chased Lougen and Seagull into Fredriksvern only to find herself pursued by 15 Danish gunboats, arrayed in three divisions. After a three-hour chase the gunboats closed with Allart and an engagement began. After two hours Allart struck, having had her rigging shot away and having lost one man killed and three wounded. On 12 August, Commander John Willoughby Marshall and were in the company of the gun-brig , Lieutenant Thomas Fitzgerald, when they discovered three Danish luggers off the Danish coast. The water was too shallow for Lynx, so Marshall sent Monkey and boats from Lynx in to cut them out. The largest of the luggers, which had four guns and four howitzers, opened fire on Monkey before all three luggers ran ashore once Monkey and the launch's 18-pounder carronade returned fire. The British refloated the luggers and brought them out the next day, having taken no casualties. In their haste to quit the vessel, the Danes failed to fire the fuse on a cask of gunpowder they had left by the fireplace on the largest lugger.Norrie (1827), p.202. Marshall thought the Danes' behaviour in leaving the explosive device disgraceful. The Danish-Norwegian navy managed to capture another British vessel on 2 September, when a Danish gunboat flotilla from Fladstrand, North Jutland, under the command of Lieutenant Nicolai H. Tuxen, captured the gun-brig . The engagement cost Minx two dead and nine wounded. The British Royal Navy had stationed her off the Skaw Reef to show a warning light. reported the loss to the Admiralty. English Brig Attacked by Danish-Norwegian gunboat Early in 1810 the Danes ceased sending provisioning ships to Norway because of British naval activity in √òresund and withdrew the naval officers that were so involved to Zealand. Meanwhile, there were difficulties in transporting grain from the Vordingborg, in the south of Denmark, past M√∏n to Copenhagen. This was overcome by using gunboats to convoy the merchant vessels, as the gunboats were much more maneuverable in the shallow coastal waters, and restricting the cargo vessels to those which could pass inside of M√∏n. Larger seagoing ships which would have to go outside, i.e. east of M√∏n, were too liable to be caught by the British. These actions, together with a good form of coastal signalling, resulted in a steady supply of grain to the Danish capital.Wandel CF (1815) pages 265‚Äì267 On 13 April 1810, four Danish gunboats, under the command of First Lieutenant Peter Nicolay Skibsted, captured the British gunboat off the Djursland peninsula near Gren√•. Grinder was armed with one 24-pounder gun and one 24-pounder carronade. She was under the command of Master's Mate Thomas Hester and had over-wintered at Anholt. Of her crew of 34 men, two were killed and two wounded in the action. On 23 May, seven Danish gunboats engaged the Cruizer- class brig-sloop , , and His Majesty's hired armed cutter Princess of Wales, off the Skaw. The engagement cost the Danes the loss of one gunboat, which blew up, and heavy damage to the rest. The Battle of Silda was fought on 23 July near the Norwegian island of Silda. The British frigates and attacked the pilot's station on the island and defeated the three gun schooners Odin, Tor and Balder and the gun barge Cort Adeler, which were stationed there. On 12 September, six Danish gunboats captured a becalmed Alban after a four-hour battle during which she lost her captain and one man killed and three men wounded. The Danes then took her into service as The Alban. =1811‚Äì14= Danish gunboats manned by nearly 1,000 men, including infantry forces attempted to recapture Anholt on 27 February 1811. The Battle of Anholt resulted in a Danish withdrawal to Jutland, with heavy losses. The Danes did however emerge victorious on 23 April when Swan encountered three Danish gunboats in Sunningesund. A shot from one of the gunboats damaged Swan and resulted in the wetting of her powder magazine, forcing her surrender. The Danes boarded her but were able to retrieve little before Swan sank off Uddevalla, on the Swedish coast north of Gothenburg. The fight cost Swan two men killed,as the same battle apparently also resulted in the damaging of the hired armed cutter Hero.Anderson (1910), p.344. On 11 May, recaptured Alban from the Danes. The capture occurred after a 12-hour chase near Shetland. At the time of her capture Alban was armed with 12 guns and had a crew of 58 men, all under the command of a lieutenant of the Danish navy. She was three days out of Farsund in Norway and had taken no prizes. Battle of Lyng√∏r On 31 July 1811, and were cruising together in Long Sound, Norway, when they encountered and engaged three Danish brigs: the 20-gun Langeland, the 18-gun L√ºgum, and the 16-gun Kiel. Outnumbered and outgunned, the British vessels took flight.Naval Chronicle Vol. 26 (Jul‚ÄìDec 1811), pp.284‚Äì6. The next day Brev Drageren unsuccessfully re-engaged first one and then two of the brigs. In the inconclusive engagement each British vessel sustained one man killed, and Brev Drageren also had three wounded. On 17 August sailed from Sheerness with a convoy for the Baltic. On 2 September, while she was cruising off Arendal on the Norwegian coast in the company of , three Danish 18-gun-brigs (Alsen, Lolland, and Sams√∏) engaged them.James (1837), Vol. 5, pp.347‚Äì8. Lolland engaged Manly while the other two chased Chanticleer but she maintained a course away from the action and made good her escape. In the engagement with Lolland, Manly had her spars and rigging cut to pieces. With only six guns left, and having lost one man killed and three wounded, Manly was forced to strike. The last major fight between Danish and British warships took place on 6 July 1812 during the Battle of Lyng√∏r, when a small squadron of British warships met a small squadron of Danish warships at Lyng√∏r on the Norwegian coast. The British withdrew after destroying the Danish frigate Najaden. On 2 August the same year, boats of , which was under the command of Captain Lord George Stuart, captured two Danish vessels, under the command of Lieutenant Hans Buderhof, and their prize, an American vessel of about 400 tons burthen (bm). The two Danish vessels were schooner No. 114 (of six 6-pounders and 30 men), and cutter No. 97 (of four 6-pounders and 22 men). In the action the British lost nine men killed and 16 wounded, of whom two died of their wounds; the Danes lost ten men killed and 13 wounded. As a result of the Swedish invasion of Holstein in December 1813 during the War of the Sixth Coalition, Denmark-Norway was forced to seek peace, and the Treaty of Kiel ended the war on 14 January 1814. Denmark-Norway had to cede Heligoland to Britain and the Kingdom of Norway to the King of Sweden, while Denmark did get back the island of Anholt.

She was one of only two U.S. Navy ships to have a predominantly African- American enlisted complement during the war, the other being the . PC-1264 was in service for less than two years, but the performance of her crew‚Äîand of USS Masons‚Äîled the U.S. Navy to reevaluate its perception of African Americans as members of the fleet. Although sold for scrapping, the ship remains at the Donjon Marine Yard in Rossville, Staten Island. Career USS PC-1264 was laid down at Consolidated Shipbuilding Company in Morris Heights, New York, on 7 October 1943 and launched on 28 November 1943.Priolo and Radigan 2005. PC-1264 was a United States Navy . This patrol class of submarine chaser was intended to intercept and destroy German U-boats stationed off the coast of the United States. Less expensive and faster to build than destroyers or even destroyer escorts, and requiring smaller crews, they quickly filled an important need for coastal convoy protection and anti-submarine warfare.Purdon 1972, pp. 29‚Äì30. PC-1264 was commissioned in April 1944 and decommissioned in February 1946, serving a little less than 22 months as a U.S. Navy fighting ship.Purdon 1972, pp. 52‚Äì57, 247 =Segregated ships= On 9 December 1941, the NAACP sent a telegram to Frank Knox, U.S. Secretary of the Navy, asking that African Americans be accepted into the navy in other than the messman branch. This request was refused. A 17 December letter from the NAACP to President Roosevelt resulted in the president turning the matter over to Mark Ethridge, chairman of the Fair Employment Practices Committee. This committee also received a negative response from the Navy Department. The president then sent a note to Secretary Knox stating: > I think that with all the Navy activities, BUNAV might find something that > colored enlistees could do in addition to the rating of messman.Purdon 1972. > pp. 17‚Äì25. The navy's General Board, the group charged with the formulation of navy policy, countered with a suggestion that African Americans either be enlisted as messmen, or, \\"...if this proved not feasible,\\" for general service. The problem was that the navy believed that integrated units would disrupt discipline aboard ships, entirely ignoring the fact that integrated crews had worked successfully aboard U.S. Navy ships during the American Civil War. The president responded, agreeing that \\"...to go the whole way in one fell swoop would seriously impair the general average efficiency of the Navy,\\" but still felt that something could be worked out. On 27 March 1942, the Board replied, \\"The General Board fully recognizes, and appreciates the social and economic problems involved, and has striven to reconcile these requirements with what it feels must be paramount at any consideration, namely the maintenance at the highest level of the fighting efficiency of the Navy...\\", adding that \\"...if so ordered..\\" Negro units could be used \\"...with least disadvantage...\\" in shore establishments, local defense vessels, construction units and selected Coast Guard cutters.Purdon 1972. pp. 17‚Äì25. On 7 April, the president 'so ordered,' and the navy announced that‚Äîbeginning on 1 June‚ÄîNegroes could enlist for the general service. As a result, the groundwork was laid for establishing African-American crews on USS Mason and USS PC-1264.Purdon 1972. pp. 17‚Äì25. =Commanding officers and POs= White officer Lieutenant Eric S. Purdon served as PC-1264s commanding officer from her commissioning on 25 April 1944 until 17 September 1945. He was replaced by his engineering officer, Lieutenant (jg) Ernest V. Hardman, who served as skipper until 31 October 1945. The third commanding officer was Lieutenant (jg) Jack W. Sutherland who came aboard on 31 October and helped decommission PC-1264 on 7 February 1946.Purdon 1972, p. 251. Lt. Eric Purdon, the ship's first commanding officer, reads the official orders directing him to assume command. From that point, until PC-1264 was out of service, she was in the charge of African American Ensign Samuel L. Gravely, Jr. Ensign Gravely had first reported aboard on 2 May 1945, and, at the time of the ship's decommissioning, was serving as her executive officer. PC-1264 was the first sailing assignment of future Admiral Gravely, the first African American to attain that rank.Purdon 1972, p. 251. In addition to the all-white officer complement, until the day Ensign Gravely reported aboard, eight white navy Petty Officers (PO), one in each specialty required on PC-1264, were also assigned to the ship. Their job was to train the African-American crew until Lt. Purdon considered some of the men expert enough in their specialty to rate promotion to petty officer. Months later, when eight African-American crewmen were promoted in their specialties, the white petty officers were transferred.Purdon 1972, pp. 24‚Äì25, 43. This made PC-1264 the only U.S. Navy ship with a completely African- American crew, as USS Mason never replaced its white petty officers with African Americans.Purdon 1972, p. 24. PC-1264s enlisted complement on the fantail, at the time of her commissioning ceremonies. =Training incidents= On 30 April 1944, after four days of intensive drills, PC-1264 went up the Hudson River to Iona Island to load ammunition for her guns for the first time. After loading, Lt. Purdon expected to moor there for the night, but was not allowed due to the danger from the large amount of ammunition stored there. Looking for a berth for the night, he called the duty office of the nearby U.S. Military Academy at West Point to ask if his ship could tie up at its pier. There was some confusion, as no Navy ship had tied up there in recent history. However, PC-1264, with its mostly African-American crew was made welcome, and numerous visitors walked along the dock inspecting her. In addition, the U.S. Army provided two buses, and many of the enlisted crewmen were taken on a tour of the Academy under the guidance of knowledgeable sergeants.Purdon 1972, pp. 63‚Äì67 Unfortunately for PC-1264, a number of other U.S. Navy bases and towns where the ship moored during its tour of duty did not extend the same hospitality as West Point. Especially in the southern United States, PC-1264s crew experienced various degrees of racial intolerance. For example, although most U.S. Navy seamen from nearby training facilities took their swimming tests off a pier at the municipal public beach at Miami Beach, on the day the crew of PC-1264 was supposed to qualify, the city of Miami Beach refused the use of its public beach for the training of Negroes.Purdon 1972, p. 45. At the Submarine Chaser Training Center in Miami, the civilian guards at the gate often took a long time inspecting the crew's ID cards and passes when the men were entering and leaving the base, far longer than the time spent inspecting white seamen. Then one day, this suddenly stopped. It took some time before the officers of PC-1264 were able to discover why. At a local bar, white seamen of another anti-submarine patrol craft had overhead civilians talking about going down to the base to shoot up the \\"nigger ship.\\" These seamen returned to base, armed themselves with rifles and pistols without authorization and went to the gate to wait. When the nervous civilian guards asked what they were doing, the white seamen explained. After that the officers and crew of PC-1264 noticed that racial harassment at this base decreased significantly.Purdon 1972, pp. 94‚Äì95. =Shakedown cruise= After loading ammunition at Iona Island and leaving West Point, the ship sailed to Fort Lafayette to load depth charges. Then it reported to the United States Naval Frontier Base at Tompkinsville, Staten Island, New York, which became the PC-1264s home port. This base cared for the escort ships that accompanied convoys to many destinations. Once at Tompkinsville, the ship's crew continued training and calibrating their equipment, especially the ship's radio direction finder. Besides checking the structural strength of the hull and target practice on the range at Sandy Hook, the ship went through many other tests before going to sea for the first time. Finally, PC-1264 was ready for its shakedown cruise to the Submarine Chaser Training Center in Miami, Florida.Purdon 1972, pp. 67‚Äì74 Upon arrival at Miami, the shakedown inspectors gave the ship and crew a rough going over for several days. However, the crew was jubilant when the ship received a glowing report. Leaving soon after on its first independent cruise, at about 10:35 am the ship encountered engine trouble and was stopped dead in the water far from land. After some delay, a naval tug returned the ship to post after midnight.Purdon 1972, pp. 85‚Äì89. A depth charge explodes astern during a practice anti-submarine run during the ship's shakedown tests. On 2 July 1944, the ship's shakedown cruise and post-inspection was completed. PC-1264 was then ordered to a three and a half-days' exercise at the Fleet Sound School in Key West. However, as far as the Submarine Chaser Training Center was concerned, PC-1264 was ready. Fifteen members of the crew also received the ship's first promotions.Purdon 1972, p. 97. =Escort duty= After completing Fleet Sound School, PC-1264 returned to New York and reported for duty on 10 July 1944. She was assigned to Task Unit 02.9, a surface escort group based at the Naval Frontier Base, Staten Island. In the months ahead, PC-1264 would escort convoys from New York to Cuba or Key West and back again, or from Charleston, South Carolina to New York. She escorted the from New York to Key West so that U.S. air and sea anti-submarine forces would not confuse Argo with a German submarine. PC-1264 would also serve in the role of an \\"enemy destroyer\\" to provide submarines with anti-escort training, which also gave additional anti-submarine training to PC-1264s crew.Purdon 1972, pp. 103, 106‚Äì108, 131‚Äì140 Its first convoy duty was Convoy NG-448, from New York to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. On 21 July sonar indicated a large unidentified object nearby and, acting on standard anti-submarine procedures, PC-1264 engaged the contact for three hours before leaving to rejoin the convoy, which was now safely out of range. Afterwards, she regularly escorted convoys from New York to Key West and back again.Purdon 1972, pp. 107‚Äì109. In September 1944, the engineering section discovered a series of cracks between the engine mounts and bedplates (girders supporting the engines) that were welded to the ship's hull. These bedplates distributed the engine's weight along the hull. Base engineering confirmed that poor welding during construction was responsible for the cracks. The base engineer also stated that a heavy sea could shift the engines off their supports and sink the ship. As a result, PC-1264 was relieved from duty and towed to the Navy Yard Annex, at Bayonne, New Jersey. This may have saved the lives of the crew, as the convoy they were preparing to escort later encountered a hurricane with heavy seas. In all probability, PC-1264 would have been lost.Purdon 1972, pp. 116‚Äì117. After the ship was repaired and passed sea trials, PC-1264 reported again to its Tompkinsville base. It was there, during the first week of November, that the eight white Petty Officers received orders detaching them from PC-1264, and their places were taken by eight, newly promoted, black Petty Officers.Purdon 1972, p. 127. =Independent anti-submarine duty= In early January 1945, as PC-1264 and other escort ships were sailing with a convoy to Key West, the command vessel received a radio message from Eastern Sea Frontier headquarters detaching three of the ships, including PC-1264, and ordering their return to New York. While PC-1264 would escort one more convoy during the war, her primary mission now was anti-submarine duty. The capture of German spies landed by during November 1944, and the statement by one of the spies that the Germans were preparing to launch V-1 and V-2 rockets by submarines against major U.S. ports, forced the U.S. Navy to respond by increasing its active anti-submarine forces. PC-1264 was part of that increase and began patrolling areas from Long Island south to Cape Charles, the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay.Purdon 1972, pp. 157‚Äì160. On 17 January, PC-1264 unloaded her ammunition, then proceeded to the Luders Marine Construction Company in Stamford, Connecticut to have her bottom cleaned and receive a new coat of paint on her underwater hull. She arrived on 18 January and was in drydock for three days. For the next three months, PC-1264 patrolled a line running north by east for from Buoy \\"Able,\\" the farthest seaward buoy marking the mine-swept channel into New York, away. Despite the monotony and the winter weather, the duty was pleasant, as PC-1264 spent seven days at sea and then five days in port.Purdon 1972, pp. 161‚Äì165. Officers and crew line the rails while in port. On 28 February, while engaged in a practice \\"anti-submarine' run against Buoy Able, PC-1264 may have flushed a German submarine that was using Buoy Able as cover against sonar from patrolling vessels. As the ship neared the end of the practice run against the buoy, the sonar operator reported \\"Target bearing left rapidly.\\" Lt. Purdon quickly realized what had probably happened and PC-1264 actively engaged the target with Mark 22 Antisubmarine Projectiles. This continued for several hours, and, at one point, two crewmen claimed to have seen a submarine conning tower rise briefly then sink back into the turbulence. Eventually the signal disappeared. While Eastern Sea Frontier headquarters believed that the ship had engaged a false signal, the crew always believed that they had flushed U-866, a damaged submarine sunk two weeks later off Sable Island, east of Nova Scotia.Purdon 1972, pp. 165‚Äì172. On 23 April, PC-1264 left Tompkinsville on her last patrol. On 25 April, while at sea, the ship received new orders. PC-1264 was ordered to proceed to Charleston, South Carolina and assume command of the escort ships for Convoy KN-382. Although PC-1264 had participated in escorting many convoys, this was the first time she was to be in command of the escort group. This was an indication of the confidence Eastern Sea Frontier headquarters now had in PC-1264. On 27 April, PC-1264, accompanied by PC-1149 and PC-1547, led 30 merchant ships out of Charleston harbor. The convoy was to sail eastward to rendezvous with a smaller convoy heading north from Key West. The next morning, the 30-ship convoy met the northbound convoy of nine merchantmen escorted by three frigates and three subchasers. was in command of this convoy and PC-1264 reported in, turned over command of the 30 merchantmen, and assumed position on the starboard beam of the joining convoys. With the arrival of the three subchasers from Charleston, two of the smaller subchasers were detached for other duties. The next afternoon, two of the frigates also left.Purdon 1972, pp. 179‚Äì188. On 29 April, the convoy encountered U-548, which was attacked by USS Natchez. The convoy and the other escorts, including PC-1264 continued on course with USS Natchez remaining to deal with U-548. Later that night the convoy encountered Task Group 02.10, a Hunter-Killer Group, which passed down the port side of the convoy on its way assist USS Natchez. Two of the destroyer escorts in this group participated in the destruction of U-548, one of the last anti-submarine actions of the war in the Atlantic.Purdon 1972, pp. 192‚Äì200. =Battle of the Atlantic ends= Convoy NK-686 started from New York with 28 cargo ships and tankers with PC-1264 as one of the convoy's five escort ships. While the war in Europe had officially ended the day before, the Commander of Eastern Sea Frontier was not taking any chances that individual German submarines might continue the battle. As the convoy headed south toward Key West, 15 ships joined when it passed the Chesapeake Bay, while others left it for the ports of Charleston, Savannah and Jacksonville. Then, on 15 May, Eastern Sea Frontier headquarters was convinced the danger was over, and the merchantmen were dispersed to head for their destinations alone. The escort ships, Task Unit 02.9.10, were ordered to Key West for a week's training before returning to New York. On the return trip to Tompkinsville, New York, where Task Unit 02.9.10 arrived on 25 May, the crews' concern was where they were headed next, as there was still a war in the Pacific.Purdon 1972, pp. 208‚Äì213. As PC-1264 remained in a crowded anchorage filled with numerous other escort vessels, the crew watched as many other submarine chasers had their K-guns, that fired the depth charges, removed and their 20 mm guns replaced by twin-barreled guns of the same caliber. These ships were headed for the Pacific where men-of-war needed heavy anti-aircraft defenses against Japanese suicide planes. Finally the word came down: > From Chief of Naval Operations. To USS PC1264. When in all respects ready > for sea, and when directed by Commander Eastern Sea Frontier, you will > proceed to Norfolk, Virginia, and report to Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic > Fleet, for training. Upon completion of refresher training, you will proceed > via Canal Zone and report to Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet.Purdon 1972, > pp. 214‚Äì216. PC-1264 soon had her K-guns removed from the afterdeck, and on 31 July she left for Norfolk. After an inspection by base personnel, PC-1264 left for Miami and arrived at the Submarine Chaser Training Center on 5 August. PC-1264 was due to remain at the Center for ten days training, but an incident cut that time short.Purdon 1972, pp. 220‚Äì221. Officers, crew and mascot pose for a photograph. One night, at a club that served African Americans, a small fight resulted in the club owner calling the Shore Patrol. When the three white members of the Shore Patrol arrived‚Äîa Navy Chief, another enlisted sailor, and an army MP‚Äîthe chief stayed with the vehicle while the other two entered the club. There, they spotted a black sailor in an officer's uniform. Since impersonating an officer is a Federal offense, the MP went over to that man. The man suspected of \\"impersonating an officer\\" was actually Ensign Sam Gravely. When the MP told Ensign Gravely that the chief wanted to see him, Gravely replied, \\"If the Chief wants to see me, tell him to come here.\\"‚Äîfollowing correct naval protocol for an enlisted man to come to an officer. The MP then grabbed Ensign Gravely out of his chair. \\"Take it easy,\\" Ensign Gravely shouted to the other men in the club who were visibly upset; then added, \\"This is only a mistake.\\" Then to the MP, he said, \\"Let's go.\\" However, the word spread quickly that Ensign Gravely was being arrested. Black sailors converged on the MP and the Shore Patrol chief radioed for reinforcements. Two more Shore Patrol vehicles with more men soon arrived, to find Ensign Gravely trying to calm the men and explain the mistake to the Shore Patrol. However, Shore Patrol personnel in the two vehicles quickly emerged and forced a number of PC-1264s crew into the trucks. Ensign Gravely got into the chief's vehicle, and all proceeded to Shore Patrol Headquarters.Purdon 1972, pp. 221‚Äì223. One of PC-1264s crew ran for the ship to tell the captain what had happened. When Lieutenant Purdon arrived at Shore Patrol headquarters he found the Shore Patrol officer on duty apologizing to Ensign Gravely as the Ensign had explained the MP's mistake. However, the men who had moved against the Shore Patrol, seeking to defend Ensign Gravely, were charged with \\"Refusal to Obey Orders of Shore Patrol,\\" \\"Interference with Shore Patrol,\\" two charges of \\"Drunk and Disorderly,\\" and one charge of \\"Drunk.\\" The next morning at base headquarters, Lieutenant Purdon was informed that the admiral commanding the naval district wanted Lieutenant Purdon to \\"institute general count martial proceedings against that ensign for 'conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman'\\". Lieutenant Purdon, as the commanding officer of PC-1264, refused, citing Navy Regulations that a commandant of a naval district could not order a ship's captain to bring charges against any officer under that ship captain's command. The base adjutant, hearing and understanding the facts behind the incident, advised Lieutenant Purdon to restrict his men to the ship and, therefore, out of reach of the Shore Patrol and the admiral, which Lieutenant Purdon did. PC-1264 spent four more days in training and left Miami for Key West.Purdon 1972, pp 223‚Äì226. =End of the war= Key West was as far west as PC-1264 ever sailed. The day after her arrival, President Truman announced that an atomic bomb had been dropped on Japan. With her orders canceled, PC-1264 waited at Key West for three weeks. Eventually, the Bureau of Naval Personnel issued plans for demobilization. Lieutenant Purdon requested to be released from active duty and recommended that Lieutenant (jg) Ernest Hardmann, his executive officer, be given command. On 5 September, orders arrived for PC-1264 to proceed to Norfolk, where Lieutenant Purdon would turn over command to Lt. Hardmann. PC-1264 arrived at Norfolk on 10 September, and the change of command ceremony took place on 17 September. Before this ceremony, members of the crews already were being released from active duty or transferred to other stations. Also, the crew presented Lieutenant Purdon with a desk lamp with the inscription \\"USS PC 1264 We Will Never Fail.\\" Afterwards, the ship stayed at Norfolk for six more weeks, then moved to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, just up the Elizabeth River.Purdon 1972, pp. 226‚Äì231. In early October, PC-1264 was honored by being selected as one of forty-seven representative warships for a review of the fleet by President Truman on Navy Day, 27 October. On 24 October, she sailed from Norfolk to New York, where the review was to be held. Soon after PC-1264 left Norfolk, her new commanding officer, Lieutenant (jg) Jack Sutherland, arrived‚Äîafter traveling there from New York. He was sent back to New York and arrived there soon after his new command. However, he would not take command until after Navy Day. PC-1264, as the smallest vessel, was at the tail end of the Fleet review. However, President Truman, on board the destroyer , circled PC-1264 and waved to the crew.Purdon 1972, pp. 233‚Äì239. Officers and enlisted men of PC-1264 at its decommissioning. Both before and after the fleet review, PC-1264 held \\"open house\\" for families and friends of the crew and other interested persons, especially from the African-American community which had great pride in the ship's accomplishments. On 31 October, Lieutenant (jg) Sutherland assumed command. On 4 November, the ship sailed for New London, Connecticut, where it spent all of November and half of December assisting in the training of submarine officers, as a target ship for them to practice submarine runs on. On 15 December, PC-1264 returned to Tompkinsville for Christmas leave. While on leave, Ensign Ben Shanker, the executive officer, received orders to the Pacific and did not return to the ship. When the crew returned, Ensign Sam Gravely was the new executive officer. Soon after, PC-1264 returned to New London for its submarine training duty. However, PC-1264 then received orders to return to New York \\"for disposal.\\" On 7 February 1946, five officers and twenty-eight enlisted men stood at attention as PC-1264 was officially decommissioned.Purdon 1972, pp. 239‚Äì240, 244‚Äì247. The war records of the submarine chaser PC-1264 and the destroyer escort USS Mason considerably contributed to opening up billets for African Americans in the post-war navy. As a final honor for PC-1264, the officer-in-charge of the final inspection party remarked, \\"This ship has done a better job of decommissioning‚Äîis in better shape‚Äîthan any other ship, at least, here in New York.\\" Because of her condition, PC-1264 became the subchaser used as a showcase for prospective civilian purchasers.Purdon 1972, pp. 248‚Äì249. After the war After PC-1264 was decommissioned, she was transferred to the Maritime Commission for final disposition. , she was extant‚Äîalbeit in poor repair‚Äîat the former Donjon Marine Yard in New York. Two 1990-era photographs show her heavily rusted, but still afloat amid other hulks. Like many officers, Lieutenant Purdon left the U.S. Navy after the war but remained in the Naval Reserve. He worked as an intelligence analyst for the Central Intelligence Group until 1948, when he was recalled to active duty. He retired in 1963 with the rank of commander. Eric Purdon then held civilian jobs with the Commerce Department, Office of Economic Opportunity and the Job Corps, and was also an author. He died in 1989.Los Angeles Times 1989.

The natural son of a Spanish conquistador and an Inca noblewoman born in the early years of the conquest, he is known primarily for his chronicles of Inca history, culture, and society. His work was widely read in Europe, influential and well received. It was the first literature by an author born in the Americas to enter the western canon.Noble David Cook, \\"Garcilaso de la Vega, el Inca\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 3, pp.32-33. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. After his father's death in 1559, Vega moved to Spain in 1561, seeking official acknowledgement as his father's son. His paternal uncle became a protector, and he lived in Spain for the rest of his life, where he wrote his histories of the Inca culture and Spanish conquest, as well as an account of De Soto's expedition in Florida. Early life Statue of Garcilaso in Villa Borghese gardens, Rome Born G√≥mez Su√°rez de Figueroa in Cuzco, Peru, in 1539, he was the natural son of a Spanish conqueror and encomendero and a royal Inca mother.Libros Peruanos. \\"Inca Garcilaso de la Vega.\\" He was born during the early years of the Spanish conquest. His father was Spanish captain and conquistador Sebasti√°n Garcilaso de la Vega y Vargas (d. 1559). His mother was an elite Inca woman, Palla Chimpu Ocllo, who was baptized after the fall of Cuzco as Isabel Su√°rez Chimpu Ocllo. She was descended from Inca nobility, a daughter of T√∫pac Huallpa and a granddaughter (not a niece) of the powerful Inca Tupac Yupanqui. Because his parents were not married in the Catholic Church, he was illegitimate and the boy was given only his mother's surname. Under the Spanish system of caste that developed, he would have been classified as a criollo (for being of Spanish descent, born in South America) and mestizo (for his mixed parents). Coat of arms of Garcilaso illustrated in a 1609 document When G√≥mez was young, his father abandoned his mother and married a much younger Spanish woman. As such, G√≥mez lived with his mother, her husband Juan de Pedroche, her Inca family and had two daughters, De la Vega's half-sisters Ana Ru√≠z, who went on to marry Mart√≠n de Bustinza, and Luisa de Herrera, who married Pedro M√°rquez de Galeoto (one of their children was Alonso M√°rquez de Figueroa). His first language was Quechua, but he also learned Spanish from early boyhood.\\"Inca Garcilaso de la Vega\\" by Jos√© Carlos Rovira and Remedios Mataix., Cervantes Virtual website He lived with his mother's family for the first ten years of his life before his father took the boy into his household and gave him an education. Garcilaso received an inheritance when his father died in 1559. The next year, at the age of 21, he left Peru for Spain. Travel to Spain Su√°rez de Figueroa reached Spain in 1561 while there was still fighting in his native country under the conquest. The Spanish did not achieve their final victory until 1572. He traveled to Montilla, where he met his father's brother, Alonso de Vargas, who acted as the young man's protector and helped him make his way. The younger man soon traveled to Madrid to seek official acknowledgement as his father's son from the Crown, and he was allowed to take the name of Garcilaso de la Vega. Also referred to as \\"El Inca\\" or \\"Inca Garcilaso de la Vega\\", he received an informal education in Spain. Together with his uncle's support, gaining his father's name helped him integrate into Spanish society. Later life He remained in Spain and did not return to Peru. As warfare continued in the conquest, he was at political and even physical risk there because of his royal Inca lineage. It is recorded that he died in C√≥rdoba on 23 April 1616, but it could have been up to two days earlier because of the inaccuracy of the existing documents. House of Garcilaso in Montilla, during his time in Spain Personal life He had at least two sons, born of relationships with different servants. One son was recorded as being born in 1570; he might have died at a very young age. With another servant, Garcilaso had a second son, Diego de Vargas, born in 1590, who helped his father copy the Royal Commentaries and survived him until at least 1651. It is possible that his eldest son was the 'Admiral' Lope de Vega, who commanded a ship in the fleet of √Ålvaro de Menda√±a, on his 1595 expedition to the Solomon Islands. Lope de Vega was lost at sea when his ship parted from Menda√±a's fleet in a fog.This claim was inferred by Australian historian Lawrence Hargrave in a paper to the Royal Society of NSW in 1909. Military service De la Vega entered Spanish military service in 1570 and fought in the Alpujarras against the Moors after the Morisco Revolt. He received the rank of captain for his services to the Crown. Writings Title page of La Florida del Ynca (1605) Title page of Comentarios Reales de los Incas (1609) He received a first-rate but informal European education in Spain after he moved there at age 21. His works are considered to have great literary value and are not simple historical chronicles. He wrote from an important perspective, as his maternal family were the ruling Inca. He portrays the Inca as benevolent rulers who governed a country where everybody was well-fed and happy before the Spanish came. Having learned first-hand about daily Inca life from his maternal relatives, he was able to convey that in his writings. As an adult, he also gained the perspective to describe accurately the political system of tribute and labor enforced by the Incas from the subsidiary tribes in their empire. Baptized and reared as Roman Catholic, he portrayed Incan religion and the expansion of its empire from a viewpoint influenced by his upbringing. He did not acknowledge or discuss the human sacrifices that are now known to have been part of Inca practice. It is unknown whether that was an effort to portray his Inca ancestors in a more positive light to a Spanish audience or his ignorance of the practice having lived most of his life in Spain. =Historia de la Florida= De la Vega's first work was La Florida del Inca, an account of Hernando de Soto's expedition and journey in Florida. The work was published in Lisbon in 1605 and became popular. It describes the expedition according to its own records and information Garcilaso gathered during the years. He defended the legitimacy of imposing the Spanish sovereignty in conquered territories and submitting them to Catholic jurisdiction. At the same time, he expresses and defends the dignity, the courage, and the rationality of the Native Americans. It was translated and published in English in 1951. Historians have identified problems with using La Florida as an historical account. Jerald T. Milanich and Charles M. Hudson warn against relying on Garcilaso, noting serious problems with the sequence of events and location of towns in his narrative. They say that \\"some historians regard Garcilaso's La Florida to be more a work of literature than a work of history.\\" Lankford characterizes Garcilaso's La Florida as a collection of \\"legend narratives,\\" derived from a much-retold oral tradition of the survivors of the expedition. The Library of Congress in Washington, DC, has these two volumes online, scanned from an historic French-language edition published long before English editions. =Comentarios Reales de los Incas= While in Spain, Garcilaso wrote his best-known work, Comentarios Reales de los Incas, published in Lisbon in 1609. It was based on stories and oral histories told by his Inca relatives when he was a child in Cusco. The Comentarios have two sections and volumes. The first was primarily about Inca life. The second, about the conquest of Peru, was published in 1617. It was first published in English in London in 1685, translated by Sir Paul Rycaut and titled The Royal Commentaries of Peru. More than a century and a half later, in 1758 when the uprising against colonial oppression led by Tupac Amaru II gained momentum, Charles III of Spain banned the Comentarios from being published in the Quechua language in Lima or distributed there on account of its \\"dangerous\\" content. The book was not printed again in the Americas until 1918, but copies continued to be circulated secretly.Video Inca Garcilaso y Tupac Amaru It was translated and printed in English in 1961 in the United States as The Incas, and in another edition in 1965 as Royal Commentaries of the Incas.

Harbin, a major junction city on the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER), came successively under the control of the Qing dynasty, the Republic of China, Manchukuo and the People's Republic of China in this period. The people in the Soviet Union used the terms \\"KVZhDist\\" (, \\"person of the China Eastern Railway\\" ) and \\"Harbinets\\" (–•–∞—Ä–±–∏–Ω–µ—Ü, \\"Harbinite/person from Harbin\\") to refer to a person with any type of ties to the China Eastern Railway.  History  = Settlement = Russian orthodox churchyard in Harbin Russian advertisements in Harbin The first generation of Harbin Russians were mostly the builders and employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway. They moved to Harbin in order to work on the railroad. At the time Harbin was not an established city. The city was almost built from scratch by the builders and early settlers. Houses were constructed, furniture and personal items were brought in from Russia. After the Russo-Japanese War, while many Russians left Harbin, a lot of long-time residents decided to stay. By 1913, Harbin had become an established Russian colony for the construction and maintenance work on the China Eastern Railway. A record shows Harbin had a total of 68,549 people, most of which are of Russian and Chinese descent. There were a total of 53 different nationalities. Along with Russian and Chinese, there were 45 spoken languages used in Harbin at the time. Only 11.5% of all residents were born in Harbin.Bakich, Olga Mikhailovna, \\"Emigre Identity: The Case of Harbin,\\" The South Atlantic Quarterly, Vol.99, No.1 (2000): 51-73. There were lively religious activities, too, by the Russians (Saint Sophia Cathedral in Harbin), Ukrainians (Church of the Intercession in Harbin), Poles (Sacred Heart Cathedral of Harbin), Germans (Harbin Nangang Christian Church), Danish (Danish Lutheran Church), and others. A few kilometers of Harbin there is a railway station of Asheng (Ashih√©) which was a settlement of hundreds of white Russians till 1955. A large community, with orthodox church, independent college, library and a social club. The common language was Russian, with some Siberian variations. Many Czarist Imperial officers amongst \\"old believers\\" contributed to maintain strong links to Russian culture, literature and music. Almost the entire population of Asheng emigrated, to Australia and Brazil. = World War I and the Russian Revolution = In the decade from 1913 to 1923, Russia went through World War I, the Russian Revolution, and the Russian Civil War. In the 1920s Harbin was flooded with 100,000 to 200,000 White √©migr√©s fleeing from Russia. They were mostly officers and soldiers involved in the White movement, members of the White governments in Siberia and Russian Far East. There were both the intelligentsia and ordinary people. Harbin held the largest Russian population outside of the state of Russia. On September 8, 1920, the Republic of China announced that it would no longer recognize the Russian consulates in China. On September 23, China ceased relations with representatives of the Russian Empire and deprived Russians of extraterritorial rights. Overnight, Russians in China found themselves stateless. Shortly afterward, the Chinese government took over control of the institutions in Harbin such as courts, police, prison, post office, and some research and educational institutions. Russian Orthodox Saint Sofia Church built in 1907, Harbin In 1924, an agreement was signed in Beijing regarding the control of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The agreement stated that only Soviet and Chinese citizens could be employed by the CER. This meant the Harbin Russians had to choose not only their nationality, but also their political identity. Many Harbin Russians took Soviet citizenship for patriotic reasons. However, there were also Harbin Russians who remained stateless who were eventually let go from CER. Gradually, the national and the political identity of the Harbin Russians split the group into opposing sides. This led to a strong Soviet presence in Harbin. In 1929, the Congregation of Marian Fathers of the Immaculate Conception opened the Lyceum St. Nicholas, which educated Christian male elite until 1949. = Japanese occupation = Anti-Soviet Russian Fascists, inspired by Italian fascism, in Harbin, 1934. In the 1930s, the Japanese occupied Manchuria, and turned it into the puppet state of Manchukuo. In 1935, the Soviet Union sold its share of the China Eastern Railway to Japan via Manchukuo. In the spring and summer of 1935, thousands of Harbin Russians went on trains with their passports and belongings, and left for the Soviet Union. From 1932 to 1945, Harbin Russians had a difficult time under the Manchukuo r√©gime, and the Japanese occupation. Some Harbin Russians initially thought the occupation was good, hoping that the Japanese would help them in their anti-Soviet struggles and provide protection from the Chinese, who were desperately trying to restore the sovereignty of Harbin. Many Harbin Russians returned to the Soviet Union after 1935. Russian stores in Harbin Some Harbin Russians moved to other cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, and eventually left China. By the 1930s, Shanghai's Russian community had grown to 25,000. The anti-Communist Harbin Russians formed the Russian Fascist Party (RFP). The RFP was anti-semitic and harassed the Jewish Harbin Russians with, among other things, kidnappings, and many Russian Jews therefore left Harbin. In 1934, the Japanese formed the Bureau for Russian Emigrants in Manchuria (BREM; –ë—é—Ä–æ –ø–æ –¥–µ–ª–∞–º —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏—Ö —ç–º–∏–≥—Ä–∞–Ω—Ç–æ–≤ –≤ –ú–∞–Ω—å—á–∂—É—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π –∏–º–ø–µ—Ä–∏–∏), which were nominally under the control of RFP; the BREM provided identification papers necessary to live, work and travel in Manchukuo. White General Vladimir Kislitsin acted as BREM's chairman between 1938 and 1942. Ataman Grigory Semyonov, himself much in favor with the Japanese, replaced him from 1943 to 1945.\\"General V.A. Kislitsin: From Russian Monarchism to the Spirit of Bushido,\\" Harbin and Manchuria: Place, Space, and Identity, edited by Thomas Lahusen, special issue of South Atlantic Quarterly, vol. 99, no. 1 (Winter 2000) Russian poets in Harbin, 1930s The Harbin Russians were left to choose between a Soviet citizenship or to remain stateless by support of the BREM. The stateless Russians were officially favored by the regime, but in reality, they were not trusted and exposed to a great risk of being arrested as spies for the Soviet Union. They were also often enlisted in the army for work along the border to the Soviet Union. After the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 they were in an even more sensitive situation. To separate the anti-Soviet Russians from the Soviet Russians, the former were ordered to wear a badge with the colors of the Czar -- later, a white numbered disk of aluminum. The Soviet Russians were excluded from the Russian schools and their property was often confiscated, but they were under the protection of the Soviet Embassy. = After World War II = In 1945, after the Soviet Army occupied Harbin, the Soviets sent all those Harbin Russians whom they identified as White Guardists and those who had collaborated with the Japanese authorities to labor camps. After 1952, the Soviet Union initiated a second wave of repatriation of Harbin Russians. By the mid-1960s virtually all Harbin Russians had left Harbin. There were several Russian connections in Australia resulting from refugees leaving Harbin. A good portion of the Russian Old Believers left to South America.

Development The U.S. Navy-sponsored project, worth US$26.1 million when announced in 2003 ($ million today), consisted of a Sikorsky YSH-60F helicopter modified by Piasecki as a testbed to validate the \\"Vectored Thrust Ducted Propeller\\" (VTDP) system. One YSH-60F, powered by two General Electric T700-GE-701C engines, was converted to test the feasibility of VTDP. The demonstration contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command to Piasecki Aircraft. In addition to the VTDP, Piasecki installed a lifting wing with flaperons on the YSH-60F.\\"Piasecki X-49 SpeedHawk (United States)\\", Jane's Helicopter Markets and Systems. Jane's Information Group, 9 May 2008. The compound helicopter technology installed by Piasecki had been first demonstrated in trials of the Piasecki 16H-1 and 16H-1A ‚ÄúPathfinder‚Äù in the early 1960s, when the helicopters were flown at speeds up to 225 mph (360 km/h). The success of the Pathfinder inspired others to experiment with compounding, resulting in programs such as the AH-56 Cheyenne. In May 2003, the YSH-60F/VTDP demonstrator was redesignated the X-49A'.DOD 4120.15-L - Addendum, Designation-Systems.Net, 8 July 2008. During 2004, the X-49A VTDP program was transitioned from the U.S. Navy to the U.S. Army. In 2013, it was reported that Piasecki Aviation had made plans to use the VTDP design of the X-49 for their entry in the Future Vertical Lift program,The Other JMR/FVL Contenders - Aviationweek.com, April 12, 2013 but were not chosen when that project moved into its Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstrator (JMR-TD) phase.AVX joins Bell, Sikorsky/Boeing for Army's JMR-TD development - Flightglobal.com, 6 June 2013 Design The X-49A flight demonstrator was developed with funding from the U.S. Army's Aviation Applied Technology Directorate to demonstrate the ability to increase the speed of existing helicopters to 200 kt (360 km/h) or more. The flight demonstrator was updated with a lifting wing taken from an Aerostar FJ-100 business jet. A ring tail was added and the helicopter drive train modified to accommodate VTDP. Piasecki conducted integrated tests of the modified drivetrain at the Navy's helicopter transmission test facility. The wings were intended to produce lift to offload the rotor so the rotor could be slowed and produce less drag, allowing for higher speed.Croft, John. Hyper Helos: Prototypes coming off the drawing board and into the race Flight Global, 2008. Accessed: 17 February 2011. The cockpit controls were modified with the addition of a manual propeller pitch override on the collective lever for the ring tail. This is the only visible change to the aircraft's existing mechanical controls in the cockpit. The other controls needed to operate the compound helicopter's systems were integrated into the aircraft's existing mechanical controls to reduce pilot workload. The weight added to the X-49A demonstrator aircraft is estimated at about 1,600 lb (725 kg) due to the requirement to not modify the existing mechanical control system.

As Belgium is a multinational state, this connection may be residential, legal, historical, or cultural rather than ethnic. The majority of Belgians, however, belong to two distinct ethnic groups or communities ( or ) native to the country, i.e. its historical regions: Flemings in Flanders, who speak Dutch, and Walloons in Wallonia, who speak French or Walloon. There is also a substantial Belgian diaspora, which has settled primarily in the United States, Canada, France, and the Netherlands. Etymology The 1830 revolution led to the establishment of an independent country under a provisional government and a national congress. The name \\"Belgium\\" was adopted for the country, the word being derived from Gallia Belgica, a Roman province in the northernmost part of Gaul that, before Roman invasion in 100 BC, was inhabited by the Belgae, a mix of Celtic and Germanic peoples. Footnote: The Celtic and Germanic influences on and origins of the Belgae remains disputed. Further reading, e.g. The Latin name was revived in 1790 by the short-lived United Belgian States which was created after a revolution against Austrian rule took place in 1789. Since no adjective equivalent to \\"Belgian\\" existed at the time, the French noun \\"Belgique\\" (or \\"Belgium\\") was adopted as both noun and adjective; a phenomenon borrowed from Latin which was still commonly used during the period. From the sixteenth century, the Low Countries\\" or \\"Netherlands\\", were referred to as 'Belgica' in Latin, as was the Dutch Republic. Belgian culture Relations between Belgian linguistic communities Belgians are primarily a nationality or citizen group, by jus soli (Latin: right of the soil),jus soli, definition from merriam-webster.com. also known as birthright citizenship, and are not a homogeneous ethnic group.Hobsbawm and Ranger (1983), The Invention of Tradition, Sider 1993 Lumbee Indian HistoriesSeidner,(1982), Ethnicity, Language, and Power from a Psycholinguistic Perspective, pp. 2‚Äì3Smith 1987 pp.21‚Äì22 Belgians are made up of two main linguistic and ethnic groups; the Dutch-speakers (called the Flemish) and the French-speakers (mostly Walloons), as well as a third tiny but constitutionally recognized group from two small German-speaking areas. These sometimes competing ethnic and linguistic priorities are governed by constitutionally designated \\"regions or communities\\", depending on the constitutional realm of the topic, a complex and uniquely Belgian political construct. Since many Belgians are at least bilingual, or even trilingual, it is common for business, social and family networks to include members of the various ethnic groups composing Belgium. The Brussels-Capital Region occupies a unique political and cultural position since geographically and linguistically it is a bilingual enclave within the unilingual Flemish Region. Since the founding of the Kingdom of Belgium in 1830, the city of Brussels has transformed from being almost entirely Dutch- speaking into a multilingual city with French as the majority language and lingua franca, a process that has been labelled the Frenchification of Brussels\\". Since the independence of Belgium in 1830, the constitutional title of the Belgian head of state is the \\"King of the Belgians\\" rather than the \\"King of Belgium\\".Ramon Arango, Leopold III and the Belgian Royal Question, p.9.Raymond Fusilier in Les monarchies parlementaires en Europe, Editions ouvri√®res, Paris, 1960, p. 350, wrote the Belgian regime of 1830 was also inspired by the French Constitution of the Kingdom of France (1791-1792), the United States Declaration of Independence of 1776 and the old political traditions of both Walloon and Flemish provinces. =Flemish (Dutch- speaking)= Map of the medieval County of Flanders. Within Belgium the Flemish, about 60% of the population, form a clearly distinguishable group, set apart by their language and customs. However, when compared to the Netherlands most of these cultural and linguistic boundaries quickly fade, as the Flemish share the same language, similar or identical customs and (though only with the southern part of today's Netherlands) traditional religion with the Dutch.National minorities in Europe, W. Braum√ºller, 2003, page 20. However, the popular perception of being a single polity varies greatly, depending on subject matter, locality and personal background. Generally, Flemings will seldom identify themselves as being Dutch and vice versa, especially on a national level.Nederlandse en Vlaamse identiteit, Civis Mundi 2006 by S.W. Couwenberg. . Page 62. Quote: \\"Er valt heel wat te lachen om de wederwaardigheden van Vlamingen in Nederland en Nederlanders in Vlaanderen. Ze relativeren de verschillen en beklemtonen ze tegelijkertijd. Die verschillen zijn er onmiskenbaar: in taal, klank, kleur, stijl, gedrag, in politiek, maatschappelijke organisatie, maar het zijn stuk voor stuk varianten binnen √©√©n taal-en cultuurgemeenschap.\\" The opposite opinion is stated by L. Beheydt (2002): \\"Al bij al lijkt een grondiger analyse van de taalsituatie en de taalattitude in Nederland en Vlaanderen weinig aanwijzingen te bieden voor een gezamenlijke culturele identiteit. Dat er ook op andere gebieden weinig aanleiding is voor een gezamenlijke culturele identiteit is al door Geert Hofstede geconstateerd in zijn vermaarde boek Allemaal andersdenkenden (1991).\\" L. Beheydt, \\"Delen Vlaanderen en Nederland een culturele identiteit?\\", in P. Gillaerts, H. van Belle, L. Ravier (eds.), Vlaamse identiteit: mythe √©n werkelijkheid (Leuven 2002), 22‚Äì40, esp. 38. =Walloon (French-speaking)= Cheering crowds greet British troops entering Brussels, 1944 Belgian students at an event Walloons are a French-speaking people who live in Belgium, principally in Wallonia. Walloons are a distinctive community within Belgium,Ethnic Groups Worldwide, a ready reference Handbook, David Levinson, ORYX Press, (), p. 13 : ¬´ Walloons are identified through their residence in Wallonia and by speaking dialects of French. They, too, are descended from the original Celtic inhabitants of the region and Romans and Franks who arrived later. Walloons are mainly Roman catholic. ¬ª important historical and anthropological criteria (religion, language, traditions, folklore) bind Walloons to the French people.Ethnic Groups Worldwide, a ready reference Handbook, David Levinson, ORYX Press, , p.13 : \\"Walloon culture was heavily influenced by the French\\"The Encyclopedia of the Peoples of the World, A Henri Holt Reference Book, page 645 : ¬´ Culturally there is continuity between the French and the Walloons, Wallon culture consisting mainly of dialect literary productions. While historically most Wallons came within France's cultural orbit More generally, the term also refers to the inhabitants of the Walloon Region. They may speak regional languages such as Walloon (with Picard in the West and Gaumais in the South). Though roughly three-quarters of Belgium's French speakers live in Wallonia, it is important to note that French-speaking residents of Brussels tend not to identify as Walloons. =German-speaking community= The German-speaking Community of Belgium is one of the three constitutionally recognized federal communities of Belgium. Covering an area of less than 1,000 km2 within the province of Li√®ge in Wallonia, it includes nine of the eleven municipalities of the so-called East Cantons and the local population numbers over 73,000 ‚Äì less than 1% of the national total. Bordering the Netherlands, Germany and Luxembourg, the area has its own parliament and government at Eupen. The German-speaking community is composed of the German-speaking parts of the lands that were annexed in 1920 from Germany. In addition, in contemporary Belgium there are also some other German-speaking areas that belonged to Belgium even before 1920, but they are not currently considered officially part of the German- speaking community in Belgium: Bleiberg-Welkenraat-Baelen in Northeastern province of Li√®ge and Arelerland (city of Arlon and some of its nearby villages in Southeastern province of Belgian Luxembourg). However, in these localities, the German language is highly endangered due to the adoption of French. Religion Roman Catholicism has traditionally been Belgium's majority religion, with approximately 65% of the Belgians declaring themselves to be Catholics. The question asked was \\"Do you consider yourself to be...?\\" With a card showing: Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Other Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Buddhist, Hindu, Atheist, and Non-believer/Agnostic. Space was given for Other (SPONTANEOUS) and DK. Jewish, Sikh, Buddhist, Hindu did not reach the 1% threshold. However, by 2004, nationwide Sunday church attendance was only about 4 to 8% (9% for Flanders only). A 2006 inquiry in Flanders, long considered more religious than the Brussels or Wallonia regions in Belgium, showed 55% of its inhabitants calling themselves religious, while 36% said that they believed that God created the world.Inquiry by 'Vepec', 'Vereniging voor Promotie en Communicatie' (Organisation for Promotion and Communication), published in Knack magazine 22 November 2006 p. 14 (The Dutch language term 'gelovig' was translated in the text as 'religious', more precisely it is a very common word for believing in particular in any kind of god in a monotheistic sense or in some afterlife.) Demographics Belgium had a population of 10,839,905 people on 1 January 2010, an increase of 601,000 in comparison to 2000 (10,239,085 inhabitants). Between 1990 (9,947,782 inhabitants) and 2000 the increase was only 291,000. The population of Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels on 1 January 2010 was 6,251,983 (57.7%), 3,498,384 (32.3%) and 1,089,538 (10.1%), respectively.

Many of the American submarine chasers used in World War I found their way to Allied nations by way of Lend-Lease in World War II. Submarine chaser variants U.S. Navy submarine chasers were designed specifically to destroy German submarines in World War I, and Japanese and German submarines in World War II. The small SC-1-class submarine chasers of the design used in World War I carried the hull designator SC (for Submarine Chaser).Gardiner, pp. 132-133 Their main weapon was the depth charge. They also carried machine guns and anti-aircraft guns. The similar-sized SC-497-class was built for World War II. Also in World War II, larger PC-461-class submarine chasers used the PC hull classification symbol (for Patrol, Coastal).Gardiner and Chesneau, pp. 71, 152-154 In early 1915, the British Admiralty selected the US Elco company for the production of 50 Motor Launches for anti-submarine work, British industry being at maximum capacity. This order was eventually increased by a further 530. The whole order was completed by November 1916, and the vessels entered Royal Navy service. The vessels were in length and capable of . They were armed with a 3-pounder gun, towed paravanes to attack submarines and, later, depth charges.Gardiner, p. 101 Additional Motor Launches of the Fairmile A, B and other classes were built for World War II.Gardiner and Chesneau, p. 71 =War service= The British sub chasers were operated around the coast in defence. However, they were uncomfortable, wet and not suited to British sea conditions. Although used during the First World War, they were sold when the war ended. Submarine chasers were used mostly by the United States Coast Guard in World War II for destroying German U-boats that were stationed off the coast of the United States that were trying to sink merchant convoys as they departed American ports. By the end of World War II, submarine chasers had sunk around 67 German U-boats. In the Pacific Theatre, submarine chasers were used for amphibious landings, courier and escort duty.Submarine Chaser Photo Archive NavSourceSplinter Fleet - The Wooden Subchasers of World War IIGardiner and Chesneau, pp. 71, 152-154 Eight British Fairmile B Motor Launches were transferred from Canada to the US in World War II, and included the SC-1466 class of sub-chasers.\\"Sunday Ship History: Submarine Chasers\\" EagleSpeakGardiner and Chesneau, p. 71 The Imperial Japanese Navy had around 250 submarine chasers in World War II, principally about 200 of the No.1-class auxiliary submarine chasers. Some of these survived to serve in the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force (JMSDF) after the war.Watts, pp. 279-288 During Project Hula, the United States secretly transferred 32 U.S. Navy submarine chasers to the Soviet Union between 26 May and 2 September 1945, and some of these saw action in the Soviet Navy during Soviet military operations against the Japanese between 9 August and 2 September 1945. The transfer of 24 more was canceled when transfers halted on 5 September 1945, three days after the Japanese surrender. Between 1954 and 1960 all 32 transferred submarine chasers were scrapped by the Soviet Union or destroyed off its coast by mutual agreement between the two countries.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 35, 37-38, 40. =Post-war= In the decade immediately after World War II, the Soviet Union built 227 Kronshtadt-class submarine chasers, some of which remained in active service until the 1990s. Rapid developments in submarine technologies since World War II mean that submarine chasers are now obsolete, having been replaced by corvettes, frigates, and destroyers. =Survivors= The only remaining submarine chaser with intact World War II armament is the Royal Norwegian Navy's HNoMS Hitra, which is a touring museum today.

Background Newman was educated at University College at the University of Toronto, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1987. From 1985 to 1995, he worked as manager of the Toronto Sun Publishing Corporation. Many would later accuse the Sun, a center right forum, of being uncritically supportive of the Mike Harris government.

Politics Newman was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1995, defeating Liberal Mary Anne Plimbett and incumbent New Democrat Steve Owens in the riding of Scarborough Centre. The Tories won a majority government and Newman served as a backbench supporter of Mike Harris's government. He was re- elected in the provincial election of 1999, defeating Liberal candidate Adrian Heaps and New Democrat Michael Yorke in the re-distributed riding of Scarborough Southwest. On March 3, 2000, Newman was appointed to cabinet as Minister of the Environment. This appointment occurred just before a serious outbreak of E. coli poisoning in Walkerton, Ontario, in which several people died following the contamination of the town's water supply. Many blamed the Harris government's privatization of water inspection for the tragedy. Newman, as Environment Minister, bore the brunt of this criticism and was forced to defend his government's policies before an increasingly skeptical public. In the aftermath of the tragedy, he announced a public investigation and stricter standards for municipal water treatment. On February 8, 2001, Newman was appointed as Minister of Northern Development and Mines. When Ernie Eves replaced Harris as Premier on April 15, 2002, he named Newman as Associate Minister of Health and Long-Term Care.

However, allegations of corruption coupled with disagreements with Cont√©'s top associates, particularly Fod√© Bangoura, the Secretary-General of the Presidency, and Mamadou Sylla, a wealthy businessman, culminated in Diallo's removal from his prime minister post. On 4 April 2006, changes to the government which would have greatly increased Diallo's power were announced. These changes would have replaced a number of ministers with Diallo's own allies and would have placed Diallo personally in charge of several portfolios,\\"Guinea: Prime minister Diallo sacked in possible power struggle\\", IRIN, 5 April 2006.\\"Guinea PM fired in 'power tussle'\\", BBC News, 5 April 2006. including those of economy, finance, international cooperation, and planning. The decree approving the changes was said to be signed by President Cont√©, but it was later speculated that Cont√© might not have realized the significance of what he was signing at the time. A radio broadcast announcing the changes was interrupted by soldiers, which was said to be because Fod√© Bangoura had not been notified in advance.

It is located in the L√∏renskog municipality in the region of Viken, just east of the Norwegian capital Oslo. It is a teaching hospital and one of two university hospitals affiliated with the University of Oslo, alongside the larger Oslo University Hospital. The hospital has around 10,000 employees and a capacity of around 1,000 beds. In November 2008 a new hospital building designed by Danish architecture practice Arkitektfirmaet C. F. M√∏ller opened. Setting new standards for hospital architecture in Norway, at the time of its construction, it was claimed to be the most modern in Europe. History Akershus University Hospital was officially opened on 15 May 1961 as the Akershus Central Hospital (SIA). The area on which it was built, Nordbyhagen in L√∏renskog eventually became developed with more homes and apartments, nursery schools, convenience store and several buildings with associated with hospital functions. In 1978, the hospital began its second major phase, and it has since been built a series of individual buildings and minor additions to the hospital. The Norwegian Parliament (the Storting) decided in 1999 that the then Central Hospital of Akershus (SIA) would be a teaching hospital. The first teaching programs started in 2001 and it was promptly escalated so as to give the medical students proper teaching for the entire duration of their study. Today the \\"faculty division\\" is one of the ten departments affiliated with the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Oslo. Since 2002, the university hospital figured prominently in medical research and medical education. =The new hospital= In 2003 the Storting gave the go-ahead for a new University Hospital in Akershus to be built. The executive board at the Southern and Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority determined on 18 December 2003 that construction work would start in March 2004. It was to be designed by the Danish architects from the firm C.F M√∏ller and was estimated to cost around $1.7bn. On 1 March 2004 the then Health Minister Dagfinn H√∏ybr√•ten undertook the first sod. The hospital was completed 1 October 2008, and boasted to be the most modern hospital in Europe. The research center After Akershus University Hospital became a teaching hospital in 2000 a separate Center for Research () was established. Since then, the research center received an increasingly central place in the hospital. Both somatic and psychiatric departments have contributed to the positive development. The Hospital aims to ensure that both the research and teaching at the hospital maintains a high professional level, and that the basis of the activity must be the hospitals own patient population. The research aims to provide results that are useful for both diagnosis and treatment. It should be progressive by adopting the opportunities that modern medicine and technology offers, and be cost effective. Research takes place across organizational structure of the hospital, and in all departments. It is responsible for approx. 250 scientific publications per year, in the world's leading journals. Recently an article published in Time magazine received international attention. Arts and decorations Like all large public construction projects in Norway, Akershus University Hospital was constructed along with a special art project. The budget for the art project was estimated at a total of around $7 million. With a hospital building of 137,000 square meters, one of the strategic choices was to focus on getting few and building-integrated masterpieces. The art collection currently includes twelve major works, which are intended and designed for their specific and unique space. Eleven of them are located in key public spaces; in the hospital's main communications artery, nicknamed the glass street, and one is out in the parkland. All works is thus available to everyone. Besides the twelve building-integrated works the art collection includes some newly acquired autonomous works, such as drawings, paintings and photographs, as well as a new exhibition of a selection of photos from the old hospital building. The hospital's function is primarily to provide treatment and care. The hospital-space is a public space where communication and interaction between function, art, architecture, and the public was important. The intention and aim was that art should relate to the hospital in a meaningful way and add to the treatment process by soothing the visual experiences of patients as well as staff as research has shown that experiencing art has positive health effects and helps treat illnesses such as hypertension. The hope was that the art would activate in different ways and open to different cognitive and sensory experiences. Another goal has been that art should have its own integrity and independence to the building's architecture and design. The artists desired for it to be read and experienced as art, even if it is integrated into the building's architecture. Many of the original works is of renowned artists including; Troels W√∂rsel, Tony Cragg, Julie Nord, Per Sundberg, Ernst Billgren and Vesa Honkonen.

In an army, for instance, soldiers on active duty serve 24 hours a day, seven days a week for the length of their service commitment. Soldiers in World War II were deployed for the entire war and could be in active service for 4-5 years. Air force In World War II, Royal Air Force doctors had started to notice symptoms of battle fatigue in their pilots. Before 1942, there was no official limit for an operational tour. Some pilots had been flying over 200 missions with only a short break. Then the Senior Medical Officer of the RAF station Biggin Hill intervened, after asking one flight sergeant how many missions he had done and was surprised to hear 200 over 2 years. A tour system was then adopted, the length of it varied, depending on the period, theatre, and Command requirements of the time. In Western Europe, it was set at 200 hours operational flying. In 1944 in South East Asia, the day fighter pilot's tour was 300 hours or 12 months. In Bomber Command, the tour length was exceptionally based on the number of successful combat sorties (missions), the first tour was 30 sorties and the second 20 sorties. In Coastal Command, the maximum length of a tour depended on tasks and varied from fighter to squadrons, normally 200 hours for flying boats and four-engine land-plane crews‚Äô 800 hours. The tour of duty for B-52 crewmen is four to six months.United States Congress (1972). Navy In navies, a tour of duty is a period of time spent performing operational duties at sea, including combat, performing patrol or fleet duties, or assigned to service in a foreign country; a tour of duty is part of a rotation, where the ship may spend a six-month tour of duty, then spend one month in home port for maintenance, then a period of time on exercises, then return to her tour of duty. In 2018, most overseas tours for military personnel in the US Navy have been capped at two or three years. In Japan, tour lengths might increase to four years. This would also include tours to Guam and Spain. Sailors extending their tours by at least 12 months will receive preferential consideration for announced billets. In the Royal Navy (UK), operational tours can last approximately 9 months. Although with the Royal Navy Reserves, this is only 6 months. A junior doctor may be on board a ship for a seven-month stint. Army A general tour of duty for soldiers comprises service that can last from half a year to four years. Generally, duties that last longer than two years are eligible to receive medals of merit related to their service. Tours of duty can also be extended involuntarily for service members, such as in September 2006, when the tour of duty was extended for 4,000 US military personnel in Iraq. They were increased up to 15 months for tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. As of 2018, typical tours are 6-9 or even 12 months' deployment depending upon the needs of the military and branch of service. Soldiers are eligible for two weeks of leave after six months of deployment. In the UK, tours of duty are usually 6 months. In 2014, UK army tours in Afghanistan were extended to 8 months. Army doctors accompany their regiments on tours of duty for up to six months every two to three years.

Found in Southeast Asia and bordering areas, they range from Bangladesh and Northeast India in the west to the Sulu Archipelago in the Philippines in the east, and from Yunnan province in China in the north to the island of Java in the south. Although many previous classifications recognized as few as a single all-inclusive species, there are now at least eight that are considered valid: the Sunda slow loris (N. coucang), Bengal slow loris (N. bengalensis), pygmy slow loris (N. pygmaeus), Javan slow loris (N. javanicus), Philippine slow loris (N. menagensis), Bangka slow loris (N. bancanus), Bornean slow loris (N. borneanus), and Kayan River slow loris (N. kayan). The group's closest relatives are the slender lorises of southern India and Sri Lanka. Their next closest relatives are the African lorisids, the pottos, false pottos, and angwantibos. They are less closely related to the remaining lorisoids (the various types of galago), and more distantly to the lemurs of Madagascar. Their evolutionary history is uncertain since their fossil record is patchy and molecular clock studies have given inconsistent results. Slow lorises have a round head, a narrow snout, large eyes, and a variety of distinctive coloration patterns that are species-dependent. Their arms and legs are nearly equal in length, and their torso is long and flexible, allowing them to twist and extend to nearby branches. The hands and feet of slow lorises have several adaptations that give them a pincer-like grip and enable them to grasp branches for long periods of time. Slow lorises have a toxic bite, a trait rare among mammals and unique among the primates. The toxin is obtained by licking a sweat gland on their arm, and the secretion is activated by mixing with saliva. Their toxic bite is a deterrent to predators, and the toxin is also applied to the fur during grooming as a form of protection for their infants. The secretion from the arm contains a chemical related to cat allergen, but may be augmented by secondary toxins from the diet in wild individuals. Slow lorises move slowly and deliberately, making little or no noise, and when threatened, they stop moving and remain motionless. Their only documented predators‚Äîapart from humans‚Äîinclude snakes, changeable hawk-eagles and orangutans, although cats, viverrids and sun bears are suspected. Little is known about their social structure, but they are known to communicate by scent marking. Males are highly territorial. Slow lorises reproduce slowly, and the infants are initially parked on branches or carried by either parent. They are omnivores, eating small animals, fruit, tree gum, and other vegetation. Each of the slow loris species that had been identified prior to 2012 is listed as either \\"Vulnerable\\" or \\"Endangered\\" on the IUCN Red List. The three newest species are yet to be evaluated, but they arise from (and further reduce the ranks of) what was thought to be a single \\"vulnerable\\" species. All four of these are expected to be listed with at least the same, if not a higher-risk, conservation status. All slow lorises are threatened by the wildlife trade and habitat loss. Their habitat is rapidly disappearing and becoming fragmented, making it nearly impossible for slow lorises to disperse between forest fragments; unsustainable demand from the exotic pet trade and from traditional medicine has been the greatest cause for their decline. Deep- rooted beliefs about the supernatural powers of slow lorises, such as their purported abilities to ward off evil spirits or to cure wounds, have popularized their use in traditional medicine. Despite local laws prohibiting trade in slow lorises and slow loris products, as well as protection from international commercial trade under Appendix I, slow lorises are openly sold in animal markets in Southeast Asia and smuggled to other countries, such as Japan. Due in part to the large eyes that are an adaptation to their nocturnal lifestyle, they have also been popularized as 'cute' pets in viral videos on YouTube. Slow lorises have their teeth cut or pulled out for the pet trade. They make poor pets as they are nocturnal, have specialized diets, are difficult to care for, and often die from infection, blood loss, improper caring and handling or inadequate nutrition. Evolutionary history Slow lorises (genus Nycticebus) are strepsirrhine primates and are related to other living lorisoids, such as slender lorises (Loris), pottos (Perodicticus), false pottos (Pseudopotto), angwantibos (Arctocebus), and galagos (family Galagidae), and to the lemurs of Madagascar. They are most closely related to the slender lorises of South Asia, followed by the angwantibos, pottos and false pottos of Central and West Africa. Lorisoids are thought to have evolved in Africa, where most living species occur; later, one group may have migrated to Asia and evolved into the slender and slow lorises of today. Lorises first appear in the Asian fossil record in the Miocene, with records in Thailand around 18 million years ago (mya) and in Pakistan 16 mya. The Thai record is based on a single tooth that most closely resembles living slow lorises and that is tentatively classified as a species of Nycticebus. The species is named ? Nycticebus linglom, using open nomenclature (the preceding \\"?\\" indicates the tentative nature of the assignment). Several lorises are found in the Siwalik deposits of Pakistan, dating to 16 to 8 mya, including Nycticeboides and Microloris. Most are small, but an unnamed form dating to 15‚Äì16 mya is comparable in size to the largest living slow lorises. Molecular clock analysis suggests that slow lorises may have started evolving into distinct species about 10 mya. They are thought to have reached the islands of Sundaland when the Sunda Shelf was exposed at times of low sea level, creating a land bridge between the mainland and islands off the coast of Southeast Asia. =Discovery and taxonomy= The earliest known mention of a slow loris in scientific literature is from 1770, when Dutchman Arnout Vosmaer (1720‚Äì1799) described a specimen of what we know today as N. bengalensis that he had received two years earlier. The French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, later questioned Vosmaer's decision to affiliate the animal with sloths, arguing that it was more closely aligned with the lorises of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and Bengal. The word \\"loris\\" was first used in 1765 by Buffon as a close equivalent to a Dutch name, loeris. This etymology was later supported by the physician William Baird in the 1820s, who noted that the Dutch word loeris signified \\"a clown\\". In 1785, the Dutch physician and naturalist Pieter Boddaert was the first to officially describe a species of slow loris using the name Tardigradus coucang. This species was based on the \\"tailless maucauco\\" described by Thomas Pennant in 1781, which is thought to have been based on a Sunda slow loris, and on Vosmaer's description of a Bengal slow loris. Consequently, there has been some disagreement over the identity of Tardigradus coucang; currently the name is given to the Sunda slow loris. The next slow loris species to be described was Lori bengalensis (currently Nycticebus bengalensis), named by Bernard Germain de Lac√©p√®de in 1800. In 1812, √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire named the genus Nycticebus, naming it for its nocturnal behavior. The name derives from the , genitive form of (, \\"night\\"), and (, \\"monkey\\"). Geoffroy also named Nycticebus javanicus in this work. Later 19th-century authors also called the slow lorises Nycticebus, but most used the species name tardigradus (given by Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of Systema Natur√¶) for slow lorises, until mammalogists Witmer Stone and James A. G. Rehn clarified in 1902 that Linnaeus's name actually referred to a slender loris. Several more species were named around 1900, including Nycticebus menagensis (originally Lemur menagensis) by Richard Lydekker in 1893 and Nycticebus pygmaeus by John James Lewis Bonhote in 1907. However, in 1939 Reginald Innes Pocock consolidated all slow lorises into a single species, N. coucang, and in his influential 1953 book Primates: Comparative Anatomy and Taxonomy, primatologist William Charles Osman Hill also followed this course. In 1971 Colin Groves recognized the pygmy slow loris (N. pygmaeus) as a separate species, and divided N. coucang into four subspecies, while in 2001 Groves opined there were three species (N. coucang, N. pygmaeus, and N. bengalensis), and that N. coucang had three subspecies (Nycticebus coucang coucang, N. c. menagensis, and N. c. javanicus). N. kayan) was distinguished from N. menagensis in 2012. In 2006, the Bornean slow loris was elevated to the species level (as Nycticebus menagensis) based on molecular analysis of DNA sequences of the D-loop and the cytochrome b gene. In 2008, Groves and Ibnu Maryanto confirmed the promotion of the fifth species, the Javan slow loris, to species status, a move that had been suggested in previous studies from 2000. They based their decision on an analysis of cranial morphology and characteristics of pelage. Species differentiation was based largely on differences in morphology, such as size, fur color, and head markings. To help clarify species and subspecies boundaries, and to establish whether morphology-based classifications were consistent with evolutionary relationships, the phylogenetic relationships within the genus Nycticebus were investigated by Chen and colleagues using DNA sequences derived from the mitochondrial markers D-loop and cytochrome b. Previous molecular analyses using karyotypes, restriction enzymes, and DNA sequences were focused on understanding the relationships between a few species, not the phylogeny of the entire genus. The analyses published in 2006 by Chen and colleagues' proved inconclusive, although one test suggested that N. coucang and N. bengalensis apparently share a closer evolutionary relationship with each other than with members of their own species, possibly due to introgressive hybridization since the tested individuals of these two taxa originated from a region of sympatry in southern Thailand. This hypothesis was corroborated by a 2007 study that compared the variations in mitochondrial DNA sequences between N. bengalensis and N. coucang, and suggested that there has been gene flow between the two species. In 2012, two taxonomic synonyms (formerly recognized as subspecies) of N. menagensis‚ÄîN. bancanus and N. borneanus‚Äîwere elevated to species status, and a new species‚ÄîN. kayan‚Äîwas also distinguished from the same. Rachel Munds, Anna Nekaris and Susan Ford based these taxonomic revisions on distinguishable facial markings. With that, the N. menagensis species complex that had been collectively known as the Bornean slow loris became four species: the Philippine slow loris (N. menagensis), the Bornean slow loris (N. borneanus), the Bangka slow loris (N. bancanus), and the Kayan River slow loris (N. kayan). Anatomy and physiology The skull of the Sunda slow loris Slow lorises have a round head because their skull is shorter than in other living strepsirrhine. Like other lorisids, their snout does not taper towards the front of the face as it does in lemurs, making the face appear less long and pointed. Compared with the slender lorises, the snout of the slow loris is even less pointed. As with other members of Lorisidae, its interorbital distance is shorter than in lemurs. The skull has prominent crests (ridges of bone). A distinguishing feature of the slow loris skull is that the occipital bone is flattened and faces backward. The foramen magnum (hole through which the spinal cord enters) faces directly backward. The brains of slow lorises have more folds (convolutions) than the brains of galagos. Coloration patterns around the eyes differ between the slender lorises (middle two) and the slow lorises (top and bottom). The ears are small, sparsely covered in hair, and hidden in the fur. Similar to the slender lorises, the fur around and directly above the eyes is dark. Unlike the slender lorises, however, the white stripe that separates the eye rings broadens both on the tip of the nose and on the forehead while also fading out on the forehead. Like other strepsirrhine primates, the nose and lip are covered by a moist skin called the rhinarium (\\"wet nose\\"), which is a sense organ. The eyes of slow lorises are forward- facing, which gives stereo vision. Their eyes are large and possess a reflective layer, called the tapetum lucidum, that improves low-light vision. It is possible that this layer blurs the images they see, as the reflected light may interfere with the incoming light. Slow lorises have monochromatic vision, meaning they see in shades of only one color. They lack the opsin gene that would allow them to detect short wavelength light, which includes the colors blue and green. The dental formula of slow lorises is , meaning that on each side of the mouth there are two upper (maxillary) and lower (mandibular) incisors, one upper and lower canine tooth, three upper and lower premolars, and three upper and lower molars, giving a total of 36 permanent teeth. As in all other crown strepsirrhines, their lower incisors and canine are procumbent (lie down and face outwards), forming a toothcomb, which is used for personal and social grooming and feeding. The toothcomb is kept clean by the sublingua or \\"under-tongue\\", a specialized structure that acts like a toothbrush to remove hair and other debris. The sublingua extends below the tip of the tongue and is tipped with keratinized, serrated points that rake between the front teeth. Slow lorises have relatively large maxillary canine teeth, their inner (mesial) maxillary incisors are larger than the outer (distal) maxillary incisors, and they have a diastema (gap) between the canine and the first premolar. The first mandibular premolar is elongated, and the last molar has three cusps on the crown, the shortest of which is near the back. The bony palate (roof of the mouth) only goes as far back as the second molar. Slow lorises range in weight from the Bornean slow loris at to as much as for the Bengal slow loris. Slow lorises have stout bodies, and their tails are only stubs and hidden beneath the dense fur. Their combined head and body lengths vary by species, but range from between all species. The trunk is longer than in other living strepsirrhines because they have 15‚Äì16 thoracic vertebrae, compared to 12‚Äì14 in other living strepsirrhines. This gives them greater mobility when twisting and extending towards nearby branches. Their other vertebrae include seven cervical vertebrae, six or seven lumbar vertebrae, six or seven sacral vertebrae, and seven to eleven caudal vertebrae. The eyes of slow lorises are large and have a reflective layer, called the tapetum lucidum, to help them see better at night. Unlike galagos, which have longer legs than arms, slow lorises have arms and legs of nearly equal length. Their intermembral index (ratio of arm to leg length) averages 89, indicating that their forelimbs are slightly shorter than their hind limbs. As with the slender lorises, their arms are slightly longer than their body, but the extremities of slow lorises are more stout. Slow lorises have a powerful grasp with both their hands and feet due to several specializations. They can tightly grasp branches with little effort because of a special muscular arrangement in their hands and feet, where the thumb diverges at nearly 180¬∞ from the rest of the fingers, while the hallux (big toe) ranges between being perpendicular and pointing slightly backwards. The toes have a large flexor muscle that originates on the lower end of the thigh bone, which helps to impart a strong grasping ability to the hind limbs. The second digit of the hand is short compared to the other digits, while on the foot, the fourth toe is the longest. The sturdy thumb helps to act like a clamp when digits three, four, and five grasp the opposite side of a tree branch. This gives their hands and feet a pincer-like appearance. The strong grip can be held for hours without losing sensation due to the presence of a rete mirabile (network of capillaries), a trait shared among all lorises. Both slender and slow lorises have relatively short feet. Like nearly all lemuriforms, they have a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot. Slow lorises have an unusually low basal metabolic rate, about 40% of the typical value for placental mammals of their size, comparable to that of sloths. Since they consume a relatively high- calorie diet that is available year-round, it has been proposed that this slow metabolism is due primarily to the need to eliminate toxic compounds from their food. For example, slow lorises can feed on Gluta bark, which may be fatal to humans. Distribution and diversity Slow lorises are found in South and Southeast Asia. Their collective range stretches from Northeast India through Indochina, east to the Sulu Archipelago (the small, southern islands of the Philippines), and south to the island of Java (including Borneo, Sumatra, and many small nearby islands). They are found in India (Northeastern states), China (Yunnan province), Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Burma, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, and Singapore. There are currently eight recognized species. The pygmy slow loris (N. pygmaeus) occurs east of the Mekong River in Yunnan, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. The Bornean slow loris (N. menagensis), found on Borneo and nearby islands, including the Sulu Archipelago, and in 2012 was split into four distinct species (adding N. bancanus, N. borneanus, and N. kayan). The Javan slow loris (N. javanicus) is only found on the island of Java in Indonesia. The Sunda slow loris (N. coucang) occurs on Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, including Singapore and southern Thailand (the Isthmus of Kra). The Bengal slow loris (N. bengalensis) has the largest distribution of all the slow lorises and can be found in Bangladesh, Cambodia, southern China, Northeast India, Laos, Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam. Slow lorises range across tropical and subtropical regions and are found in primary and secondary rainforests, as well as bamboo groves and mangrove forests. They prefer forests with high, dense canopies, although some species have also been found in disturbed habitats, such as cacao plantations and mixed-crop home gardens. Due largely to their nocturnal behavior and the subsequent difficulties in accurately quantifying abundance, data about the population size or distribution patterns of slow lorises is limited. In general, encounter rates are low; a combined analysis of several field studies involving transect surveys conducted in South and Southeast Asia determined encounter rates ranging from as high as 0.74 lorises per kilometer for N. coucang to as low as 0.05 lorises per kilometer for N. pygmaeus. Behavior and ecology Infants are either parked on branches or carried by one of their parents while they forage. Little is known about the social structure of slow lorises, but they generally spend most of the night foraging alone. Individuals sleep during the day, usually alone but occasionally with other slow lorises. Home ranges of adults may significantly overlap, and those of males are generally larger than those of females. In the absence of direct studies of the genus, primatologist Simon Bearder speculated that slow loris social behavior is similar to that of the potto, another nocturnal primate. Such a social system is distinguished by a lack of matriarchy and by factors that allow the slow loris to remain inconspicuous and minimize energy expenditure. Vocal exchanges and alarm calls are limited; scent marking with urine is the dominant form of communication. Adult males are highly territorial and are aggressive towards other males. Vocalizations include an affiliative (friendly) call krik, and a louder call resembling a crow's caw. When disturbed, slow lorises can also produce a low buzzing hiss or growl. To make contact with other individuals, they emit a single high-pitched rising tone, and females use a high whistle when in estrus. In Indonesia, slow lorises are called malu malu or \\"shy one\\" because they freeze and cover their face when spotted. Slow lorises are slow and deliberate climbers, and often hold on to branches with three of their four limbs. To move between trees, they carefully grip the terminal branches of the neighboring tree and pull themselves across the small gap. They will also grip branches with only their hind feet, lift themselves upright, and quickly launch forward with their hands to catch prey. Due to their slow movement, all lorises, including the slow lorises, have a specially adapted mechanism for defense against predation. Their slow, deliberate movement hardly disturbs the vegetation and is almost completely silent. Once disturbed, they immediately stop moving and remain motionless. In Indonesia, slow lorises are called malu malu or \\"shy one\\" because they freeze and cover their face when spotted. If cornered, they may adopt a defensive posture by curling up and lunging at the predator. The Acehnese name, buah angin (\\"wind monkey\\"), refers to their ability to \\"fleetingly but silently escape\\". Little is known about the predation of slow lorises. Documented predators include snakes, the changeable hawk-eagle (Nisaetus cirrhatus), and Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii). Other potential predators include cats, sun bears (Helarctos malayanus), binturongs (Arctictis binturong), and Asian palm civets. Slow lorises produce a secretion from their brachial gland (a scent gland on the upper arm near the axilla) that is licked and mixed with their saliva. In tests, three predators‚Äîbinturongs, clouded leopards (Neofelis nebulosa), and sun bears‚Äîretreated or showed other signs of displeasure when presented with cotton swabs anointed with a mixture of the toxic secretion and the saliva, whereas the toxic secretion alone generated mild interest. Before stashing their offspring in a secure location, female slow lorises will lick their brachial glands, and then groom their young with their toothcomb, depositing the toxin on their fur. When threatened, slow lorises may also lick their brachial glands and bite their aggressors, delivering the toxin into the wounds. Slow lorises can be reluctant to release their bite, which is likely to maximize the transfer of toxins. This toxic bite is a rare trait among mammals and unique to lorisid primates. It may also be used for defense against other slow lorises and parasites. According to Nekaris, this adaptation‚Äîalong with vocalizations, movement, and coloration patterns similar to those of true cobras‚Äîmay have evolved through M√ºllerian mimicry to protect slow lorises when they need to move across the ground due to breaks in the canopy. Slow lorises have a special network of capillaries in their hands and feet that allow them to cling to branches for hours without losing sensation. Studies suggest that slow lorises are polygynandrous. Infants are either parked on branches while their parents find food or else are carried by one of the parents. Due to their long gestations (about six months), small litter sizes, low birth weights, long weaning times (three to six months), and long gaps between births, slow loris populations have one of the slowest growth rates among mammals of similar size. Pygmy slow lorises are likely to give birth to twins‚Äîfrom 50% to 100% of births, depending on the study; in contrast, this phenomenon is rare (3% occurrence) in Bengal slow lorises. A seven-year study of captive-bred pygmy slow lorises showed a skewed sex distribution, with 1.68 males born for every 1 female. Breeding may be continuous throughout the year. Copulation often occurs while suspended with the hands and feet clinging to horizontal branches for support. In captive Sunda slow lorises, mating primarily occurs between June and mid-September, with the estrus cycle lasting 29 to 45 days and estrus lasting one to five days. Likewise, gestation lasts 185 to 197 days, and the young weigh between at birth. Females reach sexual maturity at 18 to 24 months, while males are capable of reproducing at 17 months. However, the fathers become hostile towards their male offspring after 12 to 14 months and will chase them away. In captivity, they can live 20 or more years. =Diet= Slow lorises are omnivores, eating insects and other arthropods, small birds and reptiles, eggs, fruits, gums, nectar and miscellaneous vegetation. A 1984 study of the Sunda slow loris indicated that its diet consists of 71% fruit and gums, and 29% insects and other animal prey. A more detailed study of another Sunda slow loris population in 2002 and 2003 showed different dietary proportions, consisting of 43.3% gum, 31.7% nectar, 22.5% fruit, and just 2.5% arthropods and other animal prey. The most common dietary item was nectar from flowers of the Bertram palm (Eugeissona tristis). The Sunda slow loris eats insects that other predators avoid due to their repugnant taste or smell. Preliminary results of studies on the pygmy slow loris indicate that its diet consists primarily of gums and nectar (especially nectar from Saraca dives flowers), and that animal prey makes up 30‚Äì40% of its diet. However, one 2002 analysis of pygmy slow loris feces indicated that it contained 98% insect remains and just 2% plant remains. The pygmy slow loris often returns to the same gum feeding sites and leaves conspicuous gouges on tree trunks when inducing the flow of exudates. Slow lorises have been reported gouging for exudates at heights ranging from to as much as ; the gouging process, whereby the loris repetitively bangs its toothcomb into the hard bark, may be loud enough to be heard up to away. The marks remaining after gouging can be used by field workers to assess loris presence in an area. Captive pygmy slow lorises also make characteristic gouge marks in wooden substrates, such as branches. It is not known how the sympatric pygmy and Bengal slow lorises partition their feeding niches. The plant gums, obtained typically from species in the family Fabaceae (peas), are high in carbohydrates and lipids, and can serve as a year-around source of food, or an emergency reserve when other preferred food items are scarce. Several anatomical adaptations present in slow lorises may enhance their ability to feed on exudates: a long narrow tongue to make it easier to reach gum stashed in cracks and crevices, a large cecum to help the animal digest complex carbohydrates, and a short duodenum to help quickly pass potentially toxic exudates. Slow lorises can use both hands to eat while hanging upside down from a branch. They spend about 20% of their nightly activities feeding. = Venom = The secretion from the brachial gland of captive slow lorises is similar to the allergen in cat dander, hence the secretions may merely elicit an allergic reaction, not toxicosis. Loris bites cause a painful swelling, and the single case of human death reported in the scientific literature was believed to have resulted from anaphylactic shock. Slow lorises (of the genus Nycticebus) are accepted as the only known venomous primate. Slow loris venom was known in folklore in their host countries throughout southeast Asia for centuries, but dismissed by western science until the 1990s. Animal dealers in Southeast Asia keep tanks of water nearby so that in case of a bite, they can submerge both their arm and the slow loris to make the animal let go. It is thought all nine recognised species of this small-bodied nocturnal primate are venomous. They possess a dual composite venom consisting of saliva and brachial gland exudate, a malodourous fluid forming from an apocrine sweat gland on the animal's forearm. Both fluids have been demonstrated as being venomous individually and creating a more potent venom when mixed. Slow loris brachial gland exudate (BGE) has been shown to possess up to 142 volatile components, and possesses a variant of the cat allergen protein Fel-D1. The BGE has several ecological functions including anti-parasitic defence and communication. Slow loris saliva has been shown to be cytotoxic to human skin cells in laboratory experiments without the admix of BGE. The venom is administered through morphologically distinct dentition in the form of an adapted toothcomb. In the wild, envenomation occurs from intraspecific competition; whereby two slow lorises fight for mates, food or territory. Slow loris inflicted wounds is a major cause of premature death in zoo and wildlife slow loris populations; often resulting in festering and necrotic wounds. Slow loris envenomation in humans is rare; but can result in near fatal anaphylactic shock. A suite of additional effects of the venom have been documented including ranging from mild to permanent disfigurement and mobility loss and near-death. To protect itself, the Slow loris has also been observed to rub the venom on its fur. It then has the ability to chemically- defend itself from predator, making itself unpalatable, and able to fend off predators with burning. Secondary toxins may be introduced from the consumption of wild food, augmenting the toxicity. The combined brachial secretion and saliva of recently captured wild lorises was shown to contain batrachotoxins, which were not found in slow lorises held in captivity for more than a year. The study of slow loris venom was brought to the public attention in 2012 by the research of the world-renowned Professor K. A. I. Nekaris and in her award-winning BBC documentary, The Jungle Gremlins of Java. In culture Beliefs about slow lorises and their use in traditional practices are deep-rooted and go back at least 300 years, if not earlier based on oral traditions. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was reported that the people from the interior of Borneo believed that slow lorises were the gatekeepers for the heavens and that each person had a personal slow loris waiting for them in the afterlife. More often, however, slow lorises are used in traditional medicine or to ward off evil. The following passage from an early textbook about primates is indicative of the superstitions associated with slow lorises: > Many strange powers are attributed to this animal by the natives of the > countries it inhabits; there is hardly an event in life to man, woman or > child, or even domestic animals, that may not be influenced for better or > worse by the Slow Loris, alive or dead, or by any separate part of it, and > apparently one cannot usually tell at the time, that one is under > supernatural power. Thus a Malay may commit a crime he did not premeditate, > and then find that an enemy had buried a particular part of a Loris under > his threshold, which had, unknown to him, compelled him to act to his own > disadvantage. ... [a slow loris's] life is not a happy one, for it is > continually seeing ghosts; that is why it hides its face in its hands. In the Mondulkiri Province of Cambodia, hunters believe that lorises can heal their own broken bones immediately after falling from a branch so that they can climb back up the tree. They also believe that slow lorises have medicinal powers because they require more than one hit with a stick to die. In the province of North Sumatra, the slow loris is thought to bring good luck if it is buried under a house or a road. In the same province, slow loris body parts were used to place curses on enemies. In Java, it was thought that putting a piece of its skull in a water jug would make a husband more docile and submissive, just like a slow loris in the daytime. More recently, researchers have documented the belief that the consumption of loris meat was an aphrodisiac that improves \\"male power\\". The gall bladder of the Bengal slow loris has historically been used to make ink for tattoos by the village elders in Pursat and Koh Kong Provinces of Cambodia. Loris wine is a traditional Cambodian medicine supposed to alleviate the pain of childbirth, made from a mixture of loris bodies and rice wine. Conservation Slow lorises are popular in the exotic pet trade, which threatens wild populations. The two greatest threats to slow lorises are deforestation and the wildlife trade. Slow lorises have lost a significant amount of habitat, with habitat fragmentation isolating small populations and obstructing biological dispersal. However, despite the lost habitat, their decline is most closely associated with unsustainable trade, either as exotic pets or for traditional medicine. Each of the slow loris species that had been identified prior to 2012 are currently listed as either \\"Vulnerable\\" or \\"Endangered\\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on their Red List. When they were all considered a single species, imprecise population data together with their regular occurrence in Southeast Asian animal markets combined to erroneously suggest that slow lorises were common. This manifested as incorrect Red List assessments of \\"Least Concern\\" as recently as 2000. The three newest species are yet to be evaluated by the IUCN, although each were once thought to be subpopulations of the Bornean slow loris‚Äîwhich was evaluated as \\"Vulnerable\\" in 2008. With this division of its range and population, the Bornean slow loris and the three new species face a higher risk of extinction than before. Since 2007, all slow loris species have been protected from commercial international trade under Appendix I of CITES. Furthermore, local trade is illegal because every nation in which they occur naturally has laws protecting them. Despite their CITES Appendix I status and local legal protection, slow lorises are still threatened by both local and international trade due to problems with enforcement. Surveys are needed to determine existing population densities and habitat viability for all species of slow loris. Connectivity between protected areas is important for slow lorises because they are not adapted to dispersing across the ground over large distances. Populations of Bengal and Sunda slow lorises are not faring well in zoos. Of the 29 captive specimens in North American zoos in 2008, several are hybrids that cannot breed, while most are past their reproductive years. The last captive birth for these species in North America was in 2001 in San Diego. Pygmy slow lorises are doing better in North American zoos; from the late 1980s (when they were imported) to 2008, the population grew to 74 animals, with most of them born at the San Diego Zoo. =Wildlife trade= Until the 1960s, the hunting of slow lorises was sustainable, but due to growing demand, decreased supply, and the subsequent increased value of the marketed wildlife, slow lorises have been overexploited and are in decline. With the use of modern technology, such as battery-powered search lights, slow lorises have become easier to hunt because of their eye shine. Traditional medicine made from loris parts is thought to cure many diseases, and the demand for this medicine from wealthy urban areas has replaced the subsistence hunting traditionally performed in poor rural areas. A survey by primatologist Anna Nekaris and colleagues (2010) showed that these belief systems were so strong that the majority of respondents expressed reluctance to consider alternatives to loris-based medicines. Slow lorises are sold locally at street markets, but are also sold internationally over the Internet and in pet stores. They are especially popular or trendy in Japan, particularly among women. The reasons for their popularity, according to the Japan Wildlife Conservation Society, are that \\"they're easy to keep, they don't cry, they're small, and just very cute.\\" = Common misconceptions = Because of their \\"cuteness\\", videos of pet slow lorises are some of the most frequently watched animal-related viral videos on YouTube. In March 2011, a newly posted video of a slow loris holding a cocktail umbrella had been viewed more than two million times, while an older video of a slow loris being tickled had been viewed more than six million times. According to Nekaris, these videos are misunderstood by most people who watch them, since most do not realize that it is illegal in most countries to own them as pets and that the slow lorises in the videos are only docile because that is their passive defensive reaction to threatening situations. Despite frequent advertisements by pet shops in Japan, the World Conservation Monitoring Centre reported that only a few dozen slow lorises were legally imported in 2006, suggesting frequent smuggling. Slow lorises are also smuggled to China, Taiwan, Europe, Russia, the United States, and Saudi Arabia for use as pets. Slow lorises have their front teeth cut or pulled before being sold as pets, a practice that often causes infection and death. Within their countries of origin, slow lorises are very popular pets, particularly in Indonesia. They are seen as a \\"living toy\\" for children by local people or are bought out of pity by Western tourists or expatriates. Neither local nor foreign buyers usually know anything about these primates, their endangered status, or that the trade is illegal. According to National Geographic, slow lorises are protected by both local laws in southern Asia and by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Furthermore, few know about their strong odor or their painful bite, which may lead to anaphylaxis in some cases. According to data compiled from monthly surveys and interviews with local traders, nearly a thousand locally sourced slow lorises exchanged hands in the Medan bird market in North Sumatra during the late first decade of the 21st century. International trade usually causes a high mortality rate during transit, between 30% and 90%. Slow lorises also experience many health problems due to both local and international trade. In order to give the impression that the primates are tame and appropriate pets for children, to protect people from their potentially toxic bite, or to deceive buyers into thinking the animal is a baby, animal dealers either pull the front teeth with pliers or wire cutters or cut them off with nail cutters. This results in severe bleeding, which sometimes causes shock or death. Dental infection is common and is fatal in 90% of cases. Without their teeth, the animals can no longer fend for themselves in the wild, and must remain in captivity for life. The slow lorises found in animal markets are usually underweight and malnourished, and have had their fur dyed, which complicates species identification at rescue centers. As many as 95% of the slow lorises rescued from the markets die of dental infection or improper care. As part of the trade, infants are pulled prematurely from their parents, leaving them unable to remove their own urine, feces, and oily skin secretions from their fur. Slow lorises have a special network of blood vessels in their hands and feet, which makes them vulnerable to cuts when pulled from the wire cages they are kept in. Slow lorises are also stress-sensitive and do not do well in captivity. Common health problems seen in pet slow lorises include undernourishment, tooth decay, diabetes, obesity, and kidney failure. Infection, stress, pneumonia, and poor nutrition lead to high death rates among pet lorises. Pet owners also fail to provide proper care because they are usually asleep when the nocturnal pet is awake. References =Works cited=         Abstract in French and English.

Several articles in several parts of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany govern elections and establish constitutional requirements such as the secret ballot, and requirement that all elections be conducted in a free and fair manner. The Basic Law also requires that the federal legislature enact detailed federal laws to govern elections; electoral law(s). One such article is Article 38, regarding the election of deputies in the federal Bundestag. Article 38.2 of the Basic Law establishes universal suffrage: \\"Any person who has attained the age of eighteen shall be entitled to vote; any person who has attained the age of majority may be elected.\\" German federal elections are for all members of the Bundestag, which in turn determines who is the Chancellor of Germany. Federal elections were held in 2009, 2013 and in 2017. German elections 1871 to 1945 After the unification of Germany under Emperor Wilhelm I in 1871, elections were held to the German Reichstag or ‚ÄòImperial Assembly‚Äô, which supplanted its namesake, the Reichstag of the Norddeutscher Bund. The Reichstag could be dissolved by the Kaiser or, after the abdication of Wilhelm II in 1918, the Reichspr√§sident. With the Weimar Republic's Constitution of 1919, the voting system changed from single-member constituencies to proportional representation. The election age was reduced from 25 to 20 years of age.Peter Marschalck: Bev√∂lkerungsgeschichte Deutschlands im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert, Frankfurt am Main 1984, S. 173. Women's suffrage had already been established by a new electoral law in 1918 following the November Revolution of that year. Following the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933, another national election was held on 5 March. This was the last competitive election before World War II, although it was neither free nor fair. Violence and intimidation by the Sturmabteilung, SS and Der Stahlhelm had been underway for months against trade-unionists, communists, social democrats, and even centre-right Catholics.Evans, Richard J., The Coming of the Third Reich, Penguin Press, New York, 2004. On 27 February, just prior to the election, the Reichstag Fire Decree suspended freedom of the press and most civil liberties. Mass arrests followed, including all Communist (KPD) and several Social Democrat (SPD) delegates to the Reichstag. 50000 members of the Hilfspolizei (auxiliary Nazi police) \\"monitored\\" polling places on election day to further intimidate voters. While the NSDAP performed better than it had in the elections of November 1932, it still won only 33% of the vote. By placing their rivals in jail and intimidating others not to take their seats, the Nazis went from a plurality to the majority. Just two weeks after election, the Enabling Act of 1933 effectively gave Hitler dictatorial power. Three more elections were held in Nazi Germany before the war. They all took the form of a one-question referendum, asking voters to approve a predetermined list of candidates composed exclusively of Nazis and nominally independent \\"guests\\" of the party. =Imperial elections= * 1st 1871 German federal election * 2nd 1874 German federal election * 3rd 1877 German federal election * 4th 1878 German federal election * 5th 1881 German federal election * 6th 1884 German federal election * 7th 1887 German federal election * 8th 1890 German federal election * 9th 1893 German federal election * 10th 1898 German federal election * 11th 1903 German federal election * 12th 1907 German federal election * 13th 1912 German federal election =Weimar Republic elections= * 1st 1919 German federal election * 2nd 1920 German federal election * 3rd May 1924 German federal election * 4th December 1924 German federal election * 5th 1928 German federal election * 6th 1930 German federal election * 7th July 1932 German federal election * 8th November 1932 German federal election =Elections in Nazi Germany= * 9th March 1933 German federal election * 10th November 1933 German federal election * 11th German election, 1936 * 12th German election, 1938 German elections since 1949 =Federal Republic of Germany= Election system The German political system Federal elections are conducted approximately every four years, resulting from the constitutional requirement for elections to be held 46 to 48 months after the assembly of the Reichstag. Elections can be held earlier in exceptional constitutional circumstances: for example, were the Chancellor to lose a vote of confidence in the Bundestag, then, during a grace period before the Bundestag can vote in a replacement Chancellor, the Chancellor could request the Federal President to dissolve the Bundestag and hold elections. Should the Bundestag be dismissed before the four-year period has ended, elections must be held within 100 days. The exact date of the election is chosen by the President and must be a Sunday or public holiday. German nationals over the age of 18 who have resided in Germany for at least three months are eligible to vote. Eligibility for candidacy is essentially the same. The federal legislature in Germany has a one chamber parliament‚Äîthe Bundestag (Federal Diet); the Bundesrat (Federal Council) represents the regions and is not considered a chamber as its members are not elected. The Bundestag is elected using a mixed member proportional system. The Bundestag has 598 nominal members, elected for a four-year term. Half, 299 members, are elected in single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting, while a further 299 members are allocated from party lists to achieve a proportional distribution in the legislature, conducted according to a form of proportional representation called the Mixed member proportional representation system (MMP). Voters vote once for a constituency representative, and a second time for a party, and the lists are used to make the party balances match the distribution of second votes. Overhang seats may add to the nominal number of 598 members: for example, in the 2009 federal election there were 24 overhang seats, giving a total of 622 seats. This is caused by larger parties winning additional single-member constituencies above the totals determined by their proportional party vote. Germany has a multi-party system with two strong political parties and some other third parties also represented in the Bundestag. Since 1990, five parties (counting the CDU and CSU as one) have been represented in the Bundestag. In 2008, some modifications to the electoral system were required under an order of the Federal Constitutional Court. The court had found that a provision in the Federal Election Law made it possible for a party to experience a negative vote weight, thus losing seats due to more votes, and found that this violated the constitutional guarantee of the electoral system being equal and direct. The court allowed three years to amend the law. Accordingly, the 2009 federal election was allowed to proceed under the previous system. The changes were due by 30 June 2011, but appropriate legislation was not completed by that deadline. A new electoral law was enacted in late 2011, but declared unconstitutional once again by the Federal Constitutional Court upon lawsuits from the opposition parties and a group of some 4,000 private citizens.Decision of the Federal Constitutional Court. 25 July 2012. Retrieved 13 August 2012. Finally, four of the five factions in the Bundestag agreed on an electoral reform whereby the number of seats in the Bundestag will be increased as much as necessary to ensure that any overhang seats are compensated through apportioned leveling seats, to ensure full proportionality according to the political party's share of party votes at the national level.Bill amending the Federal Election Law. 11 December 2012. Retrieved 25 December 2012. The Bundestag approved and enacted the new electoral reform in February 2013.

The 18 March 1990 election were the first free ones held in the GDR, producing a government whose major mandate was to negotiate an end to itself and its state. Prior to the Fall of the Berlin Wall, East Germany did not have free elections. Polling places were under surveillance by the state security apparatuses and the ruling party, the SED, presented voters with a slate of proposed candidates. Voters could optionally enter a booth to strike any candidates the voter did not want; a voter who agreed with the SED's full list simply folded the unmarked ballot in half and placed it into the ballot box. Entering a voting booth was considered suspicious and was noted by the state security apparatuses, which could lead to consequences later for the voter. East German voters commonly referred to the act of voting as \\"folding\\" (). Election outcomes prior to 1990 commonly saw 99% of voters in favor of the suggested slate of candidates. On top of this, the government engaged in electoral fraud and commonly falsified both results and voter turnout percentages, even as late as the May 1989 municipal elections. *1949 East German Constitutional Assembly election *1950 East German general election *1954 East German general election *1958 East German general election *1963 East German general election *1967 East German general election *1971 East German general election *1976 East German general election *1981 East German general election *1986 East German general election *1990 East German general election =Local elections= See: Local elections in Germany (German: Kommunalwahlen) include elections for most regional and local subdivisions, unless their representatives are appointed or elected by another assembly or office. Such local elections are conducted for representatives in districts, cities, towns, villages and various other administrative regional organizations. In cities and towns local elections usually include voting for a lord mayor or mayor. Smaller villages and settlements may elect a representative (German: Ortsvorsteher) with limited administrative power. Local elections are also often combined with polls about important local matters and questions of general public interest (i.e. the construction of local roads or other infrastructure facilities). While such polls are not legally binding in most cases, their results have considerable influence on local political decisions. After the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 to strengthen the European integration, Germany and other EU member states implemented legislative changes to grant foreigners of other EU countries the right to vote in local elections in their host country. Foreign EU citizens can vote in elections on district and municipal level in Germany, after the German states adapted their regulations between 1995 and 1998.

The tonal alternation it describes is the lowering, in some contexts, of the last tone of a pattern of two adjacent High tones (HH), resulting in the pattern HL. The phenomenon is named after its first observer, the Belgian Bantu specialist A. E. Meeussen (1912‚Äì1978). In phonological terms, the phenomenon can be seen as a special case of the Obligatory Contour Principle. The term \\"Meeussen's Rule\\" (the spelling with a capital R is more common) first appeared in a paper by John Goldsmith in 1981.Goldsmith (1981).Google ngrams. It is based on an observation made by Meeussen in his 1963 article on the Tonga verb stating that \\"in a sequence of determinants, only the first is treated as a determinant\\".Meeussen (1963) It was John Goldsmith who reformulated this as the rule HH > HL (or, as he expressed it, H ‚Üí L / H _ _ ) which later became well known as Meeussen's Rule.Goldsmith (1984b), pp. 29, 50. Meeussen's rule is one of a number of processes in Bantu languages by which a series of consecutive high tones is avoided. These processes result in a less tonal, more accentual character in Bantu tone systems, ending finally in a situation in which there tends to be only one tone per word or morpheme.See Laura Downing in Hulst, Harry van der; Goedemans, Rob; Zanten, Ellen van (2010) A Survey of Word Accentual Patterns in the Languages of the World. de Gruyter, p. 412. Examples Here are some illustrations of the phenomenon in Kirundi (examples adapted from Philippson 1998). =In verb forms= * na-r√°-zi-b√°riira (I-PAST-them.CL10-to sew) 'I was sewing them' (them refers to a class 10 plural) * na-r√°-bariira (I-PAST-to sew) 'I was sewing' In the first sentence, both the tense marker r√° and the verb form b√°riira (to sew) carry a high tone, signified by the acute accent. They are separated by the pronominal marker zi. In the second sentence, the pronominal marker zi is left out, resulting in two adjacent High tones. Due to the phenomenon described by Meeussen's rule, the second High tone changes into a Low tone. =In noun forms= * buk√©eye > umu…≤√°buk√©eye * mw√°aro > umu…≤√°mwaaro These examples show a way of deriving from place names nouns with the meaning 'a person originating from'. In the first example, the place name buk√©eye has a High tone on the second syllable. The junction with umu…≤√° ('person from') has no influence on this tone. In the second example, a place name with a High tone on the first syllable is used. Like above, the second High tone of the resulting pattern of two adjacent High tones is changed into a Low tone due to the phenomenon described by Meeussen's rule. =HHH > HLL= Just as HH (High tone + High tone) can become HL (High tone + Low tone) by Meeussen's rule, so also HHH will often become HLL, and HHHH will become HLLL. Thus in the Luganda language of Uganda, the word *b√°-l√≠-l√°ba 'they will see', which theoretically has three High tones, is actually pronounced b√°lilab√° with only one.Hyman & Katamba (1993), pp. 36, 45. (The tone on the last syllable is an automatically generated phrasal tone; see Luganda tones.) This process does not operate in the same way in every language, however. For example, in Shona, a Bantu language of Zimbabwe, the similar verb *√°-ch√°-t√©ng√° 'he will buy' transforms to √°-cha-t√©ng√°, where only one syllable is lowered by Meeussen's rule.Myers (1997), p. 864. =Exceptions to Meeussen's rule= Spreading of a tone across two or more syllables is quite common in Bantu languages. Tones which derive from spreading (or from plateauing, which is the spreading of high pitch from one high tone to another) are not affected by Meeussen's rule. Thus in the Chewa language of Malawi, for example, when the word kuph√≠ka 'to cook' is followed by a direct object such as nyama 'meat', the tone on the penultimate syllable will spread: kuph√≠k√° nyama 'to cook meat'.Kanerva (1990), p. 59. There are many other exceptions to Meeussen's rule. For example, in verbs in Shona, in certain circumstances two high tones may occur in adjacent syllables. In the subjunctive _t√≠-t√©_ ng√©s√© 'we should sell', both t√≠ and t√©- have underlying high tones (the high tones of -ng√©s√© arise from tone spreading), yet the tone of t√©- is not deleted.Myers, (1997), p. 870. Likewise in the Chewa verb a- _n√°-k√°_ -f√≥tokoza 'he went and explained', the tone of k√° 'go and' does not get lowered, despite following the high-toned tense-marker n√°.Hyman, Larry M. & Al D.

Moreno began his career with Boca Juniors, making his debut for the team September 26, 1999. He had a brief but successful stint with the team, scoring 5 goals in the Copa Libertadores 2000 match against Bolivian side Blooming. At the age of 21, Alfredo Moreno joined Club Necaxa (on loan with the option to buy the player in a definite purchase) for the Verano 2001 season. Moreno's debut in Mexico was on January 21, 2001, against Puebla FC. On his third game, he managed to score his first goal on Mexican soil by the virtue of penalty kick. However, in that same game against Club Celaya he was also booked twice and sent off. He scored 6 goals in 472 played for an average of one goal every 78 minutes in a season in which Necaxa failed to qualify for the post-season. The next six months were sort of a drought, for he only scored three goals. Moreno Necaxa did not make the purchase valid and Moreno was back in Argentina playing for Boca Juniors where he stayed there for a year and a half, helping the team to win the 2003 Copa Libertadores de Am√©rica. After he left Necaxa, however, Boca Juniors sent Alfredo on loan to China's Shandong FC where he had difficulty not only with his football abilities, but also the culture and communication. While in Asia, Moreno says that in training the coach would yell out some indications and a someone would have to translate to Spanish. To make things worse, the coach was Russian, so the indications started out in Russian, then Chinese and finally into Spanish. Later on, he joined Lokomotiv of the Russian League where he was there for a brief period of one month. Once again, Moreno would have a second stay with \\"Los Rayos\\" for the newly renamed 2003 Apertura where his presence was immediately noticed. In his third game on August 16, 2003, Moreno scored twice to win the game 2‚Äì0 against Atlante F.C.. In what would be his best season with Necaxa, Alfredo scored 10 times in 20 games (13 starts), but the team slumped in the quarter finals against the champion Pachuca 4‚Äì3 in an aggregate score (Club Necaxa lost 1‚Äì3 at home and won 2‚Äì1 away). For the next 2 and a half years (Apertura 2004, 2005 and Clausura 2004, 2005 and 2006) Moreno has scored 29 goals. In 2006, he played the Copa Libertadores again, this time with UANL Tigres alongside of fellow Necaxa striker Ariel Lopez \\"El Chupa\\". However, both failed to score in two goalless draws against Libertad of Paraguay where Tigres lost in penalty kicks. Moreno has been an excellent striker, placing in Necaxa's top ten all- time goal scorers with 49 goals in 136 games player. In the years he has been with Necaxa, they have reached the Liguilla (or postseason) four times, being eliminated by Cruz Azul (Invierno 2001), Pachuca (Apertura 2003 and Apertura 2005) and Tecos UAG (Clausura 2005) and Moreno still cannot find the net in those eight games played. Moreno during his time at San Luis F.C. After much speculation, after three bad seasons and after defending the Rayos jersey for more than five years, Moreno parted ways with Necaxa. On June 11, 2006, Alfredo was transferred alongside Mario Perez to San Luis F.C. during the 2007 Draft. In exchange, Rayos receiver Angel Reyna and Leonel Olmedo. In the Apertura tournament of 2007, Moreno was the best goal scorer. In the apertura 2008 tournament, Moreno was sent to play for Club America. However, after an inconsistent tournament with America scoring 4 goals, he was sent back to Necaxa for the clausura 2009 tournament where he saw the relegation after he was the only player who sacrificed to maintain Necaxa in the primera division. For the apertura 2009 and clausura 2010, Moreno played for San Luis where he showed his level was still intact. For the Apertura 2010, Moreno signed for Atlas de Guadalajara.

It is on the Epping branch of the Central line, between Snaresbrook and Woodford stations and is in Travelcard Zone 4. History Roundel on the eastbound platform, showing the old suffix. The station opened on 22 August 1856 as part of the Eastern Counties Railway branch to Loughton which opened that day. Originally named George Lane, the station was renamed twice: South Woodford (George Lane) on 5 July 1937; and South Woodford on 14 December 1947. The station formed part of the Great Eastern Railway's system until that company amalgamated with other railways to create the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923. On 5 July 1937 the station was renamed \\"South Woodford (George Lane)\\". The station was subsequently transferred to form part of London Underground's Central line on 14 December 1947 when Central line services were extended from Leytonstone to Woodford. This formed a part of the long planned, and delayed, Eastern Extension of the Central line that was part of the London Passenger Transport Board's \\"New Works Programme\\" of 1935 - 1940. After transferring to London Underground the \\"(George Lane)\\" suffix fell out of use, though it remains on some roundel signs.Tube Facts - Tube Stations with other/alternative names During the planning of the Victoria line, route options included a continuation of the line from Walthamstow Central to Woodford or South Woodford stations. However, in 1961, the decision was taken to build only as far as Walthamstow Central. The station today The station has two entrances, one on each side of the line. George Lane originally crossed the railway tracks with a level crossing immediately to the north of the station, but this was closed and the road split into two when the line was electrified. The footbridge can be used without a ticket as, unusually for stations on the Epping branch, the footbridge is outside the ticket gateline. For some years the station had step-free access to and from the eastbound platform only. The ramp to the westbound platform was installed and opened in March 2019, making the station fully step-free. Station improvements The station underwent considerable renovations in 2006, 150 years after it opened. Five new CCTV cameras were installed in the station underpass with the intention of improving security as, in addition to the multimillion-pound station refurbishment work being undertaken, crime statistics showed South Woodford station had the highest record of violent crime in Redbridge and the underpass was seen as a security risk, particularly after dark.Edited Press Releases Transport for London London Underground - Metronet improves security at South Woodford (page 7) The rebuilding of the section of westbound platform damaged by fire was also completed and the paint scheme was a mix of white, blue and orange. However, the footbridge over the tracks at the east end was not repainted. Services and connections Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 3‚Äì7 minutes between 07:03 and 22:39 eastbound and between 06:22 and 22:19 westbound. London Bus routes 179, 549, W12, W13 and W14, and night route N55 serve the station.

He was the councillor in Ward nine in Hamilton, Ontario from December 2006 to December 2014. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1999 to 2003, and was a cabinet minister in the governments of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves. In the 2018 municipal elections he again won councillor in Ward nine in Hamilton Ontario defeating Doug Conley. Background Clark was educated at Mohawk College in Hamilton, receiving a diploma in radio broadcasting. He owned and operated a small business after his graduation, and also served as executive director of the Songwriters Association of Canada. In June 2004, Clark began co-hosting a weekly program on aging on CHML radio. Politics In the provincial election of 1999, he ran as the Progressive Conservative candidate in the suburban Hamilton riding of Stoney Creek. He defeated Liberal candidate Chris Phillips by about 2,500 votes. On February 8, 2001, he was appointed as the province's Minister of Transportation. When Ernie Eves succeeded Mike Harris as Premier on April 15, 2002, he named Clark as his Minister of Labour. Clark was initially favoured for re-election in the provincial election of 2003 against Liberal candidate Tony Magnini. Magnini was forced to resign in mid-campaign amid allegations of fraud, however, and the Liberals were able to convince Jennifer Mossop, a popular local journalist, to take his place. She defeated Clark by over 5,000 votes. In 2004, he endorsed Frank Klees's bid to lead the Ontario Progressive Conservatives. On November 13, 2006, Clark beat out incumbent city councillor Phil Bruckler by a narrow margin for a seat on the Hamilton City Council to represent Ward 9, which includes the mountain and heritage areas of Stoney Creek. In the federal election of 2011 Clark ran against and was defeated by NDP incumbent Wayne Marston in the riding of Hamilton East‚ÄîStoney Creek. He did not step down from council when running for this political position. In the Hamilton Municipal Election of 2014, Clark ran for the mayoralty of the city. He placed second, being defeated by former Hamilton Mayor Fred Eisenberger.

In 2000, Capella began to offer bachelor's degree programs. Six years later, in 2006, Capella Education Company became a publicly traded company (NASDAQ: CPLA). In 2007, Capella was named one of 86 higher education institutions in the United States to have received the National Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAEIAE) designation by the National Security Agency (NSA). The designation was valid for the academic years 2007 through 2012. In March 2008, Capella Education Co., longtime occupant of the 225 South Sixth skyscraper in downtown Minneapolis, signed a new lease that expanded its office and renamed the building Capella Tower. The building houses all of the company's 1,150 downtown Minneapolis administrative staff.Sam Black, Capella lease to rename 225 South Sixth, Minneapolis / St. Paul Business Journal, March 20, 2008. In 2009, The Project Management Institute (PMI) Global Accreditation Center for Project Management (GAC) accredited two Capella University online degree programs: the MS in Information Technology with a specialization in Project Management; and the BS in Information Technology with a specialization in Project Management. It also launched its School of Public Service Leadership. In 2010, Capella, along with three other schools, was awarded the CHEA Award for Outstanding Institutional Practice in Student Learning Outcomes by The Council for Higher Education Accreditation. In August 2018, Capella University's parent company Capella Education merged with Strayer Education Inc. to form Strategic Education, Inc. Academics According to College Navigator, Capella's faculty consists of 207 full-time instructors and 1,321 part-time instructors. Undergraduate applicants who do not have any credits eligible for transfer must successfully complete a university-approved examination to be considered for admission. Capella's enrollment is composed mainly of graduate students including 47 percent MS/MBA students and 23 percent PhD/PsyD doctoral students. The undergraduate population of Capella makes up 27 percent of the student body. Less than one percent are working on certificate programs. The average age of a Capella student is 40. Ninety-five percent of students are enrolled part-time, 74 percent are female, and 54 percent are ethnic minorities. Capella allows a limited number of credits to be earned through a prior learning assessment program, which can provide college credit for past experiences.

OIG focused on the university's policies and procedures concerning the return of Title IV funds as required by Federal Law for students who failed to give official notice that they were withdrawing from the school. The OIG found that Capella made accounting mistakes in how it calculated student eligibility for government- subsidized loans, including failing to return all funds disbursed on behalf of students who dropped out before their first day of class. Capella, in a response to the audit, says it recognizes some past shortcomings in its accounting practices and has made changes to ensure that such errors are not repeated. In 2012, Capella received criticism for its expenditures on marketing, profit, and CEO pay rather than instruction, and its use of aggressive recruiting practices. According to a report issued by former U.S. Senator Tom Harkin for the Senate Education Committee, approximately 79% of the institution's cash flow comes from US government Title IV payments, including Pell grants. The report concluded that Capella's recruiting and student services were better managed than most other for-profit competitors, especially among graduate degree students. The high withdrawal rate among Bachelor's student hopefuls, the over-reliance on part-time instructors, and the high relative marketing budget were cited as potential causes for concern.http://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/for_profit_report/PartII/Capella.pdf In April 2018, Capella students filed a class action suit against the school in Minneapolis. One had begun pursuing a doctor of nursing practice in spring 2014. She said she had been told it would take two years and cost about $35,000. But Capella's website later said the program takes 30 months, and even that figure was subsequently revised to 39 months. One student said she earned top grades paying $53,000 before Capella assigned her a different instructor. That new instructor then said she'd ‚Äúhave to start all over‚Äù on her project. She tried to oppose that decision but finally departed for another school. Another student enrolled in the school in February 2014 in a doctorate of education capstone program advertised to take 36 months. The complaint alleges Capella later claimed the program actually takes 45 months. However fewer than 10 of its students managed to finish within that projected time period. A PhD student in nursing said she earned high grades but made little progress in her dissertation. After paying more than $100,000 in tuition, she dropped out, only 20% of the way toward earning her degree. Minnesota's Office of Higher Education received 71 complaints from Capella students between 2013 and 2016. All other schools combined only generated 146 complaints in the same time period.Class-action lawsuit alleges Capella University lied about time, cost of advanced degrees, Pioneer Press, Josh Verges, April 23, 2018.

A prominent object in the northern winter sky, it is circumpolar to observers north of 44¬∞N. Its name meaning \\"little goat\\" in Latin, Capella depicted the goat Amalthea that suckled Zeus in classical mythology. Capella is relatively close, at from the Sun. It is one of the brightest X-ray sources in the sky, thought to come primarily from the corona of Capella Aa. Although it appears to be a single star to the naked eye, Capella is actually a quadruple star system organized in two binary pairs, made up of the stars Capella Aa, Capella Ab, Capella H, and Capella L. The primary pair, Capella Aa and Capella Ab, are two bright yellow giant stars, both of which are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun. The secondary pair, Capella H and Capella L, are around 10,000 astronomical units (AU)the distance between the Earth and the Sun is one astronomical unit from the first and are two faint, small and relatively cool red dwarfs. Capella Aa and Capella Ab have exhausted their core hydrogen, and cooled and expanded, moving off the main sequence. They are in a very tight circular orbit about 0.74 AU apart, and orbit each other every 104 days. Capella Aa is the cooler and more luminous of the two with spectral class K0III; it is 78.7 ¬± 4.2 times the Sun's luminosity and 11.98 ¬± 0.57 times its radius. An aging red clump star, it is fusing helium to carbon and oxygen in its core. Capella Ab is slightly smaller and hotter and of spectral class G1III; it is 72.7 ¬± 3.6 times as luminous as the Sun and 8.83 ¬± 0.33 times its radius. It is in the Hertzsprung gap, corresponding to a brief subgiant evolutionary phase as it expands and cools to become a red giant. Several other stars in the same visual field have been catalogued as companions but are physically unrelated.  Nomenclature  Capella is the brightest star in the constellation of Auriga (upper left). Œ± Aurigae (Latinised to Alpha Aurigae) is the star system's Bayer designation. It also has the Flamsteed designation 13 Aurigae. It is listed in several multiple star catalogues as ADS 3841, CCDM J05168+4559, and WDS J05167+4600. As a relatively nearby star system, Capella is listed in the Gliese-Jahreiss Catalogue with designations GJ 194 for the bright pair of giants and GJ 195 for the faint pair of red dwarfs. The traditional name Capella is Latin for (small) female goat; the alternative name Capra was more commonly used in classical times. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Capella for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. The catalogue of star names lists Capella as applying to the star Œ± Aurigae Aa.http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/WGSN/IAU-CSN.txt Observational history Capella was the brightest star in the night sky from 210,000 years ago to 160,000 years ago, at about ‚àí1.8 in apparent magnitude. At ‚àí1.1, Aldebaran was brightest before this period; it and Capella were situated rather close to each other in the sky and approximated boreal pole stars at the time. Capella is thought to be mentioned in an Akkadian inscription dating to the 20th century BC. Its goat-associated symbolism dates back to Mesopotamia as a constellation called \\"GAM\\", \\"Gamlum\\" or \\"MUL.GAM\\" in the 7th- century BC document MUL.APIN. GAM represented a scimitar or crook and may have represented the star alone or the constellation of Auriga as a whole. Later, Bedouin astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represented one animal. The stars of Auriga comprised a herd of goats, an association also present in Greek mythology. It is sometimes called the Shepherd's Star in English literature. Capella was seen as a portent of rain in classical times. Building J (foreground) at alt= some ancient stone ruins of buildings in a sandy area Building J of the pre-Columbian site Monte Alb√°n in Oaxaca state in Mexico was built around 275 BC, at a different orientation to other structures in the complex. Its steps are aligned perpendicular to the rising of Capella at that time, so that a person looking out a doorway on the building would have faced it directly. Capella is significant as its heliacal rising took place within a day of the Sun passing directly overhead over Monte Alb√°n. =Multiple status= Professor William Wallace Campbell of the Lick Observatory announced that Capella was binary in 1899, based on spectroscopic observations‚Äîhe noted on photographic plates taken from August 1896 to February 1897 that a second spectrum appeared superimposed over the first, and that there was a doppler shift to violet in September and October and to red in November and February‚Äîshowing that the components were moving toward and away from the Earth (and hence orbiting each other). Almost simultaneously, British astronomer Hugh Newall had observed its composite spectrum with a four prism spectroscope attached to a telescope at Cambridge in July 1899, concluding that it was a binary star system. Many observers tried to discern the component stars without success. Known as \\"The Interferometrist's Friend\\", it was first resolved interferometrically in 1919 by John Anderson and Francis Pease at Mount Wilson Observatory, who published an orbit in 1920 based on their observations. This was the first interferometric measurement of any object outside the Solar System. A high- precision orbit was published in 1994 based on observations by the Mark III Stellar Interferometer, again at Mount Wilson Observatory. See ¬ß1 for spectral types, Table 1 for orbit, Table 5 for stellar parameters, and ¬ß6.3 for the age of the system. Capella also became the first astronomical object to be imaged by a separate element optical interferometer when it was imaged by the Cambridge Optical Aperture Synthesis Telescope in September 1995.. In 1914, Finnish astronomer Ragnar Furuhjelm observed that the spectroscopic binary had a faint companion star, which, as its proper motion was similar to that of the spectroscopic binary, was probably physically bound to it. In February 1936, Carl L. Stearns observed that this companion appeared to be double itself;. this was confirmed in September that year by Gerard Kuiper. This pair are designated Capella H and L. =X-ray source= Two Aerobee-Hi rocket flights on September 20, 1962, and March 15, 1963, detected and confirmed an X-ray source in Auriga at RA Dec , identified as Capella. Stellar X-ray astronomy started on April 5, 1974, with the detection of X-rays from Capella. A rocket flight on that date briefly calibrated its attitude control system when a star sensor pointed the payload axis at Capella. During this period, X-rays in the range 0.2‚Äì1.6 keV were detected by an X-ray reflector system co-aligned with the star sensor. The X-ray luminosity (Lx) of ~1024 W (1031 erg s‚àí1) is four orders of magnitude above the Sun's X-ray luminosity. Capella's X-rays are thought to be primarily from the corona of the most massive star. Capella is ROSAT X-ray source 1RXS J051642.2+460001. The high temperature of Capella's corona as obtained from the first coronal X-ray spectrum of Capella using HEAO 1 would require magnetic confinement, unless it is a free-flowing coronal wind. Observation alt=photograph of night sky above a dimply-lit horizon With an average apparent magnitude of +0.08, Capella is the brightest object in the constellation Auriga, the sixth-brightest star in the night sky, the third-brightest in the northern celestial hemisphere (after Arcturus and Vega), and the fourth-brightest visible to the naked eye from the latitude 40¬∞N. It appears to be a rich yellowish-white colour, although the yellow colour is more apparent during daylight observation with a telescope, due to the contrast against the blue sky. Capella is closer to the north celestial pole than any other first magnitude star.Polaris is only second magnitude. Its northern declination is such that it is actually invisible south of latitude 44¬∞S‚Äîthis includes southernmost New Zealand, Argentina and Chile as well as the Falkland Islands. Conversely it is circumpolar north of 44¬∞N: for the whole of the United Kingdom, Canada and the northernmost United States, the star never sets. Capella and Vega are on opposite sides of the pole, at about the same distance from it, such that an imaginary line between the two stars will nearly pass through Polaris. Visible halfway between Orion's Belt and Polaris, Capella is at its highest in the night sky at midnight in early December and is regarded as a prominent star of the northern winter sky. A few degrees to the southwest of Capella lie three stars, Epsilon Aurigae, Zeta Aurigae, and Eta Aurigae, the latter two of which are known as \\"The Kids\\", or Haedi. The four form a familiar pattern, or asterism, in the sky. Distance Based on an annual parallax shift of 76.20 milliarcseconds (with a margin of error of 0.46 milliarcseconds) as measured by the Hipparcos satellite, this system is estimated to be from Earth, with a margin of error of . An alternative method to determine the distance is via the orbital parallax, which gives a distance of with a margin of error of only 0.1%. Capella is estimated to have been a little closer to the Solar System in the past, passing within 29 light-years distant around 237,000 years ago. At this range, it would have shone at apparent magnitude ‚àí0.82, comparable to Canopus today. ‚Äì based on computations from Hipparcos data. (The calculations exclude stars whose distance or proper motion is uncertain.) In a 1960 paper, American astronomer Olin J. Eggen concluded that Capella was a member of the Hyades moving group, a group of stars moving in the same direction as the Hyades cluster, after analysing its proper motion and parallax. Members of the group are of a similar age, and those that are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun have moved off the main sequence after exhausting their core hydrogen reserves and are expanding and cooling into red giants. Stellar system alt= two large pale yellow circles and three small circles on black background. They denote the two giants, and Sun and two dwarfs of the Capella system. There are several stars within a few arc minutes of Capella and some have been listed as companions in various multiple star catalogues. The Washington Double Star Catalog lists components A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, O, P, Q, and R, with A being the naked-eye star. Most are only line-of- sight companions, but the close pair of red dwarfs H and L are at the same distance as the bright component A and moving through space along with it. Capella A is itself a spectroscopic binary with components Aa and Ab, both giant stars. The pair of giants is separated from the pair of red dwarfs by 723\\". American astronomer Robert Burnham Jr. described a scale model of the system where Capella A was represented by spheres 13 and 7 inches across, separated by ten feet. The red dwarfs were then each 0.7 inches across and they were separated by 420 feet. At this scale, the two pairs are 21 miles apart. =Capella A= Hertzsprung-Russell diagram showing an evolutionary track for a star of approximately the mass of the two Capella giants. The current states of Capella Aa and Ab are marked. Capella A consists of two yellow evolved stars that have been calculated to orbit each other every 104.02128 ¬± 0.00016 days, with a semimajor axis of 111.11 ¬± 0.10 million km (0.74272 ¬± 0.00069 au), roughly the distance between Venus and the Sun. The pair is not an eclipsing binary‚Äîthat is, as seen from Earth, neither star passes in front of the other. The orbit is known extremely accurately and can be used to derive an orbital parallax with far better precision than the one measured directly. The stars are not near enough to each other for the Roche lobe of either star to have been filled and any significant mass transfer to have taken place, even during the red giant stage of the primary star. Modern convention designates the more luminous cooler star as component Aa and its spectral type has been usually measured between G2 and K0. The hotter secondary Ab has been given various spectral types of late (cooler) F or early (warmer) G. The MK spectral types of the two stars have been measured a number of times, and they are both consistently assigned a luminosity class of III indicating a giant star. The composite spectrum appears to be dominated by the primary star due to its sharper absorption lines; the lines from the secondary are broadened and blurred by its rapid rotation. The composite spectral class is given as approximately G3III, but with a specific mention of features due to a cooler component. The most recent specific published types are K0III and G1III, although older values are still widely quoted such as G5IIIe + G0III from the Bright Star Catalogue or G8III + G0III by Eggen. Where the context is clear, these two components have been referred to as A and B. The individual apparent magnitudes of the two component stars cannot be directly measured, but their relative brightness has been measured at various wavelengths. They have very nearly equal brightness in the visible light spectrum, with the hotter secondary component generally being found to be a few tenths of a magnitude brighter. A 2016 measurement gives the magnitude difference between the two stars at a wavelength of 700 nm as 0.00 ¬± 0.1. The physical properties of the two stars can be determined with high accuracy. The masses are derived directly from the orbital solution, with Aa being and Ab being . Their angular radii have been directly measured; in combination with the very accurate distance, this gives and for Aa and Ab respectively. Their surface temperatures can be calculated by comparison of observed and synthetic spectra, direct measurement of their angular diameters and brightnesses, calibration against their observed colour indices, and disentangling of high resolution spectra. Weighted averages of these four methods give 4,970 ¬± 50 K for Aa and 5,730 ¬± 60 for Ab. Their bolometric luminosities are most accurately derived from their apparent magnitudes and bolometric corrections, but are confirmed by calculation from the temperatures and radii of the stars. Aa is 78.7 ¬± 4.2 times as luminous as the Sun and Ab 72.7 ¬± 3.6 times as luminous, so the star defined as the primary component is the more luminous when all wavelengths are considered but very slightly less bright at visual wavelengths. Estimated to be 590 to 650 million years old, the stars were probably at the hot end of spectral class A during their main sequence lifetime, similar to Vega. They have now exhausted their core hydrogen and evolved off the main sequence, their outer layers expanding and cooling. Despite the giant luminosity class, the secondary component is very clearly within the Hertzsprung gap on the Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram, still expanding and cooling towards the red giant branch, making it a subgiant in evolutionary terms. The more massive primary has already passed through this stage, when it reached a maximum radius of 36 to 38 times that of the Sun. It is now a red clump star which is fusing helium to carbon and oxygen in its core, a process that has not yet begun for the less massive star. Detailed analysis shows that it is nearing the end of this stage and starting to expand again which will lead it to the asymptotic giant branch. Isotope abundancesThe lithium abundance, C12/C13 ratio and C/N ratio have all declined in Capella Aa but not in Capella Ab. and spin rates confirm this evolutionary difference between the two stars. Heavy element abundances are broadly comparable to those of the Sun and the overall metallicity is slightly less than the Sun's. The rotational period of each star can be measured by observing periodic variations in the doppler shifts of their spectral lines. The absolute rotational velocities of the two stars are known from their inclinations, rotation periods, and sizes, but the projected equatorial rotational velocities measured using doppler broadening of spectral lines are a standard measure and these are generally quoted. Capella Aa has a projected rotational velocity of 4.1 ¬± 0.4 km per second, taking 104 ¬± 3 days to complete one rotation, while Capella Ab spins much more rapidly at 35.0¬±0.5 km per second, completing a full rotation in only 8.5 ¬± 0.2 days. Rotational braking occurs in all stars when they expand into giants, and binary stars are also tidally braked. Capella Aa has slowed until it is rotationally locked to the orbital period, although theory predicts that it should still be rotating more quickly from a starting point of a rapidly-spinning main sequence A star. Capella has long been suspected to be slightly variable. Its amplitude of about 0.1 magnitudes means that it may at times be brighter or fainter than Rigel, Betelgeuse, and Vega, which are also variable. The system has been classified as an RS Canum Venaticorum variable, a class of binary stars with active chromospheres that cause huge starspots, but it is still only listed as a suspected variable in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars. Unusually for RS CVn systems, the hotter star, Capella Ab, has the more active atmosphere because it is located in the Hertzsprung gap‚Äîa stage where it is changing its angular momentum and deepening its convection zone. The active atmospheres and closeness of these stars means that they are among the brightest X-ray sources in the sky. However the X-ray emission is due to stable coronal structures and not eruptive flaring activity. Coronal loops larger than the Sun and with temperatures of several million K are likely to be responsible for the majority of the X-rays. =Capella HL= The seventh companion published for Capella, component H, is physically associated with the bright primary star. It is a red dwarf separated from the pair of G-type giants by a distance of around 10,000 AU. It has its own close companion, an even fainter red dwarf that was 1.8\\" away when it was discovered in 1935. Eighty years later the separation had increased to 3.5\\", sufficient to allow tentative orbital parameters to be derived. It is component L in double star catalogues. The Gliese-Jahreiss Catalogue of nearby stars designates the binary system as GJ 195. The two components are then referred to individually as GJ 195 A and B. The two stars are reported to have a 3.5 visual magnitude difference, 2.3 mag in the passband of the Gaia spacecraft, although the difference is much smaller at infrared wavelengths. This is unexpected and may indicate further unseen companions. The mass of the stars can be determined from the orbital motion, but uncertainties in the orbit have led to widely varying results. In 1975, an eccentric 388 year orbit gave masses of and . A smaller near-circular orbit published in 2015 had a 300-year orbit, benefitting from mass constraints of and respectively for GJ 195 A and B based on their infrared magnitudes. =Visual companions= Six visual companions to Capella were discovered before Capella H and are generally known only as Capella B through G. None are thought to be physically associated with Capella although all appear closer in the sky than the HL pair. Component F is also known as TYC 3358-3142-1. It is listed with a spectral type of K although it is included in a catalogue of OB stars as a distant luminous star. Component G is BD+45 1076, with a spectral type of F0, at a distance of . It is identified as a variable member of the Guide Star Catalogue from Chandra observations although it is not known what type of variability. It is known to be an X-ray source with an active corona. Several other stars have also been catalogued as companions to Capella. Components I, Q, and R are 13th magnitude stars at distances of 92\\", 133\\", and 134\\". V538 Aurigae and its close companion HD 233153 are red dwarfs ten degrees away from Capella; they have very similar space motions but the small difference makes it possible that this is just a coincidence. Two faint stars have been discovered by speckle imaging in the Capella HL field, around 10\\" distant from that pair. These have been catalogued as Capella O and P. It is not known whether they are physically associated with the red dwarf binary. Etymology and culture Capella traditionally marks the left shoulder of the constellation's eponymous charioteer, or, according to the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy's Almagest, the goat that the charioteer is carrying. In Bayer's 1603 work Uranometria, Capella marks the charioteer's back. The three Haedi had been identified as a separate constellation by Pliny the Elder and Manilius, and were called Capra, Caper, or Hircus, all of which relate to its status as the \\"goat star\\". Ptolemy merged the Charioteer and the Goats in the 2nd century Almagest. In Greek mythology, the star represented the goat Amalthea that suckled Zeus. It was this goat whose horn, after accidentally being broken off by Zeus, was transformed into the Cornucopia, or \\"horn of plenty\\", which would be filled with whatever its owner desired. Though most often associated with Amalthea, Capella has sometimes been associated with Amalthea's owner, a nymph. The myth of the nymph says that the goat's hideous appearance, resembling a Gorgon, was partially responsible for the Titans' defeat, after Zeus skinned the goat and wore it as his aegis. In medieval accounts, it bore the uncommon name Alhajoth (also spelled Alhaior, Althaiot, Alhaiset, Alhatod, Alhojet, Alanac, Alanat, Alioc), which (especially the last) may be a corruption of its Arabic name, , al-cayy≈´q. cAyy≈´q has no clear significance in Arabic,Edward William Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon: but may be an Arabized form of the Greek Œ±ŒØŒæ aiks \\"goat\\"; cf. the modern Greek ŒëŒØŒ≥Œ± Aiga, the feminine of goat. To the Bedouin of the Negev and Sinai, Capella al-'Ayy≈´q ath-ThurayyƒÅ \\"Capella of the Pleiades\\", from its role as pointing out the position of that asterism. Another name in Arabic was Al-RƒÅkib \\"the driver\\", a translation of the Greek. To the ancient Balts, Capella was known as Perk≈´no O≈æka \\"Thunder's Goat\\", or Tikutis. Conversely in Slavic Macedonian folklore, Capella was Jastreb \\"the hawk\\", flying high above and ready to pounce on Mother Hen (the Pleiades) and the Rooster (Nath). Astrologically, Capella portends civic and military honors and wealth. In the Middle Ages, it was considered a Behenian fixed star, with the stone sapphire and the plants horehound, mint, mugwort, and mandrake as attributes. Cornelius Agrippa listed its kabbalistic sign File:Agrippa1531 Hircus.png with the name Hircus (Latin for goat). In Hindu mythology, Capella was seen as the heart of Brahma, Brahma H·πõdaya. In traditional Chinese astronomy, Capella was part of the asterism (; English: Five Chariots), which consisted of Capella together with Beta Aurigae, Theta Aurigae, and Iota Aurigae, as well as Beta Tauri. Since it was the second star in this asterism, it has the Chinese name (; English: Second of the Five Chariots). In Quechua it was known as Col√ßa; the Incas held the star in high regard. The Hawaiians saw Capella as part of an asterism Ke ka o Makali'i (\\"The canoe bailer of Makali'i\\") that helped them navigate at sea. Called Hoku-lei \\"star wreath\\", it formed this asterism with Procyon, Sirius, Castor and Pollux. In Tahitian folklore, Capella was Tahi-ari'i, the wife of Fa'a-nui (Auriga) and mother of prince Ta'urua (Venus) who sails his canoe across the sky. In Inuit astronomy, Capella, along with Menkalinan (Beta Aurigae), Pollux (Beta Geminorum) and Castor (Alpha Geminorum), formed a constellation Quturjuuk, \\"collar-bones\\", the two pairs of stars denoting a bone each. Used for navigation and time-keeping at night, the constellation was recognised from Alaska to western Greenland. The Gwich'in saw Capella and Menkalinan has forming shreets'ƒÖ ƒØƒØ vidzee, the right ear of the large circumpolar constellation Yahdii, which covered much of the night sky, and whose orientation facilitated navigation and timekeeping. In Australian Aboriginal mythology for the Boorong people of Victoria, Capella was Purra, the kangaroo, pursued and killed by the nearby Gemini twins, Yurree (Castor) and Wanjel (Pollux). The Wardaman people of northern Australia knew the star as Yagalal, a ceremonial fish scale, related to Guwamba the barramundi (Aldebaran).

","title":"1953 in rail transport"},{"id":"1264088","text":"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are the stem cells that give rise to other blood cells. This process is called haematopoiesis. This process occurs in the red bone marrow, in the core of most bones. In embryonic development, the red bone marrow is derived from the layer of the embryo called the mesoderm. Haematopoiesis is the process by which all mature blood cells are produced. It must balance enormous production needs (the average person produces more than 500 billion blood cells every day) with the need to regulate the number of each blood cell type in the circulation. In vertebrates, the vast majority of hematopoiesis occurs in the bone marrow and is derived from a limited number of hematopoietic stem cells that are multipotent and capable of extensive self-renewal. Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to different types of blood cells, in lines called myeloid and lymphoid. Myeloid and lymphoid lineages both are involved in dendritic cell formation. Myeloid cells include monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, erythrocytes, and megakaryocytes to platelets. Lymphoid cells include T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and innate lymphoid cells. The definition of hematopoietic stem cell has evolved since they were first discovered in 1961. The hematopoietic tissue contains cells with long-term and short-term regeneration capacities and committed multipotent, oligopotent, and unipotent progenitors. Hematopoietic stem cells constitute 1:10,000 of cells in myeloid tissue. HSC transplants are used in the treatment of cancers and other immune system disorders.\\"5. Hematopoietic Stem Cells.\\" Stem Cell Information. National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 17 Jun 2011. http://stemcells.nih.gov/info/scireport/pages/chapter5.aspx  Structure  They are round, non-adherent, with a rounded nucleus and low cytoplasm-to-nucleus ratio. In shape, hematopoietic stem cells resemble lymphocytes. =Location= Hematopoietic stem cells are found in the bone marrow of adults, especially in the pelvis, femur, and sternum. They are also found in umbilical cord blood and, in small numbers, in peripheral blood. Stem and progenitor cells can be taken from the pelvis, at the iliac crest, using a needle and syringe. The cells can be removed as liquid (to perform a smear to look at the cell morphology) or they can be removed via a core biopsy (to maintain the architecture or relationship of the cells to each other and to the bone). =Subtypes= A colony-forming unit is a subtype of HSC. (This sense of the term is different from colony-forming units of microbes, which is a cell counting unit.) There are various kinds of HSC colony-forming units: * Colony-forming unit‚Äìgranulocyte-erythrocyte-monocyte-megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM) * Colony-forming unit‚Äìlymphocyte (CFU-L) * Colony-forming unit‚Äìerythrocyte (CFU-E) * Colony-forming unit‚Äìgranulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) * Colony-forming unit‚Äìmegakaryocyte (CFU-Meg) * Colony-forming unit‚Äìbasophil (CFU-B) * Colony- forming unit‚Äìeosinophil (CFU-Eos) The above CFUs are based on the lineage. Another CFU, the colony-forming unit‚Äìspleen (CFU-S), was the basis of an in vivo clonal colony formation, which depends on the ability of infused bone marrow cells to give rise to clones of maturing hematopoietic cells in the spleens of irradiated mice after 8 to 12 days. It was used extensively in early studies, but is now considered to measure more mature progenitor or transit-amplifying cells rather than stem cells. =Isolating stem cells= Since hematopoietic stem cells cannot be isolated as a pure population, it is not possible to identify them in a microscope. Hematopoietic stem cells can be identified or isolated by the use of flow cytometry where the combination of several different cell surface markers (particularly CD34) are used to separate the rare Hematopoietic stem cells from the surrounding blood cells. Hematopoietic stem cells lack expression of mature blood cell markers and are thus called Lin-. Lack of expression of lineage markers is used in combination with detection of several positive cell-surface markers to isolate hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, hematopoietic stem cells are characterised by their small size and low staining with vital dyes such as rhodamine 123 (rhodamine lo) or Hoechst 33342 (side population).  Function  Diagram of cells that arise from Hematopoetic stem cells during the process of hematopoiesis. = Haematopoiesis = Hematopoietic stem cells are essential to haematopoiesis, the formation of the cells within blood. Hematopoietic stem cells can replenish all blood cell types (i.e., are multipotent) and self-renew. A small number of Hematopoietic stem cells can expand to generate a very large number of daughter Hematopoietic stem cells. This phenomenon is used in bone marrow transplantation, when a small number of Hematopoietic stem cells reconstitute the hematopoietic system. This process indicates that, subsequent to bone marrow transplantation, symmetrical cell divisions into two daughter Hematopoietic stem cells must occur. Stem cell self-renewal is thought to occur in the stem cell niche in the bone marrow, and it is reasonable to assume that key signals present in this niche will be important in self-renewal. There is much interest in the environmental and molecular requirements for HSC self-renewal, as understanding the ability of HSC to replenish themselves will eventually allow the generation of expanded populations of HSC in vitro that can be used therapeutically. = Quiescence = Hematopoietic stem cells, like all adult stem cells, mostly exist in a state of quiescence, or reversible growth arrest. The altered metabolism of quiescent HCSs helps the cells survive for extended periods of time in the hypoxic bone marrow environment. When provoked by cell death or damage, Hematopoietic stem cells exit quiescence and begin actively dividing again. The transition from dormancy to propagation and back is regulated by the MEK/ERK pathway and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Dysregulation of these transitions can lead to stem cell exhaustion, or the gradual loss of active Hematopoietic stem cells in the blood system. =Mobility= Hematopoietic stem cells have a higher potential than other immature blood cells to pass the bone marrow barrier, and, thus, may travel in the blood from the bone marrow in one bone to another bone. If they settle in the thymus, they may develop into T cells. In the case of fetuses and other extramedullary hematopoiesis, Hematopoietic stem cells may also settle in the liver or spleen and develop. This enables Hematopoietic stem cells to be harvested directly from the blood. =DNA damage with aging= DNA strand breaks accumulate in long term hematopoietic stem cells during aging. This accumulation is associated with a broad attenuation of DNA repair and response pathways that depends on HSC quiescence. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a pathway that repairs double-strand breaks in DNA. NHEJ is referred to as \\"non-homologous\\" because the break ends are directly ligated without the need for a homologous template. The NHEJ pathway depends on several proteins including ligase 4, DNA polymerase mu and NHEJ factor 1 (NHEJ1, also known as Cernunnos or XLF). DNA ligase 4 (Lig4) has a highly specific role in the repair of double-strand breaks by NHEJ. Lig4 deficiency in the mouse causes a progressive loss of Hematopoietic stem cells during aging. Deficiency of lig4 in pluripotent stem cells results in accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks and enhanced apoptosis. In polymerase mu mutant mice, hematopoietic cell development is defective in several peripheral and bone marrow cell populations with about a 40% decrease in bone marrow cell number that includes several hematopoietic lineages. Expansion potential of hematopoietic progenitor cells is also reduced. These characteristics correlate with reduced ability to repair double-strand breaks in hematopoietic tissue. Deficiency of NHEJ factor 1 in mice leads to premature aging of hematopoietic stem cells as indicated by several lines of evidence including evidence that long-term repopulation is defective and worsens over time. Using a human induced pluripotent stem cell model of NHEJ1 deficiency, it was shown that NHEJ1 has an important role in promoting survival of the primitive hematopoietic progenitors. These NHEJ1 deficient cells possess a weak NHEJ1-mediated repair capacity that is apparently incapable of coping with DNA damages induced by physiological stress, normal metabolism, and ionizing radiation. The sensitivity of haematopoietic stem cells to Lig4, DNA polymerase mu and NHEJ1 deficiency suggests that NHEJ is a key determinant of the ability of stem cells to maintain themselves against physiological stress over time. Rossi et al. found that endogenous DNA damage accumulates with age even in wild type Hematopoietic stem cells, and suggested that DNA damage accrual may be an important physiological mechanism of stem cell aging. Clinical significance =Transplant= Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the transplantation of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells, usually derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood. It may be autologous (the patient's own stem cells are used), allogeneic (the stem cells come from a donor) or syngeneic (from an identical twin). It is most often performed for patients with certain cancers of the blood or bone marrow, such as multiple myeloma or leukemia. In these cases, the recipient's immune system is usually destroyed with radiation or chemotherapy before the transplantation. Infection and graft-versus-host disease are major complications of allogeneic HSCT. In order to harvest stem cells from the circulating peripheral blood, blood donors are injected with a cytokine, such as granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), that induces cells to leave the bone marrow and circulate in the blood vessels. In mammalian embryology, the first definitive Hematopoietic stem cells are detected in the AGM (aorta- gonad-mesonephros), and then massively expanded in the fetal liver prior to colonising the bone marrow before birth. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains a dangerous procedure with many possible complications; it is reserved for patients with life-threatening diseases. As survival following the procedure has increased, its use has expanded beyond cancer to autoimmune diseases and hereditary skeletal dysplasias; notably malignant infantile osteopetrosis and mucopolysaccharidosis. Research =Behavior in culture= A cobblestone area-forming cell (CAFC) assay is a cell culture-based empirical assay. When plated onto a confluent culture of stromal feeder layer, a fraction of Hematopoietic stem cells creep between the gaps (even though the stromal cells are touching each other) and eventually settle between the stromal cells and the substratum (here the dish surface) or trapped in the cellular processes between the stromal cells. Emperipolesis is the in vivo phenomenon in which one cell is completely engulfed into another (e.g. thymocytes into thymic nurse cells); on the other hand, when in vitro, lymphoid lineage cells creep beneath nurse-like cells, the process is called pseudoemperipolesis. This similar phenomenon is more commonly known in the HSC field by the cell culture terminology cobble stone area-forming cells (CAFC), which means areas or clusters of cells look dull cobblestone-like under phase contrast microscopy, compared to the other Hematopoietic stem cells, which are refractile. This happens because the cells that are floating loosely on top of the stromal cells are spherical and thus refractile. However, the cells that creep beneath the stromal cells are flattened and, thus, not refractile. The mechanism of pseudoemperipolesis is only recently coming to light. It may be mediated by interaction through CXCR4 (CD184) the receptor for CXC Chemokines (e.g., SDF1) and Œ±4Œ≤1 integrins. = Repopulation kinetics = Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) cannot be easily observed directly, and, therefore, their behaviors need to be inferred indirectly. Clonal studies are likely the closest technique for single cell in vivo studies of HSC. Here, sophisticated experimental and statistical methods are used to ascertain that, with a high probability, a single HSC is contained in a transplant administered to a lethally irradiated host. The clonal expansion of this stem cell can then be observed over time by monitoring the percent donor-type cells in blood as the host is reconstituted. The resulting time series is defined as the repopulation kinetic of the HSC. The reconstitution kinetics are very heterogeneous. However, using symbolic dynamics, one can show that they fall into a limited number of classes. To prove this, several hundred experimental repopulation kinetics from clonal Thy-1lo SCA-1+ lin‚àí c-kit+ HSC were translated into symbolic sequences by assigning the symbols \\"+\\", \\"-\\", \\"~\\" whenever two successive measurements of the percent donor-type cells have a positive, negative, or unchanged slope, respectively. By using the Hamming distance, the repopulation patterns were subjected to cluster analysis yielding 16 distinct groups of kinetics. To finish the empirical proof, the Laplace add-one approach was used to determine that the probability of finding kinetics not contained in these 16 groups is very small. By corollary, this result shows that the hematopoietic stem cell compartment is also heterogeneous by dynamical criteria. It was originally believed that all Hematopoietic stem cells were alike in their self-renewal and differentiation abilities. This view was first challenged by the 2002 discovery by the Muller- Sieburg group in San Diego, who illustrated that different stem cells can show distinct repopulation patterns that are epigenetically predetermined intrinsic properties of clonal Thy-1lo Sca-1+ lin‚àí c-kit+ HSC. The results of these clonal studies led to the notion of lineage bias. Using the ratio \\\\rho = L/M of lymphoid (L) to myeloid (M) cells in blood as a quantitative marker, the stem cell compartment can be split into three categories of HSC. Balanced (Bala) Hematopoietic stem cells repopulate peripheral white blood cells in the same ratio of myeloid to lymphoid cells as seen in unmanipulated mice (on average about 15% myeloid and 85% lymphoid cells, or 3 ‚â§ œÅ ‚â§ 10). Myeloid- biased (My-bi) Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to very few lymphocytes resulting in ratios 0 < œÅ < 3, while lymphoid-biased (Ly-bi) Hematopoietic stem cells generate very few myeloid cells, which results in lymphoid-to- myeloid ratios of œÅ > 10. All three types are normal types of HSC, and they do not represent stages of differentiation. Rather, these are three classes of HSC, each with an epigenetically fixed differentiation program. These studies also showed that lineage bias is not stochastically regulated or dependent on differences in environmental influence. My-bi HSC self-renew longer than balanced or Ly-bi HSC. The myeloid bias results from reduced responsiveness to the lymphopoetin interleukin 7 (IL-7). Subsequently, other groups confirmed and highlighted the original findings. For example, the Eaves group confirmed in 2007 that repopulation kinetics, long-term self-renewal capacity, and My-bi and Ly-bi are stably inherited intrinsic HSC properties. In 2010, the Goodell group provided additional insights about the molecular basis of lineage bias in side population (SP) SCA-1+ lin‚àí c-kit+ HSC. As previously shown for IL-7 signaling, it was found that a member of the transforming growth factor family (TGF-beta) induces and inhibits the proliferation of My-bi and Ly-bi HSC, respectively.

He was awarded the 1990 Cam√µes Prize and the 1992 Neustadt International Prize for Literature, the only Brazilian poet to receive such award to date. He was considered until his death a perennial competitor for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Melo Neto's works are noted for the rigorous, yet inventive attention they pay to the formal aspects of poetry. He derives his characteristic sound from a traditional verse of five or seven syllables (called ‚Äò‚Äôredondilha‚Äô‚Äô) and from the constant use of oblique rhymes. His style ranges from the surrealist tendency which marked his early poetry to the use of regional elements of his native northeastern Brazil. In the auto Morte e Vida Severina, his only work which has come to be widely read by the general public, Melo Neto's addresses the culture and the unforgiving life in arid Pernambuco.  Life and career  Melo Neto was born in Recife, Pernambuco, and spent most of his youth in his family's sugar-cane mills in the interior of the state. He was a cousin of distinguished poet Manuel Bandeira and sociologist Gilberto Freyre. In 1940, his family moved to Rio de Janeiro. Two years later, Melo Neto published his first book of poems, Pedra do Sono, from his own expense, with a circulation of 340 copies. In 1945, he applied to the post of diplomat, a position he would hold for most of his life. The following year, he married Stella Maria Barbosa de Oliveira, with whom he had five children. After passing through several different countries, he became consul of Brazil in Porto in 1984, only returning to Rio de Janeiro three years later. He worked for many years in Spain, and his experiences in Seville would leave palpable influences in his poetry. In 1956, Melo Neto published his most famous work, Morte e Vida Severina, and, in 1968, he was elected to the 37th chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters. In 1986, he married Marly de Oliveira and, two years later, he retired, resigning from his office as ambassador. Melo Neto died in 1999, in Rio de Janeiro. In a career spanning more than fifty years, Melo Neto published 18 books of poetry and two plays. Poetry The image of an engineer designing a building, an epithet Melo Neto himself adopted, is often used to describe his poetry. From the start, his poetry was extraordinarily rich in imagery. Commenting Pedra do Sono, his first book, Antonio Candido, who noted his debt to cubism and surrealism, observed how his poems were composed from the accumulation of concrete and sensory images, using words in an almost pictorial manner.Candido, Antonio. Poesia ao norte. ‚Äò‚ÄôRemate De Males‚Äô‚Äô, 2012, accessed 21 October 2019. Originally published in 1943 Quickly, however, he proved highly attentive to the social reality of his state. In O c√£o sem plumas (‚ÄúA Dog without Feathers‚Äù)‚Äô, his first long poem, dated from 1950, he portrayed the lives of the destitute classes, who depended on the Capibaribe River, and described the toiling of the sugar-cane mill. Three years later, in O Rio (‚ÄúThe River‚Äù) he assumed the voice of the river, narrating in first-person its course and the villages and landscapes it crossed.

It is a long funicular railway in Aberystwyth and is the second longest funicular railway in the British Isles, after the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway. Since November 1987, the Aberystwyth Cliff Railway has been a Grade II listed structure. The Cliff Railway was developed as an element of Constitution Hill, a Victorian business venture by the Aberystwyth Improvement Company in the 1890s. The funicular took visitors to the top of the hill, where attractions such as a camera obscura were established. The cliff railway was originally a water balance system, but it was electrified during 1921. Passengers numbers were high during its initial decades, but dropped after the outbreak of the Second World War and stayed depressed for decades. The cliff railway is now owned and run by Constitution Hill Ltd, a registered charity. It is open to passengers during the summer months, typically operating between April and October, with a reduced timetable during the rest of the year. Location The Aberystwyth Cliff Railway was part of the Constitution Hill development built by the Aberystwyth Improvement Company, established in 1895. It was an early theme park, consisting of arcades and restaurant at the foot of the hill, and a camera obscura and park at the top. The funicular railway was developed to transport people between the areas.\\"Aberystwyth Cliff Railway.\\" stallionvalley.com, Retrieved: 22 June 2018. Constitution Hill was designed and engineered by George Croydon Marks who also designed the pavilion for the Aberystwyth Royal Pier, and a meandering footpath as an alternative to the Cliff Railway. Around 12,000 tonnes of rock was excavated for the middle section of the footpath to accommodate a footbridge over the cliff railway. The area is surrounded by the gardens and pleasure grounds of Constitution Hill. Design An empty car descending the cliff railway The cliff railway was originally a cable-drawn balanced system moving a pair of cars, with a maximum capacity of 30 passengers, permanently connected via a continuous cable. When opened, it operated using a water balance system, which used a Worthington Corporation compound steam engine water pump housed in the lower station to move water to the upper station. Each passenger car had a tank in their chassis that could hold 4 tonnes of water. Water was added to the tank of the top car, which descended under gravity, hauling the lighter lower car on the parallel track to the top station. The railway is straight, ascending about over a horizontal distance of , a maximum gradient of more than 1:2 (50 per cent). The gauge is , slightly narrower than standard gauge, and laid on timber sleepers. In 1921, the railway was electrified using a 41 kW Morley DC motor. In 1934, after changes to the town‚Äôs electricity supply, a mercury arc rectifier and transformer were installed in the lower station to provide a 440V DC power output. The cars are moved using a high-tensile steel cable attached to both vehicles. It passes around a drum, mounted on a vertical axis between the tracks at the top. The motor drives the drum controlled by an automated cut-off which stops the motor and the cars when required. Its twin carriages are named Lord Geraint and Lord Marks. Operations Lower station of the Aberystwyth Cliff Railway A car near the upper station of the railway, circa 1985 The cliff railway opened to the public in 1896; and was credited with stimulating the development of Constitution Hill as a popular leisure area.\\"Aberystwyth Cliff Railway.\\" historypoints.org, Retrieved: 22 June 2018. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the cliff railway was popular with visitors but during and after the Second World War, passenger numbers declined significantly. In 1948, seeking to revive its fortunes, the Aberystwyth Pier Company bought it and carried out repairs and upgrades. The new owners were unable to increase passenger numbers. In 1976, the railway was closed briefly on account of a fault in its braking system. During the late 1970s, a local mining company acquired a majority stake and formed the Aberystwyth Cliff Railway Company to operate it. In 1978 a new electrical system was installed which is used to the present day. It takes its power from and returns surplus energy to the National Grid. In November 1987, the cliff railway was recognised as a Grade II listed structure. In 1998, it was purchased by Constitution Hill Ltd, a registered charity, the trustees are volunteers; all profits generated support the railway's maintenance and restoration activities. The cliff railway has received some external funding, including grants from European Union funds. The railway is operated under a light railway order. The line is open to passengers during the summer months, typically operating between April and October, while transitioning to a limited timetable during the colder months.\\"Aberystwyth Cliff Railway.\\" visitmidwales.co.uk, Retrieved: 22 June 2018.

It was a lanky, fast- running animal, possibly an omnivore. From what fossils are known, it probably closely resembled other ornithomimids, except for its more powerful forelimbs. Discovery Anserimimus was found in the Mongolian aimag, or province, of Bayankhongor during a joint Soviet-Mongolian expedition to the Gobi Desert, in the late 1970s. Mongolian paleontologist Rinchen Barsbold named Anserimimus in 1988, combining the Latin anser meaning 'goose' with the Greek mimos meaning 'mimic'. Anser is the generic name of several species of geese. Although Anserimimus does not specifically resemble a goose, ornithomimosaurs have traditionally been named after different types of birds, such as Struthiomimus ('ostrich mimic'), Gallimimus ('rooster mimic'), and Pelecanimimus ('pelican mimic'). The one named species of Anserimimus is called Anserimimus planinychus. The specific name is derived from the Latin planus meaning 'flat', and the Ancient Greek ·ΩÑŒΩœÖŒæ, onyx, meaning 'claw', in reference to the peculiar flattened claws which characterize the genus.Rinchen Barsbold, 1988, \\"A new Late Cretaceous ornithomimid from the Mongolian People's Republic\\", Paleontological Journal 22: 124-127 Hand of ZPAL MgD‚àíI/65 There is only a single specimen of Anserimimus, its holotype IGM 100/300. It consists of a rather complete and articulated skeleton lacking the skull and lower jaws. Limited information has been published on the anatomy of Anserimimus, as Barsbold did not describe most of these bones, instead focusing on only those with features that set Anserimimus apart from other ornithomimids. In an unpublished thesis Robert Bronowicz in 2005 gave a detailed description of the species, also referring additional material to it, among which a second partial skeleton, specimen ZPAL MgD-I/65.Bronowicz, R., 2005, Upper Cretaceous dinosaur Anserimimus planinychus (Theropoda: Ornithomimidae) from Mongolia. MS Thesis, University of Warsaw However, in 2010 Bronowicz concluded this other find, though most closely related to Anserimimus planinychus, probably represented a separate taxon. Description Different view of skeleton Anserimimus was a medium-sized ornithomimosaurian. Gregory S. Paul in 2010 estimated its length at three metres, its weight at fifty kilogrammes.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 113 The thighbone is 435 millimetres long. There are several key differences between it and related species, though most of these are shared with ZPAL MgD-I/65. The claws on the hand are long, low at the back and rather straight, only slightly curved, with the lower surface nearly flat. The forelimb is long and also built more powerfully than that of other ornithomimids, with large crests on the scapulocoracoid of the shoulder and humerus (upper arm bone), which provided attachment points for large arm muscles like the biceps. The metacarpus of the hand is fused, adding to the strength. The foot is strongly arctometatarsalian, with the third metatarsal excluded from the front surface of the metatarsus over 40% of its upper length. Phylogeny Anserimimus was by Barsbold assigned to the Ornithomimidae, a group of derived Ornithomimosauria. This has been confirmed by modern cladistic analysis. Its closest relative may be Gallimimus from the same formation albeit from a different area (Kobayashi & Lu, 2003;Kobayashi, Y. & Lu J. 2003. A new ornithomimid dinosaur with gregarious habits from the Late Cretaceous of China. Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 48(2): 235‚Äì259. Kobayashi & Barsbold, 2005Kobayashi, Y. & Barsbold, R. 2005. Reexamination of a primitive ornithomimosaur, Garudimimus brevipes Barsbold, 1981 (Dinosauria: Theropoda), from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia. Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences 42: 1501-1521.). Other studies have been unable specifically to determine its relationships or those of any other ornithomimids (Ji et al., 2003;Ji Q., Norell, M.A., Makovicky, P.J., Gao K., Ji S, & Yuan C. An early ostrich dinosaur and implications for ornithomimosaur phylogeny. American Museum Novitates 3420: 1-19. Makovicky et al., 2004Norell, M.A., Makovicky, P.J., & Currie, P.J. 2001. The beaks of ostrich dinosaurs. Nature 412: 873-874.). The following cadogram is based on Xu et al., 2011: Paleobiology The function of the powerful arm, with its straightened claws, remains unknown. It may indicate a different diet of food-gathering strategy than other ornithomimids, although its diet is difficult to determine, since the animal's skull is unknown. Scientists have long hypothesized that ornithomimids, descended from carnivorous theropod ancestors, were actually omnivores or even herbivores.Osborn, H.F. 1917. Skeletal adaptations of Ornitholestes, Struthiomimus, and Tyrannosaurus. Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History 35: 733‚Äì771. Paleoecology Anserimimus was recovered from the Nemegt Formation of Mongolia. The Nemegt is thought to represent alluvial plains containing meandering rivers. The layer Anserimimus was found, is dating from the early Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous, or about 70 million years ago. Aside from Gallimimus, other theropods found in the Nemegt Formation include the gigantic Tarbosaurus and Deinocheirus, as well as smaller dromaeosaurids, oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, and birds. Herbivores are represented by the hadrosaurids Barsboldia and Saurolophus, the ankylosaurid Tarchia and several titanosaurian sauropods and pachycephalosaurians. The rock facies of this formation suggest the presence of stream and river channels, mudflats, and shallow lakes. Sediments also indicate that there existed a rich habitat, offering diverse food in abundant amounts that could sustain massive Cretaceous dinosaurs.Novacek, M. (1996).

She was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1999 to 2003, serving as an associate minister and member of the Cabinet in the government of Ernie Eves. As of 2007, she works as a Justice of the Peace. School trustee Molinari served as president of a local Parent Teacher Association, and was elected to the York Catholic District School Board in 1988. She served as chair of the board from 1994 to 1998, and was also given a Catholic School Trustees Association Trustee Award of Merit in 1998. Provincial politics Molinari was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1999, defeating Liberal candidate Dan Ronen in the riding of Thornhill. Molinari's bid for election was almost derailed early in the campaign when one of her pollsters asked constituents how they felt about being represented by a candidate who was the son of a Holocaust survivor (Ronen's father had survived internment at Auschwitz, and Thornhill has a large Orthodox Jewish population). She overcame this controversy, however, and defeated Ronen by 343 votes. Ernie Eves replaced Mike Harris as Premier of Ontario on April 15, 2002, and he appointed Molinari as an Associate Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing with responsibility for urban affairs. There were some who believed that Molinari would be re- elected in the provincial election of 2003, because of her party's support for a tax credit to parents who send their children to private or denominational schools. This issue was important to some members of Toronto's Jewish community, and Dan Ronen even chose to endorse Molinari for re-election because of her party's stand on this single issue. While she polled better than most other Tories in the Greater Toronto Area, Molinari was not able to overcome a provincial shift to the Liberals and lost to local councillor Mario Racco by 796 votes. Later life In 2004, Molinari was appointed to a post in Catholic Missions in Canada. Some regarded this appointment as controversial, given Molinari's pro-choice views on abortion. She has organized and hosted an annual fundraiser to raise funds for Catholic Missions within Canada.

Early years Wall was born Maxwell George Lorimer, son of the successful music-hall entertainer Jack (Jock) Lorimer, a Scottish comedy actor from Forfar, known for his songs and dancing, and his wife Stella (born Maud Clara Mitchison). He was born near the Oval, at 37 Glenshaw Mansions, Brixton Road, London SW9. In 1916, during a World War I air raid, Max and his elder brother Alex were saved from death by a cast iron bed frame, but his younger brother Bunty and their Aunt Betty, who was looking after them, were killed by a bomb dropped from a German Zeppelin which also destroyed their house. Max and Alex went to live with their father and his family, whilst their mother went to live with Harry Wallace, whom she had met on tour. When their father died of tuberculosis in 1920, aged 37, their mother married Harry Wallace, and they all moved to a pub in Essex.An Audience with Max Wall - BBC Radio 4 - first broadcast 3 December 2007 Career =Early career= Wall auditioned for a part with a touring theatre company, and made his stage d√©but at the age of 14 as Jack in Mother Goose with a travelling pantomime company in Devon and Cornwall featuring George Lacey. In 1925 he was a speciality dancer in the London Revue at the Lyceum. He became determined not to rely on his father's name, so abbreviated Maxwell to Max, and his stepfather's name Wallace, to Wall. He is best remembered for his ludicrously attired and hilariously strutting Professor Wallofski. John Cleese has acknowledged Wall's influence on his own \\"Ministry of Silly Walks\\" sketch for Monty Python's Flying Circus. After appearing in many musicals and stage comedies in the 1930s, Wall's career went into decline, and he was reduced to working in obscure nightclubs. He then joined the Royal Air Force during World War II and served for three years until he was invalided out in 1943. Wall married dancer Marion Pola and the couple had five children. In an interview with the family in the mid-1950s, Tit-Bits magazine wrote: \\"The kind of private jokes you find in all the nicest families flourish with the Walls. After Max and his wife, Marion, had their first son, Michael, it seemed kind of natural to make a corner in names beginning with ‚ÄòM‚Äô, and there are now Melvyn (aged nine), Martin (nearly five) and the four-month-old twins Meredith and Maxine. ... In the same way, because the Walls, like other couples married during the war, were eventually thrilled when they found a house with four walls of their own, they decided to call it just that, only Martin arrived and made it ‚ÄòFive Walls‚Äô.\\" In 1955 Wall left Marion and became involved with Jennifer Chimes, that year's Miss Great Britain, who was 26 years his junior and married with children. The couple married in 1956, but the following year Wall collapsed on stage and suffered a nervous breakdown. Jennifer left him, and although there were reconciliations, he divorced Jennifer for desertion in 1962. =Re-emergence= Wall re-emerged during the 1970s when producers and directors rediscovered his comic talents, along with the expressive power of his tragic clown face and the distinctive sad falling cadences of his voice. He secured television appearances and, having attracted Samuel Beckett's attention, he won parts in Waiting for Godot in 1979 and Krapp's Last Tape in 1984. In 1966 he appeared as P√®re Ubu in Jarry's Ubu Roi, and in 1972 he toured with Mott the Hoople on their \\"Rock n' Roll Circus Tour\\", gaining a new audience. His straight acting gained him this review in 1974: \\"Max Wall makes Olivier look like an amateur in The Entertainer at Greenwich Theatre...\\".The Guardian, 27 November 1974 He also appeared in Crossroads (as Walter Soper, 1982 to 1983), Coronation Street (as Harry Payne, 1978) and what was then Emmerdale Farm (as Arthur Braithwaite, 1978). He played ex-con Ernie Dodds in Minder in 1982, with George Cole. =Later work= Wall played one of the inventors in the 1968 film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and in 1977 he was seen as King Bruno the Questionable in Terry Gilliam's film Jabberwocky. In the 1970s and 80s, Wall occasionally performed a one-man stage show, Aspects of Max Wall, in which he recaptured the humour of old-time music hall theatre. On 1 April 1977, Wall's version of Ian Dury's song \\"England's Glory\\" (which featured in Dury's stage show Apples) was issued on Stiff Records (BUY 12), backed with \\"Dream Tobacco\\" and given away with the album Hits Greatest Stiffs.Stiff Records Catalogue Retrieved 6 April 2009 Wall also appeared onstage with Dury at the Hammersmith Odeon in 1978, but was poorly received, and said \\"They only want the walk\\". Between 1982 and 1984 he appeared as Tombs in the BBC Two adaptation of Jane based on the Daily Mirror comic-strip character and filmed with similar \\"comic-strip frames\\". In the second series his place in the castlist was upgraded to second, after Glynis Barber. His last film appearance was in 1989 in the 12-minute film A Fear of Silence, a dark tale of a man who drives a stranger to a confession of murder by answering only \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" to his questions; those two words, repeated, were his only dialogue. The film won a gold award in the New York Film and TV Festival. Death Wall's grave in Highgate Cemetery. On the afternoon of 20 May 1990 Wall fell at Simpson's-in-the-Strand in central London, fracturing his skull. He was conveyed by ambulance to Westminster Hospital in an unconscious state, but never regained consciousness, and died there early in the next morning, at the age of 82. His body was buried at Highgate Cemetery. Wall had four sons, Michael, Melvyn, Martin and Meredith, and a daughter, Maxine. Legacy There is a Max Wall Society, which aims to perpetuate his memory. In 2006 the Society placed an unofficial blue plaque on Wall's birthplace in South London.

White Plains Road is the primary thoroughfare through Williamsbridge. The neighborhood is part of Bronx Community Board 12 and its ZIP Codes include 10466, 10467, and 10469. The area is patrolled by the 47th Precinct of the New York City Police Department.

The proposed zoning would preserve the area‚Äôs lower density residential character and promote new development in keeping with the scale of the surrounding neighborhood. In addition, the DCP is proposing a zoning text amendment establishing a new citywide R5A district to address the unique detached housing stock found within this neighborhood.Olinville Rezoning - Approved, New York City Department of City Planning.

The area‚Äôs development patterns, although varied, are characterized by distinct enclaves of detached, semi-detached, and attached residential buildings, as well as a smaller number of mid and high- rise apartment buildings. However, the height and density of existing housing is generally lower than is permitted under the current zoning. Clusters of one- and two-family homes are prevalent in many parts of Williamsbridge and few buildings are higher than 70 feet, even in the more densely developed portions of the neighborhood. The proposed rezonings aim to address this zoning mismatch by ensuring that new development is of a density and scale compatible with the low-rise/low-density character of this community.

From 1960 until 2006, Tower operated retail stores in the United States, which closed when Tower Records filed for bankruptcy and liquidation. Tower.com was purchased by a separate entity and was not affected by the retail store closings. History The Tower Theatre in Sacramento, California, where Solomon first sold records from his father's Tower Drugs ‚Äì now the Tower Cafe =Inception, expansion, and description= In 1960, Russell Solomon opened the first Tower Records store on Broadway, in Sacramento, California. He named it for his father's drugstore, which shared a building and name with the Tower Theater, where Solomon first started selling records. The first stand-alone Tower Records store was located at 2514 Watt Ave in Arden Arcade, a suburb of Sacramento, California. By 1976, Solomon had opened Tower Books, Posters, and Plants at 1600 Broadway, next door to another Sacramento Tower Records location. In 1995, Tower.com opened, making the enterprise one of the first retailers to move online. In addition to compact discs and cassette tapes, the stores sold DVDs, electronic gadgets like mp3 players, video games, accessories, and toys, and a few Tower Records locations sold books as well, such as those in Brea, Mountain View, and Sacramento, California, as well as stores in Austin, Boston, Massachusetts, Nashville, New York City, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle. Tower Records on the Sunset Strip Seven years after its founding, Tower Records expanded to San Francisco, opening a store in what was originally a grocery store at Bay Street and Columbus Avenue. In 1979, Tower Records in Japan started its business as the Japan Branch of MTS Incorporated. The following year, Sapporo Store, the first in Japan opened. The chain eventually expanded internationally to include stores in Japan, United Kingdom, Canada, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Ireland, Israel, United Arab Emirates, Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Argentina. The Tower Records stores in Japan split off from the main chain and are now independent. Arguably the most famous Tower Records outlet was the purpose built building that company staff general- contracted, with many personally contributing their labor, which opened in 1971 on the north west corner of Sunset Boulevard and Horn Avenue in West Hollywood. In New York City, Tower Records operated a suite of stores on and near lower Broadway in the East Village. The main store was located at the southeast corner of East 4th Street and Broadway. The Tower Records Annex was in the same building, located at the southwest corner of East 4th and Lafayette Street. The third store, Tower Video, was located on the southeast corner of East 4th and Lafayette Street, and specialized in video and the second floor of this location also sold books. Their location on the Upper West Side, near Lincoln Center on 66th Street and Broadway, was a magnet for those working in the field of musical theatre. The Nashville location on West End Avenue (across from Vanderbilt University) was in a former Packard dealership. The old showroom floor in front was devoted to CDs, cassettes and vinyl. The area in the back housed videocassette sales and rentals, PC and console games and music paraphernalia. The strip mall next door contained a separate Tower Books. The location was famous for their late-night Monday events that culminated at midnight on Tuesday when staff started ringing up sales of new releases. Because of the store's proximity to Music Row, country music stars could occasionally be seen performing or shopping there. As part of a 2002 settlement with 41 states over CD price fixing Tower Records, along with retailers Musicland and Trans World Entertainment, agreed to pay a $3 million fine. It is estimated that between 1995 and 2000 customers were overcharged by nearly $500 million and up to $5 per album. In 2005, the company began using \\"scan and listen\\" stations in its stores. These stations allowed customers to listen to audio samples from CDs and to search for particular songs, albums and artists. This model of listening station is still used at the Arizona-based chain Zia Records. In 2006, the company introduced the Tower Insider program. The program was free of charge and allowed a customer to receive a membership card which could be scanned with each purchase, allowing the customer to receive coupons and notification of special deals via e-mail. =Tower Pulse! magazine= In 1983, the company began publishing a music magazine, Pulse!, which contained record reviews, interviews, and advertising. Initially, it was given away free in their stores to promote their record sales. After nine years, in 1992, the magazine began national distribution with a cover price of $2.95, but it was cancelled when the company discontinued U.S. operations. From 1983 until December 2002 Tower Records published it monthly, 222 issues in all. =Bankruptcy= Tower Records entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the first time in 2004. Factors cited were the heavy debt incurred during its aggressive expansion in the 1990s, growing competition from mass discounters and Internet piracy. Mismanagement, managerial incompetence, and crippling restrictions from the first bankruptcy deal also contributed to Tower's demise. Some observers took a pragmatic view. As Robert Moog, inventor of the Moog synthesizer, has stated: \\"I'm sorry if Tower Records' and Blockbuster's sales plummet. On the other hand, it wasn't that long ago that those megastore chains drove a lot of neighborhood record stores out of business.\\" In February 2004, the debt was estimated to be between $80 million and $100 million, and assets totaled just over $100 million. On August 20, 2006, Tower Records filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time, in order to facilitate a purchase of the company prior to the holiday shopping season. =Liquidation= A liquidating Tower Records store in Portland, Oregon. On October 6, 2006, Great American Group won an auction of the company's assets and commenced liquidation proceedings the following day. This included going-out-of-business sales at all U.S. Tower Records locations, the last of which closed on December 22, 2006. The Tower Records website was sold separately. The managers of f.y.e., a music store chain based in shopping malls, had negotiated a deal to acquire the two historic Tower locations in the latter's home base of Sacramento. f.y.e. later backed out, stating that the \\"leases aren't what we thought they were\\". f.y.e. did acquire the lease of the West End Avenue store in Nashville, which eventually closed in 2011. f.y.e. also took over a Tower Records in Torrance, which continued to operate until early 2016. Rasputin Music, a new and used music and video store based in the San Francisco Bay Area, expanded in the Central Valley of California by acquiring the leases for the former Tower Records stores in Fresno and Stockton.

The final Tower Records store (in the Pacific Time Zone) to be closed was the one in Mountain View, which closed at 5:00 p.m. One building in Sacramento had been a Tower Records store for 40 years, and the lot across the street had been the location where Solomon began selling records in 1941. R5 Records closed on June 4, 2010, and was sold to rival Dimple Records, which reopened the store in mid-July 2010.Bob Shallit: Russ Solomon's presence will be felt at new Dimple site in Sacramento The Sacramento Bee, June 5, 2010 The Tower Records building in Boston, located at the intersection of Newbury Street and Massachusetts Avenue, was instrumental in the conversion of the former street's commercial value.

The store (which occupied the first five stories) featured gold stars of Boston artists (including Gang Starr, New Kids on the Block, and Yo- Yo Ma) embedded in the front landing. Virgin Megastore took over the store from 2002 to 2007. The space was later a Best Buy store and, after being vacant for some time, in 2016 was opened as a T.J. Maxx store.Goodison, Donna, \\"T.J.

They hired former Tower buyer Kevin Hawkins to assist with the re-opening (Hawkins, along with former Tower employee George Scarlett, then left Caiman). In 2009, Richard Flynn was hired as President. The website remained based in Montreal, but the relaunch of the brand never moved forward. As of January 2019, Tower Records has created an Instagram page and a new website featuring an online version of Pulse that is updated sporadically.  International stores  = Canada = Tower Records operated in Canada in the mid 1990s with a flagship store at the Toronto Eaton Centre at the corner of Queen and Yonge which opened in December 1995 and closed in 2001. Tower Records opened a second location in Toronto in the late nineties at Empress Walk in North York also on Yonge Street but was closed just prior to the flag ship store closing. = Hong Kong = Tower Records opened stores in the Hong Kong in the 1990s. There were two stores, one located on the seventh floor of Times Square at Causeway Bay, the other at Diamond Hill. = Ireland = Tower Records is operated in Ireland by Record & Discs Ltd. (owned by Press Up Entertainment) under a licensed franchise of MTS Incorporated (USA). , two stores still operate in Ireland both located in Dublin, one on Dawson Street and the other on O'Connell Street upstairs in Easons. It is proposed that Tower Records could expand to other cities in Ireland in the coming years. = Israel = Tower Records Israel opened in 1993; a joint venture between Tower Records USA (MTS INC of W. Sacramento, CA) and two local businessmen. The Founding Director was Joel Abramson, who had previously managed Tower's flagship Sunset Strip location in Los Angeles. The first three locations were in Tel Aviv (the Opera Tower), Haifa (Hutzot HaMifratz, opened in early 1995) and Jerusalem (1995). The Tel Aviv location, with its beachfront location, was a popular shopping spot for Israeli pop stars like David Broza, Meir Ariel, Aviv Gefen, Riki Gal and others. TRI closed its final location in Ra'anana in November 2015. = Japan = Shibuya store. In 1979, Tower Records in Japan started its business as the Japan Branch of MTS Incorporated. The following year, Sapporo Store, the first in Japan opened. In 1981, Japanese subsidiary Tower Records Japan Inc. (TRJ) was established. In October 2002, TRJ went independent from the international chain by management buyout. The bankruptcy of Tower Records in the U.S. in 2006 did not affect TRJ as it had been completely independent (as of 2015, NTT DoCoMo and Seven & I Holdings are the main stakeholders). As of October 1, 2014, TRJ maintains 85 directly operated store locations throughout Japan, including 10 Tower Mini Stores, and the Shibuya Store in Tokyo (moved to the current location in March 1995) which is said to be one of the biggest music retail outlets in the world, occupying selling space of 5,000 m¬≤ (9 floors). TRJ also publishes free magazines Tower, bounce, and intoxicate directly and through its subsidiary NMNL. In addition to being the leading CD retailer in Japan, TRJ was the majority stakeholder in Napster Japan, a joint venture between TRJ and Napster LLC. On March 1, 2010, Napster Japan and TRJ announced that Napster Japan would terminate all of its services on May 31, 2010 due to the difficulty in covering the costs for maintaining the required systems to continue the services. Tower Records Japan has a subsidiary record label called T-Palette Records, which specializes in idol performers. = Malaysia = Tower Records opened stores in Malaysia in the 1997. Now Tower Records Malaysia operate at the address 27-1 JALAN 13/149L BANDAR BARU SERI PETALING 57000 KUALA LUMPUR MALAYSIA. = Mexico = The first Tower Records store in Mexico opened in the mid 1990s in the Zona Rosa area featuring 3 floors and a live DJ. After international bankruptcy, the stores were acquired by Promotora Musical, a retail company owned by Grupo Carso, the same owner of Mixup record stores. There were Tower Records stores in Mexico City (Gran Sur and Mundo E), Puebla (Las Animas) and Monterrey (Paseo San Pedro)., but eventually closed. = Philippines = Tower Records opened three stores in the Philippines in the 1990s. The first branch was located in Glorietta 3 Ayala Center Makati City which opened in 1998. The second store was in Alabang Town Center Muntinlupa City which opened in 1999.The third store was in Robinson's Place Manila, all of which are in the National Capital Region. As of 2018, all these branches have closed. = Singapore = Tower Records opened stores in Singapore in the 1990s. Singapore had two Tower Records outlets, one at Pacific Plaza that opened in 1993 and the other at Suntec City. Tower Records Pacific Plaza moved out in 2001 and the latter closed its doors in 2006 when Tower Records filed for bankruptcy globally and eventually folded. = South Korea = Tower Records opened stores in South Korea in the 1990s, with stores in Seoul and Busan. The Seoul branch became part of Synnara Record (now Media Synnara) and is now part of M2U Record, while the Busan branch has closed. The Seoul branch was used as one of the main filming locations for Seoul Broadcasting System's 2001 drama Beautiful Days, starring Lee Byung-hun, Choi Ji-woo, Ryu Si-won, Shin Min-a, Lee Jung-hyun and Lee Yoo-jin. = Taiwan = Tower Records opened three mega stores in Taipei, Taiwan in the 1990s. All stores were located in popular areas of Taipei, and became centers of fashion and music during their existence. The stores closed in December 2003. = Thailand = Tower Records opened stores in Thailand in the 1990s, introducing comprehensive music CD stocking into Thailand for the first time with revolutionary effects on the retail music business. There were several stores in Bangkok, including three megastores inside popular malls. One of the biggest megastores was located on the top floor of CentralWorld mall in central Bangkok. In the 2000s as business declined due to piracy and the downloading revolution, the stores were progressively closed and the remaining ones were eventually sold to another dealer. = United Kingdom = Tower Records in the UK was originally a London-based concern, with a first store in Kensington High Street in 1984 being followed the next year by a flagship outlet at 1 Piccadilly Circus and later two more smaller outlets at Whiteleys in Bayswater, and Kingston. However, by the start of the 1990s the chain had grown to encompass a number of other stores, with large entertainment stores also selling movies, books, magazines and games in Birmingham and Glasgow, as well as a number of smaller stores that had been purchased from rival American retailer Sam Goody when it had left the UK marketplace (an example of this express format was in Weston- super-Mare). However, with tough trading conditions in the UK market, as well as the company's trouble in the States, the firm followed Sam Goody in retreating from the UK market.Mary Fagan, Tower Records to sell remaining British sites to Virgin, Daily Telegraph, January 26, 2003 The London stores in Piccadilly and Kensington were sold to Virgin Group in 2003, who for a while traded under the Tower brand at the former site until the store could be fully refurbished, while the other stores were closed. The store was subsequently renamed Zavvi in September 2007 after a management buyout of the Virgin Megastores. The Piccadilly store closed on Wednesday, January 14, 2009 by the administrators and is now occupied by a non-music retailer as of 2017. Documentary All Things Must Pass (2015) is a documentary by filmmaker Colin Hanks chronicling the rise and fall of Tower Records, using archival footage and exclusive interviews with former staff, especially Russell Solomon and former COO Stan Goman, as well as celebrity customers Bruce Springsteen, Elton John and Dave Grohl. Another documentary called Art Gods (2013) is an oral history of the development of an influential in-store display design ethic at Tower, originating from the Berkeley location.

In Australia and other parts of the world, they are called \\"windrowers\\". They aid harvesting by speeding up the process of drying the crop down to a moisture content suitable for harvesting and storage. Crimper rollers and cutting discs on Razorbar header A swather may be self-propelled via an internal combustion engine, or may be drawn by a tractor and powered through a power take-off shaft. A swather uses a sickle bar (see mower) or cutting discs to cut the stems of the crop. A reel helps the cut crop fall neatly onto a canvas or auger conveyor which moves it and deposits it into a windrow, with all stems oriented in the same direction. Horizontal rollers behind the cutters may be used to crimp the stems of the crop to decrease drying time. The mown strip left behind is the swathe. For hay crops, this is the same basic sequence as is also done in other ways, such as hand scything, cradling, and swathing, mowing with a mower and then raking with a hay rake, or mowing and conditioning with a mower-conditioner (the latter two sometimes also with additional tedding). With grain crops, as combines replaced threshing machines, the swather introduced a new step in the harvesting process to provide for the drying time that binding formerly afforded. Binding allowed subsequent temporary storage of the cut plants before threshing (either in stooks or in a barn), during which time they dried out. Combine harvesting removes the binding and temporary pre-threshing storage step from the harvesting process, but in many regions of the world, combining without swathing, that is, reaping and threshing a standing plant at the same time, produces threshed grain that is too high in moisture for reliable storage. Getting around that problem drove the development in the 1920s and 30s both of swathing practice for grain crops, and, especially after World War II, of widespread industrial-scale grain drying. Swathing (windrowing) is more common in the northern United States and Canada because the curing time for grain crops is reduced by cutting the plant stems. In regions with longer growing seasons, grain crops are usually left standing and harvested directly by combines. In the latter regions the grain can reliably reach a low-enough moisture level while still on the standing plant, whereas in regions less conducive to such drying, swathing provides the extra help needed for the grain to reach the ideal level of moisture. Regardless of which harvesting method is used, threshed grain can receive additional drying, or not, as needed for storage; the ideal in energy efficiency, productivity, and cost- effectiveness is to get grain straight out of the combine that is dry enough. Reality does not always match that, and a damp harvest followed by drying is much better than no harvest. Farmers who do not have their own grain drying equipment will often sell to the grain elevator company to do the drying, with the expense docked from the price paid for the grain. The Swather is the mascot of sports teams at Hesston High School in Hesston, Kansas, USA. Hesston is the home to AGCO Corporation's large swather and combine harvester manufacturing plants.

The first specimen was discovered in 1867 near Fort Wallace, Kansas, US, and was sent to the American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope, who named it E.platyurus in 1868. The generic name means \\"thin-plate reptile\\", and the specific name means \\"flat-tailed\\". Cope originally reconstructed the skeleton of Elasmosaurus with the skull at the end of the tail, an error which was made light of by the paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh, and became part of their \\"Bone Wars\\" rivalry. Only one incomplete Elasmosaurus skeleton is definitely known, consisting of a fragmentary skull, the spine, and the pectoral and pelvic girdles, and a single species is recognized today; other species are now considered invalid or have been moved to other genera. Measuring long, Elasmosaurus would have had a streamlined body with paddle-like limbs, a short tail, a small head, and an extremely long neck. The neck alone was around long. Along with its relative Albertonectes, it was one of the longest-necked animals to have lived, with the largest number of neck vertebrae known, 72. The skull would have been slender and triangular, with large, fang-like teeth at the front, and smaller teeth towards the back. It had six teeth in each premaxilla of the upper jaw, and may have had 14 teeth in the maxilla and 19 in the dentary of the lower jaw. Most of the neck vertebrae were compressed sideways, and bore a longitudinal crest or keel along the sides. The family Elasmosauridae was based on the genus Elasmosaurus, the first recognized member of this group of long-necked plesiosaurs. Elasmosaurids were well adapted for aquatic life, and used their flippers for swimming. Contrary to earlier depictions, their necks were not very flexible, and could not be held high above the water surface. It is unknown what their long necks were used for, but they may have had a function in feeding. Elasmosaurids probably ate small fish and marine invertebrates, seizing them with their long teeth, and may have used gastroliths (stomach stones) to help digest their food. Elasmosaurus is known from the Pierre Shale formation, which represents marine deposits from the Western Interior Seaway. History of study Officers at Fort Wallace, Kansas, in 1867. Turner, who the same year discovered Elasmosaurus in the area, is second from left. In early 1867, the American army surgeon Theophilus Hunt Turner and the army scout William Comstock explored the rocks around Fort Wallace, Kansas, where they were stationed during the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad. Approximately northeast of Fort Wallace, near McAllaster, Turner discovered the bones of a large fossil reptile in a ravine in the Pierre Shale formation, and though he had no paleontological experience, he recognized the remains as belonging to an \\"extinct monster\\". In June, Turner gave three fossil vertebrae to the American scientist John LeConte, a member of the railway survey, to take back east to be identified. In December, LeConte delivered some of the vertebrae to the American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP, known since 2011 as the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University). Recognizing them as the remains of a plesiosaur, larger than any he had seen in Europe, Cope wrote to Turner asking him to deliver the rest of the specimen, at the ANSP's expense. In December 1867 Turner and others from Fort Wallace returned to the site and recovered much of the vertebral column, as well as concretions that contained other bones; the material had a combined weight of . The fossils were dug or pried out of the relatively soft shale with picks and shovels, loaded on a horse-drawn wagon, and transported back to Fort Wallace. Cope sent instructions on how to pack the bones, which were thereafter sent in hay-padded crates on a military wagon east to the railroad, which had not yet reached the fort. The specimen arrived in Philadelphia by rail in March 1868, whereafter Cope examined it hurriedly; he reported on it at the March ANSP meeting, during which he named it Elasmosaurus platyurus. The generic name Elasmosaurus means \\"thin-plate reptile\\", in reference to the \\"plate\\" bones of the sternal and pelvic regions, and the specific name platyurus means \\"flat-tailed\\", in reference to the compressed \\"tail\\" (actually the neck) and laminae of the vertebrae there. Back vertebrae of the holotype, 1869 Cope requested that Turner search for more parts of the Elasmosaurus specimen, and was sent more fossils during August or September 1868. The ANSP thanked Turner for his \\"very valuable gift\\" at their meeting in December 1868, and Turner visited the museum during spring, at a time when Cope was absent. Turner died unexpectedly at Fort Wallace on July27, 1869, without seeing the completion of the work he began, but Cope continued to write him, unaware of his death until 1870. The circumstances around Turner's discovery of the type specimen were not covered in Cope's report, and remained unknown until Turner's letters were published in 1987. Elasmosaurus was the first major fossil discovery in Kansas (and the largest from there at the time), and marked the beginning of a fossil collecting rush that sent thousands of fossils from Kansas to prominent museums on the American east coast. Elasmosaurus was one of few plesiosaurs known from the New World at the time, and the first recognized member of the long-necked family of plesiosaurs, the Elasmosauridae. In 1869 Cope scientifically described and figured Elasmosaurus, and the preprint version of the manuscript contained a reconstruction of the skeleton which he had earlier presented during his report at an ANSP meeting in September 1868. The reconstruction showed Elasmosaurus with a short neck and a long tail, unlike other plesiosaurs, and Cope was also unsure whether it had hind limbs. At an ANSP meeting a year and a half later, in March 1870, the American paleontologist Joseph Leidy (Cope's mentor) noted that Cope's reconstruction of Elasmosaurus showed the skull at the wrong end of the vertebral column, at the end of the tail instead of the neck. Cope had apparently concluded that the tail vertebrae belonged to the neck, since the jaws had been found at that end of the skeleton, even though the opposite end terminated in the axis and atlas bones that are found in the neck. Leidy also concluded that Elasmosaurus was identical to Discosaurus, a plesiosaur he had named in 1851. To hide his mistake, Cope attempted to recall all copies of the preprint article, and printed a corrected version with a new skeletal reconstruction that placed the head on the neck (though it reversed the orientation of the individual vertebrae) and different wording in 1870. In a reply to Leidy, Cope claimed that he had been misled by the fact that Leidy had arranged the vertebrae of Cimoliasaurus in the reverse order in his 1851 description of that genus, and pointed out that his reconstruction had been corrected. Cope also rejected the idea that Elasmosaurus and Discosaurus were identical, and noted that the latter and Cimoliasaurus did not have any distinguishing features. Though Cope had tried to destroy the preprints, one copy came to the attention of the American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh, who made light of the mistake. This led to antagonism between Cope, who was embarrassed by the mistake, and Marsh, who brought up the mistake repeatedly for decades. Marsh returned to the issue during their controversy in the New York Herald in the 1890s (Marsh claimed he had pointed out the error to Cope immediately), when their dispute gained widespread public attention. The argument was part of the \\"Bone Wars\\" rivalry between the two, and is well known in the history of paleontology. Because of Cope's reputation as a brilliant paleontologist, it has been questioned why he would make such an obvious anatomical error. It has been suggested that, as a unique specimen in 1868, the original Elasmosaurus may have been hard to interpret based on the knowledge available at the time. Also, Cope initially thought it consisted of two specimens of different animalsin an 1868 letter to LeConte, Cope had referred to the supposed \\"smaller specimen\\" as Discosaurus carinatus. Cope was only in his late twenties and not formally trained in paleontology, and may have been influenced by Leidy's mistake of reversing the vertebral column of Cimoliasaurus. In 2002 the American art historian Jane P. Davidson noted that the fact that other scientists early on had pointed out Leidy's error argues against this explanation, adding that Cope was not convinced he had made a mistake. Plesiosaur anatomy was sufficiently well known at the time that Cope should not have made the mistake, according to Davidson. Cope did little work on the specimen since his 1870 description, and it was kept in storage for nearly 30 years. It was only redescribed in detail in 2005 by the German paleontologist Sven Sachs. =Known and possible fossil elements= Today, the incomplete holotype specimen, catalogued as ANSP 10081, is the only definite specimen of Elasmosaurus. It was long exhibited, but is now stored in a cabinet with other assigned fragments. The specimen consists of the premaxillae, part of the hind-section of the right maxilla, two maxilla fragments with teeth, the front part of the dentaries, three more jaw fragments, two cranial fragments of indeterminable identity, 72 neck vertebrae, including the atlas and axis, 3pectoral vertebrae, 6back vertebrae, 4sacral vertebrae, 18 tail vertebrae, as well as rib fragments. In 2013 an incomplete neck vertebra centrum of the holotype that had been mentioned by Cope but thought to have been lost was rediscovered in storage by Sachs, and the neck vertebra count was revised from 71 to 72. In 1986 a three-dimensional reconstruction of the holotype skeleton was completed and is now displayed at the ANSP. This cast was later copied by the company Triebold Paleontology Incorporated, and replicas were provided to other museums. One of these measures about in length. generic name refers to these \\"plate\\" bones Though Cope described and figured the pectoral and pelvic girdles of Elasmosaurus in 1869 and 1875, these elements were noted as missing from the collection by the American paleontologist Samuel Wendell Williston in 1906. Cope had loaned these elements to the English sculptor Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins to help prepare them out of their surrounding concretions. At the time, Hawkins was working on a \\"Paleozoic Museum\\" in New York's Central Park, where a reconstruction of Elasmosaurus was to appear, an American equivalent to his life-sized Crystal Palace Dinosaurs in London. In May 1871 much of the exhibit material in Hawkins' workshop was destroyed by vandals (working for the New York politician William M. \\"Boss\\" Tweed) and their fragments buried; it is possible that the girdle elements of Elasmosaurus were at the workshop and were likewise destroyed. Nothing was subsequently mentioned about their loss by Hawkins or Cope. In 2018, Davidson and Everhart documented the events leading up to the disappearance of these fossils, and suggested that a photo and drawing of Waterhouse's workshop from 1869 appear to show concretions on the floor that may have been the unprepared girdles of Elasmosaurus. They also noted that conceptual sketches of the Palaeozoic Museum show that the model Elasmosaurus was originally envisioned with a long \\"tail\\", though later updated with a long neck. Davidson and Everhart concluded that the girdle fossils were most likely destroyed in Hawkins' workshop. Hawkins' workshop in Central Park; the rounded shapes in the lower center left may be concretions that contained the now missing girdle fossils of the holotype Fossils that may have belonged to the holotype were found by the American geologist Benjamin Franklin Mudge in 1871, but have probably been lost since. Additional plesiosaur fossils were recovered near the original locality in 1954, 1991, 1994, and 1998, including back vertebrae, ribs, gastralia (belly ribs), and gastroliths. As none of these elements overlap with those of the holotype specimen, in 2005 the American paleontologist Michael J. Everhart concluded they belonged to the same individual, and that the parts had been separated before burial of the carcass. He also noted that a small stone wedged in the neural canal of one of the tail vertebrae of the holotype may be a gastrolith, based on its polished appearance. In 2007 the Colombian paleontologists Leslie No√® and Marcela G√≥mez-P√©rez expressed doubt that the additional elements belonged to the type specimen, or even to Elasmosaurus, due to lack of evidence. They explained that elements missing from the holotype may have been lost to weathering or simply not collected, and that parts may have been lost or damaged during transportation or preparation. Gastroliths may also not have been recognized as such during collection, since such stones were not reported from a plesiosaur until ten years after. In 2017 Sachs and Joachim Ladwig suggested that a fragmentary elasmosaurid skeleton from the upper Campanian of Kronsmoor in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, and housed in the Naturkunde-Museum Bielefeld, may have belonged to Elasmosaurus. Additional parts of the same skeleton are housed at the Institute for Geology of the University of Hamburg, as well as in private collections. Combined, the specimen consists of neck, back and tail vertebrae, phalanges, a tooth, limb elements, 110 gastroliths, and unidentifiable fragments. Description Size compared to a human Though the only known specimen of Elasmosaurus (holotype specimen ANSP10081) is fragmentary and missing many elements, related elasmosaurids show it would have had a compact, streamlined body, long, paddle-like limbs, a short tail, a proportionately small head, and an extremely long neck. The neck of Elasmosaurus is estimated at in length; thus, Elasmosaurus and its relative Albertonectes were some of the longest-necked animals ever to have lived, with the largest number of neck vertebrae of any known vertebrate animals. In spite of their many neck vertebrae, the necks of elasmosaurids were less than half as long as those of the longest-necked sauropod dinosaurs. In 1952 the American paleontologist Samuel Welles estimated the body length to have been . In his 1869 description of Elasmosaurus, Cope estimated the length of the animal by summing up vertebral lengths and estimations of missing parts, resulting in a total length of . The living animal would have been slightly larger due to cartilage present between the vertebral bodies, and was estimated by Cope at roughly . Life restoration Like other elasmosaurids, Elasmosaurus would have had a slender, triangular skull. The snout was rounded and almost formed a semi-circle when viewed from above, and the premaxillae (which form the front of the upper jaw) bore a low keel at the midline. It is uncertain how many teeth Elasmosaurus had, due to the fragmentary state of the fossils. It probably had six teeth in each premaxilla, and the teeth preserved there were formed like large fangs. The number of premaxillary teeth distinguished Elasmosaurus from primitive plesiosauroids and most other elasmosaurids, which usually had fewer. The two teeth at the front were smaller than the succeeding ones, and were located between the first two teeth in the dentaries of the lower jaws. The known teeth of the front part of the lower jaw were large fangs, and the teeth at the back of the jaws appear to have been smaller. The dentition of elasmosaurids was generally heterodont (irregular throughout the jaws), with the teeth becoming progressively smaller from front to back. The maxillae (largest tooth bearing bone of the upper jaw) of elasmosaurids usually contained 14teeth, whereas the dentaries (the main part of the lower jaws) usually contained 17 to 19. The teeth interlocked, and their tooth crowns were slender and rounded in cross-section. The mandibular symphysis (where the two halves of the lower jaw connected) was well ossified, with no visible suture. The pectoral and pelvic girdles of the holotype specimen were noted as missing by 1906, but observations about these elements were since made based on the original descriptions and figures from the late 19thcentury. The shoulder blades (scapulae) were fused and met at the midline, bearing no trace of a median bar. The upper processes of the shoulder blades were very broad, and the \\"necks\\" of the shoulder blades were long. The pectoral girdle had a long bar at the middle, a supposedly advanced feature thought to be absent from juvenile plesiosaurs. The ischia (a pair of bones that formed part of the pelvis) were joined at the middle, so that a medial bar was present along the length of the pelvis, a feature usually not found in plesiosaurs. Like other elasmosaurids (and plesiosaurs in general), Elasmosaurus would have had large, paddle-like limbs with very long digits. The paddles at the front (the pectoral paddles) were longer than those at the back (the pelvic paddles). =Vertebrae= Reconstructed skull and neck, North American Museum of Ancient Life Unlike those of many other long-necked animals, the individual neck vertebrae were not particularly elongated; rather, the extreme neck length was achieved by a much increased number of vertebrae. Elasmosaurus differed from all other plesiosaurs by having 72 neck (or cervical) vertebrae; more may have been present but were later lost to erosion or after excavation. Only Albertonectes had more neck vertebrae, 75, and the two are the only plesiosaurs with a count higher than 70; more than 60 vertebrae is very derived (or \\"advanced\\") for plesiosaurs. The atlas and axis bone complex, consisting of the first two neck vertebrae and articulated with the back of the skull, was long, low, and horizontally rectangular in side- view. The centra, or \\"bodies\\", of these vertebrae were co-ossified in the holotype specimen, which indicates it was an adult. The neural arches of these vertebrae were very thin and rather high, which gave the neural canal (the opening through the middle of the vertebrae) a triangular outline when seen from the back. The lower part of the neural canal was narrow towards the back by the axis, where it was half the breadth of the centrum. It became broader towards the front, where it was almost the same breadth as the centrum of the atlas. The neural arches were also more robust there than in the axis, and the neural canal was higher. The neural spine was low and directed upwards and back. The centra of the atlas and axis were of equal length, and had a quadratic shape in side view. The surface (or facet) where the axis articulated with the next vertebra had an oval outline, and an excavation for the neural canal in the middle of its upper edge. A distinct keel ran along the lower middle of the atlas and axis vertebrae. Vertebra from the front part of the neck of the holotype specimen; \\"llr\\" stands for the \\"lateral longitudinal ridge\\" on the sides of the centrum Most of the neck vertebrae were compressed sideways, especially at the middle of the neck. A crest (also termed ridge or keel) ran longitudinally along the side of the neck vertebrae (a feature typical of elasmosaurids), visible from the third to the fifty- fifth vertebrae, at the hind part of the neck. This crest was positioned at the middle of the centrum in the front vertebrae, and at the upper half of the centrum from the 19th vertebra and onwards. The crest would have served to anchor the musculature of the neck. The centra differed in shape depending on the position of the vertebrae in the neck; that of the third vertebra was about as long as it was broad, but the centra became longer than broad from the fourth vertebra and onwards. The centra became more elongated at the middle of the neck, but became shorter again at the back of the neck, with the length and breadth being about equal at the 61st vertebra, and those of the hindmost vertebrae being broader than long. The articular surfaces of the vertebrae in the front of the neck were broad oval, and moderately deepened, with rounded, thickened edges, with an excavation (or cavity) at the upper and lower sides. Further back in the front part of the neck, around the 25th vertebra, the lower edge of the articular facets became more concave, and the facet shaped like a quadrate with rounded edges. By the 63rd vertebra, the articular facet was also quadratic in shape with rounded edges, whereas the centra of the hindmost vertebrae had a broad oval outline. The neural arches of the neck vertebrae were well fused to the centra, leaving no visible sutures, and the neural canal was narrow in the front vertebrae, becoming more prominently developed in the hind vertebrae, where it was as broad as high, and almost circular. The pre-and post-zygapophyses of the neck vertebrae, processes that articulated adjacent vertebrae so they fit together, were of equal length; the former reached entirely over the level of the centrum whereas the latter reached only with their back half. The neural spines of the neck vertebrae appear to have been low, and almost semi-circular by the 20th vertebra. The facets where the neck ribs articulated with the neck vertebrae were placed on the lower sides of the centra, but were only placed higher in the last three vertebrae, reaching around the middle of the sides. The neck ribs were semicircular to quadratic in side view, and were directed rather straight down. The bottom of each neck vertebrae had pairs of nutritive foramina (openings) at the middle, separated by a ridge, which became progressively more prominent and thickened towards the back of the neck. Vertebrae from the pectoral region of the holotype specimen The vertebrae that transitioned between the neck and back (or dorsal) vertebrae in the pectoral region of plesiosaurs, close to the front margin of the forelimb girdle, are often termed pectoral vertebrae. Elasmosaurus had three pectoral vertebrae, which is a common number for elasmosaurids. The rib facets of the pectoral vertebrae were triangular in shape and situated on transverse processes, and the centra bore pairs of nutritive foramina in the middle of the lower sides. The back vertebrae had rib facets level with the neural canal, and the front and back part of the transverse processes here had distinct ridges on their margins. Here the rib facets where placed higher than the transverse processes, separating the two, and were oval to rectangular in outline. The pre-zygapophyses here were shorter than those in the neck and pectoral vertebrae, and only reached above the level of the centrum with the front third of their length. The post-zygapophyses reached over the level of the centrum with the back half of their length. Back vertebrae are not useful for distinguishing between elasmosaurids, since they are not diagnostic at the genus level. Elasmosaurus had four sacral vertebrae (the fused vertebrae that form the sacrum connected to the pelvis), a number typical of elasmosaurids. The transverse processes here were very short, and the rib facets increased in size from the first to the fourth sacral vertebra. A ridge ran along the top of these vertebrae, and the lower sides of the centra were rounded, and bore pairs of nutritive foramina, separated by low ridges. The first tail (or caudal) vertebra could be distinguished by the preceding sacral vertebra by having smaller rib facets, and by being positioned in the lower half of the centrum. These vertebrae were almost circular in shape, and the first two bore a narrow keel in the middle of the upper side. The rib facets of the tail vertebrae were located on the lower side of the centra, and their oval shape became larger and broader from the third vertebra and onwards, but became smaller from the 14th vertebra. Here, the pre-zygapophyses also reached over the level of the centra for most of their length, while the post-zygapophyses reached over this level by half their length. The lower part of the centra were rounded from the first to the third tail vertebrae, but concave from the fourth to the 18th. The usual number of trail vertebrae in elasmosaurids is 30. Since the last tail-vertebrae of elasmosaurids were fused into a structure similar to the pygostyle of birds, it is possible this supported a tail-fin, but the shape it would have had is unknown. Formerly assigned species Reconstructed E. platyurus skeleton, Milwaukee Public Museum Following the description of the type species, E. platyurus, a number of other Elasmosaurus species were described by Cope, Williston, and other authors. However, none of these species are still definitely referable to the genus Elasmosaurus today, and most of them either have been moved to genera of their own or are considered dubious names, nomina dubiathat is, with no distinguishing features, and therefore of questionable validity. Cope's outdated 1869 restoration of fossil reptiles from New Jersey, including a short-necked E.orientalis confronting a Dryptosaurus Accompanying his 1869 description of E. platyurus, Cope named another species of Elasmosaurus, E.orientalis, based on two dorsal vertebrae from New Jersey. He distinguished E.orientalis from E.platyurus by the more strongly developed processes known as parapophyses on the vertebrae, in which he considered it to approach closer to Cimoliasaurus; however, he still assigned it to Elasmosaurus on account of its large size and angled sides. The first of these vertebrae was used as a doorstop in a tailor's shop, whereas the other was found in a pit by Samuel Lockwood, a superintendent. Cope gave the name orientalis to the new species, on account of it possibly having a more easterly distribution than E.platyurus. Leidy subsequently moved E.orientalis to the now dubious genus Discosaurus in the following year. In 1952 Welles considered the species a nomen dubium, given how fragmentary it was. In 1869 Cope also published an article about the fossil reptiles of New Jersey, wherein he described E.orientalis as an animal with a \\"long neck\\". Yet, in an accompanying illustration Cope showed a short- necked Elasmosaurus confronting a Dryptosaurus (then Laelaps), with a plesiosaur-like Mosasaurus and other animals in the background. According to Davidson, it is uncertain which species of Elasmosaurus is depicted, but if it is E.orientalis, the short neck contradicts Cope's own text, and if E.platyurus, he showed the animal with a short neck after acknowledging this was incorrect. Davidson has suggested that even though Leidy had pointed out Cope's error in 1868, Cope may not have accepted this. In an 1870 reply to Leidy, Cope himself stated that the generic placement of E.orientalis was in doubt, and that he had illustrated it with a short neck due to believing this was the condition of Cimoliasaurus. If more remains showed E.orientalis to have had a long neck like Elasmosaurus, he stated the image may instead represent Cimoliasaurus better. Vertebra of Plesiosaurus constrictus, which Cope assigned to Elasmosaurus In the same 1869 publication wherein he named E. platyurus and E.orientalis, Cope assigned an additional species, E.constrictus, based on a partial centrum from a neck vertebra found in the Turonian-aged clay deposits at Steyning, Sussex, in the United Kingdom. It was described by the British paleontologist Richard Owen as Plesiosaurus constrictus in 1850; Owen named the species after the extremely narrow breadth of the vertebra between the pleurapophyses, or the processes that articulate between the ribs. He considered this to be partially an artifact of preservation, but could not understand how the compression affected only the central portion and not the articular ends of the centrum. Cope recognized this as a natural condition, and considered constrictus to be \\"a species of Elasmosaurus or an ally\\". In 1962 Welles considered P.constrictus to be a nomen dubium, given its fragmentary nature. Per Ove Persson retained it as valid in 1963, noting the longitudinal ridge on the sides of the centra as an elasmosaurid trait. In 1995 Nathalie Bardet and Pascal Godefroit also recognized it as an elasmosaurid, albeit indeterminate. Pectoral girdle and front paddles of a juvenile elasmosaurid originally assigned to E.serpentinus Cope discovered another elasmosaurid skeleton in 1876. He named it as a new species, E.serpentinus, in 1877, and differentiated it by the lack of compression in the rear neck vertebrae, the presence of few sessile ribs among the first few dorsals, and the presence of \\"weak angles\\" below the front tail vertebrae. Cope had also discovered another large skeleton that bore great resemblance to the known remains of E.orientalis from the black shale of the \\"Cretaceous bed No.4\\"; he excavated it with the help of George B. Cledenning and Capt. Nicholas Buesen. In 1943 Welles removed E.serpentinus from Elasmosaurus, and placed it in a new genus, Hydralmosaurus. Subsequently, all Hydralmosaurus specimens were moved to Styxosaurus in 2016, rendering the former a nomen dubium. Williston published a figure of another E. serpentinus specimen in 1914; Elmer Riggs formally described it in 1939. Welles moved this specimen to the new genus and species Alzadasaurus riggsi in 1943. Kenneth Carpenter reassigned it to Thalassomedon haningtoni in 1999; Sachs, Johan Lindgren, and Benjamin Kear noted that the remains represented a juvenile and were significantly distorted, and preferred to retain it as a nomen dubium in 2016. Subsequently, a series of 19 neck and back vertebrae from the Big Bend region of the Missouripart of the Pierre Shale formationwere found by John H. Charles. Cope, upon receiving the bones at the Academy of Natural Sciences, considered them yet another species of Elasmosaurus. The vertebrae were, according to Cope, the shortest among members of the genus (approaching Cimoliasaurus in this condition), but he still considered them as belonging to Elasmosaurus due to their compressed form. He named it E.intermedius in 1894. However, in his 1906 revision of North American plesiosaurs, Williston regarded the vertebrae as \\"all more or less mutilated\\", and found no distinct differences between the remains of E.intermedius and E.platyurus. In 1952 Welles opined that, if E.intermedius was valid, \\"it must be referred to a pliosaurian genus\\"; however, he proceeded to label it a nomen dubium in 1962. Three shorter vertebrae found alongside E.intermedius, assigned by Cope to the new genus and species Embaphias circulosus, were also considered by Welles to be a nomen dubium in 1962. Williston named a number of other new Elasmosaurus species in his 1906 revision. In 1874 he and Mudge discovered a specimen in Plum Creek, Kansas. While he initially assigned it in 1890 to a new species of Cimoliasaurus, C.snowii, he subsequently recognized the elasmosaurid nature of its humerus and coracoids. Thus, he renamed the species E.snowii. A second specimen, discovered by Elias West in 1890, was also assigned by him to E.snowii. In 1943 Welles moved E.snowii to its own genus, Styxosaurus, where the species has remained. However, the West specimen was assigned to Thalassiosaurus ischiadicus (see below) by Welles in 1952; Carpenter returned it to S.snowii in 1999. Williston also reassigned the species E.ischiadicus from the genus Polycotylus, where he had initially placed it when he named it in 1903. The type remains were discovered by him in the same 1874 expedition with Mudge. Williston assigned another specimen discovered by Mudge and H.A. Brous in 1876. In 1943 both specimens were assigned to the new genus Thalassiosaurus by Welles, who then assigned the latter to the new genus and species Alzadasaurus kansasensis in 1952. Glenn Storrs considered both to be indeterminate elasmosaurids in 1999; in the same year, Carpenter assigned both to Styxosaurus snowii. Remains of E. nobilis (now Styxosaurus snowii) An elasmosaurid specimen was found by Handel Martin in Logan County, Kansas in 1889. Williston named this as a new species, E.(?)marshii. He bore reservations about its referral to the genus, and he recognized that it possibly pertained to another genus. In 1943 Welles moved E.(?)marshii to a genus of its own, Thalassonomosaurus; however, Carpenter sunk T.marshii into Styxosaurus snowii in 1999. Another species, E.nobilis, was named by Williston from very large remains discovered by Mudge in 1874 in Jewell County, Kansas. Welles named E.nobilis as a species of Thalassonomosaurus, T.nobilis, in 1943, but it too was considered to be part of S.snowii by Carpenter. Finally, two exceptionally large dorsal vertebrae collected by Charles Sternberg in 1895 were named E.sternbergii by Williston, but were considered indeterminate by Storrs. Williston mentioned three additional Elasmosaurus species, which he would figure and describe at a later date. He again made reference to a new species of Elasmosaurus, from Kansas, in 1908. Several Russian species, based on poorly preserved vertebral remains, were assigned to Elasmosaurus by N.N. Bogolubov in 1911. One was E.helmerseni, which was first described by W.Kiprijanoff in 1882 from Maloje Serdoba, Saratov, as Plesiosaurus helmerseni. Some material from Scania, Sweden, was assigned to P. helmerseni in 1885 by H.Schr√∂der. Vertebral and limb remains from Kursk initially assigned by Kiprijanoff to P.helmerseni were also moved by Bogolubov to the new species E.kurskensis, which he considered to be \\"identical with Elasmosaurus or related to it\\". He also named E.orskensis, based on \\"very large\\" neck and tail vertebra remains from Konopljanka, Orenburg; and E.serdobensis, based on a single neck vertebra from Maloje Serdoba. However, the validity of all these species has been questioned. Welles considered E.kurskensis as an indeterminate plesiosaur in 1962. Persson noted in a 1959 review of the Swedish \\"E.\\"helmerseni material that, while the species was probably closely related to Elasmosaurus proper, it was too fragmentary for this hypothesis to be assessed; he later remarked in 1963 that, regarding the latter three species, \\"their generic and specific definition is questionable\\", although he declined to specifically label them as invalid on account of not having seen the fossil material. Similarly, in 1999, Evgeniy Pervushov, Maxim Arkhangelsky, and A.V. Ivanov considered E.helmerseni to be an indeterminate elasmosaurid. In 2000 Storrs, Archangelsky, and Vladimir Efimov concurred with Welles on E.kurskensis, and labelled E.orskensis and E.serdobensis as indeterminate elasmosaurids. Two additional Russian species were described by subsequent authors. A.N. Riabinin described a single phalanx from a flipper in 1915 as E.(?)sachalinensis; the species was named after the island of Sakhalin, where N.N. Tikhonovich found it in 1909. However, this specimen cannot be identified more specifically than an indeterminate elasmosaurid, which was followed by Persson and Pervushov and colleagues. Storrs, Arkhangelsky, and Efimov were less specific, labelling it as an indeterminate plesiosaur; this classification was followed by Alexander Averianov and V.K. Popov in 2005. Then, in 1916, P.A. Pravoslavlev named E.amalitskii from the Don River region, based on a specimen containing vertebrae, limb girdles, and limb bones. Persson considered it a valid species, and a relatively large member of the elasmosaurids; however, like E.(?)sachalinensis, Pervushov and colleagues considered E.amalitskii an indeterminate elasmosaurid. Mauisaurus haasti) In a 1918 review of the geographic distribution and evolution of Elasmosaurus, Pravoslavlev provisionally assigned three other previously named species to Elasmosaurus; his taxonomic opinions have not been widely followed. One of these was E.chilensis, based on the Chilean Plesiosaurus chilensis named from a single tail vertebra by Claude Gay in 1848. Wilhelm Deecke moved chilensis to Pliosaurus in 1895, a classification which was acknowledged by Pravoslavlev. Edwin Colbert later assigned the type vertebra in 1949 to a pliosauroid, and also assigned other assigned remains to indeterminate elasmosauroids; the type vertebra was recognized as potentially belonging to Aristonectes parvidens by Jos√© O'Gorman and colleagues in 2013. Another was E.haasti, originally Mauisaurus haasti, named by James Hector in 1874 based on remains found in New Zealand. Although its validity was supported for a considerable time, M.haasti is regarded as a nomen dubium as of 2017. Pravoslavlev recognized another species from New Zealand, E.hoodii, named by Owen in 1870 as Plesiosaurus hoodii based on a neck vertebra. Welles recognized it as a nomen dubium in 1962; Joan Wiffen and William Moisley concurred in a 1986 review of New Zealand plesiosaurs. In 1949 Welles named a new species of Elasmosaurus, E.morgani. It was named from a well-preserved skeleton found in Dallas County, Texas. However, part of the specimen was accidentally thrown out during the relocation of the Southern Methodist University's paleontological collections. Welles recognized E.morganis similarity to E.platyurus in its shoulder girdle, but maintained it as a separate species due to its shorter neck and more robust rear neck vertebrae. In 1997 Carpenter reconsidered the differences between the two species, and found them sufficient to place E.morgani in its own genus, which he named Libonectes. Despite its reassignment and the loss of its material, L.morgani is often considered an archetypal elasmosaurid. Data based on these lost elements were unquestionably accepted in subsequent phylogenetic analyses, until a redescription of the surviving elements was published by Sachs and Benjamin Kear in 2015. Persson assigned another species to Elasmosaurus alongside his 1959 description of \\"E.\\"helmerseni remains from Sweden, namely E.(?)gigas. It was based on Schr√∂der's Pliosaurus(?) gigas, named in 1885 from two dorsals; one was found in Prussia, the other in Scania. While they were incomplete, Persson recognized that their proportions and the shape of their articular ends differed greatly from pliosauroids, and instead agreed well with elasmosaurids. Given that, at the time of Persson's writing, \\"there [was] nothing to contradict that they are nearest akin to Elasmosaurus\\", he assigned them to Elasmosaurus \\"with hesitation\\". Theodor Wagner had previously assigned gigas to Plesiosaurus in 1914. As of 2013, this questionable attribution remains unchanged. Another species from Russia, E.antiquus, was named by Dubeikovskii and Ochev in 1967 from the Kamsko-Vyatsky phosphorite quarry, but Pervushov and colleagues in 1999, followed by Storrs and colleagues in 2000, reinterpreted it as an indeterminate elasmosaurid. Classification alt=Drawing of vertebrate on a white background Though Cope had originally recognized Elasmosaurus as a plesiosaur, in an 1869 paper he placed it, with Cimoliasaurus and Crymocetus, in a new order of sauropterygian reptiles. He named the group Streptosauria, or \\"reversed lizards\\", due to the orientation of their individual vertebrae supposedly being reversed compared to what is seen in other vertebrate animals. He subsequently abandoned this idea in his 1869 description of Elasmosaurus, where he stated he had based it on Leidy's erroneous interpretation of Cimoliasaurus. In this paper, he also named the new family Elasmosauridae, containing Elasmosaurus and Cimoliasaurus, without comment. Within this family, he considered the former to be distinguished by a longer neck with compressed vertebrae, and the latter by a shorter neck with square, depressed vertebrae. Outdated restoration of two individuals with curled, snake-like necks, by alt=Old paleoart of two elasmosaurs with inaccurately curled necks. One is in the foreground with a fish in its mouth and the another chasing fish in background. In subsequent years, Elasmosauridae came to be one of three groups in which plesiosaurs were classified, the others being the Pliosauridae and Plesiosauridae (sometimes merged into one group). Charles Andrews elaborated on differences between elasmosaurids and pliosaurids in 1910 and 1913. He characterized elasmosaurids by their long necks and small heads, as well as by their rigid and well- developed scapulae (but atrophied or absent clavicles and interclavicles) for forelimb-driven locomotion. Meanwhile, pliosaurids had short necks but large heads, and used hindlimb-driven locomotion. Although the placement of Elasmosaurus in the Elasmosauridae remained uncontroversial, opinions on the relationships of the family became variable over subsequent decades. Williston created a revised taxonomy of plesiosaurs in 1925. In 1940 Theodore White published a hypothesis on the interrelationships between different plesiosaurian families. He considered Elasmosauridae to be closest to the Pliosauridae, noting their relatively narrow coracoids as well as their lack of interclavicles or clavicles. His diagnosis of the Elasmosauridae also noted the moderate length of the skull (i.e., a mesocephalic skull); the neck ribs having one or two heads; the scapula and coracoid contacting at the midline; the blunted rear outer angle of the coracoid; and the pair of openings (fenestrae) in the scapula‚Äìcoracoid complex being separated by a narrower bar of bone compared to pliosaurids. The cited variability in the number of heads on the neck ribs arises from his inclusion of Simolestes to the Elasmosauridae, since the characteristics of \\"both the skull and shoulder girdle compare more favorably with Elasmosaurus than with Pliosaurus or Peloneustes.\\" He considered Simolestes a possible ancestor of Elasmosaurus. Oskar Kuhn adopted a similar classification in 1961. Reconstructed skeleton, Centennial Centre for Interdisciplinary Science Welles took issue with White's classification in his 1943 revision of plesiosaurs, noting that White's characteristics are influenced by both preservation and ontogeny. He divided plesiosaurs into two superfamilies, the Plesiosauroidea and Pliosauroidea, based on neck length, head size, ischium length, and the slenderness of the humerus and femur (the propodialia). Each superfamily was further subdivided by the number of heads on the ribs, and the proportions of the epipodialia. Thus, elasmosaurids had long necks, small heads, short ischia, stocky propodialia, single-headed ribs, and short epipodialia. Pierre deSaint-Seine in 1955 and Alfred Romer in 1956 both adopted Welles' classification. In 1962 Welles further subdivided elasmosaurids based on whether they possessed pelvic bars formed from the fusion of the ischia, with Elasmosaurus and Brancasaurus being united in the subfamily Elasmosaurinae by their sharing of completely closed pelvic bars. Carpenter's 1997 phylogenetic analysis of plesiosaurs challenged the traditional subdivision of plesiosaurs based on neck length. While polycotylids had previously been part of the Pliosauroidea, Carpenter moved polycotylids to become the sister group of the elasmosaurids based on similarities, thus implying that polycotylids and pliosauroids evolved their short necks independently. The content of Elasmosauridae also received greater scrutiny. Since its initial assignment to the Elasmosauridae, the relationships of Brancasaurus had been considered well supported, and an elasmosaurid position was recovered by O'Keefe's 2004 analysis and Franziska Gro√ümann's 2007 analysis. However, Ketchum and Benson's analysis instead included it in the Leptocleidia, and its inclusion in that group has remained consistent in subsequent analyses. Their analysis also moved Muraenosaurus to the Cryptoclididae, and Microcleidus and Occitanosaurus to the Plesiosauridae; Benson and Druckenmiller isolated the latter two in the group Microcleididae in 2014, and considered Occitanosaurus a species of Microcleidus. These genera had all previously been considered to be elasmosaurids by Carpenter, Gro√ümann, and other researchers. Within the Elasmosauridae, Elasmosaurus itself has been considered a \\"wildcard taxon\\" with highly variable relationships. Carpenter's 1999 analysis suggested that Elasmosaurus was more basal (i.e. less specialized) than other elasmosaurids with the exception of Libonectes. In 2005 Sachs suggested that Elasmosaurus was closely related to Styxosaurus, and in 2008 Druckenmiller and Russell placed it as part of a polytomy with two groups, one containing Libonectes and Terminonatator, the other containing Callawayasaurus and Hydrotherosaurus. Ketchum and Benson's 2010 analysis included Elasmosaurus in the former group. Benson and Druckenmiller's 2013 analysis (below, left) further removed Terminonatator from this group and placed it as one step more derived. In Rodrigo Otero's 2016 analysis based on a modification of the same dataset (below, right), Elamosaurus was the closest relative of Albertonectes, forming the Styxosaurinae with Styxosaurus and Terminonatator. Danielle Serratos, Druckenmiller, and Benson could not resolve the position of Elasmosaurus in 2017, but they noted that Styxosaurinae would be a synonym of Elasmosaurinae if Elasmosaurus did fall within the group. In 2020, O'Gorman formally synonymized Styxosaurinae with Elasmosaurinae based on the inclusion of Elasmosaurus within the group, and also provided a list of diagnostic characteristics for the clade. alt=Photo of vertebrate on a white background Topology A: Benson et al. (2013) Topology B: Otero (2016), with clade names following O'Gorman (2020) Paleobiology alt=Drawing of two greenish elasmosaurs underwater with a blue background. Elasmosaurids were fully adapted to life in the ocean, with streamlined bodies and long paddles that indicate they were active swimmers. The unusual body structure of elasmosaurids would have limited the speed at which they could swim, and their paddles may have moved in a manner similar to the movement of oars rowing, and due to this, could not twist and were thus held rigidly. Plesiosaurs were even believed to have been able to maintain a constant and high body temperature (homeothermy), allowing for sustained swimming. A 2015 study concluded that locomotion was mostly done by the fore-flippers while the hind-flippers functioned in maneuverability and stability; a 2017 study concluded that the hind-flippers of plesiosaurs produced 60% more thrust and had 40% more efficiency when moving in harmony with the fore-flippers. The paddles of plesiosaurs were so rigid and specialized for swimming that they could not have come on land to lay eggs like sea turtles. Therefore, they probably gave live-birth (viviparity) to their young like sea snakes. Evidence for live- birth in plesiosaurs is provided by the fossil of an adult Polycotylus with a single fetus inside. =Neck movement and function= Williston, 1914alt=Old inaccurate drawing of elasmosaur raising its neck from ocean with pterosaurs, mosasaurs, swimming birds, and other elasmosaurs and a cliff in foreground and background Cope, in 1869, compared the build and habits of Elasmosaurus with those of a snake. Although he suggested that the vertebral column of the trunk did not allow for much vertical movement due to the elongated neural spines which nearly form a continuous line with little space between adjacent vertebrae, he envisaged the neck and tail to have been much more flexible: \\"The snake-like head was raised high in the air, or depressed at the will of the animal, now arched swan-like preparatory to a plunge after a fish, now stretched in repose on the water or deflexed in exploring the depths below\\". Although followed by many common media depictions, more recent research showed that Elasmosaurus was incapable of raising anything more than its head above the water. The weight of its long neck placed the center of gravity behind the front flippers. Thus, Elasmosaurus could have raised its head and neck above the water only when in shallow water, where it could rest its body on the bottom. Also, the weight of the neck, the limited musculature, and the limited movement between the vertebrae would have prevented Elasmosaurus from raising its head and neck very high. The head and shoulders of the Elasmosaurus probably acted as a rudder. If the animal moved the anterior part of the body in a certain direction, it would cause the rest of the body to move in that direction. Thus, Elasmosaurus would have been unable to swim in one direction while moving its head and neck either horizontally or vertically in a different direction. alt=Five gray silhouettes of elasmosaurs in different neck positions on a white background One study found that the necks of elasmosaurids were capable of 75‚Äì177Àö of ventral movement, 87‚Äì155¬∞ of dorsal movement, and 94‚Äì176¬∞ of lateral movement, depending on the amount of tissue between the vertebrae, which probably increased in rigidness towards the back of the neck. The researchers concluded that lateral and vertical arches and shallow S-shaped curves were feasible in contrast to the \\"swan-like\\" S-shape neck postures that required more than 360¬∞ of vertical flexion. The exact function of the neck of elasmosaurids is unknown, though it may have been important for hunting. It has also been suggested that the long necks of plesiosaurs served as a snorkel and allowed them to breathe air while the body remained underwater. This is disputed as there would be large hydrostatic pressure differences, particularly for the extremely long-necked elasmosaurids. The neck anatomy of elasmosaurids was capable of making a gentle slope to allow them to breathe at the surface but would have required them to engage in energy-expensive swimming at the sub-surface. In addition, the longer neck would also have increased dead space, and the animals may have required larger lungs. The neck could have had other vulnerabilities, for example being a target for predators. Simulation of water flow on 3D models showed that more elongated necks, such as those of elasmosaurids, did not increase drag force while swimming compared to shorter necked plesiosaurs. On the other hand, bending the neck sideways did increase drag force, more so in forms with very long necks. =Feeding= alt=Old picture of bones and stones on a black background In 1869 Cope noted that scales and teeth of six species of fish had been discovered directly beneath the vertebrae of the Elasmosaurus holotype, and theorized that these fish would have had formed the diet of the animal. From these remains, Cope named a new species of barracuda, Sphyraena carinata. The flexion ranges of Elasmosaurus necks would have allowed the animal to employ a number of hunting methods including \\"benthic grazing\\", which would have involved swimming close to the bottom and using the head and neck to dig for prey on the sea floor. Elasmosaurids may also have been active hunters in the pelagic zone, retracting their necks to launch a strike or using side-swipe motions to stun or kill prey with their laterally projected teeth (like sawsharks). It is possible that Elasmosaurus and its kin stalked schools of fish, concealing themselves below and moving the head slowly up as they approached. The eyes of the animal were at the top of the head and allowed them to see directly upward. This stereoscopic vision would have helped it to find small prey. Hunting from below would also have been possible, with prey silhouetted in the sunlight while concealed in the dark waters below. Elasmosaurids probably ate small bony fish and marine invertebrates, as their small, non-kinetic skulls would have limited the size of the prey they could eat. Also, with their long, slender teeth adapted for seizing prey and not tearing, elasmosaurids most certainly swallowed their prey whole. Although elasmosaurids are commonly found with several gastroliths, Elamosaurus has only been found uncontroversially with a pebble lodged in the neural arch of one of its hindmost tail-vertebrae. A specimen of the closely related Styxosaurus contained fragmented fish bones and stones in the abdominal region behind the pectoral girdle. The fish remains were identified as Enchodus and other clupeomorph fish. The stones match rock from away from where the specimen was found. Several different functions have been proposed for gastroliths, including aiding in digestion, mixing food content, mineral supplementation, and storage and buoyancy control. Elasmosaurid remains provide some evidence they were preyed upon. A humerus of an unidentified subadult elasmosaurid was found with bite marks matching the teeth of the shark Cretoxyrhina, while a crushed Woolungasaurus skull has tooth-marks matched to the pliosaur Kronosaurus. Paleoecology alt=Diagram of a tan colored North America, with blue coloring in the middle of the continent representing an ancient sea. Elasmosaurus is known from the Sharon Springs Member of the Campanian-age Upper Cretaceous Pierre Shale formation of western Kansas, which dates to about 80.5million years ago. The Pierre Shale represents a period of marine deposition from the Western Interior Seaway, a shallow continental sea that submerged much of central North America during the Cretaceous. At its largest, the Western Interior Seaway stretched from the Rockies east to the Appalachians, some wide. At its deepest, it may have been only deep. Two great continental watersheds drained into it from east and west, diluting its waters and bringing resources in eroded silt that formed shifting river delta systems along its low-lying coasts. There was little sedimentation on the eastern margin of the Seaway; the western margin accumulated a thick pile of sediments eroded from the western land mass. The western shore was thus highly variable, depending on variations in sea level and sediment supply. The soft, muddy sea floor probably received very little sunlight, but it teemed with life due to steady rains of organic debris from plankton and other organisms farther up the water column. The bottom was dominated by large Inoceramus clams, which were covered with oysters; there was little biodiversity. Clam shells would have accumulated over the centuries in layers under the sea floor's surface, and would have provided shelter for small fish. Other invertebrates known to have lived in this sea include various species of rudists, crinoids and cephalopods (including squids and ammonites). Large fish known to have inhabited the sea include the bony fishes Pachyrhizodus, Enchodus, Cimolichthys, Saurocephalus, Saurodon, Gillicus, Ichthyodectes, Xiphactinus, Protosphyraena and Martinichthys; and the sharks Cretoxyrhina, Cretolamna, Scapanorhynchus, Pseudocorax and Squalicorax. In addition to Elasmosaurus, other marine reptiles present include fellow plesiosaurs Libonectes, Styxosaurus, Thalassomedon, Terminonatator, Polycotylus, Brachauchenius, Dolichorhynchops and Trinacromerum; the mosasaurs Mosasaurus, Halisaurus, Prognathodon, Tylosaurus, Ectenosaurus, Globidens, Clidastes, Platecarpus and Plioplatecarpus; and the sea turtles Archelon, Protostega, Porthochelys and Toxochelys. The flightless aquatic bird Hesperornis also made its home there. The pterosaurs Pteranodon and Nyctosaurus, and the bird Ichthyornis, are also known far from land.

It is a coat of arms of noble families that fought in the same military unit using battle cry Hostoja or Ostoja, and that applied their ancient heritage on the Coat of Arms, forming a Clan of knights. Later, when the Clan expanded their territory to Pomerania, Prussia, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania they also adopted a few noble families of Ruthenian origin that in 14-15th century settled down in Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine, finally turning into the Clan of Ostoja. As different lines of the clan formed surnames after their properties and adding the adoptions, Ostoja was also recognized as CoA of several families that was not necessary connected to the original Clan, forming Heraldic clan.Seweryn Uruski: Rodzina.

This family moved at that time to the land occupied by Teutonic Knights. In time this family became prominent. It is not known who decided to call this coat of arms Ostoja Pruska but it is a significant example of breaking every possible heraldic rule in the name of Polish clan tradition where clan members used same coat of arms. It seems that this coat of arms was added to Ostoja almost by force. There are two families that where part of the Clan of Ostoja in the 14th century according to the records of Teutonic Knights, they lived in Pomerania and that have been given this coat of arms by all publications - the families of Lniski and Skrzyszewski vel Skrzeszewski. Here it is notable that the Skrzyszewski vel Skrzeszewski line in the 18th century suddenly changed their name to Lniski. It is not known if there is any blood relation between those families around the 14th century.

The economy is mainly based on textile manufacturing, food processing and machine industry. After Plauen and Reichenbach, Auerbach is the third most populous town in the Vogtlandkreis. Auerbach was mentioned for the first time in 1282. The town is situated at the declivities above the river G√∂ltzsch at the foot of a castle tower from the 12th century. Landmarks include the towers of the St. Laurentius church, the Catholic Zum Heiligen Kreuz church and the tower of the castle. The three tall buildings give Auerbach its nickname ‚Äúthe Three Towers Town‚Äù.

He is introduced as a member of Congress from Colorado, and succeeds to the vice presidency after President Bartlet nominates him following the resignation of incumbent John Hoynes. Personal background A Democratic Representative from Colorado at the time of his appointment, Russell was initially derided by some of the senior West Wing staff as mediocre, shallow, and a tool of Colorado mining interests. Russell's dismissive nickname around Washington was \\"Bingo Bob\\", and he was often referred to as \\"the Congressman from the Western Colorado Mining Company\\". Russell served on the House Energy Committee with future Speaker Jeff Haffley.http://www.joshlyman.com/vault/5-08-s.html Russell claims that he wears cowboy boots because of flat feet but Josh Lyman suggests that it's a transparent attempt to appear \\"folksy\\". Once confirmed as Vice President, Russell soon established himself as an ambitious and shrewd politician with a wry awareness of his own shortcomings. Russell often used self-deprecating humor to try to get past his dullness, such as stating, \\"Bob Russell is so dull his Secret Service codename is Bob Russell.\\" (A nod to real life Vice President Al Gore; for years he used the line \\"Al Gore is so boring his Secret Service codename is 'Al Gore.'\\") Nomination After the resignation of Vice President John Hoynes due to a sex scandal in May 2003, the Bartlet Administration was required to nominate a replacement, in accordance with the provisions of the 25th Amendment. President Jed Bartlet's first choice was Lewis Berryhill, his Secretary of State, played by William Devane. However, Berryhill's nomination was opposed by House and Senate Republicans, along with more than a few Democrats, most notably the Senate Minority Leader. With a great deal of reluctance, Bartlet nominated Bob Russell, whom he selected after Congressional Republicans, who were in the majority, made it clear that they would not confirm a more viable candidate‚Äîone who could conceivably win the upcoming election to choose Bartlet's successor. Bartlet decided that Russell's was the least objectionable name on the list provided by Speaker of the House Jeff Haffley, which included several even more politically unappealing individuals. Nomination speech After Bartlet informs his staff of his intention to appoint Russell, Toby Ziegler and Will Bailey attempt to prepare Bartlet's announcement speech, which he intends to deliver at a White House Rose Garden press conference. Since Will and Toby regard Russell as a nonentity, they have difficulty preparing proper remarks. As an inside joke to start their creative process, they write the speech they wish Bartlet could give: *Toby: Here's what it should be. In a triumph of the middling, a nod to mediocrity, and with gorge rising, it gives me great nausea to announce Robert Russell - Bingo Bob himself - as your new Vice President. *Will: This lapdog of mining interests is as dull as he is unremarkable. *Toby: As lackluster as he is soporific... *Will: Good. *Toby: This reversion to the mean... *Will: This rebuke to the exemplary... *Toby: Gives hope to the millions unfavored by the exceptional... *Will: Yes. *Toby: The Vice Presidency, being famously once described as not being worth a warm bucket of spit; let's now hock a big loogie for Bob Russell. Not the worst. Not the best. Just what we're stuck with. *Will: Amen. Toby and Will later complete a speech appropriate to the occasion. When Bartlet and Russell begin the press conference, Bartlet realizes that the joke speech has been mistakenly loaded into the Teleprompter; Russell senses Bartlet's momentary hesitation at the start of his speech, leans over to view the Teleprompter, and also realizes what has happened. Bartlet then ad libs a nomination speech of his own and introduces Russell. Following the press conference, Russell confronts Will and Toby, who apologize and are prepared to be reprimanded or fired. Instead, Russell tells them their joke speech was hilarious and asks for a copy. He goes on to tell them that he is well aware of his own reputation, but since he is now a member of Bartlet's team, it's incumbent on them to help rehabilitate his image. Presidential candidacy In the political primary season, he vied with Hoynes and U.S. Representative Matt Santos of Texas for the Democratic presidential nomination during the 2006 election. After a strong early start as the presumptive Democratic nominee, Russell lost the crucial California Democratic primary, and several later primaries, to Santos. Russell offered Santos and then Pennsylvania Gov. Eric Baker the opportunity to be his running mate, but both declined. After several deadlocked ballots at the Democratic National Convention and a rousing speech from Santos, President Bartlet threw his support to Santos, as did a key teachers' union leader, which secured the nomination for Santos, with former White House Chief of Staff Leo McGarry as his running mate. Russell's chief of staff and later campaign manager was Will Bailey. Donna Moss also joined his campaign staff, eventually rising to become press secretary. Bailey later became White House Communications Director following the dismissal of Toby Ziegler for a national security violation, while Moss moved over to the Santos campaign. Campaigns for Santos Late in the presidential campaign, Santos became frustrated with Russell's apparent unwillingness to campaign for him. But Russell did eventually campaign for Santos in his own home state of Colorado, a state which was subsequently carried by Santos in the election. Russell offered to continue as Vice President to Santos, after Democratic vice presidential nominee Leo McGarry died on the night of the presidential election, but Santos tactfully declined the offer. Bob Russell is last seen at the Bartlett staff goodbye party commenting to Will Bailey that McGarry's recent death had caused him to reflect on his own mortality. Background and views Before ascending to the Vice Presidency, Russell represented a Congressional district in Western Colorado. He justified his close relationship with the local mining interests because the local mining company, West Co, employed five times as many of his constituents as any other company in the district, but was attacked in the 2006 Democratic primaries by the Hoynes campaign and Common Cause for his support of mining interests. Russell also had an in-depth knowledge of nuclear weapons technology, because the Colorado Plateau is the US's leading source of uranium, and was able to assist in the Bartlet Administration's efforts to discover which nation carried out a nuclear test in the Indian Ocean. Bartlet said that Russell's voters had re-elected him four times, which indicates that he is a fifth term congressman and was probably first elected in 1994. This was confirmed when it was stated that Russell had voted to renew the embargo on Cuba in 1996, meaning he would have been first elected in 1994. As Vice President, Russell was often used by the Bartlet Administration to work with the Republicans during disputes, due to his relationships and relative popularity with Republican leaders such as Speaker Haffley. On such issues, Russell would sometimes disagree with the Bartlet Administration, including during the government shutdown, the Gaza Crisis and on gay marriage during another budget dispute. Russell's position on gay marriage was that while gay rights were advancing gradually, pushing for marriage rights too quickly would cause a backlash, so he was inclined to oppose the amendment. As a Congressman, Russell also had a strong reputation for his opposition to flag burning, co-sponsoring the Flag Burning Amendment every time it came before Congress, and strongly considered speaking out when a flag was apparently burnt in the White House. During the primaries, Russell campaigned on his support for ethanol fuel and abortion rights. Russell also supported gun control, attacking rival John Hoynes for his strong pro-gun record, although Russell was also an avid hunter who often hunted with the Governor of Montana. When the California legislature passed a law to not allow illegal immigrants driver's licenses, Russell came out in favor of it. When US foreign policy in relation to Cuba became a campaign issue, Russell took a hardline stance, re- affirming his support for sanctions and saying he would not rule out military action in order to bring about democratic change there. Russell was popular in the West and Midwest and was able to win many states in those regions in the primaries, believing that he would also be able to do so in the general election against Arnold Vinick (with his prospective running mate, Baker, hopefully being able to secure Pennsylvania and the traditional blue states in the Northeast, thus winning the election).

For a catalysed reaction, the activation energy is lower. In chemistry, a reaction coordinate is an abstract one-dimensional coordinate which represents progress along a reaction pathway. It is usually a geometric parameter that changes during the conversion of one or more molecular entities. In molecular dynamics simulations, a reaction coordinate is called collective variable. These coordinates can sometimes represent a real coordinate system (such as bond length, bond angle...), although, for more complex reactions especially, this can be difficult (and non geometric parameters are used, e.g., bond order). Reaction coordinates are often plotted against free energy to demonstrate in some schematic form the potential energy profile (an intersection of a potential energy surface) associated to the reaction. In the formalism of transition-state theory the reaction coordinate is that coordinate in set of curvilinear coordinates obtained from the conventional ones for the reactants which, for each reaction step, leads smoothly from the configuration of the reactants through that of the transition state to the configuration of the products. The reaction coordinate is typically chosen to follow the path along the gradient (path of shallowest ascent/deepest descent) of potential energy from reactants to products. For example, in the homolytic dissociation of molecular hydrogen, an apt coordinate system to choose would be the coordinate corresponding to the bond length.

He was described as at one point being the \\"chief assassin\\" for the Cartel's leader Pablo Escobar. He was believed to be responsible for the deaths of an unknown number of people with official estimates ranging in the hundreds, US authorities currently link him to the deaths of more than 220 people, having supposedly murdered members of both his own organization the Medell√≠n Cartel and the rival Cali Cartel, as well as police officers and government officials. Colombian authorities connect him to the deaths of more than 40 police officers. Arrested in 1991, he is serving multiple life sentences in a US prison. He was the first person ever to be convicted under a 1956 Federal law that made bombing a civilian aircraft a crime and the 1986 terrorism statute that allows the trial of foreign citizens in the United States if at least one victim was an American citizen. Among his convicted crimes is the 1989 bombing of Avianca Flight 203, which killed 110 civilians. Early life Born in Medellin, Mu√±oz Mosquera's father was a police officer and his mother an evangelist. He was raised in the church. He is believed to have joined the Medell√≠n Cartel in 1978 at the age of twelve after being drawn into the gang by his brother Brance (also known as Tyson due to his resemblance to boxer Mike Tyson) before becoming a gunman in his teens. He was given the nickname \\"La Quica\\" (Colombian slang for \\"the fat girl\\") from a young age due to his resemblance to his great-aunt. He rose to become one of Pablo Escobar's highest ranking enforcers. However, Mu√±oz Mosquera has claimed that he joined the Colombian army as a teenager before leaving in 1986 and was jailed on \\"three or four\\" occasions on minor theft charges. In 1989, he was arrested and convicted of being one of the main conspirators in the assassination of New Liberalism founder Luis Carlos Gal√°n, a candidate in the Colombian presidential election set to be held in May 1990. Gal√°n was murdered by an unknown gunman as he took the stage at a political rally to deliver a campaign speech in Soacha. He was jailed in the capital city, Bogot√°, but escaped in April 1990 after paying more than $500,000 in bribes, the second time he had escaped from a Colombian prison. He was wanted in connection with the murder of over 40 police officers in Colombia after Pablo Escobar began offering a $4000 reward for the murder of any officer in Medell√≠n. Colombian authorities also believe that he was directly involved in the bombing at the headquarters of the Administrative Department of Security in December 1989 and a rocket attack on the US Embassy. He was also believed to run a training camp for teenage potential sicarios (hitmen) for the Cartel. He has two children. US arrest and subsequent legal actions In September 1991, Mu√±oz Mosquera travelled to the United States, landing in Miami before travelling to Los Angeles and New York. After federal agents received a tipoff from Colombia, on September 25, 1991, Mu√±oz Mosquera was arrested along with two other men while using a payphone in the Jackson Heights area of Queens, New York, for traveling with a fake passport. Officials stated that none of the men were armed and offered no resistance when challenged by officers. Mu√±oz Mosquera initially lied to agents, stating his name as Esteban Restrepo-Echavarria, before his identity was confirmed by fingerprint records provided by Colombian officials. He was presumed to have travelled to the United States on an assassination mission and was held without bail as a result. One of his suspected targets was believed to be Max Mermelstein, a former drug smuggler who had worked for Escobar but had entered witness protection and was expected to implicate Escobar in the murder of Barry Seal. He was convicted one month later of lying to a federal officer and possessing a fake passport and sentenced to the maximum term of six years in jail. While he was in jail, federal prosecutors claimed that he was a major player in the Medell√≠n Cartel and was responsible for the bombing of Avianca Flight 203 on the orders of Pablo Escobar. On 27 November 1989, the flight took off from El Dorado International Airport in Bogot√° bound for Alfonso Bonilla Arag√≥n International Airport in Cali but exploded in mid air minutes after take off, killing all 101 passengers and 6 crew members. Although the bombing had occurred in Colombia, he was eligible to be tried by the United States as two passengers on the flight, Carlos Andres Escob√≠ and Astrid del Pilar G√≥mez, were American citizens. Mu√±oz Mosquera was charged with \\"conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine, substantive importation of cocaine, participating and conspiring to participate in a racketeering enterprise, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, various offenses relating to the bombing of a civilian airliner and the extraterritorial murder of two citizens of the United States\\". His first trial in 1994 lasted two months but was declared a mistrial after the jury were unable to reach verdict. In his second trial, in the same year, he was convicted on all thirteen counts and sentenced to 10 life sentences plus 45 years, all to be served consecutively. He became the first person ever to be convicted under a 1956 Federal law that made bombing a civilian aircraft a crime and the 1986 terrorism statute that allows the trial of foreign citizens in the United States if at least one victim was an American citizen. Before sentencing, Judge Sterling Johnson Jr. commented \\"Not only are you an evil man, but the things you did, you enjoyed doing.\\" Johnson also stated his belief that Mu√±oz Mosquera was fortunate that the prosecution had not sought the death penalty as \\"these acts cry out for the death penalty.\\" Following his conviction, he became one of the first inmates housed at ADX Florence, a supermax prison in Colorado. He is currently incarcerated at United States Penitentiary, Lee, in Virginia. While Mu√±oz Mosquera was convicted of the Avianca bombing, his involvement in the bombing was questioned by Colombian Attorney General Gustavo de Greiff, who sent a letter to Judge Sterling Johnson before the final trial, stating: De Greiff was accused by United States officials of being involved financially in the cocaine trade. The Colombian government initially suspected Gonzalo Rodr√≠guez Gacha a.k.a. \\"The Mexican\\". Carlos Mario Alzate had also been blamed for the bombing and had confessed to the crime before Mu√±oz Mosquera was put on trial. Many witnesses testified in court about Mu√±oz Mosquera's brutal acts as a high-ranking member of the Medell√≠n cartel. Many of those witnesses were convicted felons with links to the Medell√≠n and Cali Cartels. Mu√±oz Mosquera claims that he did not recognize the prosecution's witnesses, and his defense hinged on the insistence that he was a small-time thief and not even a sicario (contract killer), let alone Escobar's chief assassin. He did not deny that his brother Brance, known as \\"Tyson\\", later shot dead by Colombian forces, was involved in the Cartel (some, such as the anonymous informant whose tip led to Tyson's death, have claimed was the Medell√≠n \\"Chief of Security\\"). In popular culture *In the original Netflix series Narcos, Mu√±oz Mosquera is portrayed by Mexican actor Diego Cata√±o. *Rapper Nicki Minaj mentions \\"La Quica\\" in her 2016 hit Black Barbies. *In the 2012 Colombian television series Escobar, El Patr√≥n del Mal, Mu√±oz Mosquera is known by the alias \\"La Quica\\" and is portrayed by Manuel Viveros.

Headquartered principally in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and centered in the historic Harvard Yard, FAS is the only faculty responsible for both undergraduate and graduate education. FAS administers the courses offered at Harvard College, the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the Harvard Division of Continuing Education. It is headed by Dean Claudine Gay. As of Fall 2019, FAS comprised 1221 total faculty, including 719 tenured and tenure-track professors as well as 502 other professors, lecturers, preceptors, and visiting faculty in some 30 academic departments in the arts and humanities, the social sciences, the natural sciences, and the engineering and applied sciences. There are approximately 6,800 undergraduates (Harvard College) and 4,500 graduate students (Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences). The Harvard Division of Continuing Education welcomes more than 30,000 students annually in its open enrollment courses. In 2019, FAS had a budget of $1.6 billion and a revenue of $1.6 billion. As of 2019, the FAS endowment had a market value of $17.5 billion. Harvard's total endowment stands at $40.9 billion. Organization FAS consists of the following divisions: # Harvard College (established 1636) # The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) (established 1872) # The John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) (established 1847) # The Division of Continuing Education (DCE) (established 1871) *Commonly FAS is broken down only into the college, the GSAS, and the Extension School. This is because SEAS does not award degrees. Undergraduate concentrators as well as master's and doctoral students in the engineering and applied science departments instead receive their degrees from the College and the GSAS, respectively. In addition, FAS includes 35 research centers, institutes, and interdisciplinary programs, eleven museums, and numerous libraries. The dean of FAS serves as the chief administrative and academic officer, responsible to the president and provost of Harvard University for all aspects of the division's operations, including budgets, planning, support services, faculty appointments, curricula, student affairs, and fundraising. The dean is appointed by the president with the approval of the university's two governing boards, the Harvard Corporation and the Harvard Board of Overseers, and serves at the pleasure of the president. The dean of FAS is invariably drawn from the ranks of the tenured faculty in the division. The current dean, Claudine Gay, assumed the position in August 2018. The deans of Harvard College, GSAS, SEAS, and DCE report to the dean of FAS, as do various academic deans, administrative deans (including those responsible for finance, development, faculty personnel policy, undergraduate admissions and financial aid), and the directors of various research centers and institutes. History While Harvard College traces its origins to 1636, the body called the Faculty of Arts and Sciences only came into existence in the late nineteenth century. From 1820 until 1872, Harvard University consisted of the college and three professional schools (in law, medicine, and divinity). The governing boards established a Graduate Department in 1872 to administer and recommend candidates for the degrees of Master of Arts, Master of Science, Doctor of Philosophy, and Doctor of Science. In 1890, the governing boards merged separate faculties of the Lawrence Scientific School and the College into a single Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The Graduate Department later became the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. The Lawrence Scientific School opened in 1847 and marked Harvard's first major effort to offer a formal program in science and engineering. In 1948, the School merged with the Department of Engineering Sciences and Applied Physics in FAS to form the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences. In 2007, the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences formally became the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. On June 3, 2015, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences was renamed the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, following a $400 million gift by Harvard Business School alumnus John A. Paulson.

They were used in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, initially as a rulers' personal insignia, a state symbol, and later as a part of heraldic signs of leading aristocracy. During the period between World War I and World War II they were used by the Lithuanian Republic as a minor state symbol, e. g. on Litas coins and military equipment. Appearance The symbol appears in the following form: Horizontal line at bottom, vertical lines extend up at both ends. The Square at the middle of the horizontal line is about half as tall as the vertical lines. Another vertical line rises from the top center of the square, giving an overall appearance that is close to a trident. This form is the one usually seen in modern times, often drawn on walls and fences as protest against the Soviet occupation of Lithuania. It is notable that the ancient pre-Christian symbols of Lithuania did not follow the same strict rules of heraldry as their western counterparts. Thus this symbol was used in Or and argent, usually on the field gules, and was depicted in various shapes on flags, banners and shields. The Columns of Gediminas appears in the emblem of the Lithuanian land force, air force, navy, Military Police and National Defence Volunteer Forces. Name The name \\"Columns of Gediminas\\" was given in the 19th century by historian Teodor Narbutt, who supposed that the symbol was Gediminas' insignia. The more exact name of the symbol is the Pillars of Gediminids, since there is no direct evidence of its connection with Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas. History Engraving of Pillars of Gediminas on a stone on Rambynas hill According to the historical and archaeological evidence, the Columns were used by Grand Duke of Lithuania and Duke of Trakai Kƒôstutis. They appear on the Lithuanian coins issued by him. Peculiarities of earliest Lithuanian coins The symbol was also used by Vytautas as his personal insignia since 1397 and appeared on his seal and coins. Vilniaus ≈Ωemutinƒós pilies lobis ‚Äì XIV a. pabaigos valstybini≈≥ bei valdov≈≥ atribut≈≥ atspindys According to the accounts of Jan D≈Çugosz, it was derived from a symbol or brand used to mark horses and other property. The Columns were adopted by descendants of Kƒôstutis as their family symbol, equivalent to a coat of arms. Another user of the Columns of Gediminas was Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund Kƒôstutaitis. At first the Columns signified the family of Kƒôstutis, in contrast to the Vytis which was used by Algirdas' descendants. Later on, as a symbol of a ruling dynasty, it was adopted by Jagiellons and the two symbols became state symbols of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Columns of Gediminas are displayed on the left sleeve of Jogaila in one of his best-known portraits, painted by Jan Matejko, although Jogaila's personal insignia was a double cross. The Columns of Gediminas remained in use over the following centuries. After the annexation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union the symbol was officially banned. During the Singing Revolution in the late 80s, it became an important part of the icon of SƒÖj≈´dis, the reform movement. The Columns of Gediminas are featured on the Lithuanian Presidential award Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas, installed in 1928. The official logo of the EuroBasket 2011, that took place in Lithuania, is composed of the Columns overlaid on a basketball board.

Usually these books are written for a wide audience presumed to have a general education rather than a specifically scientific training, as opposed to the very narrow audience that a scientific paper would have, and are therefore referred to as popular science. As such, they require considerable talent on the part of the author to sufficiently explain difficult topics to people who are totally new to the subject, and a good blend of storytelling and technical writing.

It is preceded by The Summoner's Tale and followed by The Merchant's Tale. The Clerk of Oxenford (modern Oxford) is a student of what would nowadays be considered philosophy or theology. He tells the tale of Griselda, a young woman whose husband tests her loyalty in a series of cruel torments that recall the Biblical book of Job. Plot The Clerk's tale is about a marquis of Saluzzo in Piedmont in Italy named Walter, a bachelor who is asked by his subjects to marry to provide an heir. He assents and decides he will marry a peasant, named Griselda. Griselda is a poor girl, used to a life of pain and labour, who promises to honour Walter's wishes in all things. Griselda's child is kidnapped After Griselda has born him a daughter, Walter decides to test her loyalty. He sends an officer to take the baby, pretending it will be killed, but actually conveying it in secret to Bologna. Griselda, because of her promise, makes no protest at this but only asks that the child be buried properly. When she bears a son several years later, Walter again has him taken from her under identical circumstances. Finally, Walter determines one last test. He has a papal bull of annulment forged which enables him to leave Griselda, and informs her that he intends to remarry. As part of his deception, he employs Griselda to prepare the wedding for his new bride. Meanwhile, he has brought the children from Bologna, and he presents his daughter as his intended wife. Eventually he informs Griselda of the deceit, who is overcome by joy at seeing her children alive, and they live happily ever after. Prologue One of the characters created by Chaucer is the Oxford clerk, who is a student of philosophy. He is depicted as thin and impoverished, hard-working and wholly dedicated to his studies. The narrator claims that as a student in Italy he met Francis Petrarch at Padua from whom he heard the tale.The Clerks Tale, prologue, 26‚Äì32 Sources Modern illustration of the clerk, showing him wearing the garb of a medieval scholar The story of patient Griselda first appeared as the last chapter of Boccaccio's Decameron, and it is unclear what lesson the author wanted to convey. Critics suggest Boccaccio was simply putting down elements from the oral tradition, notably the popular topos of the ordeal, but the text was open enough to allow very misogynistic interpretations, giving Griselda's passivity as the norm for wifely conduct.The reception of Boccaccio's Griselda (French text) In 1374, it was translated into Latin by Petrarch, who quotes the heroine, Griselda, as an exemplum of that most feminine of virtues, constancy. Circa 1382‚Äì1389, Philippe de M√©zi√®res translated Petrarch's Latin text into French, adding a prologue which describes Griselda as an allegory of the Christian soul's unquestioning love for Jesus Christ. As far as Chaucer is concerned, critics think he used both Petrarch's and de M√©zi√®res's texts, while managing to recapture Bocaccio's opaque irony. Anne Middleton is one of many scholars to discuss the relationship between Petrarch's original and Chaucer's reworking of the tale. Middleton's article is discussed in, for instance, See also *English words first attested in Chaucer Footnotes  External links  * Read \\"The Clerk's Prologue and Tale\\" with interlinear translation *Modern translation of the Clerk's Tale and other resources at eChaucer Clerk's Tale ","title":"The Clerk's Tale"},{"id":"1264282","text":"Staryko≈Ñ (Polish for \\"Old Horse\\") is a Polish coat of arms.

After Syracuse lost the Third Sicilian War, the city of Messana was ceded to Carthage in 307 BC. When Agathocles died in 289 BC he left many of his mercenaries idle and unemployed in Sicily. Most of them returned home but some, liking the climate and the prospect of adventure on a foreign island, remained. They played a major role in the lead up to the First Punic War. In 280 BC, the Syracusans appealed to King Pyrrhus of Epirus for help against the Mamertines. Capture of Messana The then-small band of desperados came across the walled Greek settlement of Messana (now Messina). Messana was built on a strategic location on the north- eastern tip of Sicily on the strait between Sicily and Italy. Together with the fort Rhegium on the toe of Italy, it was the crossing point between Italy and Sicily. Being a peaceful people, the inhabitants allowed the travelling mercenaries into their homes. After a time, the mercenaries became restless and plotted to capture the town. One night, the mercenaries betrayed their hosts and killed most of the population, who were unprepared. In this way, they claimed Messana for themselves. The surviving Messanians were thrown out and the property and women divided. After their victory, the mercenaries named themselves the Mamertines after the Oscan war-god Mamers.Lendering, Jona. \\"Mamertines\\", Livius.org Dominion over north-eastern Sicily The Mamertines held the town of Messana for over 20 years.

Taking advantage of the peacefulness of the Sicilians, they looted the nearby settlements and captured unwary trade ships on the strait, carrying their plunder back to their base. They captured prisoners and demanded tribute. During this period, they struck coins on which their name were printed and placed images of their gods and goddesses. Their exploits made them rich and powerful. They began travelling further inland, even as far as Gela and demanded tribute. Decline The Mamertine presence did not go unchallenged forever. In around 270 BC, the Mamertine exploits came to the attention of Syracuse, by word of the refugees from the settlements. Hiero II, a tyrant of Syracuse, began to gather an army of citizens with which to rid the land of the destroyers of the peace and rescue his Greek kinsmen. Hiero met with the Mamertines when they were nearing Syracuse. Marching out his troops, he first sent his unruly mercenaries forward and allowed them to be butchered by the Mamertines. The faithless part of his army disposed of, Hiero marched his citizen soldiers back to the city where he drilled them to a better fighting condition. Leading his confident army north, he found the Mamertines again at the Longanus River on the plain of Mylae where he easily defeated them, and proclaimed himself king. The Mamertines were not accustomed to large pitched battles and had become reckless after beating Hiero's mercenaries. In the battle, Hiero captured the Mamertine leaders and the remnants fled back to the safety of Messana. Hiero had restricted the Mamertine activity and placed them in a dire situation. When Hiero returned to besiege their base (Messana) in 265 BC the Mamertines called for help from a nearby fleet from Carthage, which occupied the harbor of Messana. Seeing this, the Syracuse forces retired, not wishing to confront Carthaginian forces. Uncomfortable under the Carthaginian \\"protection,\\" the Mamertines now appealed to Rome to be allowed into the protection of the Roman people. At first, the Romans did not wish to come to the aid of soldiers who had unjustly stolen a city from its rightful possessors. However, unwilling to see Carthaginian power spread further over Sicily and get too close to Italy, Rome responded by entering into an alliance with the Mamertines. In response, Syracuse allied itself with Carthage, imploring their protection. With Rome and Carthage brought into conflict, the Syracuse/Mamertine conflict escalated into the First Punic War. Legacy Once the scale of the conflict had escalated beyond them, the Mamertines were lost to the historical record and their fate is lost, swallowed up in the larger events of the Punic wars. After the First Punic War, however, their name was not quite forgotten in the ancient world since \\"Mamertine wine\\" from the vineyards of north-eastern tip of Sicily was still known and enjoyed in the 1st century. It was the favourite of Julius Caesar and it was he who made it popular after serving it at a feast to celebrate his third consulship. Even centuries after the Mamertine occupation, the inhabitants of Messana were still called Mamertines. In his novel Salammb√¥, Gustave Flaubert writes of the Greeks singing the 'old song of the Mamertines': \\"With my lance and sword I plough and reap; I am master of the house! The disarmed man falls at my feet and calls me Lord and Great King.\\" See also * Punic Wars * Sicilian Wars Notes External links *Jona Lendering ‚Äì Mamertines *Mamertine Coins Category:Ancient mercenaries Category:Italian mercenaries Category:Magna Graecia Category:Mercenary units and formations of antiquity Category:Military units and formations of antiquity Category:Military units and formations of ancient Greece Category:Pyrrhic War Category:Roman Republic ","title":"Mamertines"},{"id":"1264302","text":"New Norway is a hamlet located within Camrose County in central Alberta, Canada. Named in 1895, it is located on Highway 21, approximately southeast of Edmonton and southwest of Camrose. New Norway is home to a number of small businesses, and has an elementary and secondary school, local fire protection and municipal services provided by Camrose County.  History  In 1892, travelling first on the newly constructed Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) line, the Ole M. Olstad family disembarked in Wetaskiwin and made their way to the Duhamel settlement, which had been established for some years. The family quickly filed homesteads a few miles south for themselves and several relatives and friends in the United States. In addition they purchased available CPR land for $3.00 per acre ($7.41/ha). For a time the area was known as the \\"Olstead District\\". However, as other Norwegian families (along with those of other nationalities) settled in the area, the name changed to New Norway around 1895. By 1903 the fledgling community had a school, general store, and a blacksmith shop to its credit. In the fall of 1909, in anticipation of the new Grand Trunk Pacific rail line being built nearby, the community was moved (by the use of skids and seven oxen) to its present location NW-11-45-21-W4 (see Dominion Land Survey). According to the Camrose Canadian, the townsite of New Norway was put on sale October 14, 1909, with 14 businesses filing intent to establish within the first month. Commercial lots sold from $100 to $250, and residential lots were priced from $50 to $150. New Norway incorporated as a village on May 6, 1910, and its first council was elected on May 9, 1910 with Norman M. Smith, James F. Willows and Evan O. Olstad serving. Over a century later, the Village of New Norway was dissolved to hamlet status under the jurisdiction of Camrose County effective November 1, 2012.  Demographics  As a designated place in the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, New Norway recorded a population of 320 living in 126 of its 136 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 278. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. In the 2011 Census, New Norway had a population of 283 living in 114 of its 128 total dwellings, a -12.4% change from its 2006 population of 323. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011.

Their biggest success was the 1979 single \\"Into the Valley\\" and the 1980 album The Absolute Game. In 2016 the band announced a 40th anniversary tour of the UK with their original singer Richard Jobson.  History  = Early years (1977‚Äì1979) = Skids played their first gig on 19 August 1977 at the Bellville Hotel in Pilmuir Street, Dunfermline, Scotland. Within six months they had released the Charles EP on the No Bad record label, created by Sandy Muir, a Dunfermline music shop owner turned manager. The record brought them to the attention of national BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel. This led to a local gig supporting The Clash. Virgin Records then signed up Skids in April 1978. The singles \\"Sweet Suburbia\\" and \\"The Saints Are Coming\\" both made commercial inroads, before \\"Into the Valley\\" reached the UK Top 10 singles chart in early 1979. The band released their debut studio album, Scared to Dance, the same year. It was recorded at The Townhouse Studios in London, England with production and keyboards by David Batchelor. Adamson walked out towards the end of the sessions before all the guitar overdubs were completed. Session guitarist Chris Jenkins was chief maintenance engineer at Townhouse studios and completed the album using Adamson's studio set up, adding additional guitar to four tracks ‚Äì \\"Into the Valley\\", \\"Integral Plot\\", \\"Calling the Tune\\" and \\"Scared to Dance\\". In the meantime, Adamson returned to Scotland when the recording was finished. He rejoined the band for the live concert tour promotion of the album. The record included \\"The Saints Are Coming\\", which was later covered in late 2006 as a charity single by U2 and Green Day. Skids enjoyed a further year of chart success as \\"Masquerade\\" and \\"Working for the Yankee Dollar\\" reached the UK Top 20 singles chart. The latter came from their second album, also released in 1979, Days in Europa, with the record's production and keyboards by Bill Nelson (Be-Bop Deluxe, , Channel Light Vessel and solo artist). Nelson was the obvious choice for the record's production duties as he was not only Adamson's principal 'guitar hero' but also an enormous influence on Adamson's playing.Nelson, Bill diary of a hyperdreamer (2004) p. 563 collected diaries from between 1999 and 2003, previously published on his official website Pomona Nelson also played an important role in polishing Skids' sound and in encouraging the development of Jobson's lyrics. Just before recording of the album commenced, Kellichan left the band and was temporarily replaced on drums by Rusty Egan (ex-Rich Kids, then with the band Visage and a New Romantic 1980s dance DJ at the Blitz club). Egan played on the album and later on the live concert tour of the record. Keyboard player Alistair Moore also temporarily joined the band to perform live with them. He had been recruited to play Bill Nelson's keyboard parts from the record. In November 1979 Mike Baillie, ex-Insect Bites, was recruited as a permanent band member, taking care of the drums, backing vocals and percussion). He slowly took over from Egan, while the band was still touring Days in Europa. Some of Jobson's lyrics as well as the album cover caused controversy. It showed an Olympian being crowned with laurels by an Aryan-looking woman, and the lettering was in Gothic script. Some, including DJ John Peel, felt that this glorified Nazi ideology and it was indeed similar to posters from the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Germany. After the original version of the album had already been released, Canadian record producer Bruce Fairbairn was brought into the project. The original cover and the track \\"Pros and the Cons\\" were removed. The sleeve was completely re-designed and the song \\"Masquerade\\" added. The album was also remixed and the tracks re-sequenced. This second version was released in 1980. = The Absolute Game, Joy and break-up (1980‚Äì1982) = In February 1980 one of the Skids founding members William Simpson left and was replaced by Russell Webb (bass guitar, backing vocals, keyboards, percussion, and guitar). Webb joined as a permanent band member and immediately started work on the recording of the band's third album The Absolute Game, released in 1980 and produced by Mick Glossop. It proved to be the band's most commercial release, reaching the Top 10 of the UK Albums Chart and contained the minor hit single \\"Circus Games\\". A few of the tracks on the album also included a collection of fourteen adult and child backing vocalists, along with a lone didgeridoo player. Initial copies of The Absolute Game came with a free limited edition, second album entitled Strength Through Joy, echoing the band's previous controversial themes. Jobson claims to have got the title from Dirk Bogarde's autobiography. Soon after the release and live concert tour of The Absolute Game Baillie left the band and was followed soon after by Adamson (although Adamson did stay around long enough to play on one more song for the next album Joy, called \\"Iona\\"). Baillie moved back to Scotland to live and Adamson went on to launch his new band, Big Country. This left Jobson and Webb to write and record the band's fourth and final album Joy, which Russell Webb also produced. The pair played multiple instruments on the album, and also invited a collection of seventeen musical friends to perform on various tracks with them. Skids dissolved in 1982, with the compilation Fanfare posthumously issued by Virgin. It was a mixture of most of the band's singles and some B-sides, though it omitted any tracks from the Joy period. Jobson and Webb then went on to form a new band called The Armoury Show. The group recorded just one album, Waiting for the Floods in 1985 before splitting up. Jobson went on to pursue a solo career as a poet, songwriter, television presenter and most recently, as a film director. He released albums on the Belgian record label Les Disques du Crepuscule and the UK's own Parlophone Records. Webb proposed a solo career and, according to Armoury Show fan page, later joined Public Image Ltd. in 1992 (but played only on their last tour), and is now a video game designer. = Reunion concerts, Burning Cities = In 2007 Richard Jobson, William Simpson and Mike Baillie, along with Bruce Watson (guitar and backing vocals), Jamie Watson (guitar), Brian Jobson (backing vocals) and Jane Button (backing vocals), got together to play three gigs. They were to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the group's formation and as a final tribute to Stuart Adamson, who had died in 2001. The shows on 4 and 5 July were at Dunfermline's Glen Pavilion (where they were supported by Rosyth band, The Draymin), outside of which Skids had previously played only their second gig, according to Jobson, and on 7 July at the T in the Park festival. Skids returned to the stage on 28 November 2009 as one of the headlining acts in Homecoming Live, a series of gigs held around the SECC complex in Glasgow to celebrate the end of the Year of Homecoming in Scotland. The line-up mirrored the 2007 gigs, with members of The Gospel Truth Choir joining Button on backing vocals for \\"A Woman in Winter\\" and \\"Working for the Yankee Dollar\\". The same line-up performed a concert on 5 March 2010 at the ABC in Glasgow, with support from The Law and Bruce & Jamie Watson, and lastly a concert on 6 March 2010 at the Alhambra Theatre, Dunfermline with support from Beatnic Prestige and Bruce & Jamie Watson. This final concert was to conclude a week of events celebrating the works, past and present, of Richard Jobson as part of The Fifer Festival 2010 on 6 March 2010. The band undertook another reunion tour in 2017 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of their formation. It had a more extensive set of venues than the 2007 reunion with concerts throughout the UK and Ireland, and headlining the 2017 Rebellion Festival on the final night. The lineup included Richard Jobson, Bill Simpson, Mike Baillie, Bruce Watson and Jamie Watson. In 2018 Burning Cities included four songs co-written by Martin Metcalfe, formerly of Goodbye Mr Mackenzie. The album reached number 28 in the charts.

It is managed by the James Paget University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. History The hospital, which replaced Great Yarmouth General Hospital and Gorleston-on-Sea Cottage Hospital, opened in July 1982. It was named after Sir James Paget an English surgeon and pathologist who was born in Great Yarmouth and is best remembered for naming Paget's disease. The Louise Hamilton Centre, which was built to provide palliative care for people with cancer and other life limiting and progressive illnesses, was officially opened by Princess Anne in April 2013.  Services  James Paget University Hospital provides a full range of clinical services for a population of 230,000 residents across Great Yarmouth, Lowestoft and Waveney. Performance Four-hour target in the emergency department quarterly figures from NHS England Data from https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times- and-activity/ In March 2007, there was an outbreak of Clostridium difficile at the hospital which killed 17 people. In December 2010 and into 2011, the hospital was put on black alert as it saw a rise in patient numbers. Patients were urged to relieve pressure on the hospital by seeking treatment elsewhere such as at pharmacies, GP surgeries and Minor Injury Units. In March 2011, the hospital had an outbreak of group A streptococcal infection which resulted in the death of a patient. As a preventative measure, staff and patients were screened. In June 2011, a Care Quality Commission inspection found that the hospital was in the moderate concern category with respect to meeting the needs of some patients in nutritional and patient dignity standards. The inspection followed allegations that the care of some elderly patients was lacking in some respects earlier during the year. In August 2012 the Care Quality Commission published a report mentioning one remaining minor concern about the hospital's record-keeping. Compliance in record-keeping meant that the hospital was now fully compliant on all the care standards. The Trust was named by the Health Service Journal as one of the top hundred NHS trusts to work for in 2015. At that time it had 2511 full-time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 3.25%. 65% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 64% recommended it as a place to work.

It is chemically similar to columbite, and the two are often grouped together as a semi-singular mineral called coltan or \\"columbite-tantalite\\" in many mineral guides. However, tantalite has a much greater specific gravity than columbite (8.0+ compared to columbite's 5.2). Iron-rich tantalite is the mineral tantalite-(Fe) or ferrotantalite and manganese-rich is tantalite-(Mn) or manganotantalite. Tantalite is also very close to tapiolite. Those minerals have same chemical composition, but different crystal symmetry orthorhombic for tantalite and tetragonal for tapiolite. Tantalite is black to brown in both color and streak. Manganese- rich tantalites can be brown and translucent. Occurrence Manganotantalite from Alto do Giz, RN, Brazil Tantalite occurs in granitic pegmatites that are rich in rare-earth elements, and in placer deposits derived from such rocks.

He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2001, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Mike Harris. Background Palladini was born in Prossedi, Italy. He was the owner of Al Palladini's Pine Tree Lincoln Mercury automobile dealership in Woodbridge, Ontario becoming locally famous for the slogan, \\"Any Palladini is a pal of mine\\" in a series of ads conceived by CHUM Radio's Larry MacInnis, and voiced by a young Rick Moranis when he was an announcer at CHUM FM radio in Toronto. He was named Canadian World Auto Marketer of the Year in 1994, and was the Vaughan Outstanding Business Achievement Award the same year. Palladini also served as Chair of the York-Finch General Hospital Foundation, and was a Director of the York University Scholarship Alliance Board. Politics He was elected in the riding of York Centre in the provincial election of 1995, defeating Liberal Mario Ferri by more than 8,000 votes (the riding had previously been held by high-profile Liberal Greg Sorbara). On June 26, 1995, he was named Minister of Transportation. Following a cabinet shuffle on October 10, 1997, he was named Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism. Palladini was re-elected in the provincial election of 1999, defeating Liberal Tony Genco by about 7,500 votes in the redistributed riding of Vaughan‚ÄîKing‚ÄîAurora. After the election, his portfolio was renamed \\"Economic Development and Trade\\". In office, Palladini presented himself as a populist while presenting legislation which reduced government services. He was often accused of anti-intellectualism. When he cut back on snowplowing budgets for provincial highways, he suggested that stranded drivers could simply use their cell phones to call for help. =Cabinet posts= Resignation and death Palladini resigned from cabinet on February 7, 2001, citing personal difficulties. One month later, he unexpectedly died of a heart attack on a golf course while vacationing in Mexico.

A solid solution series exists between tephroite and its analogues, the group endmembers fayalite and forsterite. Divalent iron or magnesium may readily replace manganese in the olivine crystal structure. It was first described for an occurrence at the Sterling Hill Mine and Franklin, New Jersey, United States. It occurs in iron-manganese ore deposits and their related skarns. It also occurs in metamorphosed manganese-rich sediments. It occurs in association with: zincite, willemite, franklinite, rhodonite, jacobsite, diopside, gageite, bustamite, manganocalcite, glaucochroite, calcite, banalsite and alleghanyite. It can also be found in England and Sweden. Tephroite has a hardness of 6 and a specific gravity of approximately 4.1, which is heavy for non-metallic minerals.
