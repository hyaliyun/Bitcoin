Early Life  Edgar Thomas Conley was born 12 April 1874 in Fairland, Montgomery County, Maryland, United States of America. Son of Charles William and Martha E. (Larrick) Conley, who owned a family farm called Green Ridge. Edgar was apparently named for an uncle born in 1840, who was a member of the 2d Maryland (Confederate Army) who died during the American Civil War. After graduating from Episcopal High School, in Alexandria, VA.,Conley attended Lehigh University for a semester and then entered Braden‚Äôs preparatory school in Highland Falls. He was admitted to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York 15 June 1893. In 1905 Conley married Claire M. Conley, who was born in Ontario Canada, but became a naturalized citizen around 1900. The couple met when Conley was assigned to Fort Niagara, New York, and the marriage produced three children.  Military Career  = Early Years = Conley as a West Point cadet Edgar Thomas Conley successfully completed his studies at West Point, where he earned the lifetime nickname of \\"Sheriff\\" for mediating a fight between cadets, and did well both academically and in extracurricular activities. Conley graduated and was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant of Infantry on 11 June 1887. After a brief stint with the US 15th Infantry in the New Mexico Territory, newly promoted 1st Lieutenant Conley was assigned to Company G, 21st Infantry on 1 February 1898. The 21st Infantry was deployed for service in the Spanish-American War, landing on Cuba with the Fifth Army Corps in late June 1898. On 1 July 1898, the 21st Infantry took part in the assault on San Juan Hill outside Santiago, Cuba. Lieutenant Conley was cited for gallantry in the battle, making him eligible to wear the Silver Star Medal when it was approved in 1932. Soon thereafter, the 21st Infantry was shipped to the Philippines to reinforce the American Army dealing with the growing Philippine Insurrection. There, Conley took part in many operations around Manila and outlying districts, earning commendation from the senior leaders for his skill in the field. Captain Conley remained with the 21st Infantry as it returned to the United States, before serving at Fort Niagara, and back in the Philippines. For a period of time, Captain Conley was assigned as the Professor of Military Science and Tactics (PMS&T;) at the Maryland Agriculture College (today part of the University of Maryland). = World War I Era Service = After the American declaration of war and entry into World War I, Major Conley, along with most prewar Regular Army officers) received temporary promotions in the National Army (forerunner of the modern United States Army Reserve).

There Conley worked as the Chief of the prisoners of war division for the AEF, for which he received a letter of commendation from the Provost Marshal General. Colonel Conley departed France on 2 December 1919, and returned to the United States. = Postwar Service = Colonel Conley seems to have returned to work at the Adjutant General's office, although he was not officially transferred to the Adjutant General's Department until 1 May 1922. In the interim, Conley was honorably discharged from the National Army on 30 June 1920, and recommissioned as a Colonel in the Regular Army on 1 July 1920. During the same time period, Colonel Conley was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal on 21 November 1921: Edgar T. Conley, colonel, Infantry, United States Army. For exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services as the Chief of the Prisoners of War Division, the Provost Marshal General's Department. He had charge of and was responsible for all matters concerning the prisoners of war labor companies, escort companies, and inclosures (sic). His sound judgment, marked ability, and devotion to duty resulted in the handling of the delicate prisoner of war questions in such a manner as to produce only commendation. His services were especially valuable to the Government. Address: Care of The Adjutant General of the Army, Washington D.C. Entered Military Academy from Maryland. Colonel Conley remained at the War Department through the remainder of the 1920s and early 1930s. On 1 June 1933, Conley was appointed as Assistant The Adjutant General with a concurrent promotion to brigadier general. On 1 November 1935 Conley was promoted to Major General and appointed as The Adjutant General of the Army. Major General Conley retired on 30 April 1938 to due to mandatory age.

Starring ten Tamil film directors, including Manivannan, Seeman, Tarun Gopi, Ponvannan, and K. P. Jagannath in lead and supporting roles.http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie- news-1/sep-08-04/directors-26-09-08.html The film, scored by Sabesh-Murali and filmed by Balabharani, was released on 5 June 2009, going on to become critically and commercially successful at the box office. Plot The film is set in the backdrop of a village near Usilampatti, in Madurai district. Mayandi (Manivannan) and Virumandi (G. M. Kumar) are siblings with disputes over settling their properties. Mayandi insists giving a portion of their ancestral properties to their stepsister, for which Virumandi does not agree. This creates enmity in Virumandi and his sons against Mayandi and his family. Mayandi has four sons - Thavasi (Ponvannan), Virumandi (Seeman), Cheenisamy (K. P. Jagannath) and Paraman (Tarun Gopi) - and one daughter - Mayakka (Deepa Shankar). All the sons except Paraman marry, and they live as a joint family. Paraman falls in love with his schoolmate Poongodi (Poongodi). He gets admission into engineering, and Mayandi sells a portion of his land to pay fees for Paraman. This angers the wives of Thavasi and Virumandi. They keep insisting on partitioning the properties between four sons, thinking that Mayandi is spending more for the education of Paraman, while the other three sons are not educated properly. However, Paraman‚Äôs brothers are actually so affectionate towards him, and they prefer staying together. Suddenly, Mayandi passes away due to an electric shock when he steps over a wire unknowingly. Now, the wives of Thavasi and Virumandi again keep insisting on doing the property partition. Their plan gets executed: the properties get partitioned into three, leaving Paraman as his portion was already sold by Mayandi to pay the college fees. Paraman could not bear his father‚Äôs death, and Poongodi shows affection to him. Poongodi gets admission into Madras Medical College, and she leaves to Chennai for education, though she keeps talking to Paraman regularly on the phone. Paraman continues his engineering course while he is considered as a burden by his sisters-in-law. However, his brothers take care of him. One day, Thavasi‚Äôs wife falls sick, and she needs blood urgently. As it is a rare group, it becomes difficult. Paraman informs this to his friends in college, and his friends come for rescue. Thavasi‚Äôs wife is saved, and she realizes her mistake and feels bad for ill-treating Paraman despite which he helped her in a timely manner. Paraman secures a job through campus placement, and his living condition improves. One day, he gets shocked to see Poongodi in a bus stop along with her husband and a baby. Paraman cries upon thinking that Poongodi has betrayed him. However, Poongodi tells a flashback that her \\"husband\\" is actually her relative who lost his leg in an accident on the day of the marriage, following which the marriage gets cancelled. Now, her parents request Poongodi to marry the groom as it would be an insult for the entire family due to a cancelled marriage. Poongodi, though not interested, accepts for the sake of her family‚Äôs wishes. Still, she kept calling Paraman over the phone in the usual manner so that he will not get broken and instead will concentrate on studies. Knowing the truth, Paraman feels happy about Poongodi‚Äôs kind heart and her sacrifice for the welfare of her family. Finally, Paraman meets Virumandi and cries to him to lead a joint life along with everyone. He also wins the heart of Virumandi and his sons also and marries his aunt's daughter.

Club career  Bergamaschi began his football career at his home town club of Hellas Verona. He soon established himself in the first eleven and was regarded as one of the best midfielders of the time, gaining an invitation to the Under-21 national side managed by Vicini and later the Under-23 under Bearzot. For the 1973‚Äì74 season he transferred to A.C. Milan who had signed him after his great performance in their historic 3‚Äì5 defeat when Verona crushed Milan's scudetto hopes on the last day of the championship the season before. With Milan, however, the midfielder was not able to excel in the generally mediocre Rossoneri team who had a disappointing league season and whose positive displays in the European Cup Winners' Cup ended in a bitter final defeat against 1. FC Magdeburg in Rotterdam. Bergamaschi played for Genoa the following season and returned to Milan to spend the 1975‚Äì76 season largely in the reserves, with only six appearances in Serie A. For the 1976‚Äì77 season the midfielder was sold to Foggia and with the club he returned to his usual form, helping the Apulian team win promotion to Serie A. His return to Verona for the 1978‚Äì79 season coincided with one of the most negative performances of the club in Serie A that resulted in relegation to the second-tier Serie B. Bergamaschi stayed with the club for another season despite the relegation, but then moved to A.C. Cesena in 1980. After securing promotion to Serie A with his new club in 1981, he played one more season for Rimini Calcio F.C. and ended his playing career in 1982.  International career  Although Bergamaschi was never capped for Italy at senior level, he received three call-ups for Italy U21 under manager Azeglio Vicini, and later received two call-ups for Italy U23 under manager Enzo Bearzot. Playing style  Both as a playmaker and winger, Bergamaschi displayed great tactical instinct and a feeling for the game. His best technical qualities were a clear vision of the game and a rapid execution of plays characterized by his precise long passing enabling a quick counter- attacking play.

It contains the Washington Valley Reservoir and the Chimney Rock Hawk Watch. Park development The only partially developed park has a western and eastern section separated by the Bound Brook Gap with the Chimney Rock Road that connects Bound Brook with Martinsville. The terrain is rocky and mountainous and covered with pine and hemlock. At the center of the western section of the park is the Washington Valley Reservoir (formerly known as the Bound Brook/Elizabeth Reservoir), which was created in 1920 when the western branch of the Middle Brook was dammed. The eastern section of the park has the much smaller East Branch Reservoir and the Buttermilk Falls of the eastern branch of the Middle Brook. Adjacent to the park is the Chimney Rock Quarry built atop the old Chimney Rock Copper Mine a.k.a. Bound Brook Quarry or Washington Mine. Copper mines over deep exist and active mining continues to this day as owned and operated by the Stavola group of companies. The most famous copper find was used to mold a small brass cannon later used at the siege of Yorktown. Calcite has also been mined from the nearby Chimney Rock Quarry. Many marble and granite companies continue to operate in this area . In 1886, William Haelig leased the land from copper miners to establish his Chimney Rock Quarry. Before 1900, stone was carried out of the quarry to the railroad in Bound Brook by horse-drawn wagons. Haelig persuaded the Central Railroad of New Jersey to lay a spur to the stone pit. Trap rock quarrying was more profitable than mining, and the quarry is still active. The reservoirs have no boat access and are of interest to anglers. Species that can be caught include largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, pumpkinseed, and yellow perch. The park contains numerous trails that are used by hikers and mountain bikers. Chimney Rock Hawk Watch At an outcropping of the first Watchung mountain ridge is Chimney Rock Hawk Watch. In the fall, the area is visited by birdwatchers to observe the annual southward migration of raptors and other birds. Chimney Rock Hawk Watch In the 2008 season, they recorded 12,275 sightings, of these over 10,000 were hawks including 7,836 broad-winged hawks, 1,745 sharp-shinned hawks. Also there were 140 bald eagle and 17 golden eagle sightings. Hawk watching lasts from early September into November, the second half of September being the peak time.Daily tally at Chimney Rock Hawk Watch Middlebrook encampment To some degree, the eastern section of the park covers a military fortification that was used by the Continental Army near the site of the 1777-78 Middlebrook encampment. Remnants can be found in the shape of earth walls. A look-out point is preserved that was used to observe movements of the British Army in the plains towards New Brunswick.

In addition to these, ESB1 comprises Danish, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, and Spanish sections. The Latvian and Slovakian sections of the school currently operate to the end of the primary cycle. Applications for enrolment in the four Brussels-based European Schools are administered centrally, with all applications for those whose mother-tongue is Danish, Hungarian, Polish, Slovenian or Maltese referred automatically to the ESB1, along with applications for enrolment in the nursery and primary cycles of the Latvian section. Students enroled in the schools are generally instructed in the language of their respective section. Students must choose from either English, French or German for their second language, which becomes the language of instruction for History and Geography curriculum from the third- year secondary, as well as the optional Economics course available from fourth year. Students are also expected to take a third language upon entering the secondary cycle. Students whose mother-tongue is not covered by a language section, are enroled in the English, French or German sections, and can opt for their mother-tongue in place of English, French or German studies, respectively. History The first European School was founded in Luxembourg in 1953 as a private initiative of officials working for the institutions of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), based within the jurisdiction, to provide an education to their children in their mother-tongues, whilst instructing them in a multilingual, multicultural environment. On 12 April 1957, the six founding states of the ECSC transformed the initiative into an intergovernmental organisation, signing the Statute of the European School, with the Board of Governors of the School being composed of the ministers of education of the six signatory states. The month prior, on 25 March 1957, the same states had signed the two Treaties of Rome, which established the European Economic Community (EEC) and European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) on 1 January 1958. In a meeting of the foreign ministers of the six founding states of the three communities, held on 6 and 7 January 1958, Brussels and Luxembourg were selected as provisional seats of the Commissions and Council meetings of the EEC and Euratom. Consequently, at the request of the Belgian authorities, the Board of Governors of the European School agreed to the founding of a European School in Brussels. Upon its opening at site on rue du Tr√¥ne in September 1958, the school had just 26 pupils and six teachers. In September 1959, the school relocated to its current main campus, made available by the Belgian State, in the leafy Brussels suburb of Uccle.Flags of the then 6 European Communities states fly in front of the school's administrative building in 1971. Demand for school places increased following the merging of the executives and Councils of the three European Communities (EC) in 1967, with most of their departments relocating permanently to Brussels, along with their staff and families. The first wave of enlargement of the EC in 1973, also saw the same States accede to the Statue of the European School, in order to provide an education to children of staff seconded or hired from their respective nations. Increasing demand for school places led to the establishment of a second School in Brussels in 1974. The incorporation of the EC into the European Union in 1993, and successive waves of enlargement of its membership, led to increased staff presence in the city. With new EC - and then EU - entrants each successively acceding to the international framework governing the Schools (repealed and replaced in 2002 by the Convention defining the Statute of the European Schools, originally signed in 1994), a third and fourth school were founded in Brussels in 1999 and 2007, respectively. In 2015 the Boards of Governors of the European Schools agreed to the use of the European School, Brussels I's Berkandael site as a temporary overflow campus for the school up until the establishment of a fifth European School in Brussels on the site of the former NATO headquarters originally due in September 2019. In January 2020, the Belgian government approved the project, with the school expected to open in time for the 2021 academic year.

He served one term in the Florida State Senate, representing parts of South Florida from 2012 to 2016, and before that served two terms in the Florida House of Representatives, representing a district in southern Miami-Dade County from 2008 until his election to the Senate. History Bullard was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and moved to Florida in 1981; his father, Edward B. Bullard, served in the Florida House of Representatives from 2000 to 2008, and his mother Larcenia Bullard, served in the House from 1992 to 2000 and in the Florida State Senate from 2002 to 2012. He attended Florida A&M; University, graduating with a degree in history education in 1999. Since 2000, Bullard has taught social studies at Coral Reef Senior High School in Richmond Heights. Florida House of Representatives In 2008, when his father was term-limited from the 118th District in the House, Bullard ran to succeed him. Bullard emerged victorious from a crowded Democratic primary and won the general election uncontested. In 2010, he was challenged in the primary by Kionne L. McGhee, and won by less than 400 votes. He won the general election in a landslide against his Republican opponent, Charlie Lopez. Florida Senate Florida State Senate districts were redrawn in 2012, and the 39th District, in which his mother could not seek another term due to term limits, was reconfigured, with the Palm Beach County sections removed and more sections from Miami-Dade County added. Bullard ran to succeed his mother, and faced Ron Saunders, the Minority Leader of the Florida House of Representatives; former State Representative James Bush; JJ Johnson; and Sal Gutierrez in the primary. The Miami Herald, which felt that more representation for the Florida Keys was necessary in the legislature, endorsed Saunders. However, Bullard narrowly won the primary by 1,500 votes and 35% of the vote, with Saunders and Bush in a close second and third. In the general election, Representative Bullard faced Scott Hopes, the CEO of a health technology firm, and won the endorsement of the Herald, which praised his \\"push for education reforms.\\" In the end, Bullard defeated Hopes. While serving in the Senate, Bullard sponsored legislation aimed at preventing cyberbullying, which allows schools to \\"discipline a student for cyberbullying if the student uses a computer, computer system, or computer network owned by a school.\\" He criticized efforts by the legislature to reduce funding for Florida Virtual School while simultaneously allowing private companies to offer virtual education, noting, \\"We spend all of this money, time and energy to beef up our own virtual program, Florida Virtual School, and all of a sudden, we are cutting them and allowing outside providers nationwide to come in and take a chunk of the pot of money.\\" After court-ordered redistricting, Bullard found himself drawn into a more competitive senate district in 2016, based around Kendall in southern Miami-Dade. He was defeated by Republican State Representative Frank Artiles in the general election, 51 to 41%. Controversies State Senator Bullard, on a trip with Black Lives Matter touring the Middle East, was photographed with a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, an organization listed on the State Department's list of designated terrorist organizations.United States Department of State Those images were shared on social media by the group which coordinated Bullard‚Äôs trip. Bullard said he did not know until after the West Bank trip that its tour guide, Mahmoud Jeddah, was affiliated with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.

German Anti- partisan Warfare in Europe, 1939-1945, Schiffer Pub., 2001, .Mazower, Mark. Inside Hitler's Greece: The Experience of Occupation, 1941-44, Yale University Press, 2001, . The shooting was the first of a series of reprisals in Crete. It was orchestrated by Generaloberst Kurt Student, in retaliation for the participation of Cretans in the Battle of Crete which had ended with the surrender of the island two days earlier. The massacre was photographed by Franz-Peter Weixler, a German army war propaganda correspondent, whose negatives were discovered 39 years later in the Federal German archives by a Greek journalist. Background =Geography= The village of Kondomari is part of the Platanias municipality and is located near the north coast of Crete, west of the city of Chania and southeast of the Maleme airstrip. =During the Battle of Crete= The Battle of Crete began on 20 May 1941 with a large-scale airborne invasion aimed to capture the island's strategic locations. As was proven in practice, one of the most important locations was the Maleme airstrip and its surrounding region. Its capture allowed the Luftwaffe to fly in large-scale reinforcements of troops and supplies that eventually determined the outcome of the Battle. In the morning of 20 May 1941, German paratroopers of the III Battalion of the 1st Air Landing Assault Regiment were dropped southeast of Maleme. Their landing site extended to Platanias and included Kondomari. The invaders were confronted by New Zealand troops from the 21st and 22nd Battalions,Official History of New Zealand in the 2nd World War 1939‚Äì45. 21 Battalion ‚Äî Battle for Crete joined by ill-armed local civilians carrying primitive weapons. The paratroopers experienced strong resistance and suffered severe losses that totaled nearly 400 men out of 600, including their commander Major Otto Scherber. Eugen Meindl, the regiment's commander, was shot through the chest during his parachute jump near the Platanias bridge but survived. He was replaced by Oberst Hermann- Bernhard Ramcke. =Student's order on reprisals= Throughout the Battle of Crete, the Allied forces and Cretan irregulars had inflicted heavy losses of lives on the Wehrmacht. In particular, the unprecedented resistance from the local population exasperated the Prussian sense of military order according to which no one but professional warriors should be allowed to fight. Reports from General Julius Ringel, commander of the 5th Mountain Division, stated that Cretan civilians were picking off paratroopers or attacking them with knives, axes and scythes. Even before the end of the battle, unproven and exaggerated stories had started to circulate, attributing the excessively high casualties to torture and mutilation of paratroopers by the Cretans.Beevor, Antony. Crete: The Battle and the Resistance, John Murray Ltd, 1991. Penguin Books, 1992. When these stories reached the Luftwaffe's High Command in Berlin, G√∂ring ordered temporary commander General Kurt Student to undertake inquiries and reprisals. Thus, seeking to counter insurgency and before inquiries were complete, Student issued an order for launching a wave of brutal reprisals against the local population right after the surrender of Crete on 31 May. The reprisals were to be carried out rapidly, omitting formalities or trials and by the same units who had been confronted by the locals. The massacre Following Student's order, the occupants of Kondomari were blamed for the death of a few German soldiers whose bodies had been found near the village. On 2 June 1941, four lorries full of German paratroopers from the III Battalion of Luftlande-Sturm-Regiment 1 under the command of Oberleutnant Horst Trebes surrounded Kondomari.Kiriakopoulos, G.C. The Nazi Occupation of Crete: 1941-1945, Praeger Publishers 1995, . Trebes, a former member of the Hitler Youth, was the highest-ranking officer of the Battalion to have survived the Battle unwounded. Men, women and children were forced to gather in the village square. Then, a number of hostages was selected among the men while women and children were released. The hostages were led to the surrounding olive groves and later fired upon.MacDonald, C.A. The lost battle --Crete, 1941. Free Press, 1993, . The exact number of the victims is unclear. According to German records, a total of 23 men were killed but other sources put the total at about 60. The whole operation was captured on film by Franz- Peter Weixler, then serving as a war propaganda correspondent (kriegsberichter) for the Wehrmacht. =Photos= File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-166-0526-05, Kreta, Auszeichnung von Fallschirmj√§gern.jpgWalter Gericke (left); Horst Trebes (right) File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-166-0525-27, Kreta, Kondomari, Erschie√üung von Zivilisten.jpgThe civilian hostages at Kondomari File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-166-0525-29, Kreta, Kondomari, Erschie√üung von Zivilisten.jpgParatroopers being prepared to open fire; Horst Trebes in front File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-166-0525-39, Kreta, Kondomari, Erschie√üung von Zivilisten.jpgFiring squad soldier closeup File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-166-0525-30, Kreta, Kondomari, Erschie√üung von Zivilisten.jpgCivilians being shot File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-166-0527-06A, Kreta, Kondomari, Erschie√üung von Zivilisten.jpgDead bodies Aftermath The day following the massacre of Kondomari, forces of the 1st Air Landing Assault Regiment went on to raze Kandanos and murder most of its people. After the summer of 1941, Franz-Peter Weixler was dismissed from the Wehrmacht for political reasons. He was later accused of high treason against Nazi Germany for having leaked uncensored material related to the paratroopers' activities on Crete that included photographs taken in Kondomari, and for having helped some Cretans to flee. Weixler was arrested by the Gestapo, court martialled and imprisoned from early 1944. Post-war in November 1945, during G√∂ring's trial in Nuremberg, Weixler gave a written eyewitness report on the Kondomari massacre. According to a documentaryŒöŒøŒΩœÑŒøŒºŒ±œÅŒØ ŒßŒ±ŒΩŒØœâŒΩ ~ Œó œÄœÅœéœÑŒ∑ ŒµŒ∫œÑŒ≠ŒªŒµœÉŒ∑ Œ±ŒºŒ¨œáœâŒΩ œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒïœÖœÅœéœÄŒ∑ of the Greek TV network NET, he returned to Kondomari in 1955 where he was received by the villagers according to their traditional custom of hospitality. Realizing that there was no apparent hostility towards him, Weixler told them that he had been following orders on the day of the massacre. However, despite their apparent calmness, the villagers were tense and at some point, one of the survivors stood up and told his fellow villagers that the formal requirements of hospitality had been observed and they should leave. Thus, the assembled villagers immediately left the spot, leaving the photographer on his own. Weixler's negatives from Kondomari were discovered in 1980 in the federal German archives by the Greek journalist Vassos Mathiopoulos,ŒúŒ±Œ∏ŒπœåœÄŒøœÖŒªŒøœÇ, ŒíŒ¨œÉŒøœÇ.

Their connection to the events at Kondomari was later established via extensive research by journalist Kostas Papapetrou, after which Weixler's photographs became widely known. In July 1941, Horst Trebes was awarded the Knight's Cross for his leadership during the assault against Crete. Three years later (1944), he was killed in action in Normandy. After the surrender of Germany, Kurt Student was captured by the British. In May 1947, he came before a military tribunal to answer charges of mistreatment and murder of prisoners of war by his forces in Crete. Greece's demand to have Student extradited was declined. Student was found guilty of three out of eight charges and sentenced to five years in prison. However, he was given a medical discharge and was released in 1948. Student was never tried for crimes against civilians and lived until 1978. Kondomari has been declared a martyred village with Presidential Decree 29, Œ¶ŒïŒö Œë 54/2.4.2019. A memorial in the village lists the names of the victims and has a wall of tiles portraying the incident.

NJG 11 was formed on 20 August 1944 with one Gruppe (group) consisting of 2 Staffeln. Formation 1 staffel was formed from elements of 6./JG 300 and in January 1945 redesignated 7./NJG 11. 2 staffel and 3 staffel formed from 1./NJGr 10 and in January 1945 redesignated 1./NJG 11 and 8./NJG 11 respectively.

Staffel was formed on 28 January 1945 at Burg-Magdeburg from Sonderkommando Welter flying Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighters. NJG 11 was the Luftwaffe's only Nachtjagdgeschwader to exclusively fly single-engine, single-seat fighter aircraft in the Wilde Sau role. (excepting 10 staffel). During its existence the gruppen operated independently of each other 'Confound & Destroy', Streetly, 1978 NJG 11 was reorganized on 30 March 1945. The Stab was disbanded and the Gruppen reduced to Staffeln which were assigned to Nachtjagdgeschwader 3 (NJG 3) and Nachtjagdgeschwader 5 (NJG 5).  Operations 1944‚Äì45  Earlier in 1944 the specialised units of JG 300 and NJGr 10 were tasked with countering the growing threat of the RAF de Havilland Mosquito units. The radar equipped fighter versions equipping No. 100 Group, Bomber Command were taking an increasing toll of the Luftwaffe's night fighters, and the 'Oboe'-equipped Pathfinder and light bomber versions were also proving difficult to intercept and shoot down. NJG 11 brought together the various single-seat high speed units into one Nachtjagdgeschwader to unify these efforts. The Focke-Wulf Fw 190 A-8 and A-9 equipped with the FuG 217 or FuG 218 Neptun V radars were utilised by the unit, though several Bf 109 G-6, G-10 and G-14 models were also used. Thus November saw the fighters of NJG 11 take up specialised high-speed high altitude interception operations against the RAF's Mosquito fighters, target markers and light bombers. Concentrating efforts over the Ruhr and Berlin, tactics were to create lighter conditions by setting up searchlight boxes, forming 'light horizons' to enable pilots to make visible contact with the enemy aircraft. Results were poor however, with only two Mosquitoes claimed over Berlin. In December 1944 the piston-engined elements of NJG 11 gave up sustained anti-Mosquito operations and confined itself to illuminated target defence night fighting against the heavy bombers of the RAF. alt=A twin engine jet aircraft pictured from front-left sitting on the ground in a hangar. The paint scheme of the aircraft is camouflage of various brown and green colours. Two antennas are protruding from the nose of the aircraft. The white number \\"305\\" is visible on the nose of the aircraft. 10./NJG 11 under Hauptmann Kurt Welter, an experienced Wilde Sau ace, commenced operations using a handful of single-seat Me 262 jets in December 1944. Seven two-seat conversion night fighter variants, designated Me 262B-1a/U1, were available by April 1945. To make room for the radar operator fuselage fuel capacity was sacrificed, and a pair of undernose hardpoints, one either side of the nosewheel well, for fitment of a pair of standard Luftwaffe 300 litre (79 US gallon) drop tanks were fitted. Following trials with radar fitted to a single-seater the two-seaters were equipped with the mid-VHF band FuG 218 Neptun V radar, with prominent Hirschgeweih (stag's antlers) eight- dipole aerials on the nose reducing the top speed by about 30 mph. According to some sources from January 1945 to the end of the war the Me 262's of 10./NJG 11 claimed some 43 Mosquitoes by night and 5 P-38 and Mosquito photo- reconnaissance aircraft by day, although these figures do not tally with known Allied aircraft losses.'History of the German Night Fighter Force', Anders Among them six Mosquitos by Feldwebel Karl-Heinz Becker and his radio operator in two weeks, two within three minutes of each other on the night of 23 March 1945.

It is a member of Southeastern Libraries Cooperating, a Minnesota library region.Southeastern Libraries Cooperating (SELCO) Housed in an 1899 Neoclassical building, the Winona Public Library was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 for having local significance in architecture and education. It is Minnesota's oldest library to continuously operate in a purpose-built facility.  History  Winona Public Library's original Fifth Street entrance Library services in Winona originated in 1857 when a local group formed the Winona Lyceum, a membership-based library funded by dues. The group changed its name to the Young Men's Library Association in 1863, and by 1870 had grown to 268 members and 1,670 books. However the library association had to close in 1875 due to debts. Two years later three local women cleared the debt and reorganized the library under a new name, the Winona Library Association. On March 22, 1886, the association donated its collection of 3,500 books to Winona, forming the city's first free public library. In the late 1890s, local lumber magnate William H. Laird donated $50,000 to the city to cover construction costs of a permanent home for the library. The library association paid for the furniture, fixtures, and shelving. The domed Neoclassical building was designed by Warren Powers Laird, dean of the school of architecture of the University of Pennsylvania, and Edgar Viguers Seeler, a prominent Philadelphia architect. The original building measured with a dome and a three-story collection wing. The brick walls are faced with Indiana Limestone while the entrance steps, curbs, and walks are built from local Winona limestone. The columns at the historic Fifth Street entrance are Creole marble from Georgia. The library's design specifically included space for public art, including a display gallery, murals, statuary, and glass art. Library features include glass floors in the book stacks and ornate copper-faced shelving and stairs. Artwork includes the Kenyon Cox mural The Light of Learning and a marble copy of Antonio Canova's sculpture Hebe. Winona Public Library added a children's department in 1921 and by 1949 had begun collecting magazines and newspapers. A 1987 remodeling project moved the entrance from Fifth Street to Johnson Street for improved accessibility.

It is on the University of Pennsylvania campus and is the home field for the University of Pennsylvania Quakers varsity baseball team. The field is about half a mile south-southeast of Franklin Field, along the eastern edge of the university's campus, along the Schuylkill River. The ballpark is tucked away near the intersection of the Schuylkill Expressway and University Avenue. The CSX railroad tracks run behind home plate and are still in use. I-76 (the Schuylkill Expressway) runs parallel to the outfield wall with exit 41 visible from home plate. The right field foul line is kept tight by a large power plant that has two rising cooling tanks and a fence around its perimeter. River Field Drive, which fronts the railroad tracks to the north, is so close that there are only a couple of rows of seats available on the third base side. History When it opened, the dimensions were reported to be 289 feet to the left field foul pole, 317 feet to the right field foul pole, and 385 feet to dead center field. The first game was played on March 23, 2000, against St. Joseph's University; Penn beat St. Joe's 13‚Äì12. The ballpark does not have lights, so all games are played during the day. The stadium opened in 2000 and was originally called Murphy Field after the athletic fields on which the ballpark was built. The university referred it to as \\"Penn Stadium at Murphy Field\\" in Athletic Department publications. These fields were named for Mike Murphy, an early Penn track coach (1896‚Äì1901 and 1905‚Äì1913) who won eight intercollegiate track championships at Penn. It was renamed Meiklejohn Stadium in 2006 to honor Penn-donor William Meiklejohn, a 1942 graduate of the Wharton school and his wife, Louise. Their contributions to the University included $10 million in 2005 to help renovate the baseball field including the addition of a new scoreboard. The field was officially renamed on April 1, 2006, prior to a double-header against Brown University.  Predecessors  From at least 1875 through the first few games of 1895, the team staged its home games at Penn's multi-purpose athletic grounds, aka University Grounds. The field was on the block southeast of the 37th and Spruce intersection, a few blocks west of the eventual site of Franklin Field. That site is now occupied by dormitories and a quadrangle. This is a photo of the baseball field. Franklin Field served as Penn's home baseball field starting on April 22, 1895. Records show that the Penn varsity baseball team played at Franklin Field from 1895 until at least 1924 if not later. The diamond was tucked into the south corner, with left and center fields spacious and right field very close, possibly less than 250 feet. This is a photo of baseball at Franklin Field. River Field, another campus multi-sports facility, opened a baseball diamond in 1940, allowing the baseball team to vacate Franklin Field.[Philadelphia Inquirer, Feb 14, 1940] Bower Field, which opened in May 1979, was Penn baseball's home field immediately prior to Meiklejohn. It was known to be a pitchers' ballpark. Bower was 330 feet down the line in left field, 340 feet down the line to right, 410 feet to dead-center, and had a 25-foot high fence extending from left-center to right-center. The field site, across the railroad tracks east-southeast of Franklin Field, is now occupied by the Hamlin Tennis Center.

It specializes in building custom estate homes, traditional single family homes, villa homes and townhouses within planned communities for middle to upper-class households. The company is a division of NVR, Inc. History The company was founded in 1984 by Alan Gillespie, related to Ed Ryan, the founder of Ryan Homes. Heartland began focusing exclusively on the South Hills region of Pittsburgh. In the following years, Heartland exclusively built for townhome communities and volume communities before opening its first master planned community, Meadowbrook, in 1992. In 2000, the company started building Northridge in Ohio Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania and in 2001, the company started building Valleybrook Farms in Adams Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania. In May 2003, the company started a development in Peters Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania. In 2006, the company announced a 217 single-family home development in Moon Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Heartland was far less affected by the United States housing bubble collapse than companies in other areas of the country since Pittsburgh experienced steady housing prices during the financial crisis of 2007-2008. In 2009, Heartland Homes expanded into its second state, opening a property in Monongalia County, West Virginia. In 2009, sales fell 8%, which was a much better performance than competitors. In March 2011, the company announced a new 19-home community in Sewickley, Pennsylvania. In August 2011, the company was featured on the HGTV show Showhouse Showdown. In October 2012, the company announced plans to build 300 homes in the North Hills suburb of Pittsburgh. In November 2012, the company pitched a plan to build 30 homes in Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania.

Priest refers to three cases regarding the financing of public schools in California that were decided by the California Supreme Court: Serrano v. Priest, (1971) (Serrano I); Serrano v. Priest, (1976) (Serrano II); and Serrano v. Priest, (1977) (Serrano III).  The Serrano cases  = Serrano I (1971) = Initiated in 1968 in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, Serrano v. Priest (John Serrano was a parent of one of several Los Angeles public school students; Ivy Baker Priest was the California State Treasurer at the time) set forth three causes of action (quotes from the decision). # \\"[As] a direct result of the financing scheme they are required to pay a higher tax rate than [taxpayers] in many other school districts in order to obtain for their children the same or lesser educational opportunities afforded children in those other districts.\\" # \\"[That] an actual controversy has arisen and now exists between the parties as to the validity and constitutionality of the financing scheme under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and under the California Constitution.\\" In an opinion by Justice Raymond L. Sullivan, the Court agreed with the plaintiffs, largely on equal-protection grounds, and returned the case to the trial court for further proceedings. As Sullivan summarizes, \\"We are called upon to determine whether the California public school financing system, with its substantial dependence on local property taxes and resultant wide disparities in school revenue, violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We have determined that this funding scheme invidiously discriminates against the poor because it makes the quality of a child's education a function of the wealth of his parents and neighbors. Recognizing as we must that the right to an education in our public schools is a fundamental interest which cannot be conditioned on wealth, we can discern no compelling state purpose necessitating the present method of financing. We have concluded, therefore, that such a system cannot withstand constitutional challenge and must fall before the equal protection clause.\\"https://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/serrano-v-priest-27628 = Serrano II (1976) = In San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez (1973), the Supreme Court of the United States reversed a similar decision by a Texas District Court, which like Serrano I had been decided on Fourteenth Amendment equal-protection grounds. In Serrano I, however, the California Supreme Court had relied in addition on California's constitution, and in Serrano II they affirmed that basis, protecting the Serrano decisions from Rodriguez. The Serrano II decision also held that the legislative response to Serrano I was insufficient, and affirmed the trial court's order requiring that wealth-based funding disparities between district be reduced to less than $100 by 1980. = Serrano III (1977) = Serrano III dealt primarily with attorneys' fees, but in passing affirmed the trial court's response to the Serrano II decision, including a six-year timetable for bringing the funding system into compliance. = Proposition 13 = The California State Legislature's response to Serrano I and Serrano II was significantly constrained by the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, which reduced property-tax revenues and imposed a 2/3-majority vote requirement for statewide tax increases. The initial property-tax-based solution was replaced by a funding scheme that relied more heavily on state (as opposed to district) revenue, which has remained in effect, with occasional adjustments, ever since.  Compliance (1983)  In 1983, the Los Angeles County Superior Court found, on remand, that the requirements of Serrano II had been sufficiently met, allowing a relatively small number of residual districts to retain a higher level of funding, based on well-above-average local property taxes.

Felton wanted to rid the United States of those he called \\"mud people\\"; Asians, Blacks, Latinos and Jews. A member of the White Order of Thule, Felton was also ironically part African American. Chase was a member of the Creativity Movement. Felton then robbed a bank with a friend from prison and forged money in order to buy materials to create a fertilizer bomb. Targets included the United States Holocaust Museum, the New England Holocaust Memorial; well-known American Jews, including Steven Spielberg; and black leaders, including Rev. Jesse Jackson. An attendant at a donut shop spotted a counterfeit $20 bill that Chase tried to pass him. He alerted an off-duty Boston police officer, who then arrested Chase and Felton.

Felton was sentenced to 21 years in prison, while Chase was sentenced to 57 months, although Judge Nancy Gertner had set aside the jury's conviction on a gun possession charge. A federal appeals court reinstated the gun charge in 2005, requiring Gertner to decide on appending longer sentences within a surplus of five years on Chase and Felton; in 2006, Gertner added a full five years to Felton's sentence (resulting in an increase from 21 years and 10 months to 26 years and 10 months), while only additional three months was appended to Chase's sentence, the judge stating that Chase had \\"made a profound change in her life\\".

As the man in the chair tries to correct him, the man in the hat continues to address him as Bingo at greater and greater volume, ending with a loud shout and cutting off the protests. After a fade to black, the same basic scene begins to play out again, this time with computer-animated characters. A man, \\"Dave,\\" is sitting in a chair under a spotlight and surrounded by darkness. A clown enters, smoking a cigarette, and addresses Dave as \\"Bingo.\\" Dave starts to protest that he's not \\"Bingo the Clown,\\" but the clown ignores him and repeats the phrases \\"Hi, Bingo!\\" and \\"Bingo the Clown!\\" With each repetition, the clown's voice gets louder and he grows physically larger until he is screaming at Dave with a head larger than Dave's entire body. A female harlequin enters, calling for \\"Music, please!\\" As she exits, the stage is illuminated and an instrumental version of the song \\"Daisy Bell\\" (Daisy, Daisy) begins to play. Strange screens rise up from under the floor and begin displaying a series of seemingly random images interspersed with pictures of clowns and the words \\"Hi Bingo!\\" At the same time, the clown begins riding a bicycle in circles around Dave while balancing a piano on one hand, and Dave is bombarded with peanuts. The harlequin descends from the ceiling and orders the music to stop. As she exits, the music stops and the lights dim, leaving Dave alone in a spotlight once again. A little girl clown enters, holding a balloon that keeps bursting and re-inflating in new colors. She addresses Dave as \\"Bingo\\" and warns him that \\"he\\" is coming to \\"check on your progress.\\" When Dave asks if Bingo is the one who is coming, the balloon girl's face transforms into a gigantic, snake-like monster and she shouts that Dave is Bingo. She then turns immediately back into a little girl to inform Dave that \\"he\\" is coming. The first clown walks through the spotlight, still carrying the piano in one hand, and drops his bicycle beside Dave's chair before leaving. The balloon girl calls Dave \\"Bingo\\" again, and when he tries to protest, he is interrupted by the harlequin shouting \\"Music, please!\\" again. The music begins playing again, and the screens also reappear, but are soon replaced by enormous, robotic faces. The balloon girl drifts away on a giant balloon, and a human-sized flea walks past with a sign announcing \\"The Money Guy.\\" The harlequin returns briefly and orders the music to stop before disappearing. When the music stops, there is a strange creature with no legs, many arms, a man's head, and dollar bills sprouting from its neck and arms. It yells at Dave for \\"looking at my money,\\" but then offers to let Dave look at his money. Confused and frightened, Dave declares that yes, he would like to look at the creature's money. The creature congratulates him for being a \\"good, little Bingo.\\" Dave says that he doesn't think that he's Bingo, asking \\"who am I?\\" The harlequin once again calls for music. This time, the lighting does not change, but the money creature is wheeled away as music plays and then fades out. Left alone, Dave says that maybe his is \\"Bingo\\" after all. The clown reappears, sitting in an easy chair, wearing glasses, with an axe embedded in his head. The clown asks Dave to confirm that he is \\"Bingo the Clown.\\" Dave agrees, stating enthusiastically that he is \\"Bingo, Bingo the Clown-o!\\" He stands up and starts dancing around while shaking a baby's rattle. The lights come on, fully illuminating the room, and a voice on a loudspeaker says \\"Thank you. Next.\\" The screen cuts to black, and the credits begin.

There have been more than two hundred individual exhibits of his work, with his murals found in Mexico, Japan and the United States. He received numerous awards for his work including grants as a Creador Art√≠stico of the Sistema Nacional de Creadores de Arte, Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes and Bellas Artes Medal from the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes. Life Gilberto Aceves Navarro was born on September 24, 1931 in Mexico City, to Mar√≠a Francisco de los Angeles Navarro and Juan Aceves Jacques, the youngest of three children. His mother was an opera singer who read tarot cards and practiced other kinds of magical arts. His father was a failed singer who abandoned the family for the best friend of his mother. His mother became pregnant with him to try and bring the father back but it failed. Aceves Navarro began drawing when he was four years of age and stated that since then drawing has been both very easy and a necessary activity for him. Since childhood, he said, he has not been very outgoing and prefers to keep to himself, which is something his role as an artist lets him do. He did not start attending school until he was seven and was hyperactive, learning to read on his own. During his school years, he met Carlos Pellicer, Julio Torri, and Francisco Villase√±or. Later, his family pressured him to study medicine but his middle school teacher intervened and had him apply to the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\". In 1950, he entered the school taking classes with Enrique Assad, Ignacio Aguirre and Carlos Orozco Romero. While at school in 1951, he was an assistant to David Alfaro Siqueiros on work at the dean's offices of UNAM. He was not happy studying at La Esmeralda, having problems with some of his teachers, especially Carlos Orozco Romero, its insistence on studying old paintings and not real life and its lack of opportunities to exhibit new artists' work. He and some friends set up impromptu and unauthorized exhibitions in places such as the Alameda Central and near factories. This prompted the school to create the Nuevas Generaciones Gallery, where he exhibited twice, but also gave him the reputation as a rebel or troublemaker. In 1952, he went with Luis Arenal to help paint the state government palace of Guerrero in Chilpancingo but when he returned three months later, he was not permitted to register. However, he did return clandestinely to study engraving with Isidoro Ocampo. Aceves Navarro met his wife Raquel Rodr√≠guez Brayda Longoria in 1957, while she was a student and he was teaching drawing. They married in 1962 against her parents' wishes although her father eventually accepted him. They had one son, Juan Aceves. Gilberto stated that his commitment to his art supersedes that to his wife and child. 612x612px Career thumb After working with Siqueiros, he began drawing in the street. He headed out in the morning with paper and pencils, at first in Parque M√©xico. He drew what he saw in the park and on the streets from nannies with children to prostitutes. He survived selling these drawings as well as painting calendar for a business called Casa Galas. His first exhibition was called \\"Energ√≠a\\" at the Galer√≠a Nuevas Generaciones at La Esmeralda which was well received. He has had over 200 individual exhibitions of his work since his first in 1954, with participation in over 300 collective shows. Every year since 1970, he has had multiple exhibitions mostly in Mexico but abroad as well. His work has frequently been shown at locations in Mexico City such as the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana (of which he is a member), Galeria del Aeropuerto Internacional, the Museo de la Estampa, Museo Carrillo Gil, Museo de Arte Moderno, the various galleries of the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas and at the Palacio de Bellas Artes.

Sentido del Tiempo, a steel sculpture by Gilberto Aceves Navarro located on Queretaro Aceves Navarro has created monumental works such as murals and sculpture. He has painted twelve murals located in Mexico City, Quer√©taro, Guadalajara, Veracruz, Montreal, Atlanta and Recife. In 1970 he painted the work Yo canto a Vietnam, an acrylic mural at the Mexico Pavilion at the World's Fair in Osaka, Japan. In 1982 he created a mural called Apoteosis de Manuel Tols√° y musa rom√°nticas made of wood, metal, tezontle and glass at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas. In 1993, he created a mural called Una canci√≥n para Atlanta in latex and acrylic for the 1996 Summer Olympics for the Atlanta Olympic Committee. In 1996 he created a mural called La guerra y la Paz at the intersection of Avenida J. Antonio Alzate and Avenida Santa Maria La Ribera in Mexico City. In 2006 he created a sculpture called La fuente de la vida which was installed on Paseo de la Reforma. On 10 April 2010, it was unveiled a new steel sculpture in Parque Tecnologico, a business venue located within Tec de Monterrey College campus Queretaro. Since the 1950s, he has taught art in one form or another to the present. From 1955‚Äì1957 he was a teacher at the Instituto Regional de Bellas Artes in Acapulco. From 1957 to 1961 he gave classes at the Instituto de Intercambio Cultural Mexicano Norteamericano in Los Angeles and the Universidad Femenina in Mexico City. From 1971 to the present he has taught at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°ticas and the Academy of San Carlos.(quien) At the Academy, he worked to break standards which pushed students to copy rather than create although he does not call himself a rebel. In addition to institution-based teaching he has taught in his own studio and given workshops in various locations since 1976. That year he began teaching selected students at his studio, with Gabriel Macotela being the first, with Bety Ezban, Bertha Kolteniuk, T√≥mas G√≥mez Robledo, Anibal Angulo, Carlos Vidal and Francisco Mu√±oz Villagran following. Later students include Ver√≥nica Ruiz de Velasco, Sergio Hernandez, Javier Anzures, Melquiades Gonzales, Magali Lara, Pablo Amor, Manuel Mar√≠n, Marco Arce, Germ√°n Venegas, Gabrial Macotila, Catalina Aroch and Ram√≥n Pe√±aloza. Since 1998, these classes have been held at his studio in Colonia Roma. He has maintained close relationships with a number of his former students. He has also given workshops in Guanajuato, Monterrey, Oaxaca, Mexico City, Colima, Saltillo and Morelia. In 1993 he created the scenery for the play La Ca√≠da de Dr√°cula at the Centro Cultural Hel√©nico, and for En la boca de fuego at C√°rceles de la Perpetua. He received awards from the Salon de la Pl√°stica Mexicana three times (1958, 1964 and 1971). He received the Premio al M√©rito Universitario from UNAM for his teaching work in 1989. In 1997 and 2000, he received grants as a Creador Art√≠stico of the Sistema Nacional de Creadores de Arte, becoming a member of the selection committee in 2002. In 2001, he was inducted into the Academia de Artes and named Creador Em√©rito of Sistema Nacional de Creadores de Arte /CONACULTA. In 2003 he received the Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes in Mexico City and the Bellas Artes Medal from the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes in 2011. Artistry 509x509px Aceves Navarro never retired, even into his eighties, because he loved to paint. He liked to see how colors and forms take shape. He considered art not a simple pleasant vocation but rather a need and a kind of mental exercise. He created murals, oils, drawings, monumental sculpture, theater and poetry. He said that drawing was fundamental to his life, and preferred to work alone in his studio. His art shows influence from David Alfaro Siqueiros, Carlos Orozco Romero, Ra√∫l Anguiano and Ignacio Aguirre. His work is considered to be between that of the Muralist generation and that of the Generaci√≥n de la Ruptura, with elements of both but he preferred to be classed with the Ruptura. Aceves Navarro's work has also been described as a precursor to figurative expressionism.

They typically contain high amounts of fiber. They may belong to one of several groups of multicellular algae: the red algae, green algae, and brown algae. Seaweeds are also harvested or cultivated for the extraction of polysaccharides such as alginate, agar and carrageenan, gelatinous substances collectively known as hydrocolloids or phycocolloids. Hydrocolloids have attained commercial significance, especially in food production as food additives.Round F.E. 1962 The Biology of the Algae. Edward Arnold Ltd. The food industry exploits the gelling, water-retention, emulsifying and other physical properties of these hydrocolloids. Most edible seaweeds are marine algae whereas most freshwater algae are toxic. Some marine algae contain acids that irritate the digestion canal, while some others can have a laxative and electrolyte-balancing effect.Wiseman, John SAS Survival Handbook Most marine macroalgae are nontoxic in normal quantities, but members of the genus Lyngbya are potentially lethal. Typically poisoning is caused by eating fish which have fed on Lyngbya or on other fish which have done so. This is called ciguatura poisoning. Handling Lyngbya majuscula can also cause seaweed dermatitis. Some species of Desmarestia are highly acidic, with vacuoles of sulfuric acid that can cause severe gastrointestinal problems. The dish often served in western Chinese restaurants as 'Crispy Seaweed' is not seaweed but cabbage that has been dried and then fried. Distribution Seaweeds are used extensively as food in coastal cuisines around the world. Seaweed has been a part of diets in China, Japan and Korea since prehistoric times. Australia and New Zealand also have eaten it, but only since Asians reached Australia in the 1800s. Seaweed is also consumed in many traditional European societies, in Iceland and western Norway, the Atlantic coast of France, northern and western Ireland, Wales and some coastal parts of South West England, as well as New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador. The MƒÅori people of New Zealand traditionally used a few species of red and green seaweed. Nutrition and uses Seaweed contains high levels of iodine relative to other foods. In the Philippines, Tiwi, Albay residents created a new pancit or noodles made from seaweed, which can be cooked into pancit canton, pancit luglug, spaghetti or carbonara and is claimed to have health benefitsCooking With Seaweed And The Health Benefits (Infographic) such as being rich in calcium, magnesium and iodine. One study in 2014 pointed to certain species of seaweed as being a possible vegan source of biologically-active Vitamin B12. The study noted that B-12 was found in both raw and roasted seaweed, the latter containing about half as much‚Äîbut still a sufficient amount. A mere 4 grams of dried purple laver is considered sufficient to meet the RDA for B-12. Polysaccharides in seaweed may be metabolized in humans through the action of bacterial gut enzymes. Such enzymes are frequently produced in Japanese population due to their consumption of seaweeds. In some parts of Asia, nori Êµ∑Ëãî (in Japan), zicai Á¥´Ëèú (in China), and gim ÍπÄ (in Korea), sheets of the dried red alga Porphyra are used in soups or to wrap sushi or onigiri. Chondrus crispus (commonly known as Irish moss) is another red alga used in producing various food additives, along with Kappaphycus and various gigartinoid seaweeds. As a nutraceutical product, some edible seaweeds are associated with anti- inflammatory, anti-allergic, antimutagenic, antitumor, antidiabetic, antioxidant, antihyperthensive and neuroprotective properties. Edible red macroalgae such as Palmaria palmata, (Dulse), Porphyra tenera (Nori) and Eisenia bicyclis have been measured as a relevant source of \\"alternative protein, minerals, and, eventually, fiber.\\" Japanese cuisine has seven types of seaweed identified by name, and thus the term for seaweed in Japanese is used primarily in scientific applications, and not in reference to food.

It is under the de facto control Northern Cyprus. The village got its name from Saint Ambrose where a church is dedicated to his name and had one of the largest churches of Cyprus, built in 1910. The church of Saint Ambrose has been now converted into a mosque. Saint Ambrose is numbered among the Saints of Cyprus and had come from Palestine with Saint Epictitus, who gave his name to Agios Epiktitos and other monks chased by the Saracens. Saint Epiktitos lived as an ascetic twenty-seven kilometers to the west and Saint Ambrose lived as an ascetic monk in this area. In the confusion of time instead of honouring Saint Ambrose the local ascetic who became a Saint in Cyprus, some started to honour the more widely known Doctor of the Church Saint Ambrose, bishop of Milan . In Cyprus, the replacement Cypriot Saints with other more known Saints bearing the same name is now a common phenomenon, apparently due to ignorance. Whatever the case, today the survivors of the village honour ( Saint Ambrose, the bishop of Milan who lived in the fourth century, who is a common Saint for both the Eastern and Western Church. However, Saint Ambrose of Milan has no direct relationship with this region or Cyprus generally and the tradition of the island does not link this Saint with the local lore, which links them with the local, Saint Ambrose of Cyprus. The local Saint Ambrose and not Saint of Ambrose of Milan, knew Saint Demitrianos, who lived during the 9th century. At that time Saint Demitrianos was bishop of Chytroi (present day Kythrea). Saint Ambrose sent him by mule drivers hot coals in baskets, Saint Dimitrianos, in return, sent him water from Kephalovryso of Kythrea in baskets as well, which caused the surprise of the villagers. Another local legend involving Ayios Amvrosios involves St Demitrianus. In the far horizon you can see the small rock-island in the Kyrenian pelagos. According to legend there was a sea-beast terrorising the villagers of Ayios Amvrosios. They asked for Ayios Demetrianos help and Ayios Demetrianos transformed the sea-beast into that rock-island. The rock-island is called \\"shiros\\" or \\"katsoshiros\\"and the area there is called also \\"shiros\\". A small seaside chapel was built in honor of St Demitrianus. The memory of the local Saint Ambrose of Cyprus is not celebrated anymore. Turkish Cypriot Agios Amvrosios municipality was founded in 1980. Culture, sports, and tourism Turkish Cypriot Esentepe Sports Club was founded in 1975, and now in Cyprus Turkish Football Association (CTFA) K-PET 1st League.Northern Cyprus Association of Football Clubs The town also has a golf course together with many shops, restaurants, bars, a Health Centre and Pharmacy.

Despite some records, these classes were never \\"doubled\\" to reflect their bogies; for example, the class AVAV never existed. AV In the closing years of the 19th century, the Victorian Railways found itself in need of more passenger carriages. In 1897, a design was settled upon, and carriage AV285 was constructed and brought into use. The number 285 was a follow-on from the AA class of carriages, the last of those having been numbered 284. The \\"V\\" indicated that the carriage was of a vestibule design, with a walk-through connection to the next carriage. The new carriage was long, and the internal layout was similar to the later E, W and S carriages, having compartments with a side corridor. It was the first passenger carriage to include toilets, which were becoming more important, given the longer journeys that could be undertaken by then. With the trial judged a success, construction of carriages 286 and 287 was continued. However, all three cars were renumbered to the AV1-3 series prior to service. By 1898, cars AV 1-7 were all in revenue service, and they were joined by AVs 8-35 by the end of 1899. Some of the carriages were used as \\"joint stock\\", for running between Melbourne and Adelaide, and entered that service directly from the production line. The symbol OA class was painted on their frames, although that was never officially recorded. OAs 31, 32, 34 and 35 were AV 31, 26, 5 and 11 in that order. The cars returned to their AV designations in about 1907, but maintained their alternative designs, having only four doors per side instead of the normal six (doors two and five were deleted, and the space was replaced with wider windows). Cars AV 21 and 23 also had some role in Melbourne- Adelaide services, but it is not known whether they were ever recoded. The carriages were kept in service until the early 1960s, being withdrawn and scrapped between 1962 and 1970. However, a handful of cars were retained, with some being converted for use in the Display Train (see below), and some for heritage operations. BV In parallel with the production of the AV class, second class vehicles were also constructed. The same dimensions and general layout were used, with construction lasting through 1898 and 1899. A total of 25 vehicles were built, numbered from BV1 to BV25. Again, joint stock vehicles were drawn from the class. OBs 33 and 36 were converted from BV's 23 and 6 respectively - however they were never officially recorded as the OB class. The last use of the class was 18BV in the final run of R766 as a coal burner, from Melbourne to Ballarat on December 19th 1999. Steamrail Ballarat intended to restore a number of the cars to active heritage status, and to that end 7BV was fitted with a kiosk in one of the compartments. CV, DV Usually, when the Victorian Railways developed a new type of passenger car, they also produced a matching guards van. The V series was no different, with DV1 and DV2 being constructed in 1898. Those vans were fitted with guard's compartments at each end, and had a large baggage area in the centre. Vans 1 and 2 had small side projections known as \\"duckets\\", which were used by the guard to peer along the side of the train through narrow windows. That was in lieu of the more regular raised observation compartments, and so CV's 1 and 2 were unique for their era in having flat roofs. In 1906, the class was increased, with DV3 to DV7 brought into service. None of those vans had duckets, instead returning to the norm of raised observation areas. Those vans also had three double-doors per side rather than two.http://www.victorianrailways.net/guards%20vans/guards%20pages/cv/cv.html In the 1910 recoding, the DV class was recoded to CV, but the numbers were unchanged. The class outlasted the AV and BV passenger carriages by about two decades, with all vans still in service in 1980. Over time, the class had their timber sides replaced with steel sheeting, and vans 3-7 had their louvres replaced with flat panels, but otherwise they remained in as-built condition for most of their lives. State Car 2 (Alexandra/Melville) & State Car 3 (Edward/Carey) State Cars 2 and 3 were built in 1901 at Newport Workshops, and entered service on 30 April that year. The two cars were largely based on the existing V type carriage design, with a body and bogie centres. The main difference was the roof style, which was clerestory but with curved ends as would be applied to the later E type carriages. While under construction, official correspondence referred to the two vehicles as Royal carriages. After entry to service, State Car No.2 was named Alexandra and Stare Car No.3 was named Edward. The names appear on the carriage drawings centred above the windowline, but no photos exist of the cars to indicate whether they were applied. The official diagrams issued in the Victorian Railways 1904 and 1908 rolling stock registers mixed up the two underframes, with Alexandra being marked as State Car No.3 and Edward as State Car No.2, and their marked tare weights also being swapped. State Car 2 Alexandra had two saloons, one either end, joined by a corridor serving two lavatories, a private sitting compartment for eight, and an attendant's compartment with room for three including a small stove. Four doors were provided on each side, to access the saloons and the compartments (or the corridor directly opposite the compartments). Because of the internal layout the doors were not uniformly spaced. State Car 3 Edward had two central saloons of with three chairs and a two-seater couch each, a small attendants' compartment with stove and a gentleman's lavatory at one end, and a four-seater private compartment adjacent to the ladies' lavatory at the other end. The car was accessed via the end diaphragms or via the four doors either side, which were roughly equally spaced. Both cars were removed from Royal Train duties in 1919, following the successful introduction of State Car No.4 based on the E type carriage design, which had sufficient facilities to cover both the earlier cars' roles in a special consist. =Alexandra= Alexandra's body was lifted in 1919, and the frame was cut in half and a section was spliced into the frame. The end diaphragms were removed and replaced with platforms, and the interior was rebuilt. The modified car was renamed Melville, and had two couches with a table and one couch in the formerly ladies-end saloon, which was extended from to . The ladies' lavatory was abolished, and the compartments were reorganised to a small attendant's storage closet (), then a conductor's compartment (). The former men's lavatory was made unisex, but split into the lavatory section and a shower section; the latter only accessible from the former mens-end saloon. That end saloon was fitted with a single bed-chair, and two couches of and ; the latter had to be shifted to access the shower compartment. The four external body doors either side were all sealed but their window spacing was retained, and access to the car was exclusively via the end platforms. In the new form, the car was named Melville.http://www.pjv101.net/cd/pages/c160v24.htmhttp://www.pjv101.net/cd/pages/c160v03.htm Melville Between 1932 and 1935 the car was leased by Jack Young of Ballarat, who used the car as a mobile radio station broadcasting to towns in the region for three to six days. During this period the car had \\"MOBILE BROADCASTING SERVICE\\" above the windowline, and \\"3YB\\" - the car's callsign - below. A further rebuild in 1952 saw the long saloon cleared out, with the space instead used for a four-cylinder A.E.C engine and Stones 44/29 T.E.F.C. Generator; the conductor's compartment was rebuilt as a kitchen area, and the short saloon was fitted with two bunk beds and wardrobes. The car was repainted to Victorian Railways blue and yellow in 1959, and fitted with 50 ton aligned bogies in 1989. It was used on the Train of Knowledge to provide power for heating and lighting (and air conditioning for some vehicles), and when that service was withdrawn it was allocated to the Seymour Rail Heritage Centre. In 2018 a proposal to refurbish the carriage was floated on behalf of the Mornington Railway Preservation Society, requesting $109,000 for restoration \\"as a mobile showpiece and educational experience\\". However, the project did not receive enough community support and, as of late 2018, remains unfunded.https://pickmyproject.vic.gov.au/rounds/pick-my-project/ideas/royal- railway-carriage-for-mornington Despite this, the vehicle was trucked from Newport Workshops to Moorooduc in September 2018.Newsrail, January 2019, p.27 =Edward= Edward was modified in 1919, with the ladies' end compartment abolished and replaced with three showers, the attendant's compartment seat modified allowing conversion to a sleeping berth, and the car was renamed Carey. A new underframe was placed under the vehicle, based on the Tait motor carriage outside-channel construction, but the car length was retained.http://www.pjv101.net/cd/pages/c160v02.htm The car was damaged at Seymour and taken off register in June 1955, and scrapped at Newport Workshops on 28 June 1961. The name Carey was recycled on a guard's van that became the new shower car.http://www.pjv101.net/cd/pages/c160v25.htm The Display Train As new carriages were introduced in the mid-1960s, it was found that the V-series passenger cars were becoming surplus. Rather than scrapping the fleet, in 1966 cars AV 22, 4, 6 and 29 lost the AV classification and became cars 1-4. in 1968 these were joined by BV's 9 and 21, these being renumbered simply \\"5\\" and \\"6\\". In 1975 guards van CV2 was modified to become a power generator for the set, but it was not externally altered. The carriage interiors were obliterated and replaced with advertising material; the outsides were sheathed in aluminium cladding, essentially creating a set of billboards on wheels. However the original carriages were more-or-less retained under the shell; photos exist of some of the carriages with the shell half-removed , revealing the passenger car's original exterior in worse-than- average condition. Of course the train was not in use every day, and for most of its life it was stored in Newport Workshops, with tours about every two years. By the 1980s it was obvious the idea was a mistake, and the train was withdrawn from service. Display Car 1 was sold privately in Rosebud, on 20 July 1982,Newsrail February 1986 p57 and Display Car 2 to the Blue Lake Model Railway Society in Mount GambierNewsrail February 1986 p57Newsrail March 1989 p73 on 24 January 1983. The remaining vehicles 3-6 were sold to St George Metal Co., a metal recycling company in Coburg, on 2 February 1983.Newsrail February 1986 p57 The Vintage Train Most of the carriages predating the V subtype had been withdrawn by the late 1960s and scrapped, so these were the only carriages remaining that could serve as a \\"vintage train\\" for leasing. Remaining V type carriages were not required for daily service, so they were instead put aside from normal running, intended to be used on specials. The train ran from 1967 to 1983, after which the remaining carriages were formally entered into the state heritage register. First class accommodation on the train was provided with AV cars in the group 1, 12, 16, 23 (Parlor), 30, 32 (Parlor) and 35, along with 45ABL, 12BL/Pioneer and 13BL/Enterprise. 12AV only lasted to 1970 and 16AV for only a few months, but the rest of the cars ran right through to 1983 and all bar 35AV were preserved with that last unit written off. Second class carriages included most of the BV fleet - cars 1, 3-8, 10-11, 15-20 and 24. Cars were run until in need of maintenance, then withdrawn and scrapped. The first to go was 20BV in 1967, only a few months after the train had started running. This was followed in 1968 with class members 10BV, 16BV, 17BV and 24BV, and in 1970 cars 4BV, 5BV, 11BV and 15BV. In 1973 6BV was also scrapped. The remainder - 1, 3, 7, 8, 18 and 19, were retained until 1981 when 1BV was scrapped; the rest entered formal preservation sometime between 1981 and 1983. Other cars known to have been included were some BC vans, with one end fitted with dual couplings since the R Class locomotives - then the most popular choice for heritage steam specials - were not compatible with screw couplings. When the BC cars were removed from service, the function of conversion cars was taken up by ABU carriages, about half of which had dual- or screw-couplings on at least one end. Disposal and Preservation The vast majority of carriages listed on this page were destroyed and burnt as a quick, easy form of disposal. Some were sold as sheds or a cheap form of housing, and a handful were retained for preservation. The current known remnants are: * 1, 23, 32AV; 3, 7, 8, 18, 19BV, Enterprise and Pioneer are at Newport Workshops, East Block. * 30AV formerly at Trentham * 1CV at Ballarat East * 5CV at Moorooduc * 6CV was sold privately, and as of February 2019 it was listed on Facebook for purchase.https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/826144407732518/ * 7CV was held by Seymour Rail Heritage Centre for a number of years; on 20 September 2015 it was transferred to Moorooduc for restoration, so that it can replace 5CV on tourist train duties, allowing that vehicle to be overhauled. Model Railways =O Scale= Veteran Models has released AV, BV & CV brass and whitemetal kits in 0 Scale (1:48). =HO Scale= Blue and Gold Models will be producing an HO scale resin kit of the V-series passenger carriages, with brass bogies supplied by Trainbuilder. CV's 3 to 7 have been produced as a resin kit by Lyndon's Basic Australian Trains; the kit is designed to represent 1960's onwards but can be backdated with additional handrails. As of May 2019 Trainbuilder are producing AV, BV, ABL, CV passenger cars It would likely be far easier to scratchbuild a display train, rather than converting a V kit.

The airport opened in November 1946 and was named for George Armstrong Custer, who spent much of his early life in Monroe. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017‚Äì2021, in which it is categorized as a local general aviation facility. Custer Airport is owned by the city of Monroe and is financially supported through hangar rentals, landing fees, and fuel sales. It is located on North Custer Road (formerly designated as M-130) about two miles (3.2 km) northwest of Monroe's downtown area. The airport property itself--occupying --is an exclave of the city limits and is separated by a one-quarter mile (0.4 km) wide undeveloped residential area belonging to Frenchtown Charter Township. Since the city owns the airport, the area it occupies was incorporated into the city limits. Munson Park, the largest public recreation park in Monroe, occupies the land immediately east of the airport. The River Raisin is just south of the airport, and farmland surrounds the airport to the west and north. Facilities Light beacon, hangar, and tarmacTarmac and hangar/terminal The airport has one asphalt runway (3-21) with a full length taxiway. Both are illuminated with high intensity lighting, runway 21 has runway end identifiers (REILS) and both runways have visual approach slope indicators (VASI). The airport has no regularly scheduled flights or arrivals. As a general aviation airport, it is mainly used by private pilots for personal and business use, as well as a variety of chartered aircraft bringing people in to do business in Monroe County. Custer Airport is able to accommodate a large variety of aircraft, including single engine aircraft, twin engine aircraft, and business jets such as the Cessna Citation and Learjet. The airport has personal hangars that house approximately 45 airplanes and a large hangar that houses several corporate aircraft as well as the Monroe Aviation School of Flight and Monroe Aviation Aircraft Maintenance. In addition, a Michigan Civil Air Patrol aircraft is stationed at the airport. The Monroe County Sheriff Department maintains hangars for its helicopter operations. The airport has 100LL fuel available 24 hours through self-serve as well as full-service Jet-A fuel. In 2007, there was an average of 65 flights per day for a yearly total of 11,389. The airport operates continuously and is staffed from 8:00 AM‚Äì5:00 PM with after-hours services available through prior arrangement. Custer Airport has no control tower, and instrument traffic is handled by the Cleveland Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZOB) in coordination with the Detroit Approach and Departure Control. The nearest neighboring airports that can accommodate flights from Custer Airport are Lenawee County Airport to the west, Toledo Suburban Airport to the southwest, and Grosse Ile Municipal Airport to the north. Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport and Toledo Express Airport are within close proximity and are used regularly by pilots departing Monroe for both business and training purposes. =Security concerns= Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, local concerns were raised that Custer Airport could be shut down by government intervention because of the airport's close proximity to a nuclear power plant. Custer Airport is located approximately from the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station in neighboring Frenchtown Charter Township. It was proposed that airports within of a nuclear power plant be shut down until tighter security policies and government mandates could be enacted by both the airports and nuclear power plants. Custer Airport was ultimately not affected and experienced no changes in security procedures or operations, because security was deemed more than adequate at the small airport. Accidents *At around 3:45 in the afternoon of March 29, 2011, a Piper Malibu airplane carrying three male passengers crashed into a soccer field in neighboring Munson Park. The plane departed from Toledo Suburban Airport (located about 15 miles south of Custer Airport in Whiteford Township) earlier that morning and traveled about southeast to Bedford County Airport in Pennsylvania. The plane soon departed back to Michigan to land at Custer Airport. However, as it approached the airport, witnesses, primarily the St. Mary Catholic Central High School tennis team practicing in the courts from the crash site, say the plane circled low and was encountering problems. The plane exploded upon impact with the ground. All three passengers were killed. Subsequent investigations by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. The plane was configured with landing gear and flaps retracted. Toxicology performed on the pilot showed the presence of hydrocodone and dihydrocodeine. The NTSB concluded that the accident was probably caused by the pilot showing poor judgement by attempting a high-speed pass several feet over the runway and subsequently failing to maintain clearance from the runway.

Despite numerous impeachment investigations and votes to impeach a number of presidents by the House of Representatives, only three presidents in U.S. history have been impeached by the House: Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump. Impeachment proceedings against a fourth, Richard Nixon, began and made it out of committee, but he resigned before the actual debate on the floor of the House began. To date, no president impeached by the House of Representatives has ever been removed from office by the Senate. Presidents While there have been demands for the impeachment of most presidents, only three -- Andrew Johnson in 1868, Bill Clinton in 1999, and Donald Trump in 2019 -- have actually been impeached. All three were acquitted by the United States Senate and not removed from office. Removal requires an impeachment vote from the House of Representatives and a conviction from the Senate. Impeachment proceedings against Richard Nixon made it out of committee, but he resigned before the actual debate on the floor of the House began. Every President elected since 1980 has been the subject of at least one resolution introduced into Congress with the purpose of impeachment. The following presidents have had resolutions introduced to initiate proceedings and many have gotten to the hearing stage. =John Tyler (Democratic-Republican turned Whig)= John Tyler was the first president to have impeachment proceedings laid against them. A number of attempts to remove President John Tyler from office failed. On January 10, 1843, Rep. John Minor Botts, of Virginia introduced a resolution that charged \\"John Tyler, Vice President acting as President\\" with nine counts of impeachable offenses, including corruption and official misconduct.Presidential Fact Book, by Joseph Nathan Kane (1999), pg. 67 The resolution was defeated, 83‚Äì127. After Tyler vetoed a tariff bill in June 1842, the House of Representatives initiated the first impeachment proceedings against a president in American history. A committee headed by former president John Quincy Adams, then a congressman, condemned Tyler's use of the veto and stated that Tyler should be impeached. (essay by Richard P. McCormick) (This was not only a matter of the Whigs supporting the bank and tariff legislation which Tyler vetoed. Until the presidency of the Whigs' archenemy Andrew Jackson, presidents vetoed bills rarely, and then generally on constitutional rather than policy grounds, (essay by Richard B. Latner) so Tyler's actions also went against the Whigs' concept of the presidency.) Adams then proposed a constitutional amendment to change the two-thirds requirement to override a veto to a simple majority, but neither house passed such a measure. =James Buchanan (Democrat)= During most of 1860, the \\"Covode Committee\\" held hearings on whether to impeach President James Buchanan. While it found no real cause, it did find that his administration was the most corrupt since the foundation of the Republic. =Andrew Johnson (National Union; formerly Democrat)= The 1868 House impeachment committee (from a photograph by Mathew Brady), seated (left to right): Benjamin F. Butler, Thaddeus Stevens, Thomas Williams, John A. Bingham, standing (left to right): James F. Wilson, George S. Boutwell, John A. Logan Several attempts were made to remove President Andrew Johnson from office. The first occurred on January 7, 1867, when Rep. James M. Ashley of Ohio, introduced a resolution accusing him of corruption. On November 21, 1867, the House Judiciary Committee produced a bill of impeachment that consisted of a vast collection of complaints against Johnson. After a furious debate, a formal vote was held in the House of Representatives on December 5, 1867, which failed 57-108.Trefousse, 1989 pages 302‚Äì3 Another impeachment vote the following year succeeded, and a Senate trial acquitted Johnson by one vote. =Ulysses S. Grant (Republican)= Near the end of Grant's second term as U.S. president in 1876, Democratic congressmen looking for political advantage against Republicans in the upcoming election threatened to impeach him after a turbulent year of administration scandals. The effort began during the impeachment trial for Grant's Secretary of War, William W. Belknap, on charges of allegedly taking extortion money from a contractor in the Trader post scandal. Although no evidence bore on Grant directly, this and several political controversies had come into public view that year, including a Navy Department scandal that involved members of his wife's family and the Whiskey Ring, which resulted in the indictment of Grant's personal secretary, Orville E. Babcock. Grant removed Babcock from his administration after he was subsequently indicted in the Safe burglary conspiracy. Hoping to further discredit the president, the Democrats' impeachment attempt focused on the amount of time Grant had been absent from his presidential duties. Congressman Joseph Blackburn introduced the impeachment measure, but proceedings never began. Congress tabled the resolution after the November election. =Grover Cleveland (Democrat)= Representative Milford W Howard, of Alabama, on May 23, 1896, submitted a resolution (H.Res 374) impeaching President Grover Cleveland for selling unauthorized federal bonds and breaking the Pullman strike. It wasn't voted on or referred to a committee. =Herbert Hoover (Republican)= Louis T. McFadden was notable for trying to impeach officials. During the 1932‚Äì33 lame-duck session of Congress, Congressman Louis Thomas McFadden twice introduced impeachment resolutions against President Herbert Hoover.76 Cong. Rec. 399 (1932). The resolutions were tabled by wide margins. =Harry S. Truman (Democrat)= In April 1951, President Harry S. Truman fired General of the Army Douglas MacArthur. Congressional Republicans responded with numerous calls for Truman's removal. The Senate held hearings, and a year later, Congressmen George H. Bender and Paul W. Shafer separately introduced House bills 607 and 614 against President Truman. The resolutions were referred to the Judiciary Committee98 Cong. Rec. 4325, 4518 (1952) which, being run by Democrats, sat on them. However, the US Senate held extensive hearings on the matter. On April 22, 1952, Representative Noah M. Mason, of Illinois, suggested that impeachment proceedings should be started against President Truman for seizing the nation's steel mills. Soon after Mason's remarks, Rep.Robert Hale of Maine, introduced a resolution (H.Res. 604).H.Res. 604 (82ndCong., 2ndsess.). See also \\"Seizure of Steel Mills,\\" remarks in the: House, CongressionalRecord,vol.98,April 22, 1952,pp.4222,4240. After three days of debate on the floor of the House, it was referred to the Judiciary where it died. =Richard M. Nixon (Republican)= President Richard Nixon leaving the White House on Marine One shortly before his resignation became effective, August 9, 1974 On October 30, 1973, the House Judiciary Committee began consideration of the possible impeachment of Richard Nixon. The initial straight party-line votes by a 21‚Äì17 margin that established an impeachment inquiry were focused around how extensive the subpoena powers Rodino would have would be. After a three-month-long investigation, and with public pressure to impeach the president growing, the House passed a resolution, , on February 6, 1974, that gave the Judiciary Committee authority to actually investigate charges against the President.-50-63 The hearings lasted until the summer when, after much wrangling, the Judiciary Committee voted three articles of impeachment to the floor of the House, the furthest an impeachment proceeding had progressed in over a century. With the release of new tapes ‚Äî after the administration lost the case of US v. Nixon ‚Äî and with impeachment and removal by the Senate all but certain, on August 9, 1974, Nixon became the first president to resign. =Ronald Reagan (Republican)= On March 6, 1987, Representative Henry B. Gonzalez introduced articles of impeachment against President Ronald Reagan regarding the Iran Contra affair, leading to the joint hearings that dominated the summer. A special prosecutor was appointed. =George H. W. Bush (Republican)= On January 16, 1991, Congressman Henry B. Gonzalez introduced H. Res. 34 to impeach President George H. W. Bush for starting the Gulf War. The resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee, where it was struck down.137 Cong. Rec. 1736 (1991). Gonzalez tried again with H. Res. 86 on February 21. Both bills were referred to the Subcommittee on Economic and Commercial Law on March 18, 1992, where the efforts also failed. =Bill Clinton (Democrat)= Clinton and Lewinsky on a 1998 Abkhazia stamp, the scandal caused derision throughout the world On November 5, 1997, Representative Bob Barr introduced a resolution, H. Res. 581, directing the House Judiciary Committee to inquire into impeachment proceedings‚Äîmonths before the Monica Lewinsky scandal came to light. Foremost among the concerns Barr cited at the time was alleged obstruction of Justice Department investigations into Clinton campaign fundraising from foreign sources, chiefly the People's Republic of China. The resolution was referred to the Rules Committee for further action,143 Cong. Rec. 10,105 (1997). which tabled the resolution. Later, Clinton was impeached and acquitted over charges relating to the Lewinsky scandal. =George W. Bush (Republican)= Due to the Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, President George W. Bush and other officials were targets of impeachment efforts. None of these efforts advanced past the hearing stage. =Barack Obama (Democrat)= In March 2012, Representative Walter B. Jones introduced H. Con. Res. 107, calling for Congress to hold the sentiment that certain actions of President Barack Obama be considered as impeachable offenses, including the CIA's drone program in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The resolution died in the House Judiciary Committee. On December 3, 2013, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on whether or not to impeach the president. At the hearing, there were views among Republicans that the president had not done his duty and that he abused his executive power. Ultimately, no list of articles of impeachment was ever drawn up and proposed to the Judiciary Committee for Obama or anyone in his cabinet. Obama was the first president in 28 years who managed to have not one article of impeachment against him referred to the House Judiciary Committee. =Donald Trump (Republican)= G20 Hamburg summit Within weeks of taking office, members of Congress declared that President Trump may have committed impeachable offenses in relation with Executive Order 13769. On July 12, 2017, Representative Al Green (D) and Representative Brad Sherman (D) introduced H. Res. 438, exhibiting one article of impeachment. This and later motions were eventually tabled by a large majority or died in committee. On September 24, 2019, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry into President Trump based on allegations laid out in a whistleblower report. A resolution enacting a rules package to govern the investigation was passed on 31 October by a vote of 232-196 in which all Republicans and two Democrats voted against the resolution. Public impeachment hearings began in the House on 13 November, and on December 10, 2019 the House Judiciary Committee published two articles of impeachment against President Trump, charging him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives on December 18, 2019. The impeachment trial of Donald Trump was then held from January 16 to February 5, 2020, with the Republican- controlled Senate acquitting Trump. After Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, died on September 18, 2020, several Democratic congressmembers talked about reviving impeachment as a tactic to prevent Trump from nominating a conservative successor to replace the liberal Ginsburg, slowing down the Senate's confirmation process. Vice Presidents A glaring and disturbing gap was filled in a change of rules during the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton in 1999. Prior to this, Vice Presidents were authorized to preside over an impeachment trial of themselves. the Senate has now authorized the Chief Justice to preside in such a circumstance.https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/senaterules.htm As of January 2020, no Vice President has been impeached. =Schuyler Colfax (Republican)= Vice President Schuyler Colfax's name surfaced during witness testimony in a House investigation of the Cr√©dit Mobilier scandal. Under this cloud of suspicion, on February 20, 1873, Congressman Fernando Wood introduced a resolution to investigate the Vice President's conduct.Cong. Globe, 42nd Cong., 3rd Sess. 1544 (1873). The House, however, refused to consider Wood's resolution, primarily because Colfax was leaving office in a little over two weeks. Then a second resolution was introduced by Congressman Tyner, calling for a general investigation into the witness testimony to see if anyone else warranted impeachment. This resolution was adopted and referred to the Judiciary Committee, which buried it. =Spiro Agnew (Republican)= In the early spring of 1973, the U.S. attorney in Maryland, investigating illegal campaign contributions and kickbacks, discovered that Vice President Spiro Agnew had been taking kickbacks from local contractors as late as December 1972. The scandal became public in the summer of that year, and as the days progressed, it appeared that an indictment was imminent. So, on the theory that a sitting Vice President couldn't be indicted, at least while an impeachment proceeding was going on, Agnew asked the House to start one in a letter dated September 15, 1973.119 Cong. Rec. 31,368 (1973). On September 26, 1973, the House took up debate on Vice President Agnew's request. Congressman Paul Findley offered a resolution, H. Res. 569, appointing a Select Committee to investigate the Vice President. The resolution was referred to the Rules Committee, which sat on it while Attorney General Elliot Richardson negotiated a plea bargain with the soon-to-be-disgraced Vice President. Agnew resigned on October 10, 1973; by unanimous consent of the House, the Judiciary Committee was discharged from further investigation under House Resolution 572. =George H. W. Bush (Republican)= =Dick Cheney (Republican)= In April 2007, United States Representative Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) filed an impeachment resolution () against Vice President Dick Cheney, seeking his trial in the Senate on three charges. After months of inaction, Kucinich re-introduced the exact content of H. Res 333 as a new resolution numbered in November 2007. Both resolutions were referred to the Judiciary Committee immediately after their introduction and the committee did not consider either. Both resolutions expired upon the termination of the 110th United States Congress on January 3, 2009. Attorneys General While impeachment proceedings against cabinet secretaries is an exceedingly rare event, no office has provoked the ire of the House of Representatives than that of Attorney General. During the first fifth of the 21st century, no less than three Attorneys General have been subjected to the process. = Harry M. Daugherty (Harding/Coolidge)= In 1922, the House Judiciary Committee held hearings on whether to impeach Attorney General Harry Daugherty. Despite evidence of wrongdoing, impeachment articles weren't reported to the full House. However it was his alleged knowledge of a kickback scam involving bootleggers (operated by his chief aide Jess Smith) that led to his eventual resignation on March 28, 1924. As the subject of a U.S. Senate investigation begun the year before, spearheaded under the direction of Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana, Daugherty, was eventually found not guilty in the investigation. =Griffin Bell ‚Äì (Carter)= On February 6, 1978, a resolution, H. Res. 1002, was introduced authorizing the Judiciary Committee to investigate Attorney General Griffin Bell. The resolution was referred to the Rules Committee.124 Cong. Rec. 2428 (1978) A week later, Rep Philip Crane, introduced H. Res. 1025. It was also referred to the Rules Committee.124 Cong. Rec. 3486 (1978) and both never saw the light of day again. =Alberto Gonzales ‚Äì (G.W. Bush)= Gonzales and his wife Rebecca, with George W. Bush and Laura Bush at the Prairie Chapel Ranch on August 26, 2007, the day that Gonzales's resignation was accepted. On July 7, 2007, Rep. Jay Inslee and 31 co- sponsorshttps://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/07/31/democrats-call-for- gonzales-impeachment-hearings/ introduced H. Res. 589, which sought impeachment hearings by the Judiciary Committee against Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.https://swampland.time.com/2007/07/30/gonzales_articles_of_impeachme/ It was referred to the Rules Committee instead. While there were no hearings, pressure mounted, and Gonzales resigned less than two months later. =Eric Holder ‚Äì (Obama)= On November 7, 2013, Rep. Ted Yoho announced that he and some colleagues were going to introduce a resolution impeaching Attorney General Holder. On Nov. 12, it was leaked to the press that Congressman Pete Olson(R-TX) and co-sponsors Reps. Phil Roe (R-TN), Ted Yoho (R-FL), Lynn Westmoreland (R-GA), Larry Bucshon (R-IN), Blake Farenthold (R-TX), Randy Weber (R-TX) and Roger Williams (R-TX). had written a detailed set of articles which were introduced as H.Res 411 The resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee, where it was never heard from again. = William Barr ‚Äî (Trump) = On June 30, 2020, Tennessee Democratic Representative Steve Cohen and 35 cosponsors introduced a resolution (H.Res.1032) on the House floor calling for the impeachment of Attorney General William Barr for many instances of alleged malfeasance. https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4890261/house-democrat-introduces-resolution- calling-impeachment-attorney-general-william- barrhttps://cohen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-cohen- introduces-resolution-investigate-and-consider Hearings on the topic on a more general fashion had already taken place.https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2020/06/24/barr-roger- stone-mueller-doj/https://www.businessinsider.com/live-house-judiciary- committee-hearing-aaron-zelinsky-testimony-2020-6 Earlier in the month, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler called the effort a waste of time,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/06/impeaching-barr-waste-time-top- democrat-200621184133329.html, considering the impeachment of President Trump earlier in the year (see above).

Other Cabinet secretaries As of July 2020, only one Cabinet Secretary, William W. Belknap, has actually been impeached. Two others resigned while impeachment proceedings were taking place. =Secretary of War William Belknap (Democrat before 1865, Republican 1865-1890)= In 1876, William W. Belknap was impeached by a unanimous vote of the House of Representatives shortly after he had resigned for allegedly having received money in return for post tradership appointments.Precedents, Volume III, Chapter LXXVII, section 2444, pp. 903‚Äì904. Speaker of the House Michael C. Kerr wrote to the Senate that Belknap resigned \\"with intent to evade the proceedings of impeachment against him.\\"Precedents, Volume III, Chapter LXXVII, section 2454, p. 922. Belknap was tried by the Senate, which ruled by a vote of 37-29 that it had jurisdiction despite the resignation.Precedents, Volume III, Chapter LXXVII, section 2459, p. 934 The vote on conviction fell short of the two-thirds required, with 35 to 37 votes for each article and 25 votes against each. Two of those voting for conviction, 22 of those voting for acquittal, and one who declined to vote said they felt that the Senate did not have jurisdiction due to Belknap's resignation.Precedents, Volume III, Chapter LXXVII, section 2467, pp. 945‚Äì946. =Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon (Republican)= In January 1932, Rep. Wright Patman and others introduced articles of impeachment against Andrew Mellon, with hearings before the House Judiciary Committee at the end of that month. After the hearings were over, but before the scheduled vote on whether to report the articles to the full House, Mellon accepted an appointment to the post of Ambassador to the Court of St. James, and resigned, thus rendering further action on the issue moot. = Secretary of the Treasury William Woodin, Eugene Meyer, Andrew Mellon and Federal Reserve Board (All Republicans)= On May 23, 1933 Rep. Louis Thomas McFadden introduced articles of impeachment against Eugene Meyer, Secretary of the Treasury William Woodin, two former Treasury Secretaries (Andrew Mellon and Ogden L. Mills); J. F. T. O'Connor (Comptroller of Currency); John W. Pole (former Comptroller of Currency); four members and three former members of the Federal Reserve Board; twelve Federal Reserve Agents; and one former Federal Reserve Agent. There was a hearing on the subject before the House Judiciary committee, but nothing became of it. =Francis Perkins (Democrat)‚Äì Labor Secretary, James Houghteling (?)‚Äì Immigration and Naturalization Commissioner and Gerard Reilly (?)‚Äì Solicitor of the Department of Labor= On January 24, 1939, Rep. J. Parnell Thomas offered an impeachment resolution against the above federal officials.84 Cong. Rec. 702 (1939) The resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee,84 Cong. Rec. 711 (1939) where it died a quiet death. Congressional conservatives were angered with Secretary Francis Perkins when she had refused to deport Harry Bridges, the head of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. Bridges, an Australian longshoreman who came to America in 1920, was accused of being a Communist. =Donald Rumsfeld ‚Äì Secretary of Defense of the United States= On June 20, 2004, angered by the War in Iraq, Rep. Charles Rangel and four co-sponsors introduced H.Res 629 which sought impeachment hearings by the Judiciary Committee against Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. It was referred to the HJC's subcommittee on the Constitution, where it died. Federal Reserve Board  The three attempts to remove all or part of the Federal Reserve Board failed. Board of Governors meeting January 1, 1922. =Lindbergh's attempt= On February 12, 1917, Rep Charles Lindbergh, Sr., father of \\"Lucky Lindy\\", offered articles of impeachment against five members of the Federal Reserve Board.

Retrieved 2015-10-28 Those sponsoring the impeachment resolution to remove Koskinen from office accused him of failing to prevent the destruction of evidence in allowing the erasure of back-up tapes containing thousands of e-mails written by Lois Lerner, and of making false statements under oath to Congress. In a statement released by the Committee, Chaffetz said Koskinen \\"failed to comply with a congressionally issued subpoena, documents were destroyed on his watch, and the public was consistently misled. Impeachment is the appropriate tool to restore public confidence in the IRS and to protect the institutional interests of Congress.\\" The IRS said on October 27 that it did not have an immediate comment on the impeachment resolution. Representative Elijah Cummings (D-Maryland), the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement: \\"This ridiculous resolution will demonstrate nothing but the Republican obsession with diving into investigative rabbit holes that waste tens of millions of taxpayer dollars while having absolutely no positive impact on a single American.

Formed in 1996 as a guitar-and-drums duo consisting of John Humphrey and Scott Giampino, they released three full-length albums for Touch and Go Records and a variety of singles and a full-length for Orange Recordings. Cash Audio toured nationally and performed live until 2002. History Cash Audio was originally named Cash Money and was formed in 1996 by John Humphrey and Scott Giampino while playing with The Late Great Danes. Humphrey‚Äôs previous band was God and Texas (Ohio/ Chicago on Rave and Restless Records), while Giampino played with local Chicago group the Mystery Girls while also doing a stint with the infamous GG Allin and the Toilet Rockers. Conceived as a two-piece rock band, the duo's style quickly led them to be categorized in the blues minimalist genre that gained popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s. They were known for their strong musicianship and great live shows (including frying bacon on stage with a hot plate). Cash Audio's music covered a variety of classic styles, including rock, blues, country, and R&B.; During the early 2000s the final recordings of the group focused on strong thematic instrumentals. Naming Controversy Originally named Cash Money, the band received national attention in 1999 in Rolling Stone # 814, in a humorous sidebar piece comparing Cash Money‚Äôs low-key touring style (two guys in a station wagon) to the excesses of the hip-hop stars of New Orleans' Cash Money Records. Lawyers from Cash Money Records quickly sent Touch and Go Records a cease and desist for Cash Money \\"the band\\". Fresh off the legal settlements with several other acts and in order to avoid the costs of another legal battle, Corey Rusk, President of Touch and Go, and the band decided to change their name to Cash Audio for their upcoming Green Bullet release in 2000. Recording and touring history 1996- 2002 Cash Audio had a strict discipline for analog recording and recorded exclusively in Chicago from 1996 to 2001, at Idful, King Size, Clava and Engine Studios, with a single session at Chase Park Transductions in Athens, Georgia, in 1999. Three full-length albums were released by Touch and Go Records, while four releases and all its vinyl recordings were released on Orange Recordings Cash Audio toured and performed with many well known acts on the Touch and Go label including, Calexico, Girls Against Boys, Killdozer, Man or Astroman, The Delta 72, Arcwelder, P.W. Long, New Wet Kojak and Silkworm. They also toured or performed with numerous bands on Seattle's Sub Pop label, including the Supersuckers, Zen Guerilla and Mudhoney. Cash Audio‚Äôs last live performance was the opening slot for Mudhoney on September 21, 2002, at Chicago‚Äôs Abbey Pub. In 2008 a recording from 1999 done for a Killdozer compilation tribute album was released.

Description This annual herb grows up to about half a meter tall and bears lobed, hairy, petioled leaves with blades up to 10 centimeters wide. The inflorescence is an umbel of lavender flowers with five petals each about a centimeter long and often dark-striped. The fruit has a hairy base just over half a centimeter long and a style which may reach 8 centimeters in length. This plant is very similar to Erodium botrys and is often overlooked as such, but brachycarpum is a smaller plant overall. Flowers are about a third the size of botrys, and the style is smaller than 80 mm rather than larger.

Lloyd, who twisted kraft paper around a metal wire, placed the paper threads on a loom and wove them into what was to become the traditional Lloyd Loom fabric. Lloyd Loom chairs quickly became very popular in the United States and in 1921, Marshall B. Lloyd sold the British rights to W (William) Lusty & Sons, who used the Lloyd Loom fabric to create a range of furniture simpler in design than the American originals. At the height of its popularity, in the 1930s, Lusty Lloyd Loom furniture could be found in hotels, restaurants and tea rooms, as well as aboard a Zeppelin, cruise ships and ocean-going liners, becoming a household name. The Lusty family developed over one thousand designs, and over ten million pieces of Lusty Lloyd Loom were made in America and Great Britain before 1940.  Lusty Lloyd Loom  William Lusty began in business in 1872 with a hardware shop in London's East End. Specialising in timber products the business benefitted from the demand for ammunition packing cases during the First World War. In May 1920 Frank Lusty sought the British rights to the new Lloyd Loom fabric, having been tipped off by Lusty's New York agent. Full patent rights were acquired in 1921 and the Lustys were in production the following year. A few years later the Lusty Lloyd Loom factory covered seventeen acres at Bromley-by-Bow in East London and employed over 500 people making a range of products from baby carriages to kitchen cupboards. By 1933 over four hundred designs were featured in the Lusty Lloyd Loom catalogue. The factory was completely destroyed by bombing during the afternoon of 7 September 1940, together with over twenty thousand items of stock; there were no fatalities. The Lustys relaunched their business with a new catalogue in 1951, though post war austerity prevented them achieving the pre-war sales level. The London factory site was eventually sold and the business moved to Martley near Worcester. Production ceased in 1968. Whilst the Lusty family found other interests and pursuits Lloyd Loom production continued in the United States at Menominee until 1982. After a brief hiatus, production resumed in Menominee in 1982 after Flanders Industries purchased the Lloyd Manufacturing works there, forming the Lloyd Flanders company. Lloyd Flanders continues to make Lloyd Loom furniture in Menominee today. Geoffrey Lusty, a grandson of William Lusty who founded the business, rekindled production in the last decade of the twentieth century by moving production to the Far East. Whilst the production standards were as good as the original, and all items were made to the original W Lusty & Sons designs, the sales could not be developed in the United Kingdom and in 2008 the business called in advisors to find a new owner. W Lusty & Sons became The Lusty Furniture Company in July 2008, backed by private investors interested in preserving the legacy of Marshall B Lloyd, the inventor of Lloyd Loom. Reinstating the original design book the new owners maintained production in Indonesia and now provide the original designs in any colour, as W Lusty & Sons had offered in 1922. Set of St. Tropez chairs in Lloyd Loom During the fallow period between 1951 and the late 1990s a raft of commercial furniture producers entered the Lloyd Loom marketplace, such as the now defunct Lloyd Loom of Spalding in the United Kingdom and Vincent Sheppard in Belgium. A number of Lloyd Loom manufacturers and retailers both in the UK and abroad have emerged designing, producing and selling various indoor and outdoor Lloyd Loom product lines. Some manufacturers and retailers have developed synthetic fibres based on the original paper loom - for use in outdoor furniture. The majority of Current worldwide Lloyd Loom production takes place in Indonesia, China and Vietnam.

The region has been responsible for several major innovations, and a presence in the national game which is disproportionately large, because it is the one part of Scotland where rugby is the main sport and played by all classes. History For centuries Borderers had been playing various forms of folk football, that were extremely similar to rugby. Some of these are still played very occasionally, such as the game in Jedburgh. Undoubtedly their popularity paved the way for that of rugby. Ned Haig, for example played Fastern's Eve Ba'. Throughout the mid-to-late-1870s, another almost parallel world of club rugby grew up in the Scottish Borders. This brand of rugby, imported from Yorkshire through the burgeoning woollen industry, was a world away from the refined old boy circuit of Edinburgh and Glasgow. The Borders remains the only part of Scotland ‚Äì outside the predominantly middle-class atmosphere of the Edinburgh elite ‚Äì where rugby really managed to take root in Scotland. In small towns where there was little or no association football, clubs such as Gala, Hawick, Selkirk, Jed Forest, and Melrose, soon became the sporting focus for the hardy farming communities nearby. Although the population of the Borders is only 100,000, its unique cauldron of local rivalries has produced some of the best players to come out of Scottish, or even European rugby. Many of the greatest Scottish sides, including those who won the Grand Slam of 1990, contained a substantial number of Borderers. It says much for the quality of play in the area that the towns from which the three most enduring club sides in Scotland hail from ‚Äì Hawick, Galashiels and Melrose ‚Äì have populations of 14,800, 12,300 and 1670 respectively. Borders rugby The area of Borders rugby is largely contiguous with Scottish Borders region, but also taking in Langholm and Biggar. Although the bulk of Borders rugby can be found in and around mid and lower Tweedsdale, the Border rugby region also takes in the likes of Langholm in Dumfriesshire in the south west, and Peebles, Innerleithen and Biggar (traditionally part of South Lanarkshire) in the west. The town of Berwick upon Tweed also has a strong association with the region, and its rugby club frequently plays against sides in the area. Border League As well as being geographically and culturally divorced from their city counterparts, the Borders clubs soon developed a competition of their own, the Border League, which is still contested, and which remains the oldest organised league competition in world rugby. Rugby sevens The Borders is also the birthplace of the abbreviated code of the sevens, which is somewhat ironic since Borders rugby has traditionally been built around forward muscle, rather than fluent back play. The code was invented in 1883, when Melrose butcher and fly-half Ned Haig suggested a shortened version of the game, as a means of raising money at a local fair. The idea was a resounding success, with Melrose beating Gala in extra time to win the competition, and soon most towns in the Borders staged their own annual sevens tournaments in April and May. So seriously do Borderers take the game, that when in 1983, the victorious French donated their Melrose Sevens winners' medals to the local lasses as a token of affection, that there was an uproar in the town. Borderers see a Melrose Sevens winners' medal as the next best thing to a Scottish cap. The Melrose Cup is the main prize of the Rugby World Cup Sevens, and is named after this. South of Scotland The South of Scotland rugby union team (The South) is a select team made up of the best players from the Border region. They would take on overseas touring sides, drawing with South Africa on two occasions and famously beating an excellent 1984 Australia touring team. They also competed in the Scottish Inter-District Championship against Edinburgh District, Glasgow District and the North and Midlands. In 1995, with the advent of professionalism in Rugby union, the SRU decided to professionalise The South District team as the Border Reivers. Border Reivers The Border Reivers were one of four professional sides set up by the SRU in 1996, from the traditional amateur District sides. The others were Glasgow Warriors, Edinburgh Rugby and Caledonia Reds. Their appearance was initially regarded with some suspicion and derision, yet it was due to the SRU's high debt that the axe fell on the Reivers just two years later. The Caledonia Reds met the same fate. The Border Reivers were merged into Edinburgh Rugby in 1998, to form the Edinburgh Reivers. In effect, though, the Borders side was effectively disbanded. Edinburgh quietly dropped the Reivers name later. The establishment of a Celtic League in 2001 gave the SRU more confidence. It resurrected the Border Reivers side in 2002 and they competed in the Celtic League, Heineken Cup and Challenge Cup. However the team largely struggled in the league. The side was disbanded in 2007. The Reivers did pick up something of a following and their demise was a minor scandal. Part of the problem was that while the Borders have produced much of Scotland's best rugby, they did not necessarily have the population to support such a team. Clubs The district includes clubs from the Scottish Borders as well as two clubs, Berwick and Langholm, and are actually situated in Northumberland and Dumfries & Galloway respectively. =BT Premiership= The BT Premiership is the premier club competition over the Scottish Borders region. =National leagues= BT National Leagues is an amateur league competition for rugby union clubs in Scotland.

Like his earlier poem The Eolian Harp, it discusses Coleridge's understanding of nature and his married life, which was suffering from problems that developed after the previous poem. Overall, the poem focuses on humanity's relationship with nature in its various aspects, ranging from experiencing an Edenic state to having to abandon a unity with nature in order to fulfill a moral obligation to humanity. The discussion of man's obligation to each other leads into a discussion on the difference between the life of a philosopher and the life of a poet. By the end of the poem, the narrator follows the philosophical path in a manner similar to what Coleridge sought to do. The response to the poem from critics was mostly positive, with many of them emphasizing the religious aspects of the work in their analysis. Background After marrying Sara Fricker in autumn 1795, Coleridge left their home at Clevedon and began to travel throughout England in order to meet with various philosophers and political theorists. In part, he was trying to meet with people so he could raise subscriptions for his various works. During this time, he would write home constantly to his pregnant wife and was concerned about her state of health. His feelings of guilt, along with a fever that he treated with laudanum, affected him greatly and caused him to express these feelings in a letter to Josiah Wade on 10 February 1796:Ashton 1997 p. 80 \\"My past life seems to me like a dream, a feverish dream! all one gloomy huddle of strange actions, and dim-discovered motives! Friendships lost by indolence, and happiness murdered by mismanaged sensibilities.\\"Ashton 1997 qtd. p. 80 After the letter, Coleridge returned to his wife who was now living with her family at Redcliffe Hill, Bristol. As he wrote The Eolian Harp to commemorate coming to his home at Clevedon, Coleridge composed Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement on leaving it.Ashton 1997 pp. 80‚Äì81 The poem was not included in Coleridge's 1796 collection of poems as it was probably still incomplete, but it was published in the October 1796 Monthly MagazineMays 2001 p. 260 under the title Reflections on Entering into Active Life. A poem Which Affects Not to be Poetry.Ashton 1997 p. 139 Reflections was included in Coleridge's 28 October 1797 collection of poems and the collections that followed. Of his early poems, Coleridge believed that Reflections was his best.Yarlott 1967 p. 109 Poem The poem begins with an idealisation of a \\"Valley of Seclusion\\":Sisman 2006 p. 129 The poem continues with a goodbye to the valleyAshton 1997 p. 81 and asks if his life of pleasure was appropriate: The narrator describes the reasons why he is leaving Clevedon along with the allowance of remembering his former life there after his work is done:Radley 1966 p. 48 Themes The themes of Reflections are connected to Coleridge's The Eolian Harp as the scene for both is the same. The land of Clevedon is praised and seen full of life, and it serves as contrast to escaping from the real world into fantasy and pondering about the abstract. Both poems also describe Coleridge's relationship with his wife and feelings of sexual desire.Holmes 1989 p. 103 The imagination aspects of the poem represent an unwillingness to accept nature on its own and rejects the conclusion of The Eolian Harp. Although the land of Clevedon can bring one closer to God, one cannot just simply exist in such an area but must seek out truth.Radley 1966 pp. 47‚Äì48 Feeling the need to seek out truth creates a separation between the mind of a poet and the mind of a philosopher. The poem reconciles the two by allowing the pursuer of truth to reflect on his time of simply enjoying nature and God's presence. However, the philosopher aspect is dominant and the individual must go out and try to help humanity. Nature can be soothing, but the narrator must reject the Edenic quality of nature because such a state is not yet appropriate.Radley 1966 pp. 48‚Äì49 The Edenic imagery figures into many of Coleridge's poems and is reinforced with the image of myrtle trees and takes on many forms within his poetry. In Reflections, to dwell in an Edenic state is a paradise in which the narrator leaves voluntarily because he cannot ignore the problems of the world like a coward. Instead, the individual is compelled to join with humanity and even the lowest form of benefiting humanity is superior to doing nothing at all.Harding 1974 pp. 46‚Äì47 The image of nature and other themes reappears in Fears in Solitude (1798). The later poem recreates the \\"Valley of Seclusion\\" image in the form of a dell. Even the image of a passerby looking in on the cottage found in Reflection is repeated. Similarly, the compulsion to enter into the world and help humanity is included, but it is altered from being motivated by guilt to a warning message against a possible invasion from outside forces. As such, Fears in Solitude does not seek to leave the location to help humanity, but to stay as a protector over his family.Yarlott 1967 pp. 118‚Äì119 In Coleridge's own life, he tried to follow the path of the philosopher, but the 10 July 1834 entry in Table Talk admits that he was unable to do so:Jasper 1985 p. 134 \\"so I own I wish life and strength had been spared to me to complete my Philosophy. For, as God hears me, the originating, continuing, and sustaining wish and design in my heart were to exalt the glory of his name; and, which is the same thing in other words, to promote the improvement of humanity. But visum aliter Deo, and his will be done.\\"Jasper 1985 qtd. p. 135 In terms of Coleridge's marriage, Reflections differs from The Eolian Harp by saying that there were problems within the marriage, especially with it distracting Coleridge from nature and the world outside of the home that he shared with his wife. The poem expresses feelings of solitude and confinement, and there is a difference between the worlds inside and outside of the cottage in a similar manner to the focus found within Coleridge's Kubla Khan. This is especially true with a focus from the private to the public spheres. Within the outside world, the poem's narrator is separate from humanity, but his focus is ever on humanity and contains both a religious and political component. The image of \\"One Life\\" within the poem compels him to abandon the sensual pleasures of the cottage and to pursue a path of helping humanity.Yarlott 1967 pp. 97‚Äì98 Sources Besides the natural relationship of the poem with the land of Clevedon, there are literary connections within the poem. The poem begins with a line from Horace, although in many versions it is misquoted. The line, \\"sermoni propiori\\", is from Horace's Satires 1.4.42 and is intended to describe the work as a whole as connecting to prose. The second stanza, where the narrator describes Dial Hill as the \\"stony Mount\\", is connected to William Crowe's Lewesdon Hill (1788). It is possible that Reflections could have been an imitation of Crowe's poetry.Mays 2001 pp. 260‚Äì262 In terms of Edenic imagery, including types of plant life, Coleridge's are connected to John Milton's Paradise Lost Book Four.Harding 1974 p. 46 Critical response The Critical Review saw favor with \\"To the River Otter\\" and Reflections in their review of the 1797 collection of Coleridge's poem.Holmes 1989 p. 148 The July review claims that the poem \\"evince a feeling heart. The comparison between the weeping eyes of a humane friend and the unmoved face of another equally benevolent, and the contrast between the latter and those who merely affect sympathy, are well drawn.\\"Jackson 1996 qtd. p. 42 During the 20th century, Virginia Radley declares that Reflections \\"although not so striking in imagery as is the 'Eolian Harp,' still has much to recommend it in this respect [...] The impression left with the reader that the cottage and its surroundings are inestimably lovely, quiet, and peaceful is a paramount one, while the dead lines [...] do not move the reader at all, except to make him wonder if the move from Clevedon for the cause of humanity was a necessary one.\\" Richard Haven argues that the poem's image of the moral path is weak because \\"the returned traveller can only dismiss his ascent to another mode of being as a pleasant but useless memory\\".Haven 1969 pp. 50‚Äì53 Anthony Harding believes \\"it is important to recognize that it steps outside the idyllic but circumscribed scene of 'The Eolian Harp', and admits the impossibility, in a fallen world, of human self-sufficiency.\\"Harding 1974 p. 48 Oswald Doughty states that the \\"most important additions\\" to Coleridge's 1797 edition of poems included Reflections.Doughty 1981 p. 127 Richard Holmes points out that both Reflections and The Eolian Harp \\"mark a new stage in Coleridge's exploration of the sacred relations between man and nature, which gradually become more serious and impassioned as they carry increasingly theological implications behind his Romanticism.\\"Holmes 1989 p. 104 Notes References * Ashton, Rosemary.

This act is considered by many historians to mark the end of the Russian Revolution of 1905, and was the subject of intense subsequent debate as to its legality. It also created a fundamental shift in the makeup of future Dumas in the Russian Empire: whereas previous laws had given peasants and other lower-class people a larger proportion of electors to the Duma, the new law transferred this to the propertied classes, in an effort to avoid election of the large number of liberal and revolutionary deputies who had dominated the First and Second Dumas. Although it largely succeeded in this objective, it ultimately failed to preserve the Imperial system, which ceased to exist during the Russian Revolution of 1917. Background During the 1905 Revolution, the autocratic regime of Nicholas II was persuaded to adopt a form of constitutionalism, in an effort to preserve itself and keep the nation from sliding into outright anarchism. Nicholas first issued what became known as the October Manifesto on promising basic civil rights and the creation of a parliament, without whose approval no laws were to be enacted in Russia.October Manifesto A new Fundamental Law was issued on of the following year, in which the State Duma was established as the lower chamber of a bicameral parliament (the State Council of the Russian Empire forming the upper house). This Duma thus became the first genuine attempt at parliamentary government in Russia.\\"Duma.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 2007 Ultimate Reference Suite. (2009). Whereas the Council of State was partly appointed by the Emperor and partly elected by various governmental, commercial and clerical organizations, the Duma was to be elected by Russians of various social classes through a complex system of indirect elections.Fundamental Laws, Article 100. See also The Russian Revolution of 1917: Causes, section \\"A\\". Initially, the electoral system was drawn up to give a sizable number of electors to the peasants, who were seen as loyal to the Tsarist regime. While many revolutionaries rejected the Emperor's concessions, most Russians decided to give the new system a chance. However, public faith in the new order was shaken by a fresh Manifesto, issued on ahead of the new Fundamental Law, which severely limited the rights of the newly constituted Duma. Since the absolute power of the Emperor did not formally end until his promulgation of the Fundamental Law itself on , the legality of this act could not be challenged by the new legislature. Furthermore, the newly promised civil liberties-- freedom of press, assembly and expression, among others--had been greatly reduced during anti-revolutionary operations in that same year. Nicholas II opened the First Duma on with a speech from the throne in the Winter Palace. While he and his ministers hoped to keep the Duma quiescent, the deputies refused to cooperate: they introduced bills for agrarian reform, which were strenuously opposed by the landlords, together with other radical legislative proposals far beyond anything the Tsarist regime was prepared to accept. He dissolved the First Duma on but since elections for the Second Duma returned even more radicals than before, the impasse between legislature and executive continued. About 20% of seats in the Second Duma were taken by Socialists: Mensheviks, Bolsheviks (both factions of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party), Popular Socialists and Socialist Revolutionaries, all of whom had boycotted the elections for the First Duma. Unable to build a working relationship with the new Duma, the Imperial government, under newly appointed Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin, set about finding an excuse to dissolve it. Tsarist Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin, who engineered the \\"Coup\\" of June 1907 The coup The desired pretext came when the government became aware of ongoing revolutionary agitation among Tsarist soldiers; this agitation was often carried out by the members of the RSDLP. On June 2, the imperial government demanded that the Duma hand over 55 Social Democratic deputies, who had (like all the members of the Duma) been guaranteed parliamentary immunity by the Fundamental Law, unless stripped of it by the legislature itself. Impatient at the Duma's lack of cooperation, it chose to arrest them anyway on the night of June 3, without awaiting the decision of a Duma commission set up to investigate the government's accusations. On June 3 the Duma was formally dissolved by Imperial Manifesto followed by Imperial edict (ukase), with Prime Minister Stolypin playing an important role in this act.\\"Stolypin, Pyotr Arkadyevich.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 2007 Ultimate Reference Suite. (2009) This action, which was perfectly legal according to the Fundamental Law (which gave the Tsar unlimited authority to dismiss the Duma at any time, for any reason that suited him),Fundamental Laws, Article 105. was followed by a dubious political maneuver. On June 3 a new electoral law was published, entirely on the Tsar's authority and without the consent of the Legislature. According to the new scheme, the wealthier landlords obtained sixty percent of the electors for the Duma; peasants got twenty-two percent, while merchants got fifteen percent and the remaining three percent went to the urban proletariat.The Russian Revolution of 1917: Causes, section A, subsection 3. Areas such as Central Asia were deprived of representation altogether, with the Tsar claiming that the new Duma must be \\"Russian in spirit\\", and that non-Russians must never be accorded a \\"decisive influence\\" over \\"purely Russian questions\\".Imperial Manifesto of June 3, 1907. Legal challenges The legality of this act was immediately challenged: according to the October Manifesto, new laws could not be enacted without the approval of the Duma,Fundamental Laws, Article 86. and neither Nicholas nor Stolypin has obtained the Duma's agreement prior to issuing this decree. The Fundamental Law did permit the Tsar to implement or change new laws without the Duma's consent, in intervals between sessions of the Duma (which is when the \\"coup\\" law was enacted), but these were supposed to be submitted to the new Duma within two months, and were subject to that Duma's power to suspend or repeal them.Fundamental Laws, Article 87. Furthermore, no such edict could ever make any changes in the Fundamental Law itself, which required not just the emperor's initiative but also the Duma's approval.Fundamental Laws, Articles 8, 87 and 107. Hence, the Tsar's new electoral statute had been enacted contrary to his own Fundamental Law. This raised the question of whether Russia was fundamentally a state ruled under an immutable organic statute (the Fundamental Law), or one still ruled by an all-powerful monarch. The Tsar's government countered by insisting that since the Emperor had granted the Fundamental Law to begin with, he had the God-given right to unilaterally alter it (even though the Fundamental Law clearly said otherwise) in extraordinary instances, such as Nicholas claimed this to be. The manifesto of June 3, 1907 announcing this change specifically appealed to the Tsar's \\"historical authority\\" as the legal basis for these changes, which Nicholas asserted \\"cannot be enacted through the ordinary legislative route\\" since the Second Duma had been \\"pronounced unsatisfactory\\" by him.Imperial Manifesto of June 3, 1907. The Tsar clearly indicated that his own authority, which he claimed to have received from God himself, superseded the authority of any law, even the Fundamental Law itself, which he himself had granted.Imperial Manifesto of June 3, 1907, This convinced many Russians that Nicholas had never embraced constitutionalism to begin with and that Russia ultimately remained an absolute autocracy hiding behind the facade of a constitution. Thus, the term \\"coup\\" came to be used to refer to the emperor's act even if it was not a coup d'√©tat in the usual sense. Legacy Contrary to the expectations (and the hopes) of some deputies, the so-called \\"coup d'√©tat\\" of June 1907 did not cause the resumption of the revolutionary movement. While SRs resumed the acts of individual terror, the number of such acts was relatively small. Since Russia remained relatively quiet, even in the face of the Tsar's contravening of the new Russian Constitution, June 3, 1907 is considered the date of the end of the first Russian revolution. The Tsar's new electoral law ensured that all future Dumas would remain under the control of the higher classes of society, but this did not ultimately prevent the Duma from taking an important role in the Tsar's eventual overthrow in the February Revolution of 1917. Nicholas' heavy-handed actions in the \\"coup\\" crisis irreparably damaged his image (already battered from previous policies he had pursued). This, in turn, caused many of his subjects to eagerly embrace the next revolution when it finally came.

Rising thousands of feet above the Shasta and Rogue valleys, it is a landmark distinguishable from over away. At 25.6 million years old, it is one of the oldest formations of the Cascade Range. The rock is protected by the Cascade‚ÄìSiskiyou National Monument and the Soda Mountain Wilderness. Several trails pass near Pilot Rock, including the Pacific Crest Trail. Geology Rising above the surrounding hills and thousands of feet above the Shasta and Rogue valleys, Pilot Rock is one of the most prominent features of the Cascade‚ÄìSiskiyou National Monument. It was created when andesitic magma broke through a weak spot in the Earth's crust and solidified beneath the surface, forming a plug. The softer rock around the plug slowly eroded away, leaving Pilot Rock as it is seen today. Similar features include Devils Tower in Wyoming and Shiprock in New Mexico. Argon‚Äìargon dating shows that the rock is approximately 25.6 million years old, making it one of the oldest volcanic formations in the Cascades, but much younger than the 425 million-year-old Siskiyou Mountains nearby. Pilot Rock has a large amount of columnar jointing, created when the magma cooled. The joints are tilted about 20 degrees to the east due to the gradual uplift of the Siskiyou Mountains to the west. The rock also has an unusually high amount of black hornblende crystals, indicating that there was a significant amount of water in the area when it formed. Extensive talus deposits have accumulated around the rock's base. The surrounding soil is primarily the sticky, eroded remnants of volcaniclastic breccia. History The Takelma tribe of Native Americans originally called the rock Tan-ts'at-seniphtha (stone standing up), but to early settlers Pilot Rock was known as Boundary Mountain. The United States Exploring Expedition passed through the area on September 28, 1841, renaming the rock Emmons Peak after Lieutenant George F. Emmons, a U.S. naval officer and member of the group. Emmons described the rock as \\"a singular, isolated rock, which stands like a tower on the top of the ridge, rising above the surrounding forest with a bare and apparently unbroken surface.\\" James Clyman also described the rock when he passed through the area on June 26, 1845. The rock later become known as Pilot Rock because it served as a landmark for pioneers coming north from California on the Applegate Trail, being visible from as far as the southern end of the Shasta Valley, over to the south. Nine planes have crashed into Pilot Rock since 1942, mainly due to poor visibility. Pilot Rock is protected by the Cascade‚ÄìSiskiyou National Monument, created in 2000, and the Soda Mountain Wilderness, created in 2009. Flora Pilot Rock is located in the eastern Klamath Mountains ecoregion and is surrounded by dense mixed coniferous forest. Wildflowers such as wild strawberries, larkspur, columbine, lupine, and paintbrush grow in the spring and summer. Gentner's fritillary, a rare species of the lily family, has been found growing on and near the rock. Trails Path to Pilot Rock in June 2019 There are several trails near Pilot Rock which can be accessed via a forest road that ends at a parking lot approximately northwest of the rock. The main trail, part of the Pacific Crest Trail, travels southeast towards the rock for about , before branching into two trails. The left branch is the northbound continuation of the Pacific Crest Trail, while the right fork is the summit trail. The steep summit trail is about long, and gains approximately in elevation. At the summit, there are views of landmarks such as Mount Shasta, the Trinity Alps, and Mount McLoughlin.

The wetlands located at the site of today's AES power plant in Redondo Beach were a source of foods including halibut, lobster, and sea bass, and also of salt. In the 18th century, the Chowigna bartered salt from the old Redondo Salt Lake, \\"a spring-fed salt lake about 200 yards wide and 600 yards long situated about 200 yards from the ocean\\", with other tribes. Their village by the lake was called \\"Onoova-nga\\", or \\"Place of Salt.\\" The Chowigna were relocated to missions in 1854, when Manuel Dominguez sold 215 acres of Rancho San Pedro, including the lake, to Henry Allanson and William Johnson for the Pacific Salt Works.

After one of the many great fires that throughout the centuries have ravaged Bergen destroyed the easternmost part of Strandgaten in 1561, Erik Rosenkrantz, governor of Bergenhus len, ordered the creation of a broad street (an \\"allmenning\\") which would prevent future fires from spreading. Torgallmenningen (formerly V√•gsallmenningen), Vetrlidsallmenningen, Korskirkeallmenningen, and many other streets in the old part of Bergen were created for the same reason. The street, formerly known as \\"Rosenkrantz' allmenning\\", is now known as \\"Murallmenningen\\". The origin of the name is the personal residence of Rosenkrantz, which he built there shortly after the fire. This building, known as \\"Muren\\" or \\"Murhvelvingen\\", has been used for a number of different purposes throughout history, and is currently home to the Buekorps Museum. Murhvelvingen at √òstre Murallmenning, where the Buekorps Museum is located The area between Torgallmenningen and √òstre Murallmenningen was destroyed in the Bergen fire of 1916. The reconstruction plans included a new street layout, which better conformed to the ideals of the era, rather than those of 1756, when the area had last burned. The streets were straightened and widened. Strandgaten was no exception; its eastern end was moved southwards, while its western end was moved northwards. Sm√∏rsallmenningen, a street which had intersected Strandgaten, was removed. The Jewish community in Bergen consisted of around 60 persons in the years before World War II, who in total owned six retail stores in Strandgaten. Because of the deportation of the Jews only one store remained after the war, and with new owners. During the war, British bombers destroyed many of the wooden houses on Nordnes. On 20 April 1944, the German steam trawler Voorbode, loaded with dynamite, exploded in V√•gen, and destroyed the area around Tollboden and Nykirken, as well as a large number of houses in the surrounding neighbourhoods and on the other side of the bay. The war was followed by a period of reconstruction and re-purposing. There were plans to tear down several of the old neighbourhoods in central Bergen, including Marken and most of the neighbourhoods on the Nordnes peninsula, including Strandgaten west of √òstre Murallmenningen. The plans were abandoned by the city government in 1974. However, the north-eastern part of the Nordnes peninsula, including about half of Strandgaten, which had been the most damaged during World War II, was cleared out and the ruins and remaining buildings were replaced with large apartment buildings. The stretch of Strandgaten between Murallmenningen and Hobergsallmenningen, was spared. It was pedestrianised in 1971, and is now known as \\"G√•gaten\\", literally \\"the walking street\\". Buildings The easternmost part of Strandgaten was completely destroyed in the fire of 1916. Before the fire most of the area's buildings were small, with two or three floors. The post-fire buildings, constructed between 1919 and 1939, were large commercial buildings with upwards of 6 floors. Many different architectural styles are represented among the buildings in this part of Strandgaten, ranging from the Neo-baroque Svaneapoteket (Strandgaten 6 and 8), which, having been finished in 1920, was the first building constructed after the fire, to functionalist buildings, e.g. Strandgaten 20. Many important Bergen architects designed buildings in this part of Strandgaten, including Einar Oscar Schou, who had also designed Den Nationale Scene, Finn Berner (the building on the corner with Torgallmenningen, which was his design), Fredrik Arnesen and Arthur Darre Kaarb√∏, Sigurd Lunde, Ingolf Danielsen, Leif Grung, and Per Grieg. The pedestrianised section has mainly smaller buildings with 2-4 floors, built before the 20th century. Significant buildings include Strandgaten 59, the former building of Sundt & Co, today located at Torgallmenningenn, and Tetingsalen (Strandgaten 53), a former brewery, public house, concert hall, theatre, and today retail store. The western half of Strandgaten, west of Holbergsallmenningen, was rebuilt after World War II. The church of Nykirken is located here, one of the few buildings on the north-eastern shore of the Nordnes peninsula to have been preserved. The home of Edvard Grieg's family, where he grew up, was located in this part of Strandgaten, but it was destroyed when the steam trawler Voorbode exploded in 1944. The ruins of Ludvig Holberg's childhood home were, too, located by Strandgaten, until they were removed in 1985. Near the northern end of the street are the main offices of the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries. Commerce Strandgaten is one of the busiest shopping streets in Bergen. Alt URL The pedestrianised section has a number of smaller shops, but has also seen the establishing of several chain stores, while the easternmost section is home to the shopping centre Kl√∏verhuset, founded in 1988, and various Norwegian and international chain stores.

It is a conversion of the abandoned Marlborough Branch of the Fitchburg Railroad. The right-of-way parallels the Assabet River in the trail's midsection. At the north end it veers north to the South Acton MBTA train station while the south end veers south to Marlborough. When fully completed, the end-to-end length will be . As of June 2020, the southwest portion of the trail from Marlborough to Hudson and the northeast portion running from the South Acton MBTA station to the Maynard‚ÄìStow border are completed. No current plans exist for paving the gap in Stow and Hudson between the two trail ends.Assabet River Rail Trail History The Marlborough Branch railroad was progressively lengthened so that it reached from the Acton station to Maynard by 1849, extended through Stow to Hudson in 1850, and reached its Marlborough terminus in 1855. Passenger service was discontinued in the reverse fashion, such that Marlborough's service ended in 1930, Hudson and Stow in 1939, and finally Maynard in 1958. The branch continued providing freight service into the 1960s. The last remaining rails and railroad ties in Acton and Maynard were removed in 2014. In 1851 transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau, who lived in Concord, wrote in his famous journal about a trek to Boon's Pond‚Äîtoday known as Lake Boon‚Äîwhich on the return included a walk along the railroad tracks now replaced by the trail.Thoreau‚Äôs walk to Boon‚Äôs Pond (pages 452-462) Status Kayak and canoe launch dock, Assabet River, Maynard, MA (USA) Plans to convert the Marlborough Branch tracks into a rail trail date back to at least 1992. A January/February 1997 feasibility study conducted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts supported the project's viability. The five municipalities through which the Marlborough Branch rails ran voted to approve the project in 1998. In 2005 the south end of the trail, measuring , was completed from Marlborough to a parking lot on Wilkins Street in northeast Hudson. Construction of of the north end of the trail ‚Äî from the South Acton train station running south to central Maynard and then southwest to White Pond Road at the Maynard‚ÄìStow border ‚Äî began in 2016. The groundbreaking ceremony for the north end was held on July 21, 2016. The ribbon-cutting event celebrating the completion was held August 10, 2018. Completion of the north end left a gap between the Marlborough‚ÄìHudson and Acton‚ÄìMaynard portions of the trail. The east end of this gap is a dirt road known as Track Road, but no bridges over the two crossings of the Assabet River exist and some parts are on private property. Maps and updates are available on the ARRT website. There are four boat launches providing canoe and kayak access to the Assabet River on the trail: one in Hudson at Main Street Landing; one in Stow at Magazu Landing; and two in Maynard, at White Pond Road and Ice House Landing. A map of locations of these boat launches is available on the ARRT website. In the fall of 2018, a volunteer organization and project called Trail of Flowers began planting thousands of blooming bulbs and perennial flowering plants, bushes, and trees along the trail. Plantings in 2018 were limited to Maynard, but expanded to Acton in 2019 and will add Marlborough and Hudson in the future. Donations cover the cost of the bulbs and perennials, and volunteers plant them. =Possible future connections= A separate April 1997 feasibility study conducted by the Massachusetts Central Transportation Planning Staff proposed a Central Massachusetts Rail Trail extending continuously from the town of Berlin to Alewife station and Minuteman Bikeway in Cambridge. The proposed trail included the Marlborough Branch right-of-way in Hudson, meaning the Central Massachusetts Rail Trail would connect to and overlap with the then-proposed Assabet River Rail Trail. In November 2013 the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation proposed a similar Mass Central Rail Trail (MCRT) - Wayside Branch project to extend the existing portions of the MCRT in Waltham to Berlin and connect to the ARRT in Hudson.

In its district lies the new fairgrounds for the city. Including its villages and hamlets, Seehausen has 1967 residents (1997). The district includes the village with the land on which the new Leipzig fairgrounds and exhibition grounds are located (known as Sachsenpark), and the hamlets of G√∂bschelwitz, Hohenheida, Gottscheina and Neblitz.  History  The village was probably settled around 1150. In 1359 the village first appears in documents as Sehusen, and around this time, the farmers of the village declared their obligations to the city of Leipzig. In 1438, Frederick II, Elector of Saxony appointed Conrad Bruser as liege lord for Seehausen. In 1551 22 farmers owned land, and lived in the village; village residents also included nine men who owned no land. By 1580, the residents had built a school. In 1631, during the Thirty Years War, Seehausen was the site of a major battle, the Battle of Breitenfeld (1631). In 1791, many of the properties in Seehausen were destroyed in a fire. The Church Evangelical Church in Seehausen, Leipzig The Duchy of Saxony underwent The Reformation in 1539 and Seehausen became Protestant. The first church was built in the 13th century, in the romanesque Choir tower. In 1560, the parish property, with all its buildings, acres and garden was sold for 150 guilder to the farmer George Dyme. The church was further renovated in 1663 for 174 Thalers. Around the 15th century, the church was renovated, by increasing the height of the tiny Romanesque windows in the Gothic style. The church also received a new altar. In 1770, the church underwent another renovation, particularly in the interior, and the coat of arms of the lordship was installed on the altar at the dedication. In 1764, the village had 29 residents who owned property, and 9 residents without property. In 1788, the residents endowed the church with an organ. Leipzig churches: Seehausen.

They are synthesized by the bacteria Streptomyces virginiae.KEGG COMPOUND The streptogramin family of antibiotics consists of two distinct groups: group A antibiotics contain a 23-membered unsaturated ring with lactone and peptide bonds while group B antibiotics are depsipeptides (lactone-cyclized peptides). While structurally different, these two groups of antibiotics act synergistically, providing greater antibiotic activity than the combined activity of the separate components. These antibiotics have until recently been commercially manufactured as feed additives in agriculture, although today there is increased interest in their ability to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly vancomycin- resistant bacteria.  Biosynthesis  Streptogramin A is a polyketide in nature, but contains some amino acid components as well. Its gene cluster codes for a hybrid PKS-NRPS protein that consists of eight PKS modules and two NRPS modules. Other enzymes are required for tailoring of streptogramin A, particularly for the unusual methylation reaction. The figure below shows the origins of the synthetic components of streptogramin A. :300px The streptogramin A PKS-NRPS is composed of 6 proteins: VirA contains modules 1 though 6; VirF, VirG, and VirH contain modules 6 through 10; VirI is the AT domain that acts for every PKS module; and VirJ contains the TE domain. The starter unit for the biosynthesis of streptogramin A is isobutyryl-CoA, which is given by the amino acid valine after it has undergone transamination and branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenation. Two rounds of chain extension with malonate follow. An NRPS module introduces a glycine residue into the growing polyketide chain, followed by two more rounds of chain extension with malonate. At this point, four enzymes use acetyl-CoA to add a methyl group to position 12 on the macromolecule. The mechanism of the reaction is proposed below. VirC and HMG-CoA synthase bear striking structural similarities and while the mechanism for VirC is not known, it can be proposed to be similar to that of HMG-CoA synthase.Dewick, Paul. Medicinal Natural Products: A Biosynthetic Approach, 2009, John Wiley & Sons Ltd. p450-451 :File:MethylationVM1.png Such an elaborate mechanism of methylation is necessary since SAM is not able to insert a methyl group onto a carbonyl carbon. Another round of malonate extension occurs, followed by the malonate's reaction with an adjacent serine extender to form an oxazole ring. This reaction is catalyzed by a cyclization domain on the Ser9 NRPS module. The diagram below shows the biogenesis of the oxazole ring from serine and malonate. Finally, a D-proline residue is added to the chain, followed by hydroxylation and dehydration to form dehydroproline, which is thought to occur through a reverse Michael-type reaction. :File:Dehydration of Virginiamycin M1.png  Mode of action  By themselves, streptogramins A and B are bacteriostatic. However, when used in conjunction with one another, the streptogramins can inhibit bacterial growth and are bactericidal. Streptogramin A first binds to the peptidyl transferase domain of the 50s ribosomal subunit, preventing the early events of elongation. The binding of streptogramin A causes a conformational change that increases the ribosomal binding activity of streptogramin B 100-fold. Upon binding the ribosome (which streptogramin B can accomplish at any stage of protein synthesis), streptogramin B prevents protein chain extension and can initiate the release of incomplete peptides. When both streptogramins are bound to the ribosome, they form an extremely stable ternary complex. In 1999 the FDA had approved Synercid, a drug containing streptogramins A and B in a 7:3 ratio respectively. This intravenously-injected drug is used to treat patients with bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium.  Resistance to streptogramins  Multiple mechanisms of streptogramin resistance have developed despite Synercid's fairly recent development. The three major mechanisms of resistance include active efflux, covalent target modification and antibiotic inactivation enzymes.

It was built in 1855 by Frederick Hilgen and William Schroeder to replace the wooden gristmill they had built in 1844. The architect and builder was Burchard Weber. At five stories high, Cedarburg Mill was the tallest building in Cedarburg when it was built and at the time cost $22,000. The mill is built on Cedar Creek. Hilgen and Schroeder built a dam on the creek near the mill, and put a water wheel near the dam to power the mill. The mill could produce 120 barrels of flour each day, which was sold in a shop owned by Hilgen and Schroeder. Because the Cedarburg Mill prospered, four other mills were built along Cedar Creek.http://www.ohiobarns.com/othersites/mills/wi/49-46cedarburgmills.html During Wisconsin's \\"Great Indian Scare\\" of September 1862, the mill was used as a makeshift fortress by some residents in response to rumors of an Native American uprising in the state. 30,000 men were out of state, serving in the American Civil War, leaving the state vulnerable. The rumors were ultimately false; there was not an uprising. However the news caused mass hysteria in state's population. The mill building is now owned by Landmark Supply Co.

The original building was erected in 1884 by Count Arthur Moore, a wealthy local Catholic as a reformatory for boys. Shortly after its construction, Moore invited the Rosminians to run the school. History Arthur John Moore was an enthusiastic supporter of the new Industrial Schools as an alternative to the detention of children in Workhouses. However, his motives for establishing Ferryhouse may not have been entirely altruistic. At this time he was running for Parliament and the building of the school, which had widespread popular support, was completed just in time for the 1880 General election. Moore was successfully returned to Westminster for the Home Rule Party. In January 1885, a Certificate was granted by the State for the school to receive 150 boys and in 1944 this Certificate was increased to 200. The numbers in Ferryhouse ranged from 189 boys in 1940, increasing to a high of 205 in 1960. This number decreased to 160 in 1970. There were between 150 and 200 boys in Ferryhouse until the 1970s. Thereafter, the numbers began to gradually decline but until the 1980s, the numbers were far in excess of the certified number. Scandal Like many residential institutions in the country, in 2009, following publication of the Ryan report, Ferryhouse was finally recognised as a place of systematic physical and sexual abuse of children carried on over a period of many years.

Plot The game stars an unnamed marine, a survivor of Bravo Team during the events of Doom 3. He awakens, and is soon confronted by Dr. Garret, who presents him Sam, a flying droid capable of opening doors and hacking computers. Together with Sam, the survivor makes his way through the Mars facility, battling zombies and demons on his way through the base. The task is to reach a port, where a spaceship full of surviving members of UAC facility is preparing to launch off. On his way, the marine meets some survivors, collects valuable information through Sam, and visits Hell, where he closes the demon-spawning portals. Eventually, the marine is forced to leave Dr. Garret behind, and Sam sacrifices itself to support a closing door to the spaceship, leaving only the data implicating UAC behind. The marine successfully boards the ship and leaves Mars with a few other survivors.

She was only the third woman (after Minnie D. Craig of North Dakota and Consuelo N. Bailey of Vermont) to serve as speaker of a state House of Representatives in the United States.The Almanac of Women and Minorities in American Politics 2002, Mart Martin, Westview Press, 2001, She also served as Acting Governor of New Jersey in early 1965. Biography Higgins was born in 1915 in New Rochelle, New York to Marion (Speaks) and Dr. James E. West. Her father was the first Chief Scout Executive of the Boy Scouts of America, serving from 1911 to 1943. She attended New Rochelle High School before entering Mount Holyoke College, where she graduated with a degree in political science in 1936. In 1941 she married William F. Higgins, and in 1949 they moved to Hillsdale, New Jersey to open a real estate and insurance business. Higgins became involved in Bergen County Republican politics, and in 1959 she was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly, where she served three terms. In 1964 she was selected as majority leader, and in 1965 she was selected as Speaker. When Governor Richard J. Hughes was out of the state in January 1965, Higgins became Acting Governor. Normally, New Jersey Senate President Charles W. Sandman, Jr. would have taken the post, as he stood first in the line of succession to the governorship. However, Sandman absented himself from the state so that Higgins would be accorded the honor of serving as the first woman to lead the state. Higgins ran for State Senate in 1965 on the Republican Party's Bergen County slate, but all four Republican candidates went down to defeat in the general election, as Democrats took control of both houses of the Legislature. After her tenure in the Assembly, Higgins continued to operate the Hillsdale real estate business with her husband. In 1973 she followed in her father's footsteps by becoming a member of the Bergen County Council of the Boy Scouts of America. She was also the first woman to serve on the board of Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. In 1991, at the age of 76, Higgins died at Pascack Valley Hospital in Westwood, New Jersey after suffering injuries in a car accident in Hillsdale. She is buried at Maryrest Cemetery in Mahwah.

The 70 Member Countries of the Forum are signatories to the IEF Charter, which outlines the framework of the global energy dialogue through this inter-governmental arrangement. The IEF is the neutral facilitator of informal, open, informed and continuing global energy dialogue. Recognising their interdependence in the field of energy, the member countries of the IEF co-operate under the neutral framework of the Forum to foster greater mutual understanding and awareness of common energy interests in order to ensure global energy security. The IEF is unique in that participants not only include IEA and OPEC countries, but also key international actors such as Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa. The IEF member countries account for more than 90 percent of global oil and gas supply and demand. The Forum's biennial Ministerial Meetings are the world's largest gathering of Energy Ministers. The magnitude and diversity of this engagement is a testament to the position of the IEF as a neutral facilitator and honest broker of solutions in the common interest. Through the Forum and its associated events, IEF Ministers, their officials, energy industry executives, and other experts engage in a dialogue of increasing importance to global energy security. The IEF is promoted by a permanent Secretariat based in the Diplomatic Quarter of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The International Energy Forum also coordinates the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI) which is a concrete outcome of the global energy dialogue.  Mission statement  The International Energy Forum aims to provide a platform for member-states to have access to open discussion and dialogue between countries that make up the global energy market. The Forum aims to gather all aspects of the energy market; producer, consumer and transit states. The goal of the forum is to create better understanding of the market on all sides, and to increase mutual awareness and understanding of existing member states.  Objectives  The fundamental aims of the Forum are: * Fostering greater mutual understanding and awareness of common energy interests among its Members; * Promoting a better understanding of the benefits of stable and transparent energy markets for the health of the world economy, the security of energy supply and demand, and the expansion of global trade and investment in energy resources and technology; * Identifying and promoting principles and guidelines that enhance energy market transparency, stability and sustainability; * Narrowing the differences among energy producing, consuming and transit Member States on global energy issues and promoting a fuller understanding of their interdependency and the benefits to be gained from cooperation through dialogue among them, as well as between them and energy related industries; * Promoting the study and exchange of views on the inter-relationships among energy, technology, environmental issues, economic growth and development; * Building confidence and trust through improved information sharing among States; and * Facilitating the collection, compilation and dissemination of data, information and analyses that contribute to greater market transparency, stability and sustainability.  History  The concept of a systematic producer-consumer dialogue emerged in the 1970s as a part of the general reorganisation in the global political and economic order with energy markets transforming the structure within individual countries as well as power balances and relations between countries. In the wake of the first Gulf War in the early 1990s, consumers and producers recognised their joint interest in the stability of the oil market, creating greater awareness, and understanding sensitivities toward each other's interests. The Gulf War revealed the importance of a concerted and coordinated global response to an adverse supply shock. On October 1, 1990 at the United Nations General Assembly, Venezuelan President, Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez called for an urgent meeting of producers and consumers under the auspices of the United Nations to help the world face the growing uncertainties and politics of the oil market. With the support of French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand, and Norwegian Prime Minister, Gro Brundtland, political support was gained for the initiation of a Ministerial Seminar of producers and consumers. Established in Paris in July 1991, the International Energy Forum was created in order to stabilise the global energy market after the 1970s energy crisis, and the 1980s oil glut. One of the main priorities of the Forum was to bring together member-states and private corporations in order to increase awareness of national and international interests, and the workings of the market in order to avoid the instabilities of the previous two decades.  Organizations  Headquartered in the Diplomatic Quarter of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, The International Energy Forum is a Secretariat organization. The forum is governed by an executive board which is composed of 31 representatives of ministries of the respective member states. The body is led by Secretary General, Joe McMonigle of USA. Mr McMonigle was appointed on August 1st, 2020. The International Energy Forum Secretariat is to ensure that the Forum is promoting a neutral platform for the exchange of information and views regarding conflicts and the future of the energy industry. Another goal of the executive board is to include both public and private entities in the global energy market in order to bring forth multiple viewpoints to the Forum. Additional duties that are performed by the Executive Board include organizing all of the Forum's activities. These include all meetings and summits that are put on by the Forum, and also coordinates the Forum's Programme of Work.  The Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI)  IEF Energy Ministers recognized that the exchange and free dissemination of energy market data helps to mitigate uncertainty by improving market transparency and facilitating well-informed decision-making that instils investor conÔ¨Ådence, supports market stability and strengthens energy security. The Joint Organisations Data Initiative, coordinated by the IEF since 2005, relies on the combined efforts of the eight JODI partner organisations (APEC, EUROSTAT, GECF, IEA, OLADE, OPEC, and UNSD), and more than 100 national administrations, and industry stakeholders to gather, verify and transmit the ofÔ¨Åcial data that populates JODI's two public databases JODI-Oil and JODI-Gas with key monthly supply and demand indicators.

The neighborhood was also the site, in 1912, of the first lunch wagon built by Jerry and Daniel O'Mahoney and John Hanf, which was bought for $800 and operated by restaurant entrepreneur Michael Griffin, who chose the location for its copious foot traffic. The wagon helped spark New Jersey's golden age of diner manufacturing, which in turn made the state the diner capital of the world. In the decades that followed, nearly all major U.S. diner manufacturers, including Jerry O'Mahoney Inc., started in New Jersey. During World War II, the area was a 24-hour hotspot for U.S. servicemen, who patronized the dozens of nightclubs located there. Transportation New Jersey Transit bus routes 82, 83, 85, and 88 serve the district.

This natural product falls in the class of iridoid glycosides, which are simply monoterpenes with a glucose molecule attached.  Natural occurrence  First isolated in 1962, catalpol was named for plants in the genus Catalpa in which it was discovered. Later in 1969, catalpol was found to be present in larger quantities in several plants in genus Rehmannia (Orobanchaceae). It is found in plants belonging to several families, including, but not limited to, Scrophulariaceae, Lamiaceae (including scullcapYaghmai and Benson, 1979 M.S. Yaghmai, G.G. Benson The wax hydrocarbons of Scutellaria lateriflora L Manchester, England (1979) 228‚Äì229 p), Plantaginaceae (Plantago sp) and Bignoniaceae, all of which being in the order Lamiales. Because they feed on these plants, variable checkerspot butterflies (Euphydryas chalcedona) contain high amounts of catalpol, which makes them unpalatable to predators and thus serves as a defense mechanism.  Biosynthetic pathway  Though first isolated in the 1960s, there has been very little investigation of the biosynthetic pathway of catalpol. S. R. Jensen has described a possible biosynthetic pathway for catalpol. With iridoids stemming from a terpenoid origin, epi-iridotrial's precursor, epi- iridodial, is derived from geraniol. Addition of a glucose at carbon 1 (C1) of the iridoid backbone and oxidation of the aldehyde at C4 of epi-iridotrial produces 8-epiloganic acid. A subsequent hydrolysis at C8 yields mussaenosidic acid, followed by a dehydration to yield deoxyngeniposidic acid. The next precursor, geniposidic acid, is furnished via hydrolysis of C10, and then a decarboxylation to remove the carboxylic acid at C4 provides bartsioside. The very widely known and accepted precursor to catalpol, aucubin, is then furnished via hydroxylation at C6. Finally an epoxidation with the alcohol at C10 yields catalpol.

He is currently a trustee of Age UK.Age Scotland website History Age Scotland came into being as a result of the April 2010 merger of Age Concern Scotland and Help the Aged in Scotland, charities with a combined 90 years of independent operations in Scotland. Age Concern Scotland developed out of several Older People's Welfare Associations founded in 1944 during the Second World War. Help the Aged in Scotland was established in 1986, when UK charity Help the Aged, founded in 1961, set up a permanent office with a staff in Edinburgh. Both charities worked throughout Scotland to support a wide network of older people's groups and forums, which in turn provide local responsive services to older people in their own communities. Age Concern Scotland offered a range of services directly, piloting programmes and working with members and drawing on local needs, expertise, and volunteers as appropriate to develop locally based provision, while Help the Aged in Scotland was considered more as a campaigning and lobbying organisation. The two charities collaborated on many issues and contributed to the 2002 introduction of Free Personal and Nursing Care and the implementation of the Adult Support and Protection Act in 2007. A joint campaign in 2005 led to the Burt Review of Council Tax, the report ‚ÄúA Fairer Way‚Äù the following year and the eventual freezing of the tax in Scotland for several years. Currently Age Scotland's focus is on integrating health and social care, fuel poverty and isolation. Fundraising Age Scotland's income is funded through corporate partnerships, legacies, fundraising events, individual donors, public funding, 14 charity shops around Scotland and its social enterprise arm, Age Scotland Enterprises. =Age Scotland Enterprises= Age Scotland Enterprises offers products and services that are designed to either address market failure and/or meet its objective of offering products that provide value for money - for example, none of its insurance products have upper age limits.

After studying under Yvor Winters at Stanford University, he published and broadcast poems, criticism and reviews (Song, The Southern Review, World Order, WONO-FM) in the 1970s,The Southern Review, Winter, 1978. and taught in the Program in Writing Arts at the State University of New York at Oswego. In 1976, Robert Hayden, Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress, wrote that Dickinson-Brown \\"is a gifted poet who has begun to attract favorable attention,\\" and that \\"he has distinguished himself as a teacher of creative writing and modern poetry.\\" World Order, Summer 1975, p. 74. The entire book-length series Jonathan: A Death Miscellany was broadcast over WONO-FM (New York) in April 1976. During that broadcast Dickinson-Brown argued that most poets write too much, and indicated that he wished to leave only a small number of poems at his death. At about the same time, he stopped publishing his work in literary reviews and journals, and more or less entirely withdrew from conventional publication. Dickinson-Brown, who abandoned university tenure at SUNY Oswego and spoke of former academic colleagues as devotees of an obscurantist cult, adapted his own writing to clear commentary on an ‚Äúunpoetically‚Äù wide range of subjects. Here, for example, is his epitaph for the great economist Angus Maddison, 1926-2010 (the lines are actually carved on Maddison's tombstone): Friend or stranger, stop and shed a tear: Gentle Angus Maddison lies here. Joining the social sciences with art, He took human misery to heart And mixed time, space and math to set men free From want. Angus hated poverty. (This poem also appears on the frontispiece of World Economic Performance: Past, Present and Future, D.S. Prasada and Bart Van Ark, eds., Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd, 2013.) Some of Dickinson-Brown‚Äôs usually short poems are written in experimental (mostly French-style syllabic) meters,The Southern Review, Autumn, 1977. but most are classical in both form and subject. They are often written in the plain style and were evidently influenced by the epigrammatic tradition of Catullus, Martial (whom he translates) and J. V. Cunningham, including their social satire and sometimes risqu√© humor. The most frequent themes are loneliness, age, love, death, physics and religion. The French poems are all epigrams.

It belongs to the Serbian Carpathians. Its highest peak is ≈†iljak () (1,565 m), a natural phenomenon of karst terrain. The north side of the mountain is covered with forests and shrubs, full of autochthonous plant species and plenty of sources of potable water. A hunting ground covers 6368 ha. The most common prey are roe deer and wild boar.  Geography  Rtanj is located in eastern Serbia, occupying the south-western, Balkan section of the Carpathian Mountains. Administratively, it belongs to the municipalities of Sokobanja and Boljevac. The most obvious physical feature is the conical shape on top of the mountain ridge, which appears to be perfect. The highest peak is the tall ≈†iljak.  Human history  Entrepreneur Julijus Minh founded a mine on the mountain in the 19th century. His widow Greta Minh, built a mausoleum in the form of a little chapel dedicated to her husband on the ≈†iljak peak. The chapel was built in 1932 and was dedicated to St. George. Some 1,000 miners participated in the construction as Minh, in the process of developing the mine, built apartments, school, community health center, cinema, park, etc. After World War II, the new Communist authorities demolished the chapel's dome with the cross in 1946. In an effort to find the gold and jewels which according to the folk mythology were hidden inside the mountain, the treasure hunters damaged the chapel using dynamite on several occasions since the 1980s, demolishing the remaining walls in the process. The first open-air bio pool in Serbia was built on Rtanj in 2019. It is filled with the mineral-rich water from the natural spring, discovered in 14th century, and needs no pumps. The water is chlorine-free; instead, plants and algae which naturally filter and clean the water are planted in one section of the pool. From this mini-lake, filtered water flows over several small steps into the pool. The shape of the pool is inspired by the Serbian ramonda flower, while the nearby hotel is shaped like a pyramid, mimicking the shape of the mountain itself.  Mythology  = Folklore = According to the folk legend, the castle of a wizard was situated on Rtanj Mountain, in which a great treasure was guarded. However, the castle has disappeared within the mountain, trapping the wealthy sorcerer inside. Ever since the treasure hunters have been visiting the mountain seeking for the lost gold and gems. = Fringe theories = In 1971, poet Miodrag Pavloviƒá wrote a poem \\"Splendid wonder\\" (Divno ƒçudo). Inspired by the folk myths from the area, Pavloviƒá described Rtanj as an abode of the ancient Serbian gods. In the next decades, additionally influenced by the pyramidal shape of the mountain, Rtanj became popular among the fringe theories supporters. In the 21st century it became a place of regular gathering of the believers in paranormal, which organize groups, symposiums and \\"surveys\\" of the mountain. Most popular theory is that, due to its shape and other \\"observed\\" factors (precise pyramidal geometry, golden ratio math, wondrous natural life, strong electromagnetism with fine frequencies, endemic plants, healthy energy radiation, special climate, mystical cultural heritage, naturally radiation-ionized air, Tesla waves), the mountain had to be artificially built. Claims are made that it is a multi- dimensional portal, that a channel leads from the top of the mountain to below the ground being used as a launch pad for alien spaceships and that Rtanj is an \\"oscillator and resonator of the subtle energy hubs\\". Alleged sightings of the \\"flying balls\\" over the mountain became a common place. For some New Age believers, the pyramidal shape of the mountain is due to it containing an alien pyramid emitting mystical energies. Many people have flocked here prior to the predicted 2012 Mayan Doomsday, believing it will protect them. Vrelo locality is described as the source of magnetic energy. The results were \\"confirmed\\" by the radiesthesia surveys, as attested by the plaque on the small stone pyramid. People stand in the hole in this area, filling themselves with energy. They claim that the prehistoric people recuperated their energy on this spot and that animals sleep on this spot during winter and that strange appearances which allegedly show on the photos taken here are because of the time travelers.  Plantlife  = Rtanj tea = Rtanj from its northern side A widely known traditional product of Rtanj is the \\"Rtanj tea\\", a herbal tea made of winter savory. It is celebrated for its antiseptic and aromatic properties, and is allegedly an aphrodisiac, which gave the plant a local moniker ƒëipikur (\\"jump(ing)-dick\\"). Allegedly, the plant also has bronchodilatory and antioxidant effect and the virility is enhanced because of the flavonoids which stimulate the production of testosterone. Before it gained its modern reputation, it has been used by the local population as a remedy for bronchitis, asthma, coughing, children's respiratory inflammations and for gerontology problems. By May 2019, the massive summer harvesting of winter savory on Rtanj was banned by the Institute for Nature Conservation of Serbia until the species recovers. The plant has been over-harvested in general, but it was especially damaged as, instead of the former harvesting using knives or scissors, the harvesters began massively pulling out the plants from their roots. Medicinal and aromatic wildly grown herbs picked on the Rtanj and the mountain Ozren, which is on the opposite, southern side of Sokobanja, account for the majority of the Serbian export of these commodities, which in 2018 reached ‚Ç¨3.3 million.  Protection  Rtanj was placed under the state protection in May 2019 when it was declared a natural monument (\\"Special nature reserve Rtanj\\").

The church was repaired under the supervision of Saint Pedro Bautista in 1590. In the same year, the Catholic church obtained permission from the Superior Government to build the church using stone. Upon the order of Saint Pedro Bautista, leader of the Franciscans, the church was rebuilt in 1600 using bricks; this building was later destroyed by the 1743 earthquake but the walls were left standing. Due to the growing number of Catholics in Tayabas, the church was again rebuilt and extended. It was further expanded under the term of Father Benito de la Pila between 1856 and 1866 with the addition of the transept in the shape of a rotunda and cupola. The brick tile roof was replaced with galvanized iron sheets in 1894. Father Manuel Gonz√°les bought the administration building (casa administraci√≥n) used by the provincial head of the Franciscans for 962 pesos in 1855. He donated it to the town to be used as classrooms to replace the old, ruined rooms. Gonzales ordered the school's construction in 1878; it was built using stone, lime and a tiled roof. Together with Father Samuel Mena, Gonz√°les rebuilt the old Tribunal built by Governor La O, which had been unused since it was burned down in 1877. From 1896 to 1899, Father Isabelo Martinez became the first Filipino priest assigned to Tayabas Basilica, followed by Father Amando Alandy, a native of Tayabs, from 1899 to 1900.Office of the Municipal Planning and Development Coordinator of Tayabas City. (2010). Tayabas, Our Town: A Socioeconomic and Cultural Profile. The church's patio played a significant role during the struggle of the Filipino revolutionaries against the Spanish forces. General Vicente Lukban and his troops surrendered to the Spanish army on the patio on August 13, 1898, while the Philippine flag was waved from the church's belfry. During the Second World War, the church's convent was used as a garrison by the Japanese Imperial Army. The church was dedicated on March 14, 1987, by the Lucena bishop Rub√©n T. Profugo, DD. On October 18, 1988, the title Minor Basilica was conferred upon the church by Pope John Paul II through the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, and was proclaimed during a eucharistic celebration on January 21, 1989. Tayabas Basilica is considered to be one of the most beautiful churches in the Philippines. Through Presidential Decree no. 374, the National Museum of the Philippines declared Tayabas Basilica as a National Cultural Treasure on July 31, 2001, along with 25 other churches in the Philippines.  Features  The church at Tayabas is generally considered to be Baroque architecture. It is included in a list of more than 30 churches declared National Cultural Treasures by the National Museum of the Philippines. = Patio and facade = The influence of Chinese architecture in Tayabas is present in the design of Tayabas Basilica. Lion statues in front of the building show a link to the influence of Chinese traders before the Spanish colonial era. Cherubs in stone reliefs playing the lute, trombone, drum and trumpet can be seen in the church patio. Its facade is almost eclectic, and was added during renovations to the church. The unusual three-storey arrangement of the facade includes has an entrance flanked by two niches in Mudejar style. The windows of the choir loft and the central window on the second floor have capiz shells. The levels are separated by horizontal bands and images of angels, and several saints including Saint Francis of Assisi, Saint Dominic and Saint Diego of Alcala. On the topmost tier are stone-carved statues of archangels Michael, Gabriel and Raphael. = Floor plan = Tayabas Basilica has a unique floor plan that resembles a key. Because of this, the Basilica is often referred to by locals as Susi ng Tayabas (\\"Key of Tayabas\\") = Aisle = The church's aisle is the longest of any church built during the Spanish colonial era. It was built between 1855 and 1860. = Interior = Tayabas Basilica's interior is built in the Neo-Classical style with seven altars. An image of the Nuestra Se√±ora de los Angeles (\\"Our Lady of Angels\\") stands in the central retablo of the altar. Severo Carpintero, known as the Maestro Carpintero (\\"Master Carpenter\\") built the church's round transept and crossing. The dome was built together with a third storey and semicircular pediment. It also has an antique organ located in the choir loft and a balcony over the altar. The basilica's ceiling painting was restored in the 1990s by Delfin Antiola.Aldor, Joel Lucky C. (2013) LOOK UP: A Study into the Sacred Art of Philippine Church Ceiling Paintings. Pintacasi: A Journal on the Cultural Heritage of the Church in the Philippines, Volume IX. = Church clock = Church clock The basilica's 18th century clock was erected in early 1900 on the belfry; it is one of the oldest and largest church clocks in Asia. The clock is tall and has a circumference of . The hour and minute hands are and long respectively. Running the clock are two weights connected by steel cable to the hour hand with a weight of and for the whole clock. The clock chimes once on the hour and half-hour. It was refurbished in 1971 during the term of Monsignor Gregorio Salvatus. = Ermita = Tayabas Basilica has two ermita chapels dedicated to Nuestra Se√±ora de las Angustias and to San Diego de Alcala. =Cemetery = The church has an old cemetery made of stone. A chapel with two towers was built in 1889 by Father Samuel Mena. The cemetery was closed when the barrio of Cota (now Lucena) became a town. Restorations In 2000, the church underwent major renovations and restorations for the sixth time. The altar was moved from the northern apse to the crossing of the apse below the dome. The church's pulpit and the basilica's monastery were also restored. Fund-raising activities to pay for the restoration of the basilica in preparation for the church's 25th anniversary as a Minor Basilica in 2014 were done since June 2009. In 2011, an estimated gross area of on the church's roof and roof framework was repaired and restored with the help of the National Museum.National Museum of the Philippines. (2011). Annual Report 2011. In 2011 the lighting of the facade was converted to solar energy using photovoltaic power panels and other devices. It is the first old church in the Philippines to use solar energy in its facade.  Administration  Tayabas Basilica is in the jurisdiction of the Vicariate of St. James of the Diocese of Lucena. Reverend Monsignor Carlos Pedro A. Herrera, PC serves as parish priest with Father Gerald A. Garcia and Father Arvin C. Pitahin as parochial vicars and Monsignor Beato S. Racelis, HP, as resident priest.  Festivities  Tayabas town is also known for its religious activities, the most important of which is the feast of Saint Michael the Archangel, the town's patron saint who is celebrated annually on September 29. The town also celebrates the Viernes Dolores de Turumba in honor of the Our Lady of Sorrows of Turumba, who is celebrated with dance, chanting and a procession. On Holy Week, a stage play depicting the passion and death of Jesus Christ can be viewed on the church patio. The play including the procession of poon - wooden statues.

It happens when the transferase allele contains a mix of amino acids from either A or B alleles, producing a bifunctional enzyme that can produce both types of antigens, usually with one weaker than the other. This results in a serum test result much like the standard, separate (trans) AB phenotype, although the weaker antigen can occasionally fail to be detected. It complicates the basic inheritance pattern (as the allele comes from one parent only) and blood- transfusion compatibility matching for ABO blood typing. Different DNA mutations of either type A or Type B alleles change amino acids in enzyme transferase A or B, homologous enzymes differing in only four of 354 amino acids (R176G, G235S, L266M, and G268A). A single change in ABO gene DNA could switch type B to type A and then, a new hybrid enzyme can produce both weak B and A2 (in serum test, A2B, and A2B3). The most common mutation is an A105 allele variation in exon 7 nucleotide position G803C changing glycine (type A) to alanine (type B). Another 8 alleles are reported in BGMUT, most recently in China and Taiwan. Some Cis-AB carriers need components like washed red blood cells or autotransfusion of serum and blood. Cis-AB type was studied first in humans in Japan (Shikoku Island) and South Korea (Gwangju area) where this rare type is more common (Chinese coast provinces and Taiwan also), although it is seen in a few European families (from France, Spain, Belgium, Germany, and Poland). In the year 2004, the American Red Cross described a family in Nebraska with a father of type cis-AB negative, a mother type O and their baby of type cis-AB. Since then, several cases in the United States have been reported. Antigen expression is weaker than A1 or B. Scenarios When one parent carries a Cis AB allele, the other allele can be any of O, A or B. The phenotype of this parent is always AB, but the children will inherit either the AB or the other allele from this parent. They could alternatively not inherit either allele from them. # If the other parent is O phenotype (OO genotype) the three possible scenarios for the blood group of children of a Cis AB carrier (and a fourth unlikely scenario) are: ## The second allele is O: children are either AB or O ## Second allele is A: Children are either AB or A ## Second allele is B: Children are either AB or B ## A very rare 4th possibility exists: if the other allele is also Cis AB then the children will be always AB irrespective whatever the other parent is, because they will have one cis AB allele from this parent. # If the other parent is type A, depending on whether this parent is genotypically AA or AO and what the other allele is in the Cis Ab carrying parent, the following scenarios are possible: ## Other parent is AO and the second allele is O: The children are either AB or A or O ## Other parent is AA and the second allele is O: The children are either AB or A ## Other parent is AO and the second allele is A: The children are either AB or A ## Other parent is AA and the second allele is A: The children are either AB or A ## Other parent is AO and the second allele is B: The children are either AB or B ## Other parent is AA and the second allele is B: The children are always AB ## Rare situation: If the other allele is also cis AB: The children are always AB # Likewise, similar scenarios for the other parent being type B are: ## Other parent is BO and the second allele is O: The children are either AB or B or O ## Other parent is BO and the second allele is A: The children are either AB or A ## Other parent is BO and the second allele is B: The children are always AB or B ## Other parent is BB and the second allele is B: The children are either AB or B ## Other parent is BB and the second allele is O: The children are either AB or B ## Other parent is BB and the second allele is A: The children are always AB ## Rare situation: If the other allele is also cis AB: The children are always AB ABO inheritance is generally derived assuming the children are not the rare Bombay phenotype, which would require both parents to be carriers of it. Real life implications =Maternity and paternity disputes= When testing paternity or maternity by ABO blood group alone, it is possible to have a paradoxical result in the rare instance that a cis-AB genotype is involved. For example, (scenario 1.1 above) a child of a cis AB individual (who will test as a regular AB phenotype) and an O individual will be either AB or O instead of the usual A or B (see diagram above). =Differential diagnosis= If the child of an AB and an O individual is O (the green-colored offspring in the scenario 1 image above), then a rare alternative possibility is that the parents were carriers (heterozygous) for the Bombay phenotype (Hh) and the child is a Bombay (hh) homozygous by genotype thus expressing Bombay phenotype also called Oh where, despite the presence of the ABO alleles, the substrate from which those antigens are made is not made and thus A, B and even O antigen are not expressed at all and are completely absent from the red cells.

It is one of the primary components found in carrot seed oil comprising approximately 40% of this essential oil. This sesquiterpene alcohol is thought to be formed in carrot seeds (Daucus carota L., Umbelliferae) during the vegetation period. Additionally, studies have shown that carotol may be involved in allelopathic interactions expressing activity as an antifungal, herbicidal and insecticidal agent. Biosynthesis It has been proposed that there is a direct cyclisation of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to the carotol (carotane backbone). This type of cyclisation is unconventional for the typical chemistry of sesquiterpenes. The only other proposed mechanism requires a complex ten-membered ring with a methyl migration. This latter reaction, regardless of how plausible it may appear to be on paper, is energetically undesired, and through the diligent work of M. Soucek and coworkers, it was shown that the cyclization from FPP to carotol is the most probable biosynthesis route. The formation of farnesyl pyrophosphate is via the mevalonate pathway. An additional five-carbon IPP unit is added in the same manner to GPP. Formation of FPP. The cyclization of FPP proceeds via a synchronous reaction of trans-antiparallel additions. This leads to the trans carbocation intermediate. Further cyclisation occurs yielding the 5 and 7-membered ring carbocation. This is followed by a 1,3-hydride shift and subsequent deprotonation to the diene. It is suggested that the carbocation elimination is directed to retain the proper structure of the isopropyl group. Based on the work of Soucek it is then proposed that a stereospecfic hydration will then take place leading to the enzymatic introduction of the hydroxyl group.

This is achieved by turning one of the liquids into a state consisting of extremely small particles distributed uniformly throughout the other liquid. A typical example is the homogenization of milk, where the milk fat globules are reduced in size and dispersed uniformly through the rest of the milk. Definition Homogenization (from \\"homogeneous;\\" Greek, homogenes: homos, same + genos, kind)homo-, word origin is the process of converting two immiscible liquids (i.e. liquids that are not soluble, in all proportions, one in another) into an emulsion (Mixture of two or more liquids that are generally immiscible). Sometimes two types of homogenization are distinguished: primary homogenization, when the emulsion is created directly from separate liquids; and secondary homogenization, when the emulsion is created by the reduction in size of droplets in an existing emulsion. Homogenization is achieved by a mechanical device called a homogenizer. Application One of the oldest applications of homogenization is in milk processing. It is normally preceded by \\"standardization\\" (the mixing of milk from several different herds or dairies to produce a more consistent raw milk prior to processing). The fat in milk normally separates from the water and collects at the top. Homogenization breaks the fat into smaller sizes so it no longer separates, allowing the sale of non-separating milk at any fat specification. Methods Homogenizing valve, a method to homogenize at high pressure Milk homogenization is accomplished by mixing large amounts of harvested milk, then forcing the milk at high pressure through small holes. Yet another method of homogenization uses extruders, hammermills, or colloid mills to mill (grind) solids. Milk homogenization is an essential tool of the milk food industry to prevent creating various levels of flavor and fat concentration. Another application of homogenization is in soft drinks like cola products. The reactant mixture is rendered to intense homogenization, to as much as 35,000 psi, so that various constituents do not separate out during storage or distribution.

Homogenization, in cell biology or molecular biology, is a process whereby different fractions of a biological sample become equal in composition. It can be a disease sign in histopathology, or an intentional process in research: A homogenized sample is equal in composition throughout, so that removing a fraction does not alter the overall molecular make-up of the sample remaining, and is identical to the fraction removed. Induced homogenization in biology is often followed by molecular extraction and various analytical techniques, including ELISA and western blot. Methods Homogenization of tissue in solution is often performed simultaneously with cell lysis. To prevent lysis however, the tissue (or collection of cells, e.g. from cell culture) can be kept at temperatures slightly above zero to prevent autolysis, and in an isotonic solution to prevent osmotic damage. If freezing the tissue is possible, cryohomogenization can be performed under \\"dry\\" conditions, and is often the method of choice whenever it is desirable to collect several distinct molecular classes (e.g. both protein and RNA) from a single sample, or combined set of samples, or when long-term storage of part of the sample is desired. Cryohomogenization can be carried out using a supercooled mortar and pestle (classic approach), or the tissue can be homogenized by crushing it into a fine powder inside a clean plastic bag resting against a supercooled solid metal block (more recently developed and more efficient technique). High-pressure homogenization is used to isolate the contents of Gram-positive bacteria, since these cells are exceptionally resistant to lysis, and may be combined with high- temperature sterilization.

Biography  = His childhood and his adolescence in the North of France = Raymond Normand was born on November 14, 1919, in Auby, a small industrial village located not far from Douai. He was the second child of Maria Duhem and Just Normand, who already had a daughter, Jeanne, five years older than he. His father had been a miner until he came back mutilated from World War I. Still he managed to work as an electrician. Raymond spent his first ten years in Flers-en-Escrebieux, living on the countryside in contact with nature, peasants and house animals. From his very early years, he had expressed a devouring passion for drawing and painting. Back in Auby, he attended the high school and the Art School in Douai. However, in 1934, he was forced to interrupt his studies because of a serious bone disease which kept him bedridden for two years. Although he had undergone several surgeries, he had to cope with the aftereffects for the rest of his life. Following his convalescence he decided to leave the high school in order to dedicate himself full-time to his studies at the Art School in Douai. = His discovery of Provence = Because of their son‚Äôs health, his parents decided to take him to the South of France. They settled in Marseilles in 1937, and there, until 1941, Raymond attended sculpture and drawing classes at the Art School. During that period, he met C√©sar, the famous French sculptor, with whom he stayed in contact for many years despite the different directions into which their art evolved. In 1943, he was sent to Germany to comply with Compulsory Labor Service. Due to his leg problem, he was assigned a job in an office. After his return to France, he worked for farmers and looked after herds of goats in Lambesc, near Salon-de-Provence. At that time, his family was living in Grans. It was during this period that he discovered the natural beauty of the Provence, just as Vincent van Gogh had done in Arles. This southern part of France was so different from the flat and dull region where Raymond had spent his childhood. Following in the footsteps of the Impressionists, he grew more and more eager to captivate on canvas the vibrating light and colors that dazzled the aspiring painter from the North for the rest of his life. = Fifty years of his life at the Trou du Loup in Ventabren = In 1950, Raymond Normand settled in Ventabren, not far from Aix- en-Provence, in the area called the Trou du Loup (Wolf‚Äôs Hole), at the bottom of the village, in a small isolated house among pine and olive trees. He devoted the remainder of his years to his art, while living in this peaceful retreat with his parents, cats and goats. Normand was mainly a landscape painter whose wide range of colors depicts the vibrating light and life of an unspoiled nature, as the hours of the day and the seasons of the year go by. The topics of his oil paintings with palette knife or brush, of his dry and soft oil pastels, of his Chinese pen or stick ink works and of his wash- drawings range from the countryside of Lambesc or Grans and the banks of the Touloubre River to the village of Ventabren and surroundings and the banks of the Arc River. Apart from self-portraits, he also painted his mother, father, family, friends and pets, as well as large pastoral scenes with unreal characters and sometimes a few caricatures. He actually acquired some fame, although, living away from the art market, he did not try to become famous. Not only his friends but also many art collectors from France and abroad have been coming to the Trou du Loup. Raymond Normand died on March 12, 2000, in Aix-en-Provence. The Town Council of Ventabren, where he was buried, has inherited his properties and works.

It is owned as a joint venture between Barrick Gold Corporation (61.5%) and Newmont Corporation (38.5%), operated by Barrick, and comprises the Pipeline, Crossroads, and Cortez Hills open pit mines; and the Cortez Hills underground mine. Ore from the mines is treated at an oxide mill at the site and on leach pads, while refractory ore is shipped to Barrick‚Äôs Goldstrike operation for processing. Region history Abandoned mill in the Cortez Gold Mine Complex at the Abandoned town of Cortez The Cortez Mountains has been mined since 1862, with silver being the primary commodity until the 1940s. The Gold Acres operation in the Cortez Mountains included open pit and underground mines in the 1930s and 1940s. Cortez Gold opened in 1968 and production ended in 1976. The United States Bureau of Mines built a pilot plant in 1969 which would make heap leaching for gold commercially viable by 1971. The low grade ore and dump material from the Gold Acres operation was then heap leached. The Cortez mill was reopened as the price of gold increased in the early 1980s, feed for the mill was provided by the nearby Horse Canyon deposit between 1983 and 1987. Further exploration of the region was carried out by Cortez Joint Venture which involved Placer Dome and Kenecott ( at the time Kenecott was a BP Minerals subsidiary). The result of the joint venture's exploration was the 1991 discovery of the Pipeline orebody. The Pipeline orebody was located near the Gold Acres operation, instead of being located in the foothills, it was entirely within the Crescent Valley. The Pipeline orebody was much larger than the original orebodies in the region. The entire Pipeline complex contained 23 million ounces of gold between the original orebodies, the Pipeline orebody and the later discoveries of South Pipeline, Crossroads and Gap. The Cortez Joint Venture built the Pipeline Mine and mill in early 1996 following a series of ownership disputes with junior mining companies. Commissioning of the Pipeline mine cost US$250 million, and resulted an annual output between 1998 and 2005 of over one million ounces of gold per year. The Cortez Hills deposit was discovered in 2002, underground development to define the resource limits began in 2006. Barrick Gold acquired 60% in Cortez in 2006 when it purchased Placer Dome for US$10.4 billion, and acquired the remaining 40% from Rio Tinto in March 2008 for US$1.7 billion. Geology The Cortez Mine is located in the Crescent Valley which is between the Shoshone and Cortez Mountains, a basin in the traditional Basin and Range setting of Nevada. Precious metal mineralization came during Jurassic-Miocene periods. The Pipeline complex lies within of silty limestone in what is called the Silurian Roberts Mountain Formation. Above this is Devonian Wenban Limestone, which acts as the host rock of the Cortez Hills deposit. Above the Devonian Limestone is Quaternary alluvium. Mining operations A Liebherr T282B 400 ton truck, the same model is in operation at the open pits at Cortez. The Pipeline and South Pipeline deposits are currently being mined using traditional open pit mining techniques, while the Cortez Hills deposit will be mined out using both open pit and underground mining techniques. =Surface= Current haulage rates at Cortez are per day of combined ore and waste, and will increase with the commissioning of the Cortez Hills open pit. Cortez currently has an average stripping ratio of 3:1. Ore in the open pit mines is hauled on surface using Liebherr T282B trucks. Cortez currently owns 24 T282Bs, which accounts for 10% of the total sales of T282 & T282B trucks worldwide. =Underground= The underground operation at Cortez Hills utilizes parallel wide by high, declines. Crosscuts connect the declines every , the ramps are driven at a grade of 6% for their entirety. The declines are used to haul ore from the stopes to surface and to provide ventilation for the mining operation. The declines are accessed via portals on the wall of an old open pit, the haulage (west) decline brings fresh air into the mine and the east decline exhausts air to surface. The declines and lateral development utilize welded wire mesh and shotcrete with swellex bolts for ground support. Open stopes will be backfilled with waste rock from the open pit hauled down the decline by empty ore trucks return from surface and mixed with cement underground. Barrick's Goldstrike Mine utilizes paste backfill, which is an alternative for Cortez in the future which may simplify the backfill process. Once the mine is in full operation it is estimated to have up to twelve production faces in operation producing per day of ore in 2009. Processing operations =Pipeline deposits= Processing of ore from the Pipeline deposits is done by either cyanide heap leaching or milling at the Pipeline mill. Low grade open pit ore is heap leached without further crushing at one of the two leach pads currently in operation. The larger leach pad is 3.6 million ft2 (362,000m2) with a 20,000 US gal/min (1,250 l/s) flow rate. The smaller pad is connected to the Pipeline mill and has a flow rate of 6,000 US gal/min (375 l/s). Higher grade ore is processed at the Pipeline mill utilizing CIC/CIL (carbon in column/carbon in leach). =Cortez Hills deposit= Low grade ore from open pit at the Cortez Hills deposit will be heap leached at dedicated heap leach pads at Cortez Hills site, while ore from the underground mine will be mixed with higher grade open pit and will be sent to the Pipeline mill via the largest overland conveyor in Nevada. Environmental & social issues =Environment= In order to bring the Cortez Hills Mine into operation, Barrick will have to move a road that runs through the Cortez Canyon which will cost US$15 million. Barrick will reforest hillsides that were clearcut in the 1800s and remove an obsolete roaster that has not been utilized since the 1980s. Working with the United States Bureau of Land Management and the Nevada Department of Wildlife Cortez has already revegetated some of their old waste dumps by placing alluvium over the waste rock and planting local vegetation in the area =Water= Northern Nevada has a limited supply of surface water which is considered a precious commodity, however large amounts of water can be found underground. At the Pipeline, pit water is pumped from aquifers where it is pumped to ranch land to be reintroduced into the groundwater supply. The mine keeps two streams of water, a contact water stream in which the water has come into contact with the mining operation, and a non-contact water stream where the water has not come into contact with the mining operation. The 'contact water stream is recycled and reused in the mining operation where the noncontact water is pumped off site. =Native Americans= The Timbisha Shoshone Tribe are calling for a stop to the Cortez Hills expansion, saying the damage that will be done to the land is irreversible and prevents the use of the lands for religious purposes. Barrick had taken part in a collaborative agreement with leaders of the four remaining Shoshone Tribes. A preliminary injunction requested by Western Shoshone activists was placed on Barrick to prevent the company from developing the Cortez Hills Mine expansion. Although the request was denied at the district level, a preliminary injunction was issued by the 9th Circuit, which could stop the project completely if the judge determines the project would cause the environment irreversible damage and restrict the religious freedom of the Western Shoshone. The focal point is Mount Tenabo (which Barrick would be mining the flank of, should the Cortez Hills Mine proceed as planned) and whether it is significant to the Western Shoshone culture as claimed. Barrick lawyers maintain that Mount Tenabo has been mined since 1862.

His studies on Ethiopia deal mainly with the internal ethnic dynamism between Tigreans and Amhara and the country's political culture as a factor in Ethiopia's survival in facing European imperialism. His studies on the Middle East deal mainly with the development of higher education and the role of students in politics. His studies on the relations between Ethiopia and the Middle East ‚Äì a field he is pioneering ‚Äî reconstruct the history of major strategic meeting points and focus mainly on the conceptual Islamic-Christian dimensions and the religious historical legacies which inspired and continue to influence those relations. =Ethiopia and Eritrea, Ras Alula, 1875‚Äì1897= A biography of Ethiopia's national hero, Ras Alula, the general and statesman who played a central role in Ethiopia's struggle for survival in facing late 19th century imperialism. In this context the book analyzes Ethiopia's relations with Egypt, the Mahdist Sudan, the Italians, and the British during the Scramble for Africa, and attempts at explaining Ethiopia's victories. In the same context it analyzes Ethiopia's home affairs of the time, mainly Tigrean-Shoan relations, the establishment of Asmara and late 19th century Eritrean history. =The Struggle Over Eritrea, 1962‚Äì1978= Analysis of the birth of the Eritrean nationalist movement and fight for independence. It focuses mainly on the internal struggles of the Eritreans as they were interwoven with two simultaneous developments: the internal affairs of Ethiopia during the time of Haile Sellassie and the beginning of Mangistu's period; and the relevant developments in the Arab world and the Arab-Israeli conflict of the time. =Ethiopia and The Challenge of Independence= A collection of twelve articles which had been published in various journals, all revolving around the Ethiopian modern experience, and which in sequence constitute an attempt at understanding the country's unique success at maintaining independence. =Students and University in Twentieth Century Egyptian Politics= This book follows two dimensions in the history of Egypt's modernization. One is the development and the evolution of the University as both a national concept and an educational institution. It reconstructs the role of politicians in shaping higher education from the 1908 establishment of the Egyptian University to Anwar Sadat‚Äôs revolutionary expansion of the education system. The other dimension is the role of students in politics. The book analyses the influence of the higher education system on the creation of the students as an active sociopolitical class; it surveys the students‚Äô role in major historic junctures, and describes the pivotal role of the educated youth in the making of the country's modern politics. =Introduction to Modern History of the Middle East= A five volume history of the Middle East from 18th century developments in the Ottoman Empire to World War I, and the establishment of the modern states of the Middle East. The narrative follows stages of modernization culminating with the emergence of modern nationalists ideas and movements, and is accompanied by hundreds of short informative articles and hundreds of authentic illustrations. =Ethiopia and the Middle East= A discussion of the relations between Ethiopia and the Oriental Middle East from medieval times to the present. It follows two interwoven aspects. One is the reconstruction of major junctures of political connections and strategic collisions. The second is the analysis and evolution of the basic mutual concepts and images which were shaped in earlier formative stages and have been reshaped in later confrontations to be transmitted to the conceptual reservoir of today's Ethiopian, Egyptian and Arab nationalism. =The Middle East Between the World Wars= Five volumes surveying the history of the Middle East from the aftermath of World War I to the end of World War II. The series analyses the \\"Parliamentarian\\" 1920s and \\"The Crisis of the 1930s\\" focusing mainly on the dynamism of inter-generational tensions as a key to sociopolitical and ideological changes. In so doing the series surveys developments in each of the major countries, but also attempts to narrate the history of the region as the home of a common Islamic-Arab civilization. Volume 5 (The Middle East During World War II, 2003) analyzes the same inter- generational tensions in Arab societies during the war, the anti-British activities on the one hand and the final victory (as of 1942) on the other hand of the elite groups leading to the emergence of the rather conservative Arab League (1945). =Ethiopia: an Empire and a Revolution= A history of Ethiopia from the early medieval Aksumite dynasty to the 1990s as analyzed mainly along the competition between centralizing concepts and institutions (‚Äúthe Amahara thesis‚Äù) on the one hand, and the pluralistic, de-centralist concepts of culture and politics (‚Äúthe Tigrean thesis‚Äù) on the other hand. The narrative also attempts to explain the ability of this Christian dominated society to retain, over that long history, its political sovereignty in facing both imperial Islam and Western imperialism. =Youth and Politics in the Middle East ‚Äì Generations and Identity Crises= A discussion of modern Middle Eastern history as developing around the role of higher education (and its various architects) in shaping new ‚Äúpolitical generations‚Äù in Arab societies, and the role of such ‚Äúpolitical generations‚Äù - mainly those of 1906, 1919, 1935, and the 1970s ‚Äî in offering and struggling for renewed interpretations of both politics and identity. =The Nile ‚Äì Histories, Cultures, Myths= This book was edited by Erlich with Israel Gershoni. It is a collection of 18 articles contributed by some of the world's leading scholars of Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia, of Islam and of Eastern Christianity. These articles were originally presented in a 1997 international conference held in Tel Aviv University and in Jerusalem under the same title. The introduction, written with co-editor (and co-organizer) Professor Israel Gershoni, presents the main theme of the book: the role of the River Nile in communicating, but also separating between its various riparian cultures and societies. The various chapters discuss the main Nile countries‚Äô common world of inter-relations, mutual images and myths, their image in medieval and modern Europe, and the various historical backgrounds to today's crisis of the Nile's waters. =The Cross and the River ‚Äì Ethiopia, Egypt and the Nile= A history of sixteen centuries of relations is analyzed, revolving around dimensions of mutual dependence: Ethiopia being the main source of Egypt's Nile, and Egypt being the main source of Ethiopia's Christianity. The complexities of good neighborliness and conflicts, of suspicions, myths and wars, of religious and cultural interpretations of the ‚Äúself‚Äù and the ‚Äúother‚Äù, is discussed from the 4th century creation of Ethiopia as a bishopric of the Egyptian Church to today's Egyptian and Ethiopian anxieties over the future of the Nile waters. =Ethiopia ‚Äì Christianity, Islam, Judaism= This book was written by Erlich with Steven Kaplan and Hagar Salamon. It is a detailed history of Ethiopia's religious history, and a discussion of the Ethiopian interpretation of each of its three belief systems, their local institutions, and their inter-relations. An introduction (by H. Erlich, the general editor) summarizes the flexible, non-essentialist nature of Ethiopia's religiosity. ‚ÄúChristianity‚Äù (by Professor Steven Kaplan) analyzes the history and many faces of the country's hegemonic religion. ‚ÄúIslam‚Äù (H. Erlich) discusses its role among ethnic minorities and on the margins of society, and ends with its apparent revolution and penetration into the core as of the 1990s. ‚ÄúJudaism‚Äù (by Hagar Salamon) surveys ‚ÄúBeta Israel‚Äôs\\" culture against the historical Ethiopian context. =Egypt ‚Äì The Older Sister= The first volume of the Open University's new series The Middle East in Our Time. The series‚Äô twelve volumes, authored by leading Israeli scholars (with H. Erlich as chief editor) will cover the history of the region's various states from 1945 to the 1980s, (each volume concluding with a succinct analysis to 2000). The Older Sister‚Äôs introduction surveys Egypt's leading role in shaping modern developments in the Middle East and in influencing the all-regional periodization of the post World War II era. The book‚Äôs three parts are devoted to a detailed analysis of ‚ÄúThe End of the Parliamentarian Era, 1945‚Äì1952‚Äù, ‚ÄúNasser and Nasserism, 1952‚Äì1970‚Äù, and ‚ÄúSadat ‚Äì The Return to Egyptianism, 1970 - 1981‚Äù. The pivotal theme is the ever-dynamic interplay between the various social and political forces in Egypt and the country's various identities ‚Äì Islamic, Arab, Egyptian. =Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia ‚Äì Christianity, Islam and Politics Entwined= A history of modern relations between the Wahhabi-Islamic state and Ethiopia, beginning in the 1930s and culminating in today's radicalization of Islam in the region and Ethiopia's transformation from a ‚ÄúChristian island‚Äù into a multicultural state. The narrative follows the development of strategic relations ever since Mussolini's conquest of Ethiopia through the Ogaden War and local activities of the terrorism networks of the 1990s. The conceptual dilemmas of Ethiopia's Christian establishments, of Ethiopia's Muslim communities and of the Saudis are analyzed as they have developed along and influenced these processes. =Ethiopia ‚Äì History of a Siege Culture= An analytical survey of Ethiopia's history from early Aksumite period to today's developments. The first part of the book discusses the medieval foundations of the country's political culture; the second part focuses on the late 19th century victory of Ethiopia over both European imperialists and local neighbors; and the third part explains the price paid for these formative victories ‚Äì the entrenchment of traditional structures and concepts as shapers of Ethiopia to 1974. The fourth part analyzes the communist revolution under Mengistu Haile Mariam (to 1991) as a recycling of the medieval siege culture in a new cloak, and argues that today's opening to both the outside world as well as to internal diversity and free economy is the first authentic revolution in the country's history. =Islam and Christianity in the Horn of Africa, Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan= Tracing the modern history of the region where the two religions first met, and where they are engaged now in active confrontation, this book surveys the political developments in the Horn of Africa since the late nineteenth century. The analysis combines the factual changes with an exploration of the ways in which religious formulations of the nearby \\"other\\" influenced policymaking and were also reshaped by it. It demonstrates how initial Islamic and Christian concepts remain directly relevant in the region today. =Generations of Rage ‚Äì University and Students in the Middle East= A detailed analysis of the development of higher education in the region combined with discussion of the rule of students in changing the Middle East along eight major historical junctures, from the rise of modern nationalist movements to the Arab Spring. =Alliance and Alienation ‚Äì Ethiopia and Israel in the Days of Haile Selassie= A discussion of the special relations between what used to be a Christian empire and the Jewish state of Israel. Analyzing the legacies of old religious messages and their influence on modern strategic relations the book, based on new archival material, sheds new lights on an African-Middle Eastern drama which began with great promise and ended disastrously in 1973.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on February 1, 1958, and stars Bugs Bunny. Mel Blanc voices Bugs and the absent-minded wolf character, Charles M. Wolf. An uncredited June Foray voices the wolf's wife, who appears in a brief scene at the beginning of the cartoon. Plot Charles M. Wolf is in his cave watching a baseball game on TV. Suddenly his wife burst in and demands he hunt a rabbit. Charles goes right away, rifle in hand muttering he hates his wife, getting a skillet tossed at his head. Bugs Bunny catches Charles running and while running alongside, he asks him what the rush is. When asked if he's hunting for something, Charlie forgets what it is and Bugs openly guesses a rabbit. Charles shoots at Bugs, but Bugs dodges the shots and in a minute or two causes him to whack himself with his gun. Bugs tests the gun for any faults, but as he shoots Charles in the face, he concludes Charles is just a bad shot. Charles starts chasing Bugs around a tree and Bugs does another round of questions as Charles has forgotten it's a rabbit he's after. As Charles recalls, Bugs trips him over. Bugs dives into his hole and leaves out a box. Charles finds inside it a hand grenade. Charlie reads a set of instructions to operate the grenade but takes too long after pulling the pin and it explodes in his face. Charles chases Bugs into a railroad tunnel. Charles runs out thinking a train is coming, but it's just Bugs holding a flashlight and blowing into a whistle. Having wised up, Charlie chases Bugs back into the tunnel, but a real train comes out of the tunnel and runs him over. Charles wonders why he ever wanted to catch a train. Out of his hole, Bugs lights a nearby fuse and Charles curiously follows it. At the end of the fuse, Charles gets in the way of an explosive gunpowder keg, which blows up. Bugs then builds a door on a plank of wood stretching out from a cliff. Charles demands to be let in and when Bugs refuses, he burst in and plummets off the cliff lying on the falling door. As Charles crashes into the ravine below, the impact also makes Bugs almost fall off the plank, but Bugs was able to hoist himself back up. Charles (now furious) rushes back up to Bugs and breathes heavily on Bugs' fur. Once again Charles forgets what he came after. This time Bugs then decides not to remind him and tells Charles to let him know when he finally finds out, leaving Charles to continue to guess. Hours later into the night, way past dinnertime, Charles is sitting on a rock, still trying to remember what it was he was chasing. Bugs emerges from his hole in his night attire, holding a candle and he bids the audience goodnight.

History The company was founded in 1991. In 1992, the first anime series distributed by Cloverway for Latin America was the Knights of the Zodiac TV series, first broadcast in Mexico and Brazil. It was followed by Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball some time later. In 1995, Dragon Ball was re-dubbed by Cloverway, after Bandai failed distributing their first episodes and a movie, dubbed under the title of \\"Zero y el drag√≥n m√°gico\\" (\\"Zero and the magic dragon\\", based on the Harmony Gold versionhttps://web.archive.org/web/20180805225739/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b-MnRSJo-o). Generally, Cloverway commissioned dubbing for the Spanish versions to the company ' (until its closure in 2005, later on to Optimedia Productions in 2006) in Mexico, and the Brazilian versions to ' (with exceptions like Sailor Moon, Yu Yu Hakusho and Mirmo) in S√£o Paulo Brazil, while some other works were dubbed into Spanish through Cloverway's arrangements with Televisa's owned in Mexico. Other Cloverway's arrangements were made with International Telefilms Inc.:es:Hern√°n Schmidt Fuentes#Telefilms for first-run syndication broadcasting in Chile (ETC TV and CHV) and Spanish dubbing recorded by in Santiago. As for the series owned by TMS, Spanish versions were already dubbed by VDI Multimedia in Los Angeles and previously distributed by other companies, but Brazilian versions were never produced and Cloverway couldn't get a deal for them to be dubbed and broadcast in Brazil. Also, Spanish versions of Kimba (Tezuka Productions) and Nippon Animation series distributed by Cloverway, were formerly dubbed and licensed by other companies, so Cloverway just distributed and offered them for reruns or inside TV programming packages. Parallel in the United States, Cloverway tried to distribute the same series by himself as in Latin America, but due to the regulations that led to the series censorship, they delegated licenses to local distributors who managed the production of English localisation, dubbing and distribution. However, Sailor Moon S and Sailor Moon SuperS were the only two licenses whose English versions were produced by Cloverway, dubbed in association with Optimum Production Services in Canada. As for the U.S. Hispanic market, Cloverway syndicated the series Tenchi Universe to Univision (Univisionhttps://web.archive.org/web/20011102065459/http://cybertoon.tripod.com/resource/tenchimuyo.html Spanish TV Saturday mornings on Univision and TelefuturaToonturama, a three- hour lineup that mainly consisted of dubbed versions of American and European animated series natively produced in English as well as anime series (Lost Universe, Tenchi Universe and Red Baron); networks) and Dragon Ball Z to Telemundohttps://web.archive.org/web/20180806114248/https://www.toonzone.net/forums/threads/spanish- dbz-returns.3611071/ networks.

In 2005, the Toei Animation licenses arranged by Cloverway were transferred to Toei Animation Inc. as a requirement, leaving Cloverway only with the catalog of the other Japanese producers they licensed. As a consequence of this, there has been a chain of irregularities, such as the loss of master tapes of many series formerly distributed by Cloverway, with the Latin American versions being the most affected for this change in distribution. After losing Toei's successful catalog, Cloverway continued representing and distributing anime from other Japanese companies, adding new properties and selling most of their new catalog to Cartoon Network L.A. and other local TV stations in Brazil and Hispanic America.

(August 8, 1903 ‚Äì January 16, 1992) was an American physician, who was principally responsible for developing the U.S. Naval Medical Research Institute. Behnke separated the symptoms of Arterial Gas Embolism (AGE) from those of decompression sickness and suggested the use of oxygen in recompression therapy. Behnke is also known as the \\"modern-day father\\" of human body composition for his work in developing the hydrodensitometry method of measuring body density, his standard man and woman models as well as a somatogram based on anthropometric measurements. Early life Behnke was born August 8, 1903, in Chicago, Illinois. He moved to New Mexico and settled in Whittier, California, by 1912. Behnke graduated from Whittier College in 1925 and moved to San Francisco to attend medical school at Stanford University. Stanford Medical School required a one-year internship prior to conferring a medical doctorate. Behnke joined the United States Navy and completed his internship at the Mare Island Naval Hospital in 1930. In 1932, the Navy sent Behnke to the Harvard School of Public Health. Naval career Following medical school in 1930, Behnke found his lifelong interest in deep sea diving when he was assigned as an assistant medical officer to and Submarine Division Twenty in San Diego under the command of Chester W. Nimitz. In addition to his other duties, Behnke spent time covering medical watch on , a submarine rescue ship, where he performed his first hard hat dive. In 1932 Behnke wrote a letter to the Surgeon General that was published in the United States Naval Medical Bulletin outlining the possible causes of arterial gas embolisms he was seeing related to submarine escape training. This separated the symptoms of arterial gas embolism (AGE) from those of decompression sickness. This letter caught the attention of the director of the submarine medicine in the Bureau of Medicine, Captain E.W. Brown. Brown sent Behnke to do postgraduate work at the Harvard School of Public Health and research on diving and submarine medicine with fellow student Charles W. Shilling. Philip Drinker asked Behnke to stay for two additional years and the Navy allowed it. Lieutenant junior grade Behnke was then sent to Pearl Harbor in 1935 to the Submarine Escape Training Tower. Later that year, Behnke et al. experimented with oxygen for recompression therapy. Evidence of the effectiveness of recompression therapy utilizing oxygen was later shown by Yarbrough and Behnke and has since become the standard of care for treatment of DCS. Behnke also began to outline his idea for a medical laboratory in 1936. That outline would eventually become the Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) now located with the National Naval Medical Center. In 1937, Behnke introduced the ‚Äúno-stop‚Äù decompression tables. After being transferred to Washington, D.C., in 1938, Behnke was assigned to medical duty at the Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU). The submarine USS Squalus sank in 1939 and Behnke responded with fellow NEDU personnel Commanders Charles Momsen and Allan McCann, Yarbrough and Wilmon, and master diver James McDonald with more divers. They met Shilling on site to begin work. Divers from the submarine rescue ship , under the direction of the salvage and rescue expert Momsen, employed the new Rescue Chamber he had invented years earlier but which the US Navy command had repeatedly blocked. They were able to rescue all 33 surviving crew members from the sunken submarine including future Rear Admiral Oliver F. Naquin. The salvage divers used recently developed heliox diving schedules and successfully avoided the cognitive impairment symptoms associated with such deep dives, thereby confirming Behnke's theory of nitrogen narcosis. Later in 1939, Behnke and Yarborough demonstrated that gases other than nitrogen also could cause narcosis. From his results, he deduced that xenon gas could serve as an anesthetic, even under normobaric conditions but was too scarce to allow for confirmation. Although Lazharev, in Russia, apparently studied xenon anesthesia in 1941, the first published report confirming xenon anesthesia was in 1946 by J. H. Lawrence, who experimented on mice. Xenon was first used as a surgical anesthetic in 1951 by Stuart C. Cullen, who successfully operated on two patients. Taking advantage of the positive public support for Navy diving following the Squalus rescue, Behnke contacted Franklin D. Roosevelt and with Presidential interest known, received approval for the construction of his research laboratory (NMRI). On December 7, 1941, when the attack on Pearl Harbor began, Behnke was at sea on and immediately reassigned to medical posts around Hawaii. Behnke returned to Washington and soon opened NMRI as the \\"research executive\\" in October 1942. Behnke focused his interest in how physical fitness and fat content effects inert gas elimination and started projects to evaluate this relationship. His research lead us to consider him the \\"modern-day father\\" of human body composition for \\"his pioneering studies of hydrostatic weighing in 1942, the development of a reference man and woman model, and somatogram based on anthropometric measurements underlie much current work in body composition assessment\\" When the people of Occupied Germany were suffering from starvation, Behnke focused his attention to increasing their food ration. Behnke remained at NMRI until 1950 when he was transferred to his final assignment at the Naval Radiological Defense Laboratory (NRDL) at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard. His work on physical fitness and body habitus continued in projects surrounding radiological shelters and decontamination. In 1950, Behnke earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal \\"for saving the life of a civilian skin diver who surfaced too quickly off Monterey. Behnke, then a Navy captain, spent two days in a decompression chamber with the man.\\" Upon retiring from the Navy in 1959, Behnke turned over command of the NRDL to Captain Harry S. Etter. Civilian career Upon his retirement from the Navy in 1959, Behnke became a professor of preventive medicine at the University of California and Director of the Institute of Applied Biology, Presbyterian Medical Center, San Francisco, California. Behnke served on the first Board of Advisors for the National Association of Underwater Instructors and taught medical aspects of diving at their first Instructor Candidate Course that started on August 26, 1960, in Houston, TX. The bends prevention and safety program for crews working in underground caissons to build the Bay Area Rapid Transit system was designed by Behnke in 1964. Behnke with several other researchers founded the Undersea Medical Society (now the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society) in 1967. The term \\"oxygen window\\" was first used by Behnke in 1967. Behnke refers to early work by Momsen on \\"partial pressure vacancy\\" (PPV) where he used partial pressures of O2 and He as high as 2-3 ATA to create a maximal PPV. Behnke then goes on to describe \\"isobaric inert gas transport\\" or \\"inherent unsaturation\\" as termed by LeMessurier and Hills, and separately by Hills, who made their independent observations at the same time. Van Liew et al. also made a similar observation that they did not name at the time. The clinical significance of their work was later shown by Sass. In 1975, Behnke was involved with experiments on cosmic particle radiation for the Apollo program. Behnke award Starting in 1969, the Behnke award is given annually has been given each year by the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society, Inc. to a scientist for outstanding scientific contributions to advances in undersea biomedical activity. The award carries an honorarium and a plaque. The first recipient was Behnke. Awards and honors Established in 1916 and awarded by the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States, the Sir Henry S. Wellcome Medal and Prize is awarded annually for \\"the research work most valuable for the military service performed in any branch of medicine, surgery, or sanitation\\". Behnke was the 1941 recipient. Behnke received the American College of Sports Medicine's Honor Award in 1976. In 1977, Behnke was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science (Sc.D.) degree from Whittier College. The Navy dedicated the NMRI Hyperbaric Research Facility on July 1, 1981, to Behnke.

The school is well connected by road, drawing its students from Kalai Upazila. History During the British era, just after the cancellation of the partition of Bengal in 1911 (Banga Vanga), a number of educational institutions were established in the then East Bengal (now Bangladesh). The partition of Bengal (1905) would have been beneficial to the eastern part of Bengal (the present day Bangladesh) with Dhaka as its capital, and development works of this area would have been more focused. But in the wake of much political turmoil and debate it was cancelled in 1911. The British Government allowed the people of East Bengal more educational institutes, more budget allocation for development works, etc., mainly to appease the aggravated inhabitants. There was no seat of higher secondary education in the Khetlal Thana under the Joypurhat Mohokuma of Bogra District. As a result, some local people took the initiative to start a school. Kalai was a village under the Khetlal Thana. Later Kalai became a separate thana. The school started with the name Kalai High English Institute in 1913 and was recognized by Calcutta (Kolkata) University in 1916. The school was first built on land donated by the local Talukder family. In 1933, a member of the Talukder family, Moyen Uddin, donated two large ponds to the school, and the school was named after him.Kalai-er Ekal O Shekal, Benajir and Habib, 2001 The school has been donated land up until now.

Shay was inspired to found the company by her dog, Pancake, to whom she used to feed homemade treats. The company was fairly small scale, with an annual revenue of about $200, however, as a result of her founding of the company Hammond was awarded $1000 by NFTE. The company traded online and in retail outlets in Kentucky, but it has since been discontinued, as Hammond was too busy with school activities to continue it. History The company was founded in 2004 by Shay Hammond and received a fair bit of media coverage during its first year, mainly due to Hammond being 11 at the time of founding. Hammond also received multiple awards and recognitions for the founding, she was awarded $1,000 in the 2006 after winning the Kentucky NFTE \\"Young Entrepreneur of the Year\\" award, and in 2007 she was recognized with a Guardian Life Insurance \\"Girls Going Places\\" award for entrepreneurship in general. Hammond was also interviewed on ABC News \\"Money Matters\\" which aired on live television 2 days before the NFTE event in 2006. Two years after founding the company Hammond had hopes for it, and said she wished to start mass-producing her treats and to open a retail location. After taking an entrepreneurship class sponsored by the University of Kentucky, which is in addition to her NFTE sponsored class, she continued selling her dog treats up until her freshman year of highschool. She says that it was hard for her to obtain a large custom, with the majority of people casting a skeptical eye over her company. Hammond no longer runs Shay's Bones and Biscuits, as it became to difficult for her to manage along with school and multiple afterschool activities. Products The biscuits were made in two flavors: Mutter Butter and Chicken Lickin', or Peanut Butter and Chicken respectively. The ingredients were all-natural, and founder Hammond mentioned that dipping the products in cheese was popular.

From 1989 to 2015, ARAA conducted over 150 clinical and pre-clinical studies, ranging from alternative therapies that employed a complementary approach to HIV care to the first in-human HIV vaccine trial. AIDS Research Alliance was partly responsible for \\"fast- tracking\\" to market half of today's anti-HIV treatments. History In 1989, a group of Southern California physicians and philanthropists, led by Paul Joseph Rothman, M.D. and Matthew Rushton, Hollywood film producer of Mrs. Doubtfire, founded Search Alliance to speed the discovery and development of effective treatments against HIV and its complications. Working with physicians who were experimenting with potential treatments in their private practices, the organization pooled data and identified promising experimental regimens. The staff designed the studies, coordinated the data collection of Alliance physicians, and analyzed and published the results. In 1995, Search Alliance changed its name to AIDS Research Alliance of America and centralized all research activities in one licensed facility based in Los Angeles. This allowed ARAA to identify and manage scientific, clinical and organizational strategies with a staff of dedicated research professionals, while maintaining affiliations with physicians, academics and scientists in research institutions around the world. In 2009, ARAA relocated from West Hollywood, where it had been located for 14 years, to a larger research facility in downtown Los Angeles.Research space: AIDS Research Alliance has leased office space at the California Professional Center building. Los Angeles Business Journal 12/01/08 As a community-based organization, ARAA served as a bridge between communities at risk of HIV and government-funded research. It collaborated with government-sponsored researchers and pharmaceutical companies, but also advocated for and conducted research that was not driven by the demand for profitability.Trials By Fire. Williams, S; POZ No. 12, P. 56; (02/96-03/96) ARAA was licensed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop a drug to combat HIV - prostratin. Carolyn H. Carlburg, J.D. was the last Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen J. Brown, M.D. was the Medical Director. Research AIDS Research Alliance of America focused its research and development program on several core areas, including the clinical trials of anti-HIV drugs that inhibited the virus in novel ways, and new medical strategies ‚Äì like microbicides and vaccines ‚Äì that prevented the spread of HIV. ARAA conducted clinical trials aimed at treating the medical disorders that accompany HIV, including HIV-associated lipodystrophy, diarrhea and neuropathy. Developing strategies that eliminated HIV viral reservoirs became a major research initiative of ARAA. This included its work on prostratin, a potential reservoir ablative agent that ARAA had in-licensed from NIH. In 2008, ARAA filed a new patent on prostratin and its analogues, thus broadening its research platform targeting the HIV reservoirs.Methods of Administering Prostratin and Structured Analogues Thereof. United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) (ISA/US), April 11, 2008 Funding AIDS Research Alliance of America funded its research by using a business model that included contract research as well as tax-deductible donations from private individuals, corporations and foundations. ARAA conducted clinical trials for major pharmaceutical sponsors including Pfizer, Merck, Theratechnologies, Schering-Plough, Tibotec, NeurogesX, National Institutes of Health, Serono, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Agouron, GlaxoSmithKline, Orasure Technologies, Gilead Sciences, and many others.PR Newswire September 17, 1995 Funders and partners to ARAA included The Ahmanson Foundation, Capital Group Companies, City of West Hollywood, Concord Music Group, David Michod, Douglas MacBride Kinney, Entertainment AIDS Alliance, The Joseph Drown Foundation, Kaiser Permanente, MacHeist, The MacDonald Family Foundation, The Pepsi Refresh Project, The Silva Watson Moon Walk Fund, The University Wide AIDS Research Program [the University of California], the Division of AIDS [NIH], Until There is a Cure, and many others. ARAA participated each year in the Combined Federal Campaign, as part of the Medical Research Charities Federation and received high ratings from the American Institute of Philanthropy and Charity Navigator. ARAA hosted a number of fundraising events ‚Äì including ArtSeen featuring A Taste of Los Angeles and was a beneficiary of events like Macy‚Äôs Passport In-Store, Spinning Nation and the Game Show Congress. ARAA was a member of the Global Giving Foundation online fundraising platform and had a partnership with We-care.com, an online charity mall.

The album is the third and allegedly final installment in Danny's famed Dream... instrumental series and, like its predecessors, bears Danny's anthroponym on its cover‚Äîan ominous all-black sleeve‚Äîrather than his stage name in an effort to distinguish himself from Daniel Swain the record producer and Danny!, his rapper alter ego. Originally intended for an April release, Dream, Extinguished's date was moved forward to January 29 (see 2008 in music) to compensate for the unforeseen delay of And I Love H.E.R., his fifth studio album. Unlike the first two entries in the Dream... trilogy, a promotional tagline for Dream, Extinguished does not exist. Cancellation and subsequent release A mere day before it was set to be released to the market in 2008, Dream, Extinguished was withdrawn by Danny himself, much to the surprise of anticipating fans. For reasons unknown Danny abandoned the entire project, leaving only a sparse quantity of promotional copies in US circulation. As a result Dream, Extinguished became the first and, to date, only title in Danny's discography to not be released, making it the most coveted record in his extensive catalogue. Rumors of the project being given a proper domestic release were confirmed in late May 2009 via Danny!'s website. The Japanese version of Dream, Extinguished made its first retail appearance on June 23, 2009 via iTunes and other major digital stores with a track listing (allegedly chronicling a year-long relationship that ended on sour terms) that closely, but not entirely, mirrors its American counterpart; three years later, the European version came out. It is not known when, if ever, Dream, Extinguished will be released in its original incarnation. As all three of Danny!'s instrumental albums were dually promoted as beat tapes, a few of the tracks included on Dream, Extinguished were later utilized by rappers such as Danny Brown, Lil B and Wale on their respective projects long after its release.

A sugary drink tax, soda tax, or sweetened beverage tax (SBT) is a tax or surcharge (food-related fiscal policy) designed to reduce consumption of drinks with added sugar. Drinks covered under a soda tax often include carbonated soft drinks, sports drinks and energy drinks. This policy intervention is an effort to decrease obesity and the health impacts related to being overweight, however the medical evidence supporting the benefits of a sugar tax on health is of very low certainty. The tax is a matter of public debate in many countries and beverage producers like Coca-Cola often oppose it. Advocates such as national medical associations and the World Health Organization promote the tax as an example of Pigovian taxation, aimed to discourage unhealthy diets and offset the growing economic costs of obesity. Design Tax design approaches include direct taxes on the product and indirect taxes. Indirect taxes include import/export taxes on sugar or other ingredients before it has been processed and local/regional.international taxes. Sales tax (indirect tax) is paid by the person consuming the item at the time of purchase and collected by the government from the seller. VAT (value added tax) is the most common type of tax and is also added on at the time of purchase, at an amount that is dependent on the value paid for the item. The amount of both VAT and sales tax are directly proportional to the amount of money paid for an item and do not consider the volume of food or drink. For this reason, a large (bulk) item would have less tax compared to a smaller cheaper item (i.e., there is less tax impact on larger packages of a food item). Most taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are set volumetrically (i.e., with a constant rate per unit volume), and that \\"only three SSB taxes worldwide are proportional to sugar content.\\" The study argued that such volumetric taxes \\"are poorly targeted to the actual health harms from SSBs,\\" and suggested taxing the amount of sugar in beverages, rather than the volume of liquid accompanying the sugar. A design change such as this has been proposed to \\"boost a SSB tax's health benefits and overall economic gains by roughly 30%.\\" Increased taxes on sweetened products have been suggested to promote companies to re-formulate their product in order to keep consumer costs affordable by decreasing use of the taxed ingredient (i.e., sugar) in their product. Government revenues from these taxes sometimes are put towards improving public health services, however this is not always the case.  Arguments against the sugary drinks tax  * The criteria on what drinks are taxed may not include equally bad substitutes like fruit juice, energy-dense snacks and biscuits.Silano, Marco, and Carlo Agostoni. \\"To Tax Or Not To Tax Sugary Drinks? This Is The Question\\". Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017): 1. Web. * The tax is regressive since consumers on lower incomes will be more negatively impacted by higher prices than consumers on higher incomes. This regressive effect of the sugary drinks tax can be counteracted if the collected tax revenue is used to subsidize healthier foods. * Cross-border shopping can also be an easy way out for consumers to not pay the tax as they will buy sugary drinks from areas where they are not taxed.  Health concerns related to excess sugar in the diet  Type II diabetes is a growing health concern in many developed and developing countries around the world, with 1.6 million deaths directly due to this disease in 2015 alone. Unlike sugar from food, the sugar from drinks enters the body so quickly that it can overload the pancreas and the liver, leading to diabetes and heart disease over time. A 2010 study said that consuming one to two sugary drinks a day increases your risk of developing diabetes by 26%. Heart disease is responsible for 31% of all global deaths and although one sugary drink has minimal effects on the heart, consuming sugary drinks daily are associated with long term consequences. A study found that men, for every added serving per day of sugar-sweetened beverages, each serving was associated with a 19% increased risk of developing heart disease. Another study also found increased risks for heart disease in women who drank sugary drinks daily. Obesity is also a global public and health policy concern, with the percentage of overweight and obese people in many developed and middle income countries rising rapidly. Consumption of added sugar in sugar-sweetened beverages has been positively correlated with high calorie intake, and through it, with excess weight and obesity. The addition of one sugar-sweetened beverage per day to the normal US diet can amount to 15 pounds of weight gain over the course of 1 year. Added sugar is a common feature of many processed and convenience foods such as breakfast cereals, chocolate, ice cream, cookies, yogurts and drinks produced by retailers. The ubiquity of sugar- sweetened beverages and their appeal to younger consumers has made their consumption a subject of particular concern by public health professionals. In both the United States and the United Kingdom, sugar sweetened drinks are the top calorie source in teenager's diets. A French study published in 2019 on the British Medical Journal also enlighted a possible link between the consumption of sugary drinks (beverages containing more than a 5% of sugar) and a higher or increased risk of developing cancer. Even if the researchers were unable to proof a clear causality between the two factors, they stated that their results can be taken as a confirm that \\"reducing the amount of sugar in our diet is extremely important.\\" Dental caries, also known as tooth decay or dental cavities, is the most common noncommunicable disease worldwide.https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/259413/WHO-NMH- NHD-17.12-eng.pdf?sequence=1 Sugary drink taxes have been discussed as a potential means to reduce the health and economic burden of dental caries. =Comparison to tobacco taxes= Proponents of soda taxes cite the success of tobacco taxes worldwide when explaining why they think a soda tax will work to lower soda consumption. Where the main concern with tobacco is cancer, the main concerns with soda are diabetes and obesity. The tactics used to oppose soda taxes by soda companies mimic those of tobacco companies, including funding research that downplays the health risks of its products. Impact =Revenue= The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reports that a national targeted tax on sugar in soda could generate $14.9 billion in the first year alone. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a nation-wide three-cent-per-ounce tax would generate over $24 billion over four years.Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, \\"Who would be affected by soda taxes?\\" The Fed Letter, No. 284 Mar 2011. Some tax measures call for using the revenue collected to pay for relevant health needs: improving diet, increasing physical activity, obesity prevention, nutrition education, advancing healthcare reform, etc. Another area to which the revenue raised by a soda tax might go, as suggested by Mike Rayner of the United Kingdom, is to subsidize healthier foods like fruits and vegetables. =Consumption= According to a 2019 review of research on sugar drink taxes, the taxes successfully reduced consumption of sugar drinks and reduced adverse health consequences. In general, the theory of supply and demand predicts that the effect of taxes is to raise the consumer price of a good, and lower the quantity consumed. Whether the sugary drinks tax is imposed on the seller or consumer, in both cases the tax burden is shared between both. Several studies have shown this effect in practice: * A 10% tax in Mexico enacted in January 2014 reduced consumption by 12% after one year, said one study that had not yet been peer- reviewed. *Various studies of the tax of one cent per ounce in Berkeley California have reported consumption has dropped between 9.6% and 52%, depending on the time period examined and the methods used. * A study (which has yet to be peer-reviewed) of the 1.5-cents-per-ounce tax in Philadelphia found actual sales of the affected beverages (which included diet beverages) dropped 46% in the city itself, but when accounting for people traveling to neighboring cities without a tax, overall purchases of the affected beverages dropped 20%. The way that the tax burden is divided upon the consumer and seller depends on the price elasticity for sugary drinks. The tax burden will fall more on sellers when the price elasticity of demand is greater than the price elasticity of supply while on buyers when the price elasticity of supply is greater than the price elasticity of demand. The price elasticity for sugary drinks is different from country to country. For instance, the price elasticity of demand for sugary drinks was found to be -1.37 in Chile while -1.16 in Mexico.Guerrero-L√≥pez, Carlos M., Mishel Unar-Mungu√≠a, and M. Arantxa Colchero. \\"Price Elasticity Of The Demand For Soft Drinks, Other Sugar- Sweetened Beverages And Energy Dense Food In Chile\\". BMC Public Health 17.1 (2017): n. pag. Web.Colchero, M.A. et al. \\"Price Elasticity Of The Demand For Sugar Sweetened Beverages And Soft Drinks In Mexico\\". Economics & Human Biology 19 (2015): 129-137. Web. Hence if both of those results were realistic and the price elasticity of supply would be the same for both, the tax burden on consumers would be higher in Mexico than in Chile. A 2019 National Bureau of Economic Research paper concluded that sugar drink taxes were \\"welfare enhancing, and indeed that the optimal nationwide SSB tax rate may be higher than the one cent per ounce rate most commonly used in U.S. cities.\\" A 2019 study in the Quarterly Journal of Economics estimated that the optimal sugar drink tax on the federal level in the U.S. would be between 1 and 2.1 cents per ounce, whereas the optimal tax on the city-level was 60% lower than that due to cross-border shopping. =Externalities as a rationale for taxation= The purchase of sugary drinks has a significant negative externalities when over-consumption causes diseases like obesity and type 2 diabetes. Depending on the national health care system, a significant portion of these costs are paid by taxpayers or insurance rate-payers; lost productivity costs are paid to some degree by employers. Society as a whole could be worse off if these costs are calculated to be greater than the benefit to the consumers of soda. A Pigovian tax like a sugary drinks tax, factors these externalities into the price of the beverage. To some degree, this causes people who over-consume soda to pay for health care costs they are causing, which proponents argue is more fair. In theory, this tax could be set at such a level that reduces consumption until the collective private benefit balances the collective costs of poorer health, though this could be accomplished at a lower tax level by using the tax revenue to create childhood nutrition programs or obesity- prevention programs. This would lessen the tax burden on people who consume soda moderately enough not to cause health problems.  Countries  A map of countries with nation-wide sugary drink taxes =Australia= The Australian Beverages Council announced in June 2018 that the industry would cut sugar content by 10% by 2020, and by another 10% by 2025. This was seen as an attempt to stave off a sugar tax. There were no plans to reduce the sugar content in the high sugar drinks. The plan is primarily to increase consumption of low-sugar or no-sugar drinks. Sales of Coca-Cola Amatil's fizzy drinks have fallen 8.1% by volume from 2016 to 2018. The Australian Medical Association continued to press for a sugar tax. =Chile= In 2014, a measure was passed to increase tax on sugary drinks, and reduce tax on low-sugar drinks. The tax rate was increased from 13% to 18%, for drinks containing 6.25g added sugar per 100ml. In contrast, the tax rate on drinks with less added sugar was decreased to 10%. This has led to a 21.6% decrease in the consumption of sugary drinks. =Colombia= A 2016 proposal for a 20% sugary drink tax, campaigned by Educar Consumidores, was turned down by the Colombian legislature despite popular support for it. Soda is often less expensive than bottled water in Colombia. = Denmark = Denmark instituted a soft drink tax in the 1930s (it amounted to 1.64 Danish krone per liter), but announced in 2013 that they were going to abolish it along with an equally unpopular fat tax, with the goal of creating jobs and helping the local economy. Critics claimed that the taxes were notably ineffective; to avoid the fat and sugar taxes, local retailers had complained that Danes simply went to Sweden and Germany, where prices were lower to buy butter, ice cream and soda. Denmark repealed the fat tax in January 2013 and repealed the tax on soft drinks in 2014. = France = France first introduced a targeted tax on nonalcoholic sugary drinks at a national level in 2012. The tax, which is 0.0716 euro per liter, applies to both regular and diet soft drinks, flavored mineral water, and fruit juices with added sugar, but does not apply to mineral water and 100% fruit juices (i.e., those with no added sugars). Following introduction, soft drinks were estimated to be up to 3.5% more expensive. A 2019 article published in the journal PLOS One estimated the price and consumption effects of the tax, using a difference-in-difference methodology. The study concluded: \\"We find that the tax is transmitted to the prices of taxed drinks, with full transmission for soft drinks and partial transmission for fruit juices. The evidence on purchase responses is mixed and less robust, indicating at most a very small reduction in soft drink purchases (about half a litre per capita per year), an impact which would be consistent with the low tax rate. We find suggestive evidence of a larger response by the sub-sample of heavy purchasers. Fruit juices and water do not seem to have been affected by the tax.\\" =Hungary= Hungary's tax, which came into effect in September 2011, is a 4-cent tax on foods and drinks that contain large quantities of sugar and salt, such as soft drinks, confectionery, salty snacks, condiments, and fruit jams. In 2016, the tax has resulted in a 22% reduction in energy drink consumption and 19% of people reduced their intake of sugary soft drinks. =India= 40% tax on sugary soda from 1 July 2017 =Ireland= Soda tax introduced on 1 May 2018. The tax will see 30 cent per litre added to the price of popular sweetened drinks containing more than 8g of sugar per 100ml. =Malaysia= Malaysia has a sugary drink tax implemented 1 July 2019. = Mexico = In September 2013, Mexico's president Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, on his fiscal bill package, proposed a 10% tax on all soft drinks, especially carbonated drinks, with the intention of reducing the number of patients with diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases in Mexico, which has one of the world's highest rates of obesity. According to Mexican government data, in 2011, the treatment for each patient with diabetes cost the Mexican public health care system (the largest of Latin America) around US$708 per year, with a total cost of 778,427,475 USD in 2010, and with each patient paying only 30 MXN (around US$2.31). In September 2013, soda companies launched a media campaign to discourage the Mexican Chamber of Deputies and Senate from approving the 10% soda tax. They argued that such measure would not help reduce the obesity in Mexico and would leave hundreds of Mexicans working in the sugar cane industry jobless. They also publicly accused New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg of orchestrating the controversial bill from overseas. In late October 2013, the Mexican Senate approved a 1 MXN per litre tax (around US$0.08) on sodas, along with a 5% tax on junk food. Research has shown that Mexico's sugary drinks tax reduced soft drink consumption. According to a 2016 study published in BMJ, annual sales of sodas in Mexico declined 6% in 2014 after the introduction of the soda tax. Monthly sales figures for December 2014 were down 12% on the previous two years. Households with the fewest resources had an average reduction in purchases of 9% in 2014, increasing to 17% by December. Furthermore, purchases of water and non-taxed beverages increased by about 4% on average. Whether the imposition of the tax and the resulting 6% decline in sales of soft drinks will have any measurable impact on long-term obesity or diabetes trends in Mexico has yet to be determined. The authors of the study urged the Mexican authorities to double the tax to further reduce consumption. A 2016 study published in PLoS Medicine suggested that a 10% excise tax on soda \\"could prevent 189,300 new cases of Type 2 diabetes, 20,400 strokes and heart attacks, and 18,900 deaths among adults 35 to 94 years old\\" over a ten-year period. The study also included that \\"the reductions in diabetes alone could yield savings in projected healthcare costs of $983 million.\\" A 2017 study in the Journal of Nutrition found a 6.3% reduction in soft drink consumption, with the greatest reductions \\"among lower-income households, residents living in urban areas, and households with children. We also found a 16.2% increase in water purchases that was higher in low- and middle-income households, in urban areas, and among households with adults only.\\" = Norway = Norway has had a generalized sugar tax measure on refined sugar products since 1922, introduced to boost state income rather than reducing sugar consumption. Non-alcoholic beverages have since been separated from the general tax, and in 2017, the tax for sugary drinks was set to 3.34 kroner per litre. In January 2018, the Norwegian government increased the sugar tax level by 83% for general sugar- containing ready-to-eat products, and 42% for beverages. The sugar tax per litre was bumped up to 4.75 kroner, and applies to beverages which are either naturally or artificially sweetened. = Philippines = In the taxation reform law dubbed as the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion Law (TRAIN) signed by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in December 2017. It includes taxation on sugar-sweetened drinks which will be implemented the following year, as an effort to increase revenue and to fight obesity. Drinks with caloric and non-caloric sweeteners will be taxed ‚Ç±6.00 per liter, while those using high-fructose corn syrup, a cheap sugar substitute, will be taxed at ‚Ç±12 per liter. Exempted from the sugar tax are all kinds of milk, whether powdered or in liquid form, ground and 3-in-1 coffee packs, and 100-percent natural fruit and vegetable juices, meal replacements and medically indicated drinks, as well as beverages sweetened with stevia or coco sugar. These drinks, especially 3-in-1 coffee drinks which are popular especially among lower- income families, are to be taxed as initially proposed by the House of Representatives version of the bill, but were exempted in the Senate version. =Portugal= Portugal introduced a sugary drink tax in 2017. It also has a tax on foods with high sodium. =Saudi Arabia= Saudi Arabia has a 50% sugar tax only on soft and energy drinks since 10 June 2017, and since 1 December 2019 the same tax percentage applies to all sugary drinks.Sugary drinks to be costlier from 1 Dec. Saudi Gazette Retrieved 27 November 2019. =Singapore= During the National Day Rally 2017, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong spoke at length on the importance of fighting diabetes. He said, \\"If you drink soft drinks every day, you are overloading your system with sugar, and significantly increasing your risk of diabetes. Our children are most at risk because soft drinks are part of their lifestyle.\\" On 4 December 2018, the Ministry of Health began a consultation exercise to seek public's feedback on four proposed measures to fight diabetes including a ban on high-sugar packet drinks and implementation of a sugar tax. On 10 October 2019, the Ministry of Health chose to ban advertisements of drinks with high sugar content; making Singapore the first country in the world to do so, as well as introduce color- coded labels. This comes after a public consultation favored these two options out of four. The labels will indicate drinks as \\"healthy\\", \\"neutral\\", \\"unhealthy\\" and take into account the amount of sugar and saturated fat contained in drinks, among other factors. They will be compulsory for \\"unhealthy\\" drinks and optional for \\"healthy\\" ones, covering instant drinks, soft drinks, juices, cultured milk and yogurt drinks in bottles, cans and packs. These measures will take effect sometime in 2020. = South Africa = South Africa proposed a sugar-sweetened beverages tax in the 2016 South African national government budget. South Africa introduced a sugar tax on 1 April 2018. The levy was fixed at 2.1 cents per gram of sugar, for each gram above 4g per 100ml of sweetened beverage. The levy excludes fruit juices, despite health professionals warning that fruit juice is as bad for a person as highly sugary drinks. =Thailand= Sugar tariffs since Oct 2017. =United Arab Emirates= In October 2017, the United Arab Emirates introduced a 50% tax on soft drinks and a 100% tax on energy drinks, to curb unhealthy consumption of sugary drinks that can lead to diabetes; it also added a 100% tax on cigarettes.UAE imposes 'sin' tax on soda, tobacco, and energy drinks Business Insider 3 October 2017 From 1 January 2020, the UAE would impose a tax on all products which contains sugar or artificial sweeteners. = United Kingdom = In the 2016 United Kingdom budget, the UK Government announced the introduction of a sugar tax, officially named the \\"Soft Drinks Industry Levy\\". The tax came into effect on 6 April 2018. Beverage manufacturers are taxed according to the volume of sugar-sweetened beverages they produce or import. The tax is imposed at the point of production or importation, in two bands. Drinks with total sugar content above 5g per 100 millilitres are taxed at 18p per litre and drinks above 8g per 100 millilitres at 24p per litre. The measure was estimated to generate an additional ¬£1 billion a year in tax revenue which would be spent on funding for sport in UK schools. Despite not being part of the United Kingdom the British Soft Drinks Industry Levy will come into force on the Isle of Man on 1 April 2019 because of the Common Purse Agreement. It was proposed that pure fruit juices, milk-based drinks and the smallest producers would not be taxed. For other beverages there was an expectation that some manufacturers would reduce sugar content in order to avoid the taxation. Indeed, manufacturer A.G. Barr significantly cut sugar content in their primary product Irn-Bru in advance of the tax. Notable research on effect of excess sugar in modern diets in the United Kingdom includes the work of Professor John Yudkin with his book called, \\"Pure, White and Deadly: The Problem of Sugar\\" first published in 1972. With regard to a proposed tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, a study published in the British Medical Journal on 31 October 2013, postulated that a 20% tax on sugar-sweetened beverages would reduce obesity in the United Kingdom rates by about 1.3%, and concluded that taxing sugar-sweetened beverages was \\"a promising population measure to target population obesity, particularly among younger adults.\\" Estimates of the revenue raised were reduced to ¬£240 million per annum in 2019. It helped to boost sales, rather than dampening performance, according to Britvic‚Äôs 2018 Soft Drinks Review. In April 2018 only 8.4% of the market was liable to the levy because drinks were reformulated.  Criticism  The tax has been criticised on several grounds, including its likely efficacy and its narrow base. UK Member of Parliament Will Quince called it \\"patronising, regressive and the nanny state at its worst.\\" In addition a study by the University of Glasgow, which sampled 132,000 adults, found that focusing on sugar in isolation misleads consumers as reducing fat intake is also crucial to reducing obesity. From an opposing standpoint, Professor Robert Lustig of the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, has argued that the UK tax measure may not go far enough and that, \\"juice should be taxed the same way as soda because from a metabolic standpoint juice is the same as soda.\\" Campaigners have since called for the soft drinks tax to be extended to include confectionery and sweets to help tackle childhood obesity.Sugar tax must apply to sweets as well as drinks, say campaigners The Guardian = United States = The United States does not have a nationwide soda tax, but a few of its cities have passed their own tax and the U.S. has seen a growing debate around taxing soda in various cities, states and even in Congress in recent years. A few states impose excise taxes on bottled soft drinks or on wholesalers, manufacturers, or distributors of soft drinks. Supermarket chilled beverage selection American localities with a soda tax Philadelphia and Berkeley are the first two cities to pass a tax on sugary drinks in the U.S. Berkeley's tax of 1 cent/oz of sugary drink has seen a decline in soda consumption by more than 20 percent. Philadelphia's tax of 1.5 cents/oz took effect on 1 January 2017. = Berkeley, California = The Measure D soda tax was approved by 76% of Berkeley voters on 4 November 2014, and took effect on 1 January 2015 as the first such tax in the United States. The measure imposes a tax of one cent per ounce on the distributors of specified sugar-sweetened beverages such as soda, sports drinks, energy drinks, and sweetened ice teas but excluding milk-based beverages, meal replacement drink, diet sodas, fruit juice, and alcohol. The revenue generated will enter the general fund of the City of Berkeley. A similar measure in neighboring San Francisco received 54% of the vote, but fell short of the supermajority required to pass. In August 2015, researchers found that average prices for beverages covered under the law rose by less than half of the tax amount. For Coke and Pepsi, 22 percent of the tax was passed on to consumers, with the balance paid by vendors. UC Berkeley researchers found a higher pass-through rate for the tax: 47% of the tax was passed-through to higher prices of sugar-sweetened beverages overall with 69% being passed-through to higher soda prices. In August 2016, a UC Berkeley study (relying on self-reporting) showed a 21% drop in the drinking of soda and sugary beverages in low-income Berkeley neighborhoods after a few months. A study from 2016 compared the changing intake of sugar sweetened beverages and water in Berkeley versus San Francisco and Oakland (which did not have a sugary drink tax passed) before and after Berkeley passed its sugary drink tax. This analysis showed a 26% decrease of soda consumption in Berkeley and 10% increase in San Francisco and Oakland while water intake increased by 63% in Berkeley and 19% in the two neighboring cities. A 2017 before and after study has concluded that one year after the tax was introduced in Berkeley, sugary drink sales decreased by 9.6% when compared to a scenario where the tax was not in place. This same study was also able to show that overall consumer spending did not increase, contradicting the argument of opponents of the Sugary Drink Tax. Another 2017 study results were that purchases of healthier drinks went up and sales of sugary drinks went down, without overall grocery bills increasing or the local food sector losing money. A 2019 study relying on self-reporting found a 53% drop in consumption in low-income neighborhoods after three years. = Philadelphia, Pennsylvania = Democratic Philadelphia mayor Jim Kenney proposed a citywide soda tax that would raise the price of soda at three cents per ounce. At the time, it was the biggest soda tax proposal in the United States. Kenney promoted using tax revenue to fund universal pre-K, jobs, and development projects, which he predicted would raise $400 million over five years, all the while reducing sugar intake by decreasing the demand for sugary beverages. Kenney's soda tax proposal was brought to the national spotlight and divided key members of the Democratic Party. Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders argued in an op-ed that the tax would hurt the poor. His opponent, Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, said that she was \\"very supportive\\" of the idea. The American Beverage Association (ABA), funded by soda companies and distributors, ran local television, radio, and newspaper advertisements against the idea, claiming that the tax would disproportionately hurt the poor. The ABA spent $10.6 million in 2016 in its effort against the tax.Claire Sasko, American Beverage Association Files Soda- Tax Lawsuit, Philadelphia Magazine (14 September 2016). The American Medical Association, American Heart Association, and other medical and public health groups support the tax.Fifteen health organizations file in Philadelphia‚Äôs sugary drink tax, American Heart Association News (10 March 2017). The Philadelphia City Council approved a 1.5-cents-per-ounce tax on 16 June 2016. As part of the compromise legislation that passed, the tax is also imposed on artificially sweetened beverages, such as diet soda. The law became effective on 1 January 2017. It was reported after two months of the tax that Philadelphia supermarkets and beverage distributors are planning layoffs because sugary beverage sales are down between 30 and 50 percent. After the tax took effect, Kenney said retailers' price gouging blamed on the tax and charging the tax on items not subject to it was \\"wrong\\" and \\"misleading\\".Retailers Blame Soda Tax; Mayor Kenney Responds With Harsh Words, CBS News Philadelphia, 10 January 2017 In February 2017, soda manufacturers and retailers announced sales declines of 30-50% in Philadelphia and announced job cuts and layoffs. Kenny characterized the layoffs as evidence of greed among manufacturers.Julia Terruso (2017). \\"Soda companies, supermarkets report 30-50 pct. sales drop from soda tax\\" Philly.com, 21 Feb 2017. In the first four months of the soda tax $25.6 million was collected, which is lower than predicted.Philly: Soda tax revenue to fall short Philly.com, 13 June 2017 The revenue is intended to pay for a pre-K program (49% of tax revenue), government employee benefits and city programs (20%), and rebuilding city parks and recreation centers. A recent study from 2017 found that Philadelphia's tax has decreased sugary beverage consumption in impoverished youth by 1.3 drinks/week. Langellier et al. also found that when paired with the pre-K program, attendance increases significantly, a finding that is likely to have longer term positive effects than a sugary drink tax alone. In March 2017, Pepsi laid off between 80 and 100 employees at two distribution plants in Philadelphia and one plant in nearby Wilmington, Delaware. The company blamed the layoffs on the tax, an assertion rejected by the city government.Pepsi to lay off 80 to 100, blames soda tax, The Philadelphia Inquirer, 1 March 2017. In September 2016, the American Beverage Association, Philadelphia business owners, and other plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against the soda tax, alleging that the tax violated the \\"Tax Uniformity Clause\\" of the state constitution.Fabiola Cineas, Philly‚Äôs Soda Tax Is Back in Court Today, Philadelphia Magazine (5 April 2017). The legal challenge was dismissed by the Court of Common Pleas in December 2016, and in June 2017 the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania (in a 5-2 decision) affirmed that ruling.

A 2019 study (which has yet to be peer-reviewed) of the 1.5-cents-per-ounce tax in Philadelphia found actual sales of the affected beverages (which included diet beverages) dropped 46% in the city itself, but when accounting for people traveling to neighboring cities without a tax, overall purchases of the affected beverages dropped 20%. =San Francisco, California = A one-cent-per-ounce soda tax (Prop V) passed with over 61% of the vote on 8 November 2016 and applies to distributors of sugary beverages on 1 January 2018. Exemptions for the tax include infant formulas, milk products, supplements, drinks used for medical reasons, and 100% fruit and vegetable juices. The soda industry spent almost $20 million in its unsuccessful push to defeat the soda tax initiative, a record-breaking amount for a San Francisco ballot initiative. In 2014, the first referendum on a soda tax, Proposition E, was voted down by San Francisco; the 2014 referendum received the support of 55 percent of voters, short of the two-thirds required for a referendum directing money to a specific item (the referendum proposed directing the revenue raised to children's physical education and nutrition programs, and in San Francisco such earmarking requires a two-thirds vote to pass).Heather Knight, Why Berkeley passed a soda tax and S.F. didn't, San Francisco Chronicle (7 November 2014). In that referendum campaign, the soda industry spent about $10 million in opposition to the proposed tax. =Oakland, California = A one-cent-per-ounce soda tax (Measure HH) passed with over 60% of the vote on 8 November 2016. The tax went into effect on 1 July 2017. =Albany, California= A one-cent-per-ounce soda tax (Prop O1) passed with over 70% of the vote on 8 November 2016.

The tax took effect on 1 July 2017, and revenue will be spent on health promotion, general wellness programs and chronic disease prevention that improve health equity, and other health programs especially for residents with low income and those most affected by chronic disease linked to sugary drink consumption. The University of Colorado, Boulder, campus was granted a one-year exemption from the tax as school officials survey what types of drinks students wish to have. The University was not aware it would be involved in the soda tax, and would have to pay an estimated additional $1 million a year to purchase sugary drinks. =Cook County, Illinois= A one-cent-per-ounce soda tax passed on 10 November 2016, by a 9‚Äì8 vote, with Cook County Board of Commissioners President Toni Preckwinkle breaking the 8‚Äì8 tie. Cook County includes Chicago and has a population of nearly 5.2 million. This was the most populous jurisdiction with a soda tax in the U.S.Hal Dardick, Cook County soda pop tax approved with Preckwinkle breaking tie vote, Chicago Tribune (10 November 2016). The campaign to introduce the tax was heavily funded by Mike Bloomberg. On 30 June 2017, a Cook County judge granted a temporary restraining order filed by the Illinois Retail Merchants Association and several Cook County- based grocers that prohibited the tax from being put into effect until at least 12 July. The tax eventually went into effect on 2 August. Due to a conflict with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, this soda tax did not apply to any soda purchases made with food stamps, which were used by over 870,000 people.Cook County: Soda tax no longer runs afoul of food stamp rules Chicago Tribune, 17 August 2017. Controversially, the tax affected diet drinks but not sugar-packed fruit juices. On 10 October 2017, the Board of Commissioners voted to repeal the tax in a 15‚Äì1 vote. The tax stayed in effect up until 1 December. The tax was highly unpopular and seen mainly as an attempt to plug the county's $1.8 billion budget deficit, rather than a public health measure. Navajo Nation In addition to the general sales tax (6 percent as of July 1, 2018) the Navajo Nation levies a special Junk Food Tax on applicable junk food items. The Junk Food Tax rate is 2 percent and applies to sales of sweetened beverages =Portland, Oregon= The Coalition for Healthy Kids and Education is currently campaigning to get a soda tax on the May 2018 ballot. Their aim is to implement a 1.15 cents per ounce tax on sugary drinks. There are 18,000 signatures required by 15 December 2017 in order for the tax to be voted on in May. =Seattle, Washington= On 5 June 2017, Seattle's City Council voted 7‚Äì1 to pass a 1.75 cents per ounce tax on sugary drinks, including soda and some fruit drinks; the tax does not include diet soda drinks and it started on 1 January 2018.Seattle City Council says yes to soda tax Retrieved 5 June 2017 After the tax was implemented, people were surprised that the tax made a case (24 cans) of Coke become $7.35 more expensive when compared to a case of Diet Coke or Coke Zero.

Both proponents and opponents of the initiative made reference to Seattle's sugary drink tax.Washington Initiative 1634, Prohibit Local Taxes on Groceries Measure (2018) at Ballotpedia =Various island nations and territories= Island nations and territories have been successful in passing soda taxes. Just like with tobacco taxes, smaller communities are often the first to pass a new type of tax. Barbados Barbados passed a soda tax in September 2015, applied as an excise of 10%. Fiji Fiji has an import tax and an excise tax on soda. French Polynesia French Polynesia implemented taxes on soft drinks in 2002. Mauritius Mauritius passed a soda tax in 2013. Nauru Nauru implemented a soda tax in 2007. Samoa Samoa passed a soda tax in 1984.  St Helena  In March 2014, the government of the island of St Helena, a British Overseas Territory in the South Atlantic, announced that it would be introducing an additional import duty of 75 pence per litre on sugar-sweetened carbonated drinks with more than 15 grams of sugar per litre. The measure was introduced in May 2014 as part of a number of measures to tackle obesity on the island and the resulting high incidence of type 2 diabetes. Tonga Tonga has a soda tax.  Scientific studies  Coca-Cola has been under fire since 2015 when emails revealed that funding for scientific studies sought to influence research to be more favorable to soda. Research funded by soda companies are 34 times more likely to find soda has no significant health impacts on obesity or diabetes. Taxing soda can lead to a reduction in overall consumption, according to a scientific study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine in March 2010. The study found that a 10 percent tax on soda led to a 7 percent reduction in calories from soft drinks. These researchers believe that an 18 percent tax on these foods could cut daily intake by 56 calories per person, resulting in a weight loss of 5 pounds (2 kg) per person per year. The study followed 5,115 young adults ages 18 to 30 from 1985 to 2006.Reuters, Tax Soda, Pizza To Cut Obesity Researchers say, 8 March 2010 A 2010 study published in the medical journal Health Affairs found that if taxes were about 18 cents on the dollar, they would make a significant difference in consumption.Health Affairs, Soda Taxes, Soft Drink Consumption, And Children's Body Mass Index 1 April 2010Associated Press Study: Small Soda Taxes Don‚Äôt Dent Obesity 1 April 2010, Research from Duke University and the National University of Singapore released in December 2010 tested larger taxes and determined that a 20 percent and 40 percent taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages would largely not affect calorie intake because people switch to untaxed, but equally caloric, beverages. Kelly Brownell, a proponent of soda taxes, reacted by stating that \\"[t]he fact is that nobody has been able to see how people will really respond under these conditions.\\"Park, Alice (13 December 2010) \\"Study: Soda Taxes May Not Be Enough to Curb Obesity\\" TIME. Similarly, a 2010 study concluded that while people would drink less soda as a result of a soda tax, they would also compensate for this reduction by switching to other high-calorie beverages. In response to these arguments, the American Public Health Association released a statement in 2012 in which they argued that \\"Even if individuals switch to 100% juice or chocolate milk, this would be an improvement, as those beverages contribute some nutrients to the diet.\\" A 2011 study in the journal Preventive Medicine concluded that \\"a modest tax on sugar-sweetened beverages could both raise significant revenues and improve public health by reducing obesity\\". It has been used by the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale to estimate revenue from a soda tax, depending on the state, year and tax rate.Revenue Calculator for Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Taxes A 2012 study by Y. Claire Wang, also in the journal Health Affairs, estimates that a penny per ounce tax on sugared beverages could prevent 2.4 million cases of diabetes per year, 8,000 strokes, and 26,000 premature deaths over 10 years.Allison Aubrey, \\"Could a Soda Tax Prevent 2,600 Deaths Per Year?\\" NPR.org, 12 January 2012 In 2012, just before the city of Richmond began voting on a soda tax, a study was presented at a conference held by the American Public Health Association regarding the potential effects of such a tax in California. The study concluded that, given that soda's price elasticity is such that taxing it would reduce consumption by 10‚Äì20 percent, that this reduction \\"...is projected to reduce diabetes incidence by 2.9‚Äì5.6% and CHD by 0.6‚Äì1.2%.\\"Health benefits, particularly in high risk populations, projected from an excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages intake in California A 2013 study in the American Journal of Agricultural Economics concluded that a 0.5-cent-per-ounce tax on soft drinks would reduce consumption, but \\"increase sodium and fat intakes as a result of product substitution,\\" in line with the Duke University study mentioned above. A 2014 study published in the American Journal of Public Health concluded that Sugar-Sweetened Beverages (SSBs) don't have a negative impact on employment. Even though job losses in the taxed industry occurred, they were offset by new employment in other sectors of the economy.Lisa M. Powell, Roy Wada, Joseph J. Persky, Frank J. Chaloupka, \\"Employment Impact of Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Taxes\\", American Journal of Public Health 104, no. 4 (1 April 2014): pp. 672-677. A 2016 modelling study estimated that a 20% tax on SSBs would decrease the consumption of SSBs in Australia by 12.6%. The tax could decline the prevalence of obesity in the Australian population, which could lead to gains in health-adjusted life years. The results showed an increase of 7.6 days in full health for a 20-24-year-old male and a 3.7 day increase in longevity for their female peers. Between 2016 and 2020, economists from the University of Iowa, Cornell University, and Mathematica, a policy research firm, conducted a multiyear study of local sweetened-beverage taxes in Philadelphia, Oakland, Seattle, and San Francisco. The study examined the taxes‚Äô one-year impacts on purchases, consumption, tax pass-through rates, pricing, and product availability. It was the first to look at the impacts on Oakland's sugar-sweetened beverage tax and the first to look at impacts of the taxes on children's consumption in either Philadelphia or Oakland. The study found that almost a year after Philadelphia and Oakland implemented taxes on sweetened beverages, purchases of sweetened beverages declined, but evidence also suggests that some city residents shopped more outside of the cities. Consumption did not decline significantly overall in Philadelphia or Oakland, but there is more evidence of reduced consumption in Philadelphia, particularly among certain groups. Findings from the project have been published in peer-reviewed journals, such as the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, Economics and Human Biology,John Cawley, David Frisvold, Anna Hill, David Jones, Oakland‚Äôs sugar-sweetened beverage tax: Impacts on prices, purchases and consumption by adults and children, Economics & Human Biology, Volume 37, 2020, 100865, ISSN 1570-677X, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ehb.2020.100865 the Journal of Health Economics,John Cawley, David Frisvold, Anna Hill, David Jones, The impact of the Philadelphia beverage tax on purchases and consumption by adults and children, Journal of Health Economics, Volume 67, 2019, 102225, ISSN 0167-6296, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2019.102225. as well as in working papers hosted by the National Bureau of Economic ResearchThe Impact of Sugar- Sweetened Beverage Taxes on Purchases: Evidence from Four City-Level Taxes in the U.S. John Cawley, David Frisvold, and David Jones, NBER Working Paper No. 26393, October 2019, JEL No. H23,H71,I12,I18 and in Mathematica issue briefs.  Proposals  There have been a number of proposed taxes on sugary beverages, including: * In 1914, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson proposed a special revenue tax on soft drinks, beer and patent medicine after the outbreak of World War I caused a decline in imports and a corresponding decline in credit created by import tariffs.\\"Wilson Proposes Soft Drink Tax,\\" Hawaiian Gazette. 1 September 1914. Page 1. Retrieved 1 September 2014. This proposed taxation measure was not however linked to the anticipated health outcomes of reduced sugar sweetened beverage consumption. * In 1994, one of the first instances where the idea of a targeted tax on sugar sweetened drinks with a link to anticipated beneficial health outcomes, was proposed by Kelly D. Brownell, Director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale. * In a 2009 \\"Perspective\\" piece in the New England Journal of Medicine, Kelly D. Brownell, Director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale, and Thomas R. Frieden, Director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, argue for taxing sugary beverages. The authors propose that sugary beverages may be the single largest cause of the obesity epidemic. They state that an excise tax of one cent per ounce would reduce consumption by more than 10%. * Maryland and Virginia are two of 33 states that levy sales taxes on soda. Maryland taxes soda at a rate of 6%, while Virginia's rate is 1.5%. Virginia is also one of six states that impose a state excise tax on soda in addition to a sales tax. * In 2009, the Obama Administration explored levying an excise tax on sweetened beverages as part of health care reform efforts, but the proposal was abandoned after heavy lobbying by the beverage industry.Tom Hamburger and Kim Geiger, \\"Beverage Industry Douses Tax on Soft Drinks.\\" Los Angeles Times, 7 February 2010. * In 2010, New York State considered a soda tax, however opposition from the soda industry and economists made a strong antitax campaign, spending at least double of the tax supporters and the plan failed. * In 2012, the City Council of Richmond, California placed the soda tax on the November 2012 ballot along with an advisory measure asking voters how they would like to spend the tax revenue. This proposal was rejected by the voters with 67% voting no and 33% voting yes. * In the California State Legislature, soda tax proposals have been introduced several times, but have not passed.Jeremy B. White, California soda tax bill pulled without a vote, Sacramento Bee (12 April 2016). In 2013, California state senator Bill Monning proposed a soda tax, but the bill died in committee.

Lawmakers want to tax sugary drinks, Los Angeles Times (8 March 2016). In 2016, Assemblymen Richard Bloom and Jim Wood introduced a bill to create a \\"health impact fee\\" of 2-cent-per-ounce on sugary drinks, with the revenue collected from the tax to go toward programs for making drinking water safe, promoting oral health, and preventing obesity and diabetes. However, the proposal again faced strong opposition from industry groups, and the bill's proponents withdrew the proposal without a vote after it became clear that it lacked the votes to pass. * In June 2013, the city of Telluride, Colorado proposed a penny-per-ounce soda tax; however, it was rejected in November, with 68% of voters voting against it. * In July 2014, U.S. Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, proposed a national soda tax bill in the House of Representatives. * In November 2014, voters in San Francisco and Berkeley, California voted on soda tax ballot measures. The measure was approved in Berkeley and received 55% of the vote in San Francisco, which was short of the needed 2/3 supermajority. * In November 2016, Santa Fe began considering a tax on all sugar-sweetened beverages, including soda, sports drinks, and iced tea, to fund early childhood education.Mayor wants soda tax to support early childhood education Albuquerque Journal However, voters rejected the proposal in a May 2017 special election. = Public support = A 2016 poll by Morning Consult-Vox finds Americans split on their support of a soda tax. Attitudes seem to have shifted a lot since 2013 when a poll concluded that \\"respondents were opposed to government taxes on sugary drinks and candy by a more than 2-to-1 margin.\\" In California, however, support for a tax has been high for a few years. According to a Field Poll conducted in 2012, \\"Nearly 3 out of 5 California voters would support a special fee on soft drinks to fight childhood obesity.\\" Support for a soda tax in New York was higher when pollsters say the money will go towards health care. A Quinnipiac University poll released in April 2010 found that New Yorkers opposed a state tax on soda of one penny per ounce by a 35-point margin, but opposition dropped to a margin of one point when respondents were told the money would go towards health care.Drake, Bruce. \\"Tax Sugary Drinks? New Yorkers Say 'No' but Leave Some Wiggle Room\\" Politics Daily. 14 April 2010. A Thompson Reuters poll released in the same month found that 51 percent of Americans opposed a soda tax, while 33 percent supported one. = Lobbying = Fighting the creation of soft drink taxes, the American Beverage Association, the largest U.S. trade organization for soft drink bottlers, has spent considerable money lobbying Congress. The Association's annual lobbying spending rose from about $391,000 to more than $690,000 from 2003 to 2008, and in the 2010 election cycle, its lobbying grew to $8.67 million. These funds helped to pay for 25 lobbyists at seven different lobbying firms. An industry group called \\"Americans Against Food Taxes,\\" backed by juice maker Welch's, soft drink maker PepsiCo Inc, the American Beverage Association, the Corn Refiners Association, McDonald's Corporation and Burger King Holdings Inc used national advertising and conducted lobbying to oppose these taxes.Tax Soft Drinks To Fight Obesity, US experts say Reuters, 16 September 2009.

France introduced a targeted sugar tax on soft drinks in 2012. At a national level, similar measures have also been announced in Mexico in 2013 and in the United Kingdom in 2016. In November 2014, Berkeley, California was the first city in the U.S. to pass a targeted tax on sugary drinks.

The village lies in the vicinity of the old road to Landsberg. On the south, it borders of the borough of Gohlis, in the west on Lindenthal and in the east, on Wiederitzsch.  History  thumb Breitenfeld was first mentioned in documents in 1271, as part of the estate of the Margrafs of Landsberg. When the elder Dietrich of Landsberg died, his illegitimate son, Dietrich II, inherited the property. The property of Breitenfeld, which included Wiederitzsch and Lindenthal, came under the legal jurisdiction of the Bishopric of Merseburg. After the Reformation, Breitenfeld came into the possession of different Saxon noble families. These occupants were counted among the Saxon noble houses, and usually had their seat at Landsberg.

In 1642, in a second Battle of Breitenfeld (1642), the troops of Sweden and Saxony again defeated the imperial troops. The Culture House (1951) At the Battle of Nations in 1813, the Prussian general Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher established his command post in the Breitenfeld mill, from which he coordinated the attacks on Napoleon's French troops positioned in M√∂ckern and Gohlis. In 1856, the patrimonial authority was relinquished and Breitenfeld acquired local autonomy within the duchy of Saxony, as a community with its own village council. In 1923, the village formed part of the conjoined community of Lindenthal, and in 1999, joined with the city of Leipzig.

The site lies along Turkey Creek on Arizona State Route 83, between Sonoita and Parker Canyon Lake, which is about to the south-southeast in Cochise County. Today, several historic buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places remain standing in Canelo, including a one-room schoolhouse and a United States Forest Service ranger station. Name \\"Canelo\\" is an alternative spelling of the Spanish word \\"canela\\", which means \\"cinnamon\\" in English. The town of Canelo gets its name from the Canelo Hills, which have a light brownish or cinnamon colored appearance when viewed from the south. It was originally spelled \\"Canille\\", but was later changed to \\"Canela\\" and finally to \\"Canelo\\" over the following years. History The Canelo area was first settled in the late 19th century by Captain Joe Parks, who arrived in 1882 to homestead along Turkey Creek. A post office wasn't opened until after the turn of the century in 1904. The local Forest Ranger and area resident, Robert A. Rodgers, was the first postmaster and the man responsible for naming the little town, which boasted a general store, a post office, a schoolhouse and a few homes in its heyday in the 1920s and 1930s. Robert's wife Annie took over the post office in 1906 and was in turn succeeded by another pioneer named Addie Parker in 1910. All three are buried in Black Oak Cemetery, northwest of the townsite. The Canelo School was built in 1912 and remained open until 1948. Today the building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was the home to Canelo Cowboy Church from April 16, 2006 until May 16, 2016. The building has also been used as a community center, country store and funeral home for burials in Black Oak Cemetery, which opened in 1917 on land allotted by the Forest Service. The cemetery is open to burial free-of-charge to all local pioneers, which is anyone who lived in the Canelo area before December 1952. It is also free for those who already have family buried in the cemetery. Canelo Ranger Station was established in 1932 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Five historic buildings are located on the site, including the ranger station office, residence, garage, pumphouse and barn, all of which were built of adobe brick by members of the Forest Service and the Civilian Conservation Corps in the early 1930s. The ranger station, northwest of the schoolhouse on Membrillo Lane, is still in use by the Forest Service and is no longer open to visitors.

It was operated by the Science Research Council, which became the Science and Engineering Research Council in 1981. Ariel 6 was used for astronomical research and provided data until February 1982. It was the last Ariel satellite to be launched. Satellite design =Operations= The spacecraft was manufactured by the Marconi Company, and had a mass of . =Sensors= The primary experiment, the cosmic ray detector, could sense heavy cosmic rays with an atomic number over 30. The diameter acrylic-lined aluminum sphere was filled with a gaseous oxygen, nitrogen, and helium mixture. Heavy cosmic rays penetrated the sphere and excited the gas to produce scintillation light; the acrylic produced Cerenkov radiation. These ultraviolet emissions were detected with 16 photo- multipliers. Data processing to separate the two different types of ultraviolet emissions was performed by comparing the brightness and duration of the emissions. The amplitude of the signal was used to determine the atomic number of the cosmic ray. Unlike the X-ray experiments, this experiment had no pointing requirements other than what was required for thermal control. The two other experiments were X-ray telescopes. One detected low-energy X-rays and the other high-energy X-rays. Mission =Launch= A Scout D-1 carrier rocket (SN S198C) was used to launch Ariel 6 from Launch Area 3A at the Wallops Flight Center. The launch was successfully conducted at 23:26:00 UTC on 2 June 1979. Once the satellite achieved orbit it was renamed from UK-6 to Ariel 6. =Operations= Ariel 6 operated in a low Earth orbit, at an inclination of 55.0¬∞ and with an orbital period of 97.22 minutes as of 15 July 1979. The satellite provided data until February 1982. It decayed from orbit and reentered the atmosphere on 23 September 1990. Results Interference from radar signals prevented the satellite from pointing correctly, and affected the data that it returned.

A west tower was planned but never built. The church closed in 1988, and it has been converted into residential flats.

He previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Washington Nationals, Toronto Blue Jays, Seattle Mariners, and Cincinnati Reds. The Nats selected Storen with the 10th overall selection in the 2009 MLB draft; he made his MLB debut for Washington in 2010. Amateur career =High school= Storen attended Brownsburg High School in Brownsburg, Indiana, where he was teammate of fellow future major league pitcher Lance Lynn. Playing for the school's baseball team, Storen had 30 wins, 319 strikeouts, and a 1.55 earned run average (ERA) over his high school career including a 9‚Äì0 win-loss record as a sophomore in 2005, en route to a Brownsburg State Championship. He was named first-team all-state in 2006 and 2007, as well as all-state honorable mention in 2005 by the Associated Press, the 2007 Hendricks County Flyer Athlete of the Year, three-time first- team All-Hoosier Crossroads Conference selection (2005‚Äì2007), first-team All- Metro West three times by The Indianapolis Star (2005‚Äì2007), their Super team in 2006 and 2007 and was their Metro-West High School Player of the Year in 2007. He participated in the 2007 Indiana North-South All-Star Game, and was a state nominee for the 2006 Wendy's High School Heisman Award. He was ranked 49th among the 2007 Top 100 High School prospects by Baseball America. Storen was drafted by the New York Yankees in the 34th round of the 2007 Major League Baseball draft but did not sign. =College career= Storen enrolled at Stanford University to play college baseball for the Stanford Cardinals. In 2008, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Over two seasons at Stanford, Storen went 12‚Äì4 with a 3.64 ERA and 15 saves. In 99 innings, he allowed 43 runs (40 earned), on 87 hits, with 23 walks, and 116 strikeouts. In both seasons he made the First All-Pac-10 Conference team. Professional career =Minor leagues= The Nationals selected Storen with the tenth overall pick of the 2009 MLB draft, which they received as compensation for failure to sign 2008 MLB draft first- round pick Aaron Crow. Storen, expressing a desire to make it to the majors as quickly as possible, signed with the Nationals the next day. Upon signing, he was assigned to the Class-A Hagerstown Suns of the South Atlantic League. Storen made an early and strong impact during his time with the Suns, and on July 19 he was called up to the Advanced-A Potomac Nationals of the Carolina League. Storen made his first pitching appearance with Potomac on July 21, earning a six out save, striking out three batters and allowing only one hit. Overall, Storen posted a 1.80 ERA in seven games with Potomac to earn a promotion to the Double-A Harrisburg Senators of the Eastern League. In 12 innings with Harrisburg, he did not allow an earned run. Storen started the 2010 season at Double-A and by the end of April was promoted to the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs after seven appearances in which he pitched 9 innings, allowing only one run, striking out 11 and walking one, earning four saves. He lasted at Syracuse just three weeks, in which he made six appearances allowing just one earned run before getting promoted to the Nationals on May 16. =Washington Nationals= 2010‚Äì2011 Storen as a rookie at 2010 spring training Storen made his major league debut on May 17, 2010, against the St. Louis Cardinals, retiring two batters in ‚Öî of an inning. Storen recorded his first major league save on August 6, 2010, against the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 2010, he pitched 55 innings over 54 games, finishing with a 4‚Äì4 record and a 3.58 ERA with five saves. In 2011, Storen became the team's closer. He pitched 75 innings over 73 games, finishing the year with a 6‚Äì3 record, with 43 saves, and a 2.75 ERA. He tied for fourth in the MLB in saves. 2012 Before the 2012 season, Storen had surgery to remove a bone chip from his elbow, and missed the first 89 games of the season. He made his season debut on July 19, 2012. Tyler Clippard remained the Nationals' closer after Storen's return, though they shared the role later in the season. In the 2012 regular season, Storen posted a 3‚Äì1 win‚Äìloss with a 2.37 ERA, 4 saves, and 24 strikeouts over innings. Storen took on the closer role for the 2012 National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, in the Nationals' first playoff appearance since the team moved to Washington. He got the save in Game 1 and the win in Game 4. In Game 5, Storen took the mound with a 7‚Äì5 lead, needing three outs to send the Nationals to the National League Championship Series. After giving up a leadoff double, he retired the next two batters. He was one strike away from the third out against both Yadier Molina and David Freese, but walked both to load the bases. Storen then gave up a two-run single to Daniel Descalso to tie the game. Manager Davey Johnson elected to have Storen pitch to Pete Kozma with the pitcher on deck; Storen allowed a two-run single to Kozma to give the Cardinals a 9‚Äì7 lead. The Nationals lost the game 9‚Äì7 and were eliminated. Storen's blown save, in which he had the Cardinals down to their final strike on five occasions, was described by teammates as \\"devastating\\" and he was said to be in \\"excruciating\\" mental pain after the loss; several teammates voiced support for him. 2013‚Äì2014 Before the 2013 season, the Nationals signed Rafael Soriano to be their closer, a move that Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo said had nothing to do with Storen's blown save in Game 5. Storen took on the roles of a middle relief and setup man. He was optioned to Triple-A Syracuse in late July following several rough outings. Storen returned to the Nationals in July and finished the season strong, with scoreless outings in 18 of his final 21 appearances. In 2013, he posted a 4‚Äì2 record, 4.52 ERA, and 58 strikeouts in 61 innings pitched. Storen bounced back in 2014, recording a career-best 1.12 ERA in 56 innings pitched. After giving up 31 earned runs in 68 appearances during the previous season, he surrendered just seven in 65 outings during the 2014 campaign. In Game 2 of the 2014 NLDS against the Giants, Storen was brought in by manager Matt Williams in relief of starter Jordan Zimmermann, who had allowed three hits and no runs in the game and had retired the last 20 hitters he faced before walking second baseman Joe Panik to with two outs the ninth. Storen allowed two hits, a single to Buster Posey and an RBI double by Pablo Sandoval. Storen was credited with a blown save. The game went to extra innings; San Francisco's Brandon Belt hit a go-ahead home run in the eighteenth inning and the Giants won, 2-1. The Giants later won the series, three games to one. 2015 Storen pitching Storen relinquished his closer role when Jonathan Papelbon was acquired by the Nationals from Philadelphia just before the trade deadline. He struggled as the Nationals' setup man, ending with two disastrous outings against the New York Mets in early September. After giving up the go- ahead runs on a homer by Yoenis C√©spedes, Storen slammed a locker in frustration, breaking his thumb and ending his season. He went 2‚Äì2 with a 3.44 ERA for the year but was 0‚Äì2 with a 9.22 ERA after the Papelbon trade. =Toronto Blue Jays= On January 8, 2016, Storen was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for outfielder Ben Revere and a player to be named later. He avoided salary arbitration with Toronto on January 15 when he agreed to a one-year, $8.375 million contract. After posting a 6.21 ERA in 33 innings pitched, Storen was designated for assignment on July 24. =Seattle Mariners= On July 26, 2016, Storen was traded to the Seattle Mariners for Joaqu√≠n Benoit. The Mariners were Storen's childhood favorite team, as he idolized Ken Griffey, Jr. Storen appeared in 19 games for the Mariners, pitching 18 innings and attaining a 3-0 record with a 3.44 ERA. =Cincinnati Reds= On January 3, 2017, Storen signed a one-year, $3 million contract with the Cincinnati Reds. The contract included an additional $1.5 million in incentives, and a $500,000 assignment bonus if Storen was traded. On April 18, 2017, Storen closed out the 9th inning of a Reds 9-3 victory by striking out the side on 9 pitches. When he returned to Washington to face the Nationals he struck out one batter to end the seventh inning. On September 17, it was announced that Storen would undergo Tommy John surgery on his right elbow, ending his 2017 season and causing him to miss the 2018 season. =Kansas City Royals= On February 15, 2019, Storen signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals. He was released on June 19, 2019. =Philadelphia Phillies= On January 21, 2020, Storen signed a minor league deal with the Philadelphia Phillies. Storen was released by the Phillies organization on June 28, 2020. Pitching style Storen throws three pitches in roughly equal proportion: a hard four-seam fastball and two-seam fastball that each range from 94 to 98 MPH, and a sharp slider from 82 to 86. Right-handed hitters see the slider more often, and left-handed hitters see the two-seamer more often. Storen often relies on the slider with two strikes. On rare occasions, he has used a changeup against lefties. Personal life Drew Storen is the son of sportscaster Mark Patrick and Pam Storen, and has a sister named Lindsay. He is also related to sports executive Mike Storen and his daughter, sportscaster Hannah Storm.

Fran√ßois Mulard. A Franco-Persian alliance or Franco-Iranian alliance was formed for a short period between the French Empire of Napoleon I and Fath Ali Shah against Russia and Great Britain between 1807 and 1809. The alliance was part of a plan to gather extra aid against Russia and by Persia's help, having another front on Russia's southern borders, namely the Caucasus region. The alliance unravelled when France finally allied with Russia and turned its focus to European campaigns. Background Due to the traditional friendly relations of France with the Ottoman Empire formalized by a long-standing Franco-Ottoman alliance, the relations of France with Iran had long been minimal. Instead, a Habsburg-Persian alliance had developed during the 16th century, and when Persian embassies visited Europe with the Persian embassy to Europe (1599‚Äì1602) and the Qagarie embassy to Europe (1609‚Äì1615), they pointedly avoided France. =First rapprochement= In 1796, Guillaume Antoine Olivier (depicted) and Jean-Guillaume Brugui√®res visited Iran in an attempt to establish an alliance, but in vain. Later however, France developed relations with Iran and signed treaties in 1708 and 1715 with the visit of an Iranian embassy to Louis XIV, but these relations ceased in 1722 with the fall of the Safavid dynasty and the invasion of Iran by the Afghans.Amini, p.xvii, p. 6-7 Attempts to resume contact were made following the French revolution, as France was in conflict with Russia and wished to find an ally against that country. In 1796, two scientists, Jean-Guillaume Brugui√®res and Guillaume- Antoine Olivier, were sent to Iran by the Directoire, but were unsuccessful in obtaining an agreement.Amini, p.6 Soon however, with the advent of Napoleon I, France adopted a strongly expansionist policy in the Mediterranean and the Near East. Following the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, France acquired possessions in the Mediterranean such as the Ionian islands as well as former Venetian bases on the coast of Albania and Greece, geographically close to the Middle-East. The French General Horace Sebastiani negotiated a Franco-Ottoman alliance with Selim III. Napoleon Bonaparte launched the French Invasion of Egypt in 1798 and fought against the Ottoman and British Empires to establish a French presence in the Middle East, with the ultimate dream of linking with a Muslim enemy of the British in India, Tipu Sultan.Tricolor and crescent William E. Watson p.13-14 Napoleon assured the Directoire that \\"as soon as he had conquered Egypt, he will establish relations with the Indian princes and, together with them, attack the English in their possessions.\\"Napoleon and Iran\\" by Iradj Amini, p.12 According to a 13 February 1798 report by Talleyrand: \\"Having occupied and fortified Egypt, we shall send a force of 15,000 men from Suez to India, to join the forces of Tipu-Sahib and drive away the English.\\" Napoleon was initially defeated by the Ottoman Empire and Britain at the Siege of Acre in 1799, and at the Battle of Abukir in 1801; by 1802, the French were completely vanquished in the Middle East.Karsh, p.11 In order to reinforce the Western border of British India, the diplomat John Malcolm was sent to Iran to sign the Anglo-Persian Treaty of 1801. The Treaty offered English support against Russia and trade advantages, and explicitly provided against French intervention in Iran: Soon however, from 1803, Napoleon went to great lengths to try to convince the Ottoman Empire to fight against Russia in the Balkans and join his anti-Russian coalition.Karsh, p.11 Napoleon sent General Horace Sebastiani as envoy extraordinary, promising to help the Ottoman Empire recover lost territories. In February 1806, following Napoleon's remarkable victory in the December 1805 Battle of Austerlitz and the ensuing dismemberment of the Habsburg Empire, Selim III finally recognized Napoleon as Emperor, formally opting for an alliance with France \\"our sincere and natural ally\\", and war with Russia and Britain.Karsh, p.12 Iranian alliance =Napoleon's motivation= In his grand scheme to reach India (the \\"India Expedition\\"), the next step for Napoleon was now to develop an alliance with the Persian Empire. Early 1805, Napol√©on sent one of his officers Am√©d√©e Jaubert on a mission to Persia. He would return to France in October 1806.Napoleon and Persia Iradj Amini p.55 =Iranian motivation= Letter of Fath-Ali Shah to Napoleon I, thanking him for the letter received through M. Jaubert, and asking for military instructors, December 1806. On the other hand, the Shah of Persia needed help against the Russian menace to his northern frontiers, as Russia had annexed Eastern Georgia in 1801 following the death of George XII of Georgia.The Russian empire, 1801‚Äì1917 by Hugh Seton-Watson p.117 General Tsitsianov occupied Georgia against rival Iranian claims, and attacked Ganja in Iran in 1804, triggering a Russo-Persian War, and soon the Russo-Turkish War was also declared in 1806. Britain, an ally of Russia, had been temporizing without a clear show of support. The Shah decided to respond to Napoleon's offers, sending a letter carried by ambassador Mirza Mohammed Reza-Qazvini (Mirza Riza) to the court of Napoleon, then in Tilsit in eastern Prussia.A History of Persia by Percy Molesworth Sykes p.402 In his instructions to the ambassador, the Shah explained that: The Shah also clearly considered helping France in the invasion of India: The Shah however denied the possibility of providing a port to the French \\"on they way to Hindustan\\".Instructions of the Shah of Persia to Mirza Riza in A History of Persia by Percy Molesworth Sykes p.402 =Alliance and military mission= The Treaty of Finckenstein between Persia and France, ratified 10 May 1807. Following the visit of the Iran Envoy Mirza Mohammed Reza-Qazvini to Napoleon, the Treaty of Finckenstein formalized the alliance on 4 May 1807, in which France supported Persia's claim to Georgia, promising to act so that Russia would surrender the territory. In exchange, Persia was to fight Great Britain, and to allow France to cross the Persian territory to reach India.The Islamic world in decline by Martin Sicker p.97 Gardane, with colleagues Jaubert and Joanin, at the Persian court of Fath Ali Shah in 1808. The red socks were an element of Persian protocol. A military mission was also sent under General Antoine Gardanne in order to help modernize the Persian army, and in order to chart an invasion route to India. Gardanne also had the missions to coordinate Ottoman and Persian efforts against Russia. Gardanne's mission consisted in 70 commissioned and non-commissioned officers, and started to work at modernizing the Persian army along European lines. The mission arrived on 4 December 1807.Persia and Napoleon A Lecture by Ambassador Iradj Amini (Qajar) at the \\"Iran Society,\\" ‚Äì London, December 17, 1997 Captains of infantry Lamy and Verdier trained the Nezame Jadid (New Army), which served under Prince Abbas Mirza.Iradj Amini, p.156 This modernized army successfully defeated a Russia Army attack on the strategic city of Erevan on 29 November 1808, showing the efficiency of French training.Iradj Amini, p.164 Lieutenants of artillery Charles-Nicolas Fabvier and Reboul were sent by Gardanne to Ispahan in order to set up a factory to produce cannons for the Persian artillery, complete with foundries, lathes, machinery and instruments. Against great odds, by December 1808, they had managed to produce 20 pieces of cannon in the European style, which were transported to Tehran.Iradj Amini, p.166-167 The 19th century diplomat Sir Justin Sheil commented positively on the French contribution in modernizing the Persian army: Askar Khan Afshar received by Napoleon I at Saint-Cloud, 4 September 1808, by Benjamin Zix. Iran ambassador Askar Khan Afshar, in Paris from July 1808 to April 1810, by Madame Vavin. The embassy of Gardanne to Persia soon lost one of the main reasons for its original dispatch. In a final reversal, Napoleon I finally vanquished Russia at the Battle of Friedland in July 1807, and France and Russia became allied at the Treaty of Tilsit. General Gardanne arrived in Tehran in Persia after the Treaty of Tilsit, in December 1807. Napoleon however wished to continue fostering the Franco-Persian alliance, in order to pursue his plan of invading India. To this effect, he planned to nominate his brother Lucien Bonaparte as his representative in Tehran.A History of Persia by Percy Molesworth Sykes p.403 Napoleon still planned to invade British India, this time with Russian help.The Russian empire, 1801‚Äì1917 by Hugh Seton-Watson p.118 A Persian ambassador was sent to Paris, named Askar Khan Afshar.Napoleon and Persia Iradj Amini, p.140 He arrived in Paris on 20 July 1808 and was able to meet Napoleon on 4 September 1808. Persia however lost the main motivation for the alliance, the recovery of Georgia and Azerbaijan over Russia, which had not even been addressed at the Treaty of Tilsit. The Franco-Persian alliance thus lost its main motivation as France and Russia were now allied. The Shah of Persia again turned to the British for military advisers. In the east, a mutual defense treaty was signed between British India and Shah Shuja al-Mulk of Afghanistan on 17 June 1809 in order to better resist the Franco-Persian threat, but by that time Persia had already denounced its alliance with France.The Islamic world in decline by Martin Sicker p.97-98 =Return of a British alliance= Persia in 1808 according to a British map, before losses to Russia in the north by the Treaty of Gulistan, and the loss of Herat to Great Britain in 1857 through the Treaty of Paris. After the failed mission of John Malcolm in 1808, who was only allowed to negotiate with the Governor of Fars,Russia and Iran, 1780‚Äì1828 Muriel Atkin p.133 Sir Harford Jones managed to sign in March 1809 a preliminary treaty with Persia and General Gardanne was returned to France.A History of Persia by Percy Molesworth Sykes p.404-405 In another mission in 1810, Malcolm brought a large mission of officers, one of whom, Lindsay Bethune, would become Commander-in-Chief of the Persian army for several years.A History of Persia by Percy Molesworth Sykes p.406 In 1809‚Äì1810, the Shah sent ambassador Haji Mirza Abul Hasan Khan to the Court in London, immortalized as Hajji Baba by diplomat James Morier.A History of Persia by Percy Molesworth Sykes p.407 According to Sir Justin Sheil: Epilogue The alliance between France and the Ottoman Empire was maintained, and a peace settlement was brokered between Russia and the Ottomans, but the territories the Ottomans had been promised (Moldavia and Wallachia) through the Treaty of Tilsit were never returned, although the Ottomans themselves had complied with their part of the agreement by moving their troops south of the Danube.Karsh, p.14 Russo-Persian war. Meanwhile, a Russo-Persian war raged on despite France and Russia's efforts to try to reach a settlement between Russia and Persia.The Islamic world in decline by Martin Sicker p.98 In 1812 Persia had to face a major defeat against Russia at the Battle of Aslandoz, forcing the Shah to negotiate the Treaty of Gulistan, on 12 October 1813, which resulted in huge territorial (and eventually irrevocable) integral territorial losses for Iran in its territories in the Caucasus region, comprising modern-day Georgia, Dagestan, and most of the contemporary Republic of Azerbaijan, per the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813. In 1812, through the Treaty of Bucharest, the Ottoman Empire and Russia also agreed to make peace, just as Russia was anxious to liberate this southern front in anticipation of Napoleon's Invasion of Russia, with Russia keeping Bessarabia and the Ottomans regaining Wallachia and Moldavia.Turkish Foreign Policy, 1774‚Äì2000 by William M. Hale, p.23 After the fall of Napoleon, a French officer named Jean-Fran√ßois Allard visited Abbas Mirza to propose his services. He was promised the position of a Colonel, but never actually received the troops corresponding to his function. In 1820, Allard left for Punjab where he played a great role.John Gorton, A general Biographical Dictionary, p. 16Chambers's encyclopaedia p.152 Ferouk Khan in The Illustrated London News, 1857. After a long period of exchanges between Persia and Great Britain, diplomatic relations with France resumed in 1839 following a dispute between Great Britain and Persia over the Afghanistan city of Herat. Great Britain would remove its military and diplomatic missions from Persia, and occupy Kharg island and attack Bushehr.Iran and the West Sƒ´r≈´s Ghanƒ´, p.302-303 Mohammad Shah Qajar would in turn resume diplomatic relations with France, and send a diplomatic mission to Louis-Philippe under Mirza Hossein Khan to obtain military help. In response, a group of French officers was sent to Persia with the returning ambassador. The Persian embassy to Napoleon III, led by Amin o Dowleh. In 1857, during the Anglo-Persian War (1856‚Äì1857), a Persian ambassador named Ferouk Khan was sent to Napoleon III, who expressed his regrets about the conflict. Negotiations led to the March 1857 Treaty of Paris, which put an end to the Anglo-Persian War.Immortal Steven R.

His work circulated mostly within the boundaries of Zagreb, where he resided. Later in life, he got heavily influenced by modernism. Today, he is regarded as one of the highlights of early modern architecture in Croatia. Biography Bastl was born on 13 August 1872 to an ethnic Czech family originating from a Bohemian town P≈ô√≠bram. He eventually moved to Zagreb where he established a status as an architect working for the H√∂nigsberg & Deutsch atelier. His motives for emigrating to Croatia remain unknown (Croatian lands and Czech lands were part of one empire at the time). Upon arrival, he enrolled in the Royal crafts school, graduating in 1896.

Parker, first published in 1982. It is the first of three Spenser novels involving the character April Kyle, who returns in Taming a Sea-Horse and Hundred-Dollar Baby. Plot Spenser is hired to find a runaway 16-year-old girl. It soon becomes obvious that she has turned to prostitution. Storyline summary The book opens with Spenser and Susan Silverman talking with the Kyles about their missing daughter, April. Mr. Kyle apparently saw her in the act of seducing a John, a man about his age. He's livid at the thought of his daughter working as a prostitute and voices his opinion loudly. Spenser is clearly not interested in working for Mr. Kyle at any price, but the pleadings of Susan Silverman and Mrs. Kyle persuade Spenser to take the job (which he does for the nominal fee of one dollar). Spenser talks to a Smithfield, Mass. cop ( friend of Susan's named Cataldo) and gets a lead that some of April's old crowd might know something. Spenser literally strongarms a kid named Carl Hummel to find out where they think she might be: with a friend in Boston, Amy Gurwitz, who left town a few months before April did. Spenser goes to see Amy. She is living in a three-story home with a middle-aged man named Mitchell Poitras and tries to look the part of a sophisticated well-to-do woman even though she is no more than sixteen. He gets no information from her, but is convinced she knows something about April. (It turns out that Mitchell Poitras is a high-ranking figure in the Massachusetts school system and deals with a lot of troubled youths. He is using his position to funnel troubled girls into prostitution). Next Spenser heads to a part of Boston called the Combat Zone (Boston's red- light district). He asks a hooker about April and shows a photo he has of her. Her pimp, a strong-looking man who goes by the name \\"Trumps,\\" tries to stop Spenser. Spenser takes Trumps's sap away from him and roughs him up with it. Once Trumps steps away, he learns April has been working for a pimp named \\"Red.\\" The hooker warns Spenser to watch his back after roughing up Trumps because he hold grudges and that she will be beaten for what happened. Spenser offers to take her away and she laughs at him. Spenser enlists the help of Hawk and heads back to the Combat Zone to find Red. They find him in a strip bar, but Trumps and two thugs confront Spenser before he can question Red. Hawk arrives and takes out the two thugs by slamming their heads together. Once he informs Trumps that he has Spenser's back, Trumps backs off and leaves. Red refuses to answer questions, but after Hawk chops him across the throat, Red discloses April's last known address. Spenser and Hawk proceed to the address and find it in a filthy building with a hooker as a neighbor. April's room is dirty and small and empty except for a photo on the wall of her parents' home. Spenser decides to watch the house that Amy and Mitchell Poitras are living in. After they leave the house, Spenser breaks into their house shortly before Thanksgiving. While there, he finds a set of spare keys and has them copied at Sears. On the third floor, he finds a kiddie porn photo and movie studio and a huge stash of pornographic photos and films. He leaves the house leaving behind no evidence of his visit. Hawk finds out that Red works for Tony Marcus, a black crime boss. Under the pretense of hiring Trumps's hooker, the one that warned him earlier, Spenser questions her and finds out that April has been transferred to the \\"Sheep Ranch\\" (a brothel that specializes in kinky acts) in Providence, Rhode Island. Undercover in a garish red outfit, Spenser finds the Sheep Ranch with the help of a local cabby and busts April out of there going through the madam and bouncer to do it. On the road with April, Spenser discovers that she was moved there right after he talked to Amy. He tells April he won't force her to go back to her parents if she doesn't want to. Claiming to need an emergency bathroom break on the side of the road, April gets out of the car and disappears into the woods. Susan had befriended a neighborhood dog, a black Labrador Retriever. Someone broke into her house, shot the dog, and left it in the kitchen. Spenser gets Officer Cataldo to watch over Susan while he takes care of it. Spenser and Hawk visit Tony Marcus's office. Soon, Spenser beats Marcus up and threatens to kill him if anything happens to Susan. He also works a deal where they can take April and bust Mitchell for child porn. Marcus begrudgingly agrees as long as his name is kept out of it. Then he punches Spenser in the jaw at the end of their meeting and Spenser lets him go. Hawk, who occasionally works freelance for Marcus, assures Spenser that Marcus's word is good. With Susan and Hawk, Spenser visits Mitchell's house on a Friday night. After they peek into the windows, it is apparent there is a big party with numerous guests. They let themselves in the locked front door using Spenser's duplicate spare keys. They are confronted by a big bodyguard, but Hawk knocks him out and dumps him behind the shrubs by the front porch. Upon entering the living room, they see that they have happened upon not just any old party, but a full-fledged orgy. Most of the men are middle-aged or older and all the girls are very young, most obviously younger than eighteen. After wandering through the throng of dancing and groping guests, they fail to find Amy, April, or Mitchell. A recon of the second floor finds many couples engaged in sex, but not the party hosts. They find all three on the third floor in the kiddie porn studio. Another man, a porn distributor named Hal, is also there with his bodyguard Vance. Hawk overpowers the bodyguard and holds Amy, Mitchell, and Hal at bay with his gun. Spenser tells Susan to go with April back to the car and to call the cops (Spenser had made arrangements for the Boston Police Department's vice squad to bust a child pornographer). He instructs Amy to follow in order to avoid arrest, but she refuses. As Spenser explains to Mitchell about his impending arrest and his need to keep a certain name (Marcus) out of it, he hears Susan cry for him downstairs. He runs to help, and Hawk follows. Once downstairs, April yelled out that Susan was trying to kidnap her and the partygoers attacked her. April had separated herself from Susan by the time Spenser and Hawk arrive. A brawl breaks out with all the partygoers against Hawk and Spenser. Due to their superior strength, reflexes, and training, they overpower all the attendees who come up against them, but just barely. They suffer a few superficial injuries but inflict much greater on their attackers. Boston Police officers arrive just as the last partier goes down under Spenser's blows. After talking with the police and getting first aid for their wounds, Spenser and Hawk head back to Susan's red Bronco. Susan is there with April who came along willingly after the brawl. She came with the assurance that she wouldn't be forced to go back with her parents. Spenser and Susan drop off Hawk and head back to Spenser's place. They talk with April about her options over dinner. With grave reservations, they decide to take April to interview with Patricia Utley, a madam of an upscale brothel in New York (first encountered in the Spenser book Mortal Stakes). There she can be safer, learn better escort skills, make more money, and not have to turn more than one trick a night. Susan and April spend the night; April on the couch, Susan with Spenser. They talk over their decision, not entirely happy with it, but realize it is probably the best thing for April, considering her miserable home environment and lack of better options.

Different roles of GABA and glycine in the modulation of chemosensory responses in Hydra vulgaris (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa), Coelenterate Biology 2003. Springer Netherlands. DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4020-2762-8_7. is a small animal freshwater hydroid with length from 10mm to 30mm and width about 1 mm.Hydra , Northern State University. Description The hydra have four to twelve tentacles that protrude from just outside the mouth. They feed by extending their tentacles and waiting for food to touch the tentacles. They then bring the food to their mouth, ingest and digest the organism. Anything that cannot be digested is egested. Ingestion and egestion occur through the mouth. Like other hydras, Hydra vulgaris cling to a base object with a \\"foot\\" pad, shaped like a disk. The Hydra moves by releasing its grip on its base and is carried away by the current. H. vulgaris can also move by bending over, grabbing a surface with its tentacles, releasing its grip with its \\"foot\\" and flipping over itself. Model organism H. vulgaris is often used, like many hydra, as a model organism for morphallactic regeneration because they are easy to care for, requiring minimal direct care, and reproduce relatively quickly. It is reported that they do not undergo senescence, making them biologically immortal although this has been disputed. Reproduction A hydra vulgaris with 6 tentacles. This species can reproduce in three ways: sexual reproduction, budding, and indirectly through regeneration.Working with Hydra, Ward's Science 2002. When hydra reproduce sexually, simple testes, ovaries, or both will develop on the bodies of an individual. Sperm released into the environment by the testes enters the egg within the ovary. The egg forms a chitinous exoskeleton and waits for favorable conditions before the organism will emerge. Budding occurs when conditions are favorable; proper water temperature and enough food are the major factors. A miniature adult hydra will grow out of the body of the parent hydra. Once fully developed, it will separate from the parent and continue the life cycle. Hydras use this kind of reproduction more often because it is easier and will create more hydras than other methods. The third method of reproduction is more of a survival mechanism than a reproduction mechanism. When a hydra is cut into segments, each segment, if large enough, will grow into an individual hydra sized relative to the size of the segment. This happens in other animals like the starfish.

History A notice was published in the London Gazette on 23 November 1900 stating the intention of Lowestoft Corporation to construct a tram line going from Lowestoft to the old parish of Pakefield, stopping off at places on the way all in the county of East Suffolk. The system was built to a gauge of and had a maximum extent of . The buttons and cap badges of Lowestoft Corporation Tramways depicted an angel with a halo and wings holding a shield, containing a crown above a rose, based on the borough coat of arms, illustrated in this postcard. In the late 1920s the Corporation decided to replace the trams with motor buses rather than renew the infrastructure. The line was closed in stages, with the section north of the harbour closing in April 1931 and the southern section on 8 May 1931. For several years prior to the closure of the tram system in 1931, the Corporation operated motor buses concurrently with the trams. The first few buses were lettered \\"Lowestoft Corporation Tramways\\", but as the fleet grew the lettering was changed to \\"Lowestoft Corporation Transport\\". Extent of the system Tram shed in Rotterdam Road. The northern terminus was on the A12 midway between the junction with Hollingsworth Road and the junction with Harris Avenue. From there it followed the A12 south to its other terminus at Pakefield where the A12 has a junction with Pakefield Street and Stradbroke Road. That area is still often referred to as the Pakefield terminus or Pakefield Tramways. The terminus itself was in front of what is still known today as The Tramway's Hotel. A branch from this north-south route ran westward from the Suffolk Hotel on station square along Denmark Road to the depot in Rotterdam Road, with the entrance opposite the end of Essex Road. The shed was four lanes with a glass peak to the roof. The lines were still in situ in the depot's shed and yard during the 1960s when the depot was being used for Lowestoft Corporation buses. In 2009 the shed building was still being used, but not as a shelter for public transport vehicles. Located in Norwich Road, adjacent to the depot, was Lowestoft Corporation's electricity generating station. Originally opened in 1901, its output capability was increased in 1903 to cope with the tramway's electrical load. Tramcars The fleet consisted of: * Fifteen open top double deck tramcars. * Four single deck tramcars. * One works car. Preserved tramcar The East Anglia Transport Museum owns an original 1904 open top double deck Lowestoft Corporation tramcar, which had been a static exhibit but as of 2009 is being restored to fully working condition for operation on the museum's track.

It was founded in 1937, making it the second oldest regional ballet company in the United States. Dayton Ballet seasons typically comprises four works‚Äîfamiliar traditional ballets, such as The Nutcracker, as well as new and innovative works‚Äîand over 40 performances. The Dayton Ballet performs in the historic 1,139-seat Victoria Theatre (Dayton, Ohio) and the 2,300-seat Schuster Performing Arts Center. Part of the Dayton Performing Arts Alliance, which also oversees the Dayton Opera and the Dayton Philharmonic, the ballet receives administrative and operational leadership and support from its parent organization. Karen Russo Burke has been the Artistic Director of the Dayton Ballet since 2011. History Dayton Ballet had its beginning when Josephine (Jo) Schwarz and her sister Hermene opened The Schwarz School of Dance in 1927. Jo Schwarz later studied ballet and danced in Chicago, in New York at the School of American Ballet, and in Europe. She danced on Broadway, but was forced to return home to Dayton after being injured while performing there. In May 1938, Jo and Hermene gathered together the school's finest dancers, named the troupe \\"The Experimental Group for Young Dancers,\\" and staged a performance at the Dayton Art Institute. This was the first performance of what is now the Dayton Ballet. Jo was a pioneer of the American regional ballet movement of the mid-20th century. Through years of persistence, she made Dayton a center of dance. In 1958, the company restructured as the Dayton Civic Ballet, with a board of directors, and federal tax-exempt status. In 1959, the Dayton Civic Ballet became a chartered member of the Northeast Regional Ballet Association. The Schwarz sisters organized many regional dance festivals and choreography conferences. In 1978, the company dropped the \\"Civic\\" designation and became the fully professional Dayton Ballet. =1980‚Äì1990= Stuart Sebastian, a student of Josephine and Hermene Schwarz, assumed directorship of the company in 1980 at the invitation of Josephine Schwarz. He had danced professionally for the Dayton Ballet and the National Ballet of Washington before assuming the role. He had also choreographed in New York, Germany and England. Sebastian led the Dayton Ballet for 10 years, in which time the company rose in stature and status. Sebastian brought in new dancers and created the company's first full-length ballet, The Sleeping Beauty. He choreographed over 25 new works. Of those, six were full-length ballets, including Swan Lake and Dracula. Under Sebastian, the Dayton Ballet toured more than 75 cities and took its first international tour to Jerash, Jordan. In 1988, the company appeared on national television while performing in the opening ceremonies of the Pan American Games. =Transition: 1991-1993= Following the departure of Stuart Sebastian in 1990 and his subsequent death in January 1991 after a lengthy battle with AIDS, the company entered a period of transition. James Clouser, former artistic director of the Houston Ballet, was brought in on a three year contract. It was a bumpy and tumultuous time for the company, and a time of considerable change. Clouser was the first outside, non-Daytonian director, the Dayton Ballet had ever seen, and was a considerable break from the company's past directors. Many dancers and staff from the previous era left, and many new dancers and staff were hired. According to Dayton Daily News articles written during the transition, the board of trustees was looking for change and that is why they brought in someone from the outside. In the fall of 1992 an executive director was brought in for the very first time in the company's history: Dermot Burke. =Recent history: 1993‚Äì2012= Dermot Burke was a star principal dancer with the Joffrey Ballet in New York and had been artistic director of the American Repertory Ballet in New Jersey for 10 years. He knew and choreographed for Sebastian and the Dayton Ballet back in 1984. In the Fall of 1993 Dermot assumed the dual role of executive and artistic director of the company. Under Dermot Burke, the company took on a more American flavor in the tradition of the Joffrey Ballet, embracing distinctly American dance literature, dancers and choreographers. There was also a shift to a \\"repertory company with lots of choreographic voices,\\" as Burke stated. This repertory includes and has held onto the work of Sebastian and the company's past, while at the same time including the work of outside choreographers. =2012 merger= Following more than two years of planning, the Dayton Ballet, Dayton Opera, and Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra‚ÄîDayton‚Äôs three classical performing arts organizations‚Äîbecame a new, single entity on July 1, 2012. This new organization was named the Dayton Performing Arts Alliance. It is the largest performing arts organization in the community. Dayton Performing Arts Alliance performances are made possible in part by Montgomery County and Culture Works. The organization also receives partial funding from the Ohio Arts Council. The new organization has one administrative and operational core with one CEO and executive director, with each performing arts unit retaining its own artistic director. Dayton Ballet School The company's dependent dance school, Dayton Ballet School, is the oldest dance school in Dayton and one of the oldest in the US.

The enzyme macrophomate synthase converts 5-acetyl-4-methoxy-6-methyl-2-pyrone to 4-acetyl-3-methoxy-5-methyl-benzoic acid (macrophomic acid) through an unusual intermolecular Diels-Alder reaction (Scheme 1). The pathway to formation of macrophomic acid suggests that the enzyme is a natural Diels-Alderase. Formation of this type of aromatic ring compound normally proceeds via the shikimate and polyketide pathways; however, the production of macrophomic acid by macrophomate synthase proceeds totally differently. Learning about the production of macrophomic acid by a possible natural Diels-Alderase enzyme is important in understanding enzyme catalytic mechanisms. This knowledge can then be applied to organic synthesis. Image:Scheme_1_macrophomic_acid.gif Biosynthesis The biosynthesis of macrophomic acid is catalyzed by the enzyme macrophomate synthase. The unusual multistep conversion of 5-acetyl-4-methoxy-6-methyl-2-pyrone (3) to macrophomic acid is thought to proceed by either a concerted Diels-Alder reaction or a recently proposed 2-step Michael-aldol sequence. The Michael- aldol sequence involves a Michael addition reaction and an aldol condensation. The actual pathway is not yet understood completely. In the conversion of the 2-pyrone (3), oxaloacetate (1) is decarboxylated to form an enolate that coordinates to a Mg2+ metal center (2) found in the active site of the enzyme. Then, the coordinated enolate can either add to the 2-pyrone (3) through a Michael-aldol or Diels-Alder pathway. Both pathways include a bicyclic intermediate (4). In the Michael-aldol pathway (Scheme 2), The coordinated oxaloacetate enolate performs a Michael addition to the ring of the pyrone to form intermediate 4. Next, this intermediate undergoes an aldol condensation to form the proposed bicyclic intermediate (5). Finally, this bicyclic compound undergoes a decarboxylation to form intermediate 6 and dehydration to form macrophomic acid (7). Image:Oxaloacetate_enolate_formation.gif Image:Scheme_2_macrophomic_acid.gif In the Diels-Alder mechanism for the biosynthesis of macrophomic acid (Scheme 3), oxaloacetate is decarboxylated to form the enolate complex with Mg2+. Next, the enolate complex adds to the pyrone through a Diels-Alder concerted reaction to form a bicyclic intermediate (8). Then, just as in the Michael-aldol sequence, the bicyclic intermediate gets decarboxylated and dehydrated to form macrophomic acid (9). This pathway is thought to be the actual mechanism; however, according to QM/MM calculations, it seems that the Michael-aldol sequence is more energetically favored. There has also been difficulty in isolating the key intermediates for either proposed pathway.

The related pharmacokinetic parameter tmax is the time at which the Cmax is observed. After an intravenous administration, Cmax and tmax are closely dependent on the experimental protocol, since the concentrations are always decreasing after the dose. But after oral administration, Cmax and tmax are dependent on the extent, and the rate of drug absorption and the disposition profile of the drug. They could be used to characterize the properties of different formulations in the same subject. Short term drug side effects are most likely to occur at or near the Cmax, whereas the therapeutic effect of drug with sustained duration of action usually occurs at concentrations slightly above the Cmin. The Cmax is often measured in an effort to show bioequivalence (BE) between a generic and innovator drug product.

She is also the director of the Kavli Neural Systems Institute at The Rockefeller University. She is well known for her contributions to the field of olfaction, particularly for the discovery and subsequent characterization of the insect olfactory receptor family, and to the genetic basis of chemosensory behavior in mosquitoes and humans.  Early life  Leslie Vosshall was born in Lausanne, Switzerland where she spent most of her early childhood. Vosshall moved to New Jersey when she was 8 years old. She spent summers from age 17 to 19 in her uncle, Philip Dunham's, summer laboratory with Gerald Weissmann at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole. Vosshall said this experience was \\"an incredible introduction to the practice of science.\\"  Education  Vosshall received her B.A. in Biochemistry from Columbia University in 1987 and her Ph.D. from Rockefeller University in 1993. She then returned to Columbia for a postdoctoral fellowship in the laboratory of future Nobel laureate Richard Axel from 1993-1997. She then worked in the position of Associate Research Scientist in Dr. Axel's laboratory from 1997-2000. Vosshall was offered the position of Assistant Professor at The Rockefeller University in 2000, and was promoted to Associate Professor in 2006. In April 2010, she was granted tenure and is currently the Robin Chemers Neustein Professor and Head of the Laboratory of Neurogenetics and Behavior. She served as Associate Director of the Kavli Neural Systems Institute from 2015-2016 and was promoted to Director in 2016.  Research  The Vosshall Lab uses three model organisms: fruit flies, mosquitoes and humans to understand how the nervous system processes and perceives odors. In addition, the Vosshall Lab studies the genetic basis of mosquitoes' host-seeking and blood-feeding behaviors. Research from Vosshall's lab demonstrated that a chemical transferred from the male of the species during sex plays a key role in shaping the female‚Äôs sexual proclivities. The Vosshall lab discovered that the domestic form of the mosquito Aedes aegypti has increased attraction to humans, due to higher expression of odorant receptor AaegOr4. In addition, work from the Vosshall lab led to the discovery that ORCO, a mosquito co-receptor, is responsible for their attraction to humans and their sensitivity to the insect repellent DEET.

The village came under aerial bombardment on October 15‚Äì16, along with a number of other towns and villages in the area. Later, during the same operation, an attack on the village was planned, but the attack was called off when Israeli forces learned that a large Egyptian Army force was quartered in the village. It probably fell to Israeli forces in early November, shortly after the occupation of Ascalon at the end of Operation Yoav. Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel and two kibbutzim, Zikim and Karmia, were established on village lands in 1949 and 1950 respectively.

Uzbekistan In Uzbekistan, household plots were reclassified as \\"dehkan farms\\" in 1998, at which time the Law of Dehkan Farms was passed.Lerman 2008, 482. Around 60% of all agricultural production in the country comes from dehkan farms,Lerman 2008, 492. which control less than 5% of arable land in the country and average less than 0.2 hectares in size.Lerman 2008, 488, 495. The small dehkan farms grow vegetables and raise livestock. Scale crops, such as wheat and cotton, are usually grown on larger peasant farms (average size more than 40 hectares) and on the few remaining shirkats (former collective farms). All agricultural land in Uzbekistan is owned by the state. While this situation allows the state to demand certain performance and production standards from larger farms, dehkan farms are allowed to grow whatever the farmers wish. Additionally, unlike larger farms where leases must be renewed, leases for dehkan farms are lifetime holdings and can be transferred through inheritance. They cannot, however, be sold or given to someone outside the family as a gift.Lerman 2008, 484-486. Dehkan farms own 93% of all cattle in Uzbekistan.

The Mystical City of God is a book written in the 17th century by the Franciscan nun Venerable Mary of Jesus of √Ågreda. According to Mar√≠a de √Ågreda, the book was to a considerable extent dictated to her by the Blessed Virgin Mary and regarded the life of the Virgin Mary and the divine plan for creation and the salvation of souls. The work alternates between descriptions of the Trinity, the Virgin Mary's life, and the spiritual guidance she provides to the author, by whom her words were reproduced for the spiritual benefit and growth of the reader. The book describes at length the various virtues, and how the reader should live in order to see them reflected in their own life, with the Virgin Mary as their model for sanctity. The work has the Imprimatur of several Popes and Bishops and appeals primarily to those who believe in private revelation and the sanctity of Mary. Non-Catholics generally do not accept the teaching of the Catholic Church and are consequently skeptical of works of this nature. Various misinterpretations of her writings led to the extent that Mystical City of God was temporarily placed on the Church's Index Librorum Prohibitorum in August 1681. By the order of Blessed Innocent XI, however, the decree of condemnation was removed three months later, after it was shown that a faulty French translation was at the basis for the censure. The book was subsequently criticized by Jansenists and Gallicans in the 18th century, while the Church continued to defend its orthodoxy.http://www.traditioninaction.org/History/B_017_Agreda_5.html In 1673, Mar√≠a de √Ågreda was declared venerable soon after her death, but the process of her beatification has yet to be completed. The Cambridge history of Spanish literature By David Thatcher Gies, Cambridge University Press, 2004 page 157 Beatification and canonization do not authenticate revelations, however.Co-Patronesses of Europe, 5 Yet there is no doubt that the Church, which recognized Bridget's holiness without ever pronouncing on her individual revelations, has accepted the overall authenticity of her interior experience. Excerpt \\"My daughter, one of the misfortunes, which deprive souls of happiness, or at least diminish it, is that they content themselves with performing good works negligently or without fervor, as if they were engaged in things unimportant or merely accidental. On account of this ignorance and meanness of heart few of them arrive at an intimate friendship of God, which they can attain only by fervent love. This is called fervent precisely because of its similarity to boiling water. For just as water is made to boil and foam by the fire, so the soul, by the sweet violence of the divine conflagration of love, is raised above itself and above all created things as well as above its own doings. In loving, it is more and more inflamed, and from this very love springs an unquenchable affection, which makes the soul despise and forget all earthly things while at the same time it becomes dissatisfied with all temporal goodness. And as the human heart, when it does not attain what it dearly loves (if that attainment is possible) is inflamed with ever greater desire of reaching it by other means; therefore, the loving soul, finds ever new things to strive after for the sake of the Beloved and all service will seem to it but little. Thus it will pass from good will to a perfect will, and from this to what will please the Lord still more, until it arrives at the most intimate union with Him and at a perfect conformation with the will of God.\\" (The Mystical City of God, volume II, 594) Controversy Chapter 3 of Book 8 claims Mark the Evangelist wrote his Gospel in Hebrew while in Palestine, then translated his Gospel into Latin while in Rome,Mystical City of God Book 8, Chapter 3 The Evangelist Mark wrote his gospel four years later, in the forty-sixth year after the birth of Christ. He likewise wrote it in Hebrew and while in Palestine. Before commencing he asked his guardian angel to notify the Queen of heaven of his intention and to implore her assistance for obtaining the divine enlightenment for what he was about to write. The kind Mother heard his prayer and immediately the Lord commanded the angels to carry Her with the usual splendor and ceremony to the Evangelist, who was still in prayer. The great Queen appeared to him seated on a most beautiful and resplendent throne. Prostrating himself before Her, he said: \\"Mother of the Savior of the world and Mistress of all creation, I am unworthy of this favor, though I am a servant of thy divine Son and of Thyself.\\" The heavenly Mother answered: \\"The Most High, whom thou servest and lovest, sends me to assure thee, that thy prayers are heard and that his holy Spirit shall direct thee in the writing of the Gospel, with which He has charged thee.\\" Then She told him not to write of the mysteries pertaining to Her, just as She had asked saint Matthew. Immediately the Holy Ghost, in visible and most refulgent shape, descended upon saint Mark enveloping him in light and filling him with interior enlightenment; and in the presence of the Queen he began to write his Gospel. At that time the Princess of heaven was sixty-one years of age. Saint Jerome says that saint Mark wrote his short Gospel in Rome, at the instance of the faithful residing there; but I wish to call attention to the fact, that this was a translation or copy of the one he had written in Palestine; for the Christians in Rome possessed neither his nor any other Gospel, and therefore he set about writing one in the Roman or Latin language. whereas it was the opinion of several of the Church Fathers that Mark wrote his Gospel in Greek while in Rome.Saint Augustine, Harmony of the Gospels Of these four, it is true, only Matthew is reckoned to have written in the Hebrew language; the others in Greek.

It spans a coastal area of . History The history of Puchuncav√≠ and its surroundings goes back over 500 years, being one of the oldest localities in Chile. The contemporary name comes from the Mapudungun \\"Punchuncahuin\\", meaning \\"where fiestas abound\\". Similarly, there have been other meanings to this word, such as \\"Remains of Fiestas\\" or \\"End of Fiestas\\". There are no precise dates known relating to the origin of Puchuncav√≠, and it is presumed that at the arrival of the Spaniards a shantytown by this name existed. Puchuncav√≠ was one of the terminals of the famous Inca road system, a stone footpath of medium width that united the Zona Central of Chile with Cuzco, Peru, the capital of the Inca Empire. In this location resided a Curaca or direct representative of the Inca, in charge of collecting taxes, crops, and imposing imperial authority over the indigenous peoples of the region. Upon the arrival of the Spanish, conquistador Pedro de Valdivia gave the valley of Puchuncav√≠ to one of his soldiers, the Italian native Mil√°n Vicenzo del Monte, a nephew of Pope Julius II. His descendants subdivided the lands between their heirs and finally in the 17th century there were several principal owners. On 8 December 1691, the Parrish of Puchuncav√≠ was created by the Chaplain of War during the independence of Chile, Presbyter Juan Manuel Benavides y Mujica, as recorded in the parish archives. On 6 March 1875, the Villa of Puchuncav√≠ was declared and was on several occasions provincial capital. In the year 1894 the first commune called ‚ÄúQuintero- Puchuncav√≠‚Äù was formed, integrating the two neighboring localities. In 1929, president Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo, issued a decree annexing the low-budget communes, and Puchuncav√≠ was eliminated. This mandate complicated the situation; Puchuncav√≠ happened to depend on Quintero. After a long period of dependence on Quintero, the creation of the Puchuncav√≠ commune was achieved through Decree No. 3827 on 15 October 1923 after great efforts made by the then authorities of the town of Quintero and prominent residents of the area. Thus, in 1943 the corporation of the commune of Quintero decided to separate of the two cities. After a series of meetings with neighbors and the authorities, they achieved this separation on 13 September 1944 as issued in Law Decree No. 7866 under then-president Juan Antonio R√≠os and alcalde Juan Jos√© Mena Salinas, creating the Municipality of Puchuncav√≠ with its eight districts: Placilla de Puchuncav√≠, La Laguna, La Canela, San Antonio, Pucal√°n, Melosillas, Los Maitenes, Campiche, La Greda, Las Ventanas, La Chocota and Horc√≥n. In 1975, with the creation of the Quillota Province and restructuring of the Valpara√≠so Province, Puchuncav√≠ became part of the latter province. Demographics According to data from the 2002 Census of Population and Housing, Puchuncav√≠ had 12,954 inhabitants; of these, 11,099 (85.7%) lived in urban areas and 1,855 (14.3%) in rural areas. At that time, there were 6,643 men and 6,311 women. The population grew by 21.5% (2,293 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. The commune consists of a number of localities and towns, including Las Ventanas, which hosts the Foundry and Refinery of Las Ventanas (est. 30 September 1964); La Chocota and Horc√≥n with their handcrafted boats and nude beach; Maitencillo, where one can find the Marbella Resort; El Rungue, countryside known for its traditional restaurant El Caballito de palo (English: \\"Stick Pony\\"); Pucal√°n and Los Maquis, whose people are primarily dedicated to the production of coal and agriculture; Campiche, whose people are primarily dedicated to growing tomatoes and other vegetables; La Canela; La Quebrada; El Paso; La Laguna; Chilicauquen; El Rinc√≥n; and El Leon. Administration As a commune, Puchuncav√≠ is a third- level administrative division of Chile administered by a communal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde is Agust√≠n Valencia Garc√≠a.

This is a list of characters from the Japanese anime series Bakugan Battle Brawlers. Heroes =Battle Brawlers= Dan Kuso Daniel \\"Dan\\" Kuso (known in the Japanese version as and nicknamed ) is the main human protagonist in the series, who, is 12 years old (11 in the Japanese dub) in the first season, 15 in New Vestroia, 16 in Gundalian Invaders, and 17 in Mechtanium Surge. In the beginning he is ranked #121, and by episode 39, he is ranked #1, and has become ranked #4 or under in episode 6 of Mechtanium Surge. In New Vestroia, Dan returns to New Vestroia to help Drago save the world from the invading Vestals. Despite having just been introduced to the new Brawling system, Dan manages to get the hang of it before he battles his way into the Resistance by tying with Ace. He returns to Earth, following Spectra, Gus, and Lync into a portal with Mira and Baron. After losing Drago to Spectra in episode 16, his determination to get him back pays off as he and Drago reunite in episode 18. At the end of episode 19, he and Baron go back to New Vestroia through Dr. Gehabich's dimension transporter. In episode 20 he and Baron make it back to New Vestroia where they battle Mylene and Shadow in Beta City where they defeat them when Drago unleashes the power of the Perfect Core. In episode 26, he goes back to Earth, along with Marucho, Shun and the rest of the Bakugan. Various portals open up across the world, allowing all the other brawlers to reunite with their Bakugan. After the destruction of the BT System, Dan and the Brawlers find out, with Lync Volan's help, that King Zenoheld is constructing a machine called the Alternative Weapon System which could destroy both Earth and Vestal. Dan along with the rest of restisance attempt to stop the alternative through any means necessary. At the end of New Vestroia he destroys the alternative weapon system with the help of his friends and allies. It is shown that he has been dating Runo at the start of the season. In Gundalian Invaders, Dan, Marucho, Shun, Jake, and Ren join Fabia in fighting an oncoming invasion of the evil Gundalians who want to rule over Neathia and have control over the Sacred Orb. In Mechtanium Surge, he and Drago have problem controlling their new powers they were given to by Code eve, and can sometime be taken over by Mag Mel and Razenoid and spawn Zenthon, a Mechtogan, which they eventually tame while in New Vestroia, after they returned to New Vestroia to control their new powers. They were the number one in bakugan Interspace until they were disqualified for using Zenthon accidentally, when battling Anubias for number one position. Dan later regained the title of Leader of the Brawlers after he apologized to the rest of the Brawlers minus Spectra. He has a good relationship with his parents. His mom is a big yoga fan, while his dad is obsessed about pudding and has a personality similar to Dan's, only he's a little more clueless. It is possible that Dan plays guitar; in earlier episodes you can see a Fender Telecaster in the corner of his bedroom. In season 3, Dan has moved to Bayview Town because of his dad's work, and quickly becomes popular due to the fact he helped destroy Naga and King Zenoheld. Runo Misaki , is a 12-year-old (11 in the Japanese dub) girl who loves playing Bakugan against skilled people so she can show off. Runo is a Haos brawler. Her Guardian Bakugan is a Haos Tigrerra (the others being Terrowclaw and Saurus), who is very obedient and powerful in battle. Tigrerra later evolves into Haos Blade Tigrerra. Though underage (in the first season), she helps her parents run their family business in a cafe. It is revealed in episode 32 that she knew Dan from when she was little, but didn't realize it because she didn't catch his name. She reached 6th in the rankings. She has not brawled for the final showdown against King Zenoheld as Tigrerra chose not to brawl and put her into trouble. She missed her friends so much that she teleported herself to New Vestroia but she was half way there. She's believed to be 16 years old in the third season's timeline. Even though she didn't appear in Gundalian Invaders as an individual, in True Colors, she was shown in a flashback from New Vestroia, and in Mobile Assault, she was shown in a picture with Dan. In Mechtanium Surge, she was shown in another picture with Julie in the episode Back in Sync. However, she finally made her return in the episode Enemy Allies, where she delivers the battle suits to Dan, Marucho and Shun as they battle Wiseman. From that episode on, she and Mira helped to deliver the Battle Suits to the Brawlers whenever they needed them. In Jump to Victory, she met a Baku Sky Raider named \\"Haos Aerogan\\" and became his new partner, but Aerogan later returned to New Vestroia. Runo is a fairly good opponent in Bakugan. Near the end of Mechtanium Surge, Runo, along with Julie and Mira, are killed when Mechtavius Destroyer annihilates Bakugan City, but their deaths are prevented when Dan, Shun, and Marucho, are able to use the Current of Time to go back to before that happened and destroy Mechtavius Destroyer for good, preventing that dark future. Marucho Marukura Marucho Marukura (known in the Japanese version as and nicknamed ) loves to play Bakugan and is also able to change attributes. Marucho is eleven (ten in the Japanese dub) and is an aquas brawler. He is seen after being defeated by Volt in episode 13, being held as a hostage in episodes 15 and 17, and was later freed by Mira and Spectra in episode 20, even though he is unaware of this. He gets Preyas back in episode 26. Nothing is known about Preyas Angelo/Diablo. In episode 26, he goes back to Earth with Dan, Shun, Drago, the other brawlers' old Guardian Bakugan, Elfin, and Ingram, except for Storm Skyress. Marucho's trap Bakugan is Aquos Tripod Epsilon. Despite his height, he is older than Baron. Marucho is 14 years old in the second series. In episode 31, \\"Spectra Rises\\", Marucho Dan and Mira make it to Vestal where they meet up with Ace Baron and Klaus later they are challenged by both of Volt Luster for their attribute energy and then challenging Dan. Spectra then battles Dan, Mira and Marucho when both Mira and Marucho lose when Drago protects them from Cyber Helios' cyber blast. At episode 35's ending, Marucho loses the Aquos energy to Hydron and Shadow Prove, although he wins the battle. He helps fend off the onslaught of Zenoheld's robotic bakugan during the final episode of New Vestroia. He also gains a new Bakugan and will be back in Gundalian invaders. He's now believed to be about 16 in Mechtanium Surge. Shun Kazami was the former 1st ranked Bakugan brawler but after Masquerade showed up, he moves down to 6th, then back up to 5th after defeating Komba, then 2nd and ultimately to 3rd by the end of the first series. He is 13 years old (11 in the Japanese dub), has black hair, which is tied into a long ponytail, bronze-brown eyes and wears a purple jacket over a dark, dark blue (almost black) sleeveless shirt. He is a master of Bakugan and co-created the rules with Dan. He is also Dan's childhood best friend. Shun is a loner, a boy of very few words, but yet is willing to help his friends at almost every turn. He is a Ventus brawler and he approaches Bakugan like a ninja. He lives with his grandfather, who used to be a famous ninja warrior, who once expected Shun to follow in his footsteps instead of playing Bakugan. His Guardian Bakugan is a Ventus Skyress, whom Shun received from his sick mother before she fell into a coma, and died in the Japanese series. It is unknown if Shun has a father, this is not yet revealed, he has not appeared in any of the seasons. Skyress later evolved into Storm Skyress. In New Vestroia, Shun came to New Vestroia completely by accident, and explained why Dan could not contact him in episode 1; he was up alone in the mountains working on his ninja skills, when a warp hole appeared and he was sucked into New Vestroia. He is 16 years old in New Vestroia. He made a cameo appearance in episode 4 when Marucho battled Mylene, but his face was not revealed as his hood covered it completely and was offered a place in the Vexos. After hearing that Skyress was taken captive, he rushed towards one of the cities to save her, but on the way, teamed up with Dan after rescuing him from Spectra and Gus. After being separated from Skyress, he teams up with Ventus Ingram, who he grabbed just before a beam pulled him into the ship. In the beginning, he does not get along with Ace very well, who refers to him as a \\"ninja-wannabe\\", but he is deeply admired by Baron who, in episode 7, even tries to imitate some of Shun's ninja moves but fails. He is taken hostage in episode 15, after being defeated by Shadow. Mira and Spectra later free him in episode 20, though he is unaware of this. He is reunited with Storm Skyress in episode 26 but she stays in New Vestroia, claiming that she was in his past and that Ingram is officially his new partner now. In episode 26, he goes back to Earth with Marucho, Dan, Drago, the other brawler's Bakugan, except for Storm Skyress. Shun returns to New Vestroia a few episodes after the beginning of the second series, and has a run-in with Lync Volan of the Vexos. Storm Skyress comes to his rescue, and after Lync is defeated by Shun and Ingram, Skyress bids Shun her final farewell. Shun is still the strong silent type and highly skilled with Bakugan, and is willing to help his friends whenever they need it. He helps Dan defeat the Alternative in the final episode of New Vestroia. Not much has changed for how he acts or looks, except for the fact that he has cut off his ponytail to neck length. His Trap Bakugan is Ventus Hylash and his current Guardian Bakugan is Ventus Master Ingram. Shun is 17 years old in Gundalian Invaders. Shun returns in Gundalian Invaders as the second ranked battler in Bakugan Interspace and partnered with the synthetic Hawktor clone. At first he does not trust Ren and asks Fabia for her side of the story after the comes to Earth. Together they expose Ren for the liar he is and the brawlers side with Fabia at which point he is given the real Ventus Hawktor that Fabia gave him. When the brawlers head to Neathia, Shun helps restart the second defense shield by switching Bakugan with Dan and heading to the generator. The mission is a success, but it is later destroyed by Barodius and Colossus Dharak. Shun returns again in \\"Mechtanium Surge\\" as co-captain of the Battle Brawlers. His Bakugan is Ventus Taylean which is another Bakugan from Neathia. In episode 7, Dan disappears and Shun loses his cool as the new captain of the Battle Brawlers. Julie Makimoto Julie Makimoto (known in the Japanese version as is a 12-year-old girl from Australia who tries to stay happy even when the worst has happened (for example, when Billy ended up under the control of Masquerade); she acts happy after something bad happened but she generally does that just to cover up her true feelings inside. Julie forgets things easily, proving that she is a little scatterbrained at times. In the Japanese version, Julie spices her speech with American phrases, differentiating her personality from the others. She adores Dan, and by \\"adore\\", we mean \\"make out adore\\". This is why she's jealous of Runo, but eventually gets over Dan and becomes best friends with Runo. Instead, she ends up wooing Billy Gilbert, her childhood friend. She is a Subterra battler and her guardian Bakugan is her Subterra Gorem. Gorem then evolves into Subterra Hammer Gorem. Julie has a sister named Daisy who has bested her in everything since she was a child. She reached 8th in the rankings. She chose not to brawl against Zenoheld in the final showdown as Gorem did not want to put her into trouble. She returns in Gundalian Invaders as a neighbor of Dan's once he moves. She works at a cafe and in Revelation, it is revealed she is a cheerleader for the team Jake plays for. This strongly suggests she is already in high school in her first year with Dan. She's believed to be about 16 years old. In Brawler To Be, Jake is having his first battle and Jake gets scared, so Julie teaches Jake some lessons. Her role is basically that of a supporting character. Julie returns in Mechtanium Surge as a news reporter. Near the end of that season, Julie is killed alongside Runo and Mira when Mechtavius Destroyer levels Bakugan City, but her death is prevented when Dan, Shun, and Marucho use the Current of Time to go back and destroy Mechtavius Destroyer for good, before he could carry out his murderous intent. Alice Gehabich is a 14-year-old girl from Moscow, Russia. Although she knows almost everything about the game, she rarely plays it; she is generally afraid of hurting others, including Bakugan. She usually just gives advice to the other brawlers, which she prefers over battling. Alice is kind and caring, worried forand compassionate towards others and does not think of herself. She also adores Shun. Alice was sometimes unconsciously possessed by \\"Masquerade\\" (her mysterious alter-ego), and with a sudden jolt, her auburn hair spikes up and turns into a golden blonde as well as becomes slightly shorter and straighter, and clothes and a mask come out of nowhere on her, and finally, she turns into a male. This was caused by her exposure to the Silent Core. Alice might seem to be less important than the other brawlers, but in fact she plays an important part, not as Masquerade, but without her, the brawlers might have already lost her to her alter ego. Michael Gehabich is her grandfather; who she constantly worries about after finding out that his alter-ego is the monstrous Hal-G and that he works for Naga. Alice and Marucho are the 2 brawlers who mostly use strategy. However, unlike Marucho, Alice gives her strategies to the other brawlers. She left the Brawlers after finding out that she was Masquerade out of intense guilt over what she had done as him, as well as fearing the Battle Brawlers will have a deep grudge against her, but later returns in time to save Dan in the form of Masquerade. Her guardian is Alpha Hydranoid, which she received from Masquerade after he bid her farewell and left her body (something she initially resents, because she believed that she needed him; although Masquerade's presence will always be in her, as he is capable of communicating to her through her mind. Alice is also shown once with Masquerade's shadow instead of her own). After that, she initially begins to battle more, with her Darkus attribute, which she inherited from Masquerade. She either has a crush on Shun or Lync. Alice is 17 years old in New Vestroia, 18 years old in Gundalian Invaders, and 19 years old in Mechtanium Surge. Alice has a special ability that most brawlers wish to have, she can see the power level of any bakugan on the field even if the bakugan is not playing.That is why she does not have a baku-pod. She might have this ability because of Masquerade. She ultimately ends up at 2nd place at the end of the series. It is still unknown if Alice is an orphan. She appears in Surprise Visitor and takes in Lync in Gate Crashers. In New Vestroia it is stated after Alice is reunited with Hydranoid, that she hates brawling because of what happened in the past, but when Shadow attacks in Shadow Attack, she has no choice but to fight back with help from Chan Lee. She and her grandfather also manage to find the route to the Mother Palace in All For One. Joseph \\"Joe\\" Brown Joseph \\"Joe\\" Brown (known in the Japanese version as ), also known as . In the first season, it was revealed that due to an unknown health condition, he basically lived in a hospital for some time. During this time, the Brawlers thought that he was working for Masquerade, because somehow, Masquerade knew every location they set foot, although this was because Alice was a Battle Brawler, so she knew where they were. After Dan confronted him, he told Dan that he would only tell him the truth if Dan could beat him in a battle. In the middle of the battle, Joe fainted, and when he awoke he revealed that the brawlers' theory was untrue and he actually sent a message to all of the Bakugan players around the world to warn them that Masquerade was plotting against them. After the truth was revealed, they asked him if he wanted to become a Battle Brawler, which he gladly accepted. He then revealed that he and his mother were going on a road trip for the time being, to see the world outside of the hospital. Sometime later, after he moved to the Brawlers' neighborhood, he found Wavern, who had the Infinity Core hidden inside of her. It was also revealed that Wavern was Naga's twin sister and that he was looking for her in order to absorb the infinity core. After he obtained Wavern, Joe was the first person to beat Masquerade in a one-on-one battle. Jake Vallory is a new friend of Dan's after his arrival at his new town. He has a powerful presence, because he's big for his age. He's very calm, but can get overly excited and obsessive. He is a Subterra brawler and his Bakugan partner is Coredem. He is just starting out as a brawler and still was asked to join the Bakugan Battle Brawlers. He really admires Dan and likes to use his name and rhymes it with other words like, \\" Dan the Man with the big, brown van.\\" which sometimes irritates Dan. Later on when the brawlers are on Neathia Jake gets kidnapped and brainwashed but as of episodes 34 it looks like Jake is coming back to his senses. But in Dream Escape he has a dream where Dan is shouting his name and it is then that he comes back to his senses and goes back to Neathia with the others. Gunz Lazar Gunz Lazar is a new character and the new member of the Battle Brawlers in Arc 2 of Mechtanium Surge. Gunz has blond hair, wears a gray, with red lining, jumpsuit. His eyes are violet. He thinks of himself as Dan's greatest opponent, and has a somewhat cocky personality. He is a Haos brawler and his partner is Reptak. He was seen in Evil Arrival which he fought in the Neo Tournament in Bakugan City. However, he was lost since Wiseman Cometh. In Battle Suit Bash, he was revealed that he was captured by Wiseman and that he was absorbing Gunz's energy as well as stealing his appearance using vines. He later freed himself in Enemy Infiltration. He later took on the Wiseman persona himself after Coredegon stopped using it, becoming a second Wiseman and vowing vengeance against Dan for turning Reptak against him. He was defeated and later abandoned the persona in Doom Dimension Throwdown, joining the Brawlers and reuniting with Reptak. =Bakugan Brawlers' Resistance= The Bakugan Brawlers' Resistance' is a resistance movement that opposed the Vexos. Among its members are: Mira fermin Mira Clay (known in the Japanese version as ) is a 16-year-old Vestal girl who had formed the Bakugan Brawler Resistance after witnessing the tortured Alpha Hydranoid speak out in vengeance to the invaders, to free all the captured Bakugan from Prince Hydron and the Vexos. At the end of Surprise Visitor, she along with Baron travel with Dan back to his world. In Unmasked, Mira challenges Spectra to a battle and if she's victorious, Spectra will be unmasked. If she loses, however, she has to join the Vexos, and even battle against her own friends. She told herself in the beginning that her hero was always her brother, Keith, but forced herself to change her mind about it after Spectra unmasks himself in front of her, revealing that he was her 'hero'. Baron described her as 'intense'. She betrays the Brawlers in Family Ties as she says that she wants to stay with Keith, once telling the others on Earth that Spectra is her brother. She returns to New Vestroia through the portal Apollonir opened with Spectra, Gus and Lync after revealing her betrayal. In Beta City Blues, she reveals that she has joined the Vexos, but is really wondering what Spectra is up to. In Brotherly Love she challenged her elder brother to a battle and if she wins, she goes back to being with her real brother and not Spectra. However, if she loses, she will have no choice but to work for and obey Spectra. She later lost the brawl. She is regretful of this as she says, \\"I'm sorry, my friends\\" after the battle, and is also seen crying as she has no choice but to be an enemy to the Resistance that she herself had founded. She later returns to the Resistance. She returns to Vestal with Ace and Baron and their Bakugan, in case the Vexos will want to take back New Vestroia for themselves in the future. Mira visits the Brawlers on Earth for a visit, but soon returns to Vestal, this time with Dan and Marucho, and they meet up with Ace and Baron at Klaus Von Hertzen's estate. Following the defeat of Zenoheld she returns to Vestal with her older brother, Gus, and the rest of the Vestal Resistance. She also has a brother that she desperately wants to find after he disappeared during Hydranoid's rebellion. Although she is the leader, she is not necessarily accepted by the others, as she has a small tendency to go off on her own. She prefers the Subterra attribute. Her main Bakugan is Subterra Wilda and her Trap Bakugan is Baliton. She has a crush on Dan and is presented several times: in Six Degrees of Destruction where she tried to see if Dan would notice her change in hair style and in Reunion she was extremely sad to the point of crying when she thought Dan was caught in the explosion and upon knowing he survived she jumped into Dan's arms hugging him. In Surprise Visitor, Dan brought up Runo and Ace said Mira sounded jealous (even though Mira is jealous of Runo, she is still good friends with her). It was also the main reason for Ace's hostility to Dan because Ace has a romantic crush on Mira. Mira returns in Bakugan: Mechtanium Surge where she helps the brawlers by creating powered battle suits for their Bakugan. She is among those killed by Mechtavius Destroyer near the end of the season when he destroys Bakugan City, but her death is prevented when Dan, Shun, and Marucho are able to go back in time and destroy Mechtavius Destroyer before he could attack Bakugan City. Ace Grit is a Vestal boy, 16 years of age, and the Darkus battler of the Resistance with Darkus Percival as his guardian and Darkus Falcon Fly as his trap. He is often very rash and does not think things through. As revealed in episode 13, Ace was once a top brawler in the Vestal tournaments, but stayed away after Hydron used them to find strong brawlers. Mira approached him, invited him to the Resistance, and gave him Percival. Ace first shows his skills as a brawler when he battles Dan in the second episode of the series: Ace refuses to accept humans on the Resistance and challenges Dan to a battle to prove his skills. After three hours, the battle ends in a draw and the two become fast best friends. In Return of a Friend, he and Mira had an argument because Mira wanted to postpone destroying the dimension controllers and find her brother, however, Ace refuses to allow her to go because he fears of the dangers she may face. In Voices in the Night, he says, \\"This is for Mira\\", which may also hint that he likes Mira. After Mira and Baron went to Earth with Dan, he worries about Mira and when he hears her voice in the night, which was really Shadow Prove who was leading him into a Vexos trap, he tries to save her, which further proves his love for Mira. In What's the Plan?, when he and Shun are forced to fight together in a tournament, Ace wears a purple and black mask to disguise himself while tensions rise between the two of them and they fall close to losing. However, on the edge of defeat, they put their differences aside and Ace works together with Shun after realizing he was just trying to help. Shun remarks that he is very much like Dan. In Voices in the Night, after falling for the Vexos trap laid out by Mylene, he loses in battle to her and becomes a hostage. After Marucho and Shun are also captured, they are relocated to Beta City, where they are freed by Mira and Spectra, though they are unaware of this. When he's told that Mira betrayed the Resistance he refused to believe it due to his feelings for her and gets a little violent by grabbing Dan's collar, but accepts it as the truth when Baron insists Dan's telling the truth. In Wall To Wall Brawl, When the Resistance infiltrate Gamma City, he and Dan battle Mira and Gus. Mira ends up betraying Gus and Ace tells her he always believed in her, Mira smiles happily at him and is glad to be back on the resistance. After Skyress, Hydranoid, Gorem, Tigrerra and Preyas are rescued, Ace and Percival return to Vestal with Baron and Mira and spread the truth about the Bakugan and the Vexos' actions. After Percival receives the Darkus attribute energy from Exedra, Percival evolves to Knight Percival. While Baron searches for an apartment to move into, Ace helps out but is ambushed by Mylene. He nearly loses but is saved by Klaus. Ace travels to Earth with the Resistance to hide out from the Vexos and protect the Attribute energies. While in hiding, Julie develops a crush on him after watching him work out. When Marucho invents Bakugan Interspace, Ace is set to battle Billy, but also challenges Julie so as to not \\"get in between the two love birds.\\" Despite Percival becoming immobile, Ace is victorious thanks to his evolved trap Darkus Flash Falcon Fly. After the Resistance decided to go on the attack, Ace and Marucho encounter Lync and Shadow at the Mother Palace. Due to the rigged field, Ace and Marucho lose and the Darkus energy is taken. After destroying the BT System, Ace returns to Earth with the Resistance and witnesses Dan's ultimate battle with Spectra, in which he decides to turn over a new leaf. After Keith becomes an official member of the Resistance, Ace becomes jealous of the time Keith spends with Mira. But Julie and Percival assure him that Keith and Mira are only siblings and that Mira is just happy to have her brother back. Baron Leltoy Baron Leltoy (known in the Japanese version as ). Originally, Baron fought with Tigrerra, but lost her to Spectra and Helios. He used Haos Nemus as his main Bakugan and uses Piercian as his Trap Bakugan. In Surprise Visitor, he says that he had always wondered what it would be like on the other side of the portal, which was the portal that led Runo to New Vestroia from Earth. In the end, he decides to follow Dan, Mira, and Runo to Earth in order to stop the Vexos from destroying it. Baron admires Runo as one of the six original Battle Brawlers but Runo's father does not like the fact that he does. He returns to New Vestroia with Dan through Dr. Gehabich's dimension transporter. He seems to be very fond of the activities done on Earth, especially by Dan e.g. taking baths. In Beta City Blues, he and Dan made it back to New Vestroia where they battled Mylene and Shadow in Beta City. Baron was defeated helping Dan and Drago, but he still was able to keep Nemus. He returns to Vestal with Ace and Mira with their Bakugan, in case the Vexos will want to take back New Vestroia for themselves in the future. In Revenge of the Vexos, after the Vexos return Baron brawls Prince Hydron and loses the Haos attribute energy. Baron is currently 12 years old, confirming this in the English version by saying, \\"I'm almost 13 ya know!\\" He is a huge fan of the Bakugan Battle Brawlers and the six fighting Bakugan as displayed by his reaction to first meeting Dan, Marucho, Drago, and Shun. He seems to always embarrass himself in front of Dan, Marucho, and Shun. According to Mira, he has a poster of the Bakugan Battle Brawlers up on his wall. From what was shown in Revenge of the Vexos, Baron has a large family and is very caring for his many younger brothers and sisters. He is the youngest and most emotional of all the brawlers. Spectra Phantom (Keith Fermin) . At the beginning of the series, Spectra Phantom would only serve under and obey Prince Hydron. Little was known about Spectra, but it confirmed he is very powerful and thinks highly of his skills as a Pyrus brawler. He was the Vexos' strongest battler and used Pyrus Viper Helios as his main Bakugan and Metalfencer as his Trap Bakugan. After seeing Drago's powers, Spectra said that he's not going to let it be a 'play thing', which means that even when he captures Drago, he will not give him to Prince Hydron. In What's the Plan?, Mira noticed a possibility that Spectra could be Mira's brother. How he became Spectra is unknown. He also wished to join forces with Dan and the Resistance so they could take Prince Hydron down together in an attempt to rule New Vestroia and Vestal. After Gus lost to Mira, Spectra unmasks himself, proving himself as Mira's older brother Keith Clay ( in the Japanese version). When he, Gus and Lync traveled to Earth, Mylene took over as leader. Meanwhile, Spectra won the Bakugan brawl against Dan and Drago, and takes Drago. Dan defeats him and a corrupted Drago during their brawl with the help of Pyrus Apollonir. In episode 19, he convinced Mira to join him. He needed her help on his \\"ultimate plan\\", which was creating a Cyber Helios and duplicating the power of the Perfect Core, planning to use this Bakugan to overthrow the Vestal royal family. In Brotherly Love he battled Mira and won with his new Cyborg Helios. In episode 24 he took several Mechanical Bakugan for his own purpose of making Maxus Helios to defeat Dan. He does not return to Vestal, but he remains in the other rim of the planets area in a ship with Gus, Helios, Elico, Vulcan, and Brontes. Spectra appears again in Spectra Rises, battles Dan, and loses, but nevertheless says he will see him again soon. As shown in Spectra Rises, he used the forbidden card \\"Chaos Ability X\\" on Elico, Vulcan and Brontes, which forced their unnatural evolution, making them his battle weapons. In All Or Nothing, Spectra transports Dan to his ship upon reaching Earth to retrieve the Perfect Core from Drago. During their battle, Spectra seems to have a change of heart, referring to Dan as his friend in thanks for enlightening him. He reveals shortly that using data on Bakugan evolution, he plans to bring out even further power from within the Bakugan. After they arrive at the Mother Palace, he states that the Resistance is on their own in shutting down the BT system. After confronting Zenoheld however, Gus is defeated and Spectra soon forms a temporary alliance with Dan to avenge his fallen comrade. After the Pyrus attribute energy is absorbed and the BT system begins to activate, his ship is used to transport all of the bakugan on New Vestroia to Earth. When time begins to run out, and the Resistance decides to bail out while they still can, Helios leaves Spectra and confronts Drago about staying to evacuate the remaining bakugan. The two decide to head off and destroy the BT system, and after Drago evolves by absorbing the attribute energies, Helios and Spectra once again become Dan and Drago's rivals before leaving New Vestroia. But in the end of Spectra's Last Stand, Spectra agrees to join Dan and the Resistance and takes off his mask, becoming Keith once again. It is shown in the same episode that like Mira, he may have some sort of telepathic ability, as he spoke to Dan and Drago in their own minds from a distance. Spectra has returned in the fourth season, Bakugan Mechtanium Surge. He was first seen in the shadows receiving a distress call from Marucho who was fighting against the rampaging chaos bakugan, although Marucho and Shun were surprised that Spectra came to help they were still glad. Spectra left afterwards but not before telling Dan that he has changed from the old Dan. Spectra and Helios returned to help the brawlers again when they were fighting against Mag Mel on Gundalia and before they left Spectra said they had nothing left to worry about over the brawlers. When Dan thanked the two of them for helping, Spectra said they could call on him anytime. =Castle Knights= Fabia Sheen is the Princess of Neathia. She is the younger sister of Serena Sheen, the former Neathian Queen. Fabia's reason for brawling is to save her planet from the Gundalians. She is also the fianc√©e of the former Captain of the Castle Knights, Jin, who is deceased. She seems to have the same kind of love for freedom and initiative to act as Mira does. She also seems to be strong, because she shoulder threw Dan twice in episode 3, the first was by accident and the second was when she got mad at Dan after losing, and in episode 10 when Zenet tried to take her as a hostage and Fabia threw her hard on the ground. Those incidents may prove Ren Krawler's statement about the Neathians' specialty at close combat, although most of what Ren said was a lie to put down the Neathians. Fabia owns Aranaut, the bakugan of her deceased fianc√©e, Jin. After she becomes the new Neathian Queen in Bakugan: Mechtanium Surge, following her sister stepping down from the throne, she gives Aranaut to Captain Elright. Rafe Rafe (known in the Japanese version as ) is a new character in Bakugan: Mechantium Surge. He is a Neathian Castle Knight who was sent by Princess Fabia to go to Earth to help the Brawlers with the Mechtogan threat. He is the new Haos Brawler of the Battle Brawlers. Since the Battle Brawlers helped save Neathia during the war against Emperor Barodius Rafe, along with other members of the Castle Knights, have looked up to Dan and the Brawlers. Rafe was disappointed when he and Paige discovered how much the Brawlers had changed with Dan and Drago gone but he never gave up believing in the Battle Brawlers. After Mag Mel's defeat Rafe and Wolfurio returned to Neathia. =Gundalian Forces= Ren Krawler Voiced by Hirofumi Nojima (Japanese) David Reale (1-9), Peter Cugno (English) is a 16-year-old Darkus Brawler. Ren was the leader of a secret agent group sent to Earth by Emperor Barodius to find the DNA Code. He is an alien disguised as a human sent to find the best brawlers and defeat the Neathians. Ren comes from the underground world of Gundalia where he was kept, unknowingly, by the Emperor's family due to his possession of a dark Bakugan with a powerful ability. He is a member of the Twelve Orders because he thinks that would save his people if he works for them. He is attempting to trick the brawlers into thinking that the Neathians are the ones trying to conquer Gundalia. His Bakugan partner is Linehalt. He makes an appearance at the end of the final episode of New Vestroia. In A New Beginning it was revealed that he helped put Bakugan Interspace online. He has a battle with Dan, which ends up as a draw. In Confrontation Ren shows too much care and loyalty to his home planet. It's possible that even if Ren and Marucho are current enemies, they still share a big friendship thread. It also seems Ren does not want to fight the brawlers because he still remembers their friendship. After Sid, Lena, Jesse and Zenet were punished by the Twelve Orders, Ren feels incredibly guilty over what has happened, especially since he has gotten off Scot free each time. While he was fighting with Dan, he was surprised to see that Sid is alive and is relieved to hear from him that the others are alive as well. Sid saves Ren from Dharak's attack and falls to his death, not before giving Ren his Rubanoid. After some serious thought and battling with Dan, Ren decides to turn on Barodius and do something he should have done a long time ago: fight alongside his true friends. At first, the Neathians do not accept him, but after battling Fabia, where he lost, Fabia offers him her hand and he goes with the Brawlers. He is now one of the Castle Knights. After the war is over Ren returns to Gundalia along with his teammates and Nurzak. In Mechtanium Surge Ren has become the commander of the Gundalian Forces and is reunited with the Brawlers when they come to help Gundalia fight against Mag Mel. Paige Paige (known in the Japanese version as ) is a new character in Bakugan: Mechtanium Surge. She is a Gundalian Soldier who was sent to Earth by Princess Fabia of Neathia to help the brawlers deal with the Mechtagan threat. She is the new Subterra Brawler of the Battle Brawlers. Paige and Boulderon like to charge head first into battle. When Paige first met the Brawlers she was unimpressed with the way they acted and couldn't understand why Rafe looked up to them. Later though Paige changes her mind and figures out why Rafe looks up to them when Marucho comes up with a plan to win a competition. Paige later admits she may have been a bit too hot-headed with her first judgement of Shun and Marucho. After Mag Mel's defeat Paige and Boulderon returned to Gundalia. Villains =Doom Dimension's faction= Hal-G Hal-G is a man with green skin and white hair who was the alter-ego of Alice's grandfather Michael after he was exposed to the Silent Core just like Alice, who became Masquerade. He assisted Naga in his quest to get the Infinity Core from Wayvern. After Naga was destroyed, Hal-G was exposed to the Infinity Core and returned to being Michael. At the beginning of the first video game, Hal-G said that he had the Silent Core and all Bakugan would bow to him. At nearly the end of the game, Hal-G reappeared after the player defeated Marduk at the Tournament a second time, showing the Silent Core to them, but stolen by Marduk's Bakugan Vladitor. Masquerade is Alice's male-and-evil separated personality and used to be the first-ranked Bakugan player in the world before he left Alice's body. His goal is to send all Bakugan to the Doom Dimension with his Doom Card, so he can evolve his Hydranoid and have the ultimate Bakugan (to take the Infinity Core and bring it to Naga). He is a Darkus battler. He is revealed to be Alice in episode 38 and his origin is revealed in episode 39. Masquerade came to life when negative energy changed Alice when she was exposed to the energy of the Silent Core alongside her grandfather Michael. Darkus Hydranoid is Masquerade's Guardian Bakugan (his first Guardian Bakugan was Reaper, but he sent it to the Doom Dimension). He battles with Dan in episode 38 and loses. After that, Masquerade takes his mask off, revealing his true identity, Alice. Following the battle against Centorrior and Druman, Masquerade disappears from Alice's body. In New Vestroia, Masquerade made a minor appearance in episode 32 during Alice and Chan Lee's Brawl against Shadow. =Vexos= King Zenoheld The central villain of the second season. The King of Vestal and a leader of the Vexos. He is the one responsible into invade New Vestroia, capture the Bakugan and them to fight each other to create Mechanical Bakugan as his own weapons. In the first half of New Vestroia, Zenoheld had little interaction with the Resistance or the Vexos. The only time he appeared was when he nagged Hydron for not taking better care of the Dimension Controllers. He seems to be impatient with him due to his constant failure. He will also check in with him and make sure that he is still on the right track, although Hydron shrugs his warnings and discipline off, as he thinks he is doing fine without his father's constant nagging. In the second half of New Vestroia, he flees Vestal and resides in his palace on the outer skirts of the galaxy that is remote from civilization. He is revealed to be a brawler and he sends a message to the Six Ancient Warriors to surrender their Attribute Energies to him so that Professor Clay can power up the Bakugan Termination System. They decline his offer at first, but then they decide to battle him. When they arrive, Zenoheld reveals that he owns a Mechanical Bakugan, Pyrus Farbros. After a tough battle, Zenoheld comes out victorious, but the Ancients escaped and entrusted their Attribute Energies to the Resistance. After hearing the news of the Attribute Energies being dispersed throughout New Vestroia and Earth, he entrusts Mylene Pharaoh with the duty of picking another Subterra Brawler to replace Gus in the Vexos. She chooses Hydron, and he says that he ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt have picked better himself‚Äù. After Hydron gains the Haos Energy after he defeats Baron in a brawl he says ‚ÄúI knew I could count on you...Hydron‚Äù, revealing that he now trusts him with responsibility more than he did in the first half. Soon after Mylene and Volt come back from brawling, he sees a transmission from Spectra, saying that the Vexos, Hydron and Zenoheld himself were responsible for the mess in the previous season. This causes him to send Shadow Prove to seek out Dan and the others so that he will get the Attribute Energies first. But when he does, he realizes Spectra jammed the transporting system, making it impossible to travel to Vestal and back. This infuriates him, knowing that he is up to something. Eventually, though, Shadow goes to Earth and brawls Chan Lee and Alice (who do not have any Attribute Energies). He wins and proves himself to Zenoheld. He also brawled against Gus Grav, and won with the Farbros-Assail formation, and destroyed Blast Elico, and his Bakugan Trap Hexados. However, Gus and Vulcan survived the final blow. In BT: The Final Battle, he helps Hydron brawl Mira Clay, Dan Kuso and Spectra Phantom. However he does not brawl until Hydron loses to Dan and Spectra. He wins but Farbros was destroyed and he takes the Pyrus energy from Cross Dragonoid. In Phantom Data Attack, he almost launched the Bakugan Termination System, and then Cross Dragonoid and Helios MK2 try to destroy it, but fail. When Cross Dragonoid brings the B.T. System into the atmosphere and absorbed all the Attribute Energies from it Zenoheld was furious and was eventually going do something about it. In Fusion Confusion, he takes his frustration out on Hydron demanding to know whose fault it was for the destruction of the BT System. After Professor Clay told him about how he could rule over all dimensions he had Clay create the Alternative Weapon to destroy Earth and Vestal. In An Heir To Spare, it is revealed that Zenoheld took his anger against Hydron for another time. He battled against Hydron to see who would have the throne, and won. Hydron was then jailed, along with Gus Grav. Zenoheld stated that they were never destined to be father and son. In Ultimate Weapon, he battled Spectra, who rammed into his palace. During the entire battle he was losing, even with Assail Farbros, because later Gus joined Spectra. However, when Farbros combined with the Alternative, he overpowered both of them. In All For One and Final Fury, he uses the Alternative against the brawlers, but when the Alternative was destroyed, Farbros was destroyed by Dryoid. Hydron then used Dryoid to trap Zenoheld until the Alternative explodes, supposedly killing all three. He is currently mentioned by Dan in the season 3's introduction (first fourteen episodes), and also appeared in the next video game, Defenders of the Core (along with Spectra and the other Vexos, excepted Hydron and Clay). Professor Clay Fermin Professor Clay Fermin is Mira and Keith's father who created the first Mechanical Bakugan named Ventus Altair for Lync in Cyber Nightmare. He also appeared in Facing Ace with Alpha Hydranoid. He also created Darkus Hades and Trap Darkus Fortress for Shadow. Professor Clay is also credited for making the Cyber Bakugan that were intended for Prince Hydron but are being reprogramed for Spectra by Lync. He also turns Pyrus Helios into Pyrus Cyborg Helios after Helios gave him the idea of a Cyborg Bakugan. He also oversaw the test run of his creation Farbros in King Zenoheld's battle with the six Ancient Warriors. Besides Altair, Cyborg Helios, and Farbros, other examples of Professor Clay's Mechanical Bakugan creations are Aquos Brachium, Darkus Fortress, Subterra Dryoid, Dynamo, Fencer, Foxbat, Grafias, Grakus Hound, Hades, Klawgor, Leefram, Macubass, Metalfencer, Scraper, Spindle, Spitarm, Spyderfencer, and Wired. He also designed the Bakugan Termination System and is currently developing the Alternative Weapon system for King Zenoheld. As of Ultimate Weapon, he has finished the Alternative Weapon system (which he based on Farbros). In Final Fury, he was killed along with Hydron & Zenoheld when the Alternative System was destroyed, while he was watching the video sent by Fabia about the Bakugan at war. Prince Hydron Hydron was the commander of the Vexos, the Vestal Prince and Zenoheld's son. He tried collecting all six of the fighting Bakugan that saved Vestroia and keep them as trophies. The Vexos continually failed to bring him Drago, the last of the six fighting Bakugan needed in his collection, as he had already in possession of Gorem, Preyas, Tigrerra, Skyress, and Hydranoid in a petrified statue form. He is shown to have a habit of twirling his hair between his fingers. In episode 17, he may have been aware that Spectra had Drago in his hands. At the end of the first half of the series, he flees New Vestroia with Mylene, Volt, Lync, Shadow and Professor Clay. He attempted to kill Spectra due to Spectra's betrayal but failed due to Spectra's own determination for power. He lost the six fighting Bakugan to the Resistance in Reunion. In Revenge of the Vexos, he started brawling with Subterra Bakugan, using Dryoid when he is sent to obtain the Haos Energy from Baron's Mega Nemus, and succeeded. In Elfin On the Run, he teams up with Shadow Prove to try to obtain the Aquos Energy from Marucho and Aquos Minx Elfin and succeed in defeating Elfin, but lost to Preyas. Later, he battles Dan and Spectra at the Mother Palace, but loses to Helios and his new Battle Gear. In Volt's Revolt, after Volt leaves the Vexos, Zenoheld orders Hydron to deal with Volt. Volt defeats Hydron in a brawl, but Hydron starts to go insane and throws a dimensional grenade at Volt to send him to another dimension. He is almost pulled in with Volt, but escapes in the nick of time. In Payback, when Lync copies the plans for the Vexos' new Alternative Weapon system, Hydron follows Lync and defeats him in a brawl. He then throws another dimensional grenade at Lync to send him to the same dimension as Volt. When he returns, he is looking for his father's approval, but Zenoheld ignores Hydron blaming him for his minions' failures. This causes Hydron to face his father. When he does, he loses and is put in a cell across from a shadowed figure, which is possibly Gus from the figure's blue hair. In the next episode, it did turn out to be Gus, and they had a brief conversation before the opening. Gus later tricks Hydron, after a string of dog-related insults on Gus's part, into brawling with him. This breaks the doors on the cells releasing both. Before flying off, Gus says that he could have asked Hydron nicely but that would probably not work only further angering Hydron. He is later seen making his own, escape attempt on Dryoid. He makes it to the ship with the other Bakugan Brawlers. They forgive him and he is presumed that he was killed after ensuring that his father will not escape the blast from the ALternative's destruction. His last words were \\"Volt, Lync, I'll be there soon.\\" The blast occurred right after, so it is believed that he is dead. Mylene Pharaoh Mylene is the only female in the Vexos. She did not trust Spectra and enjoys doing things her way, but is still a loyal member of the Vexos. She becomes the leader of the Vexos after Spectra and Gus travel to Earth. However, King Zenoheld later became the ruler of the Vexos. Mylene used Aquos Elico as her main Bakugan, and Aquos Tripod Theta as her Trap Bakugan. She defeated Ace in episode 13. She enjoyed the power of being the leader of the Vexos and, like Spectra, is tired of Prince Hydron bossing her around all the time. She also gets annoyed easily by Shadow Prove, who will not stop following her everywhere she goes. In episode 20 she and Shadow Prove battled Dan and Baron in Beta City and were defeated when Drago unleashed the power of the Perfect Core. She escapes New Vestroia with Volt, Shadow, and Lync, saying that it could be destroyed by the battle between Spectra and Dan and their Bakugan, discarding her guardian Bakugan together with Volt's Haos Brontes, as she thinks that Bakugan with feelings are useless. She later flees to Vestal with the Vexos, Prince Hydron, and Professor Clay, leaving Spectra and Gus. She later duels Ace in order to obtain Percival's Darkus Energy wielding Aquos Macubass, but was defeated by Ace and Klaus. She than went to Earth with Lync to draw out the brawlers. They found Runo and Mira and battle them. Mylene defeats both Runo and Mira, thus gaining the Subterra energy. She later goes on to defeat Shun and Baron alongside Volt, taking the Ventus energy. After Zenoheld's announcement to create the Alternate Weapons System that would destroy both Vestal and Earth, she appears when Volt was about to leave, warning him about his idea. When he leaves, she wishes him luck, and appears saddened when she hears what happened. In episode 48, Mylene is ordered by Zenoheld to retrieve the Brawlers Battle Gear data and DNA code for the Alternative Weapons system. She is then lured into Bakugan Interspace with Shadow Prove by Keith and Mira, and is forced to battle. She no longer serves Zenoheld and has named herself a free agent. She loses to Mira and her mechanical Bakugan is destroyed. In the end, she rejects the Brawlers' offer to join them and instead throws a dimensional grenade at Keith and Mira. But after the grenade activated, Bakugan Interspace shut down, trapping her, Shadow Prove, Keith, and Mira inside. Marucho made a connection to bring them back, so Mira told Mylene and Shadow to come, but Mylene refuses to go. Mylene than got pull by the dimensional pull until Mira and Keith grabbed her hand, but accidentally let go her as Mira and Keith were teleported and Shadow grabbed Mylene's hand as they both were pulled in the dimensional portal. Her fate is unknown. Shadow Prove Shadow is a Darkus brawler. He is very childish and jester-like. When he starts a battle, he is very pompous. His Guardian Bakugan is Darkus Hades, who was created with Alpha Hydranoid's DNA, and he also has Darkus Fortress as a Trap Bakugan. Mylene described him as a child in episode 3, and then a hyena in episode 15. He has the ability to copy other people's voices as he tricked Ace and Marucho into falling for a trap by being the voice of Mira and Dan respectively. He has a habit of sticking his tongue out every time he talks or laughs. He defeated Shun in episode 15. In episode 20 he and Mylene battled Dan and Baron in Beta City and were defeated when Drago unleashed the power of the Perfect Core. He later flees to Vestal with the Vexos, Prince Hydron, and Professor Clay, leaving Spectra and Gus. But soon after, he is forced to leave Vestal with the other Vexos after the citizens of Vestal rally against Zenoheld and Hydron. Later when Spectra blocks the Vexos from teleporting to Vestal, Zenoheld sends Shadow to Earth to battle Alice to lure the Brawlers back to Earth. Shadow does stalk her disguised as a werewolf before she battles him. He loses his Darkus Hades against Alice and Chan Lee, but reveals his mechanical Bakugan Darkus MAC Spyder, and wins easily. In episode 35, he joins with Prince Hydron to battle Marucho for the Aquos attribute energy and succeeds upon defeating Elfin, but lost to Preyas. When the Resistance infiltrated the Mother Palace, Shadow and Lync fought Ace and Marucho, winning the battle and taking the Darkus energy. He is trapped in Bakugan Interspace along with Mylene, Keith and Mira. Shadow and Mylene are pulled into the dimensional portal while Mira and Keith were teleported back to Earth. Because of staying behind with Mylene, it could be guessed Shadow has an attraction towards her. His fate is unknown. Volt Luster Volt is a Haos attribute brawler. He used Haos Brontes as his Guardian Bakugan and Haos Dynamo as a Trap Bakugan. He and Lync Volan are the Vexos' tag team champions, although they do not get along well together. He gets defeated by Dan in Invasion of the Vestals, and then again in episode 9 by Ace and Shun in the Bakugan Battle Tournament. He defeats Marucho in episode 14. He is defeated by Baron in Wall To Wall Brawl, and in Ultimate Bakugan is shown with Mylene and Shadow as they hatched an escape plan. In Final Countdown, his Haos Brontes was thrown out by Mylene, together with her Aquos Elico, as she thinks that Bakugan with feelings are useless. Although he was furious, he still left without Brontes, proving Mira's theory that he is brainless. He later flees to Vestal with the Vexos, Prince Hydron, and Professor Clay, leaving Spectra and Gus. He makes his reappearance in Spectra Rises, at first challenging Dan and the brawlers still in possession of Elemental Energies, but backs when Spectra appears, and Gus taunts him by saying he stole Brontes' soul. It is shown Volt seems to believe in doing the honorable thing, saying, \\"I won't kick a man when he's down,\\" after Dan defeats Spectra, and seemingly weakened by the battle. Later, Volt challenges Gus to a brawl to win Brontes back, revealing his mechanical Bakugan Haos Boriates. However, he is defeated by Gus. In Samurai Showdown, Volt challenges Shun for the Ventus attribute energy. But Volt is defeated by the combined efforts of Shun and Baron. In Volt's Revolt Volt does not agree with King Zenoheld's plan to destroy all living things that stand up against him and returns home showing some of his past to the audience in the process. He is shortly thereafter confronted and challenged by Prince Hydron, Volt wins the ensuing Brawl then starts to leave not before scarring Hydron by telling Boriates to nearly crush him. As payback, Hydron throws a grenade in front of Volt, which opens a dimensional port beneath him, sending him into a far dimension. As Volt sinks into the portal, he vows that Hydron will get what's coming to him for all the suffering he has caused innocent people. Volt later appears in Hydron's dreams/hallucinations along with Lync in An Heir To Spare. His fate is unknown. Lync Volan Lync is a Ventus brawler. He used mechanical Ventus Altair as his Guardian Bakugan, and mechanical Ventus Wired as a Trap Bakugan. Altair and Wired are able to combine into Meta Altair. However, in Gate Crashers, Altair and Wired were damaged beyond repair, and did not brawl for the rest of the arc. He was a spy for Prince Hydron on Spectra and Gus. He and Volt Luster were the Vexos' tag team champions. He gets defeated by Dan in Invasion of the Vestals, and then again in episode 9 by Ace and Shun in the Bakugan Battle Tournament. He then gets defeated by Baron in episode 11. He went to Earth with Spectra, Gus, Dan, Mira, and Baron. He was stuck on Earth with Alice after rejecting Dan's hospitality. He is seen crying at the end of episode 11. Baron called him 'a little weasel' in episode 11. In the same episode, Gus calls him a snake. He has his Gauntlet taken away by Dr. Gehabich in order to fix his dimension transporter without Lync realizing it (although it would not have mattered, as his Bakugan were destroyed anyhow). Lync eventually makes it home after swearing loyalty to Spectra and when Prince Hydron asked him to spy on Spectra, Lync denies him and helps Spectra with his \\"ultimate plan\\". But he then betrays Spectra by locking up Gus so he cannot tell his master of Mylene's escape plan. It is obvious he will do whatever is best for him (going as far as to claim behind Hydron's back \\"You can count on me to do what's best for me.\\" He later openly admits that he's \\"very loyal to three people: me, myself and I\\" in conversation with Volt and the other Vexos), due to his multiple betrayals throughout the series. He later flees to Vestal with the Vexos, Prince Hydron, and Professor Clay, leaving Spectra and Gus. He reappears to battle Shun after Zenoheld launches a prototype for the Bakugan Termination System, but is defeated with the combined efforts of Skyress, and a newly evolved Ingram. In Earth Invaders, Lync and Mylene battle Runo and Mira and succeed in obtaining the Subterra attribute energy. He later brawls Ace and Marucho alongside Shadow, taking the Darkus energy. Lync does love Alice. It was this that finally caused him to leave the Vexos when Zenoheld declared that the alternative would be used to wipe out Vestal, Earth, New Vestroia (may have been a likely target as Zenoheld had a grudge against the Bakguan, although it was not mentioned in the list of targets) and anyone else that opposed him. After Volt's departure and \\"demise\\" at Hydron's hand, Lync copied the Blue Prints of the alternative to give to Alice (who would warn the resistance). He hesitates to speak to her, feeling guilty about his betrayal of her trust. However he resolves to speak to her. However Hydron appears on the scene (Professor Clay had discovered that Lync had made an unauthorised copy, which Mylene overheard him saying, she reported the incident to Zenoheld, who sent Hydron after Lync) and challenges him to a battle. Lync puts up a heroic and close fight but Aluze is destroyed by Dryoid and he is banished with a death bomb by Hydron (but not before throwing his glove with the data disk towards Alice's home, where she found it later outside, once the battle and its combantants had disappeared from the secene). Lync later appears in Hydron's dreams/hallucinations along with Volt in An Heir To Spare. His fate is unknown. =Twelve Order= Barodius / Mag Mel The central villain of the third season, and also a major villain in the fourth season (alongside Coredegon). The Emperor of Gundalia, leader of the Twelve Orders and also a Darkus Brawler. He was born to a family that has ruled Gundalia for a long time. He is the leader of the Twelve Orders that seek to conquer Neathia. He has been able to rule Gundalia due to his overwhelming strength and special ability to simultaneously execute battles. His sole desires are: to obtain the secret DNA Code from the Bakugan that possess it and create the most powerful Bakugan in the universe. His other goal is to take Neathia's Sacred Orb so he can rule the universe. His Bakugan partner is Dharak. Gill is his longtime childhood friend and most trusted confidant, but when Barodius found out that Gill killed Kazarina, he had Phantom Dharak destroy both Gill, Airzel, Stoica and their Bakugan. His quiet and calm demeanour masks his hot tempered and devious nature. He is highly arrogant but also highly intelligent. Barodius and Phantom Dharak have a final showdown with Dan and Drago and in the end, they lost to Dan and Drago. Refusing to admit defeat, Barodius and Phantom Dharak start to take the power of the Sacred Orb only for Code Eve to banish them inside a flip world of Bakugan Interspace, thus turning them into Mag Mel and Razenoid, although the Brawlers at first believed that the two had been killed after Dharak absorbed too much of the Sacred Orb's powers. From that point onwards, he kept his desire to take the Gate and Key to control the Mechtogan and Bakugan in existence. He was killed in \\"The Final Takedown\\". Kazarina Member of the Twelve Orders. She's a Haos Brawler. She is sly as she is cold-hearted and is always by Emperor Barodius' side. She works as the Director of the Bakugan Biological Research Center, where she secretly undergoes cruel living body experiments to heighten the abilities of Bakugan. Her goal is to develop abilities that will rival the Neathians. She is an exceptional scientist who has unraveled the mysteries of Bakugan evolution. She can also hypnotize others to do her bidding, as shown with Jake and Coredem. She is heartless and selfish, as she would sacrifice one of her own subordinates to use as a scapegoat without losing any sleep on it. Another example of her cruelty was shown in a battle before the series began, when she killed a number of Neathian soldiers, including the previous commander of the Castle Knights and Fabia's fianc√© Jin before capturing Aranaut and sadistically experimenting on him. Her Bakugan partner is Lumagrowl. Kazarina is killed by Gill in the middle of Broken Spell and her spell on everybody is broken. When Lumagrowl hears about Kazarina's death, he leaves in sadness. His final, mournful howl over her death is heard echoing. Gill Member of the Twelve Orders. He's a Pyrus Brawler. Gill is a calm, cool warrior who pledges his undying loyalty to Emperor Barodius. He had no parents when he was a child and was raised by the Emperor's family, seeing Barodius as an older brother. He will follow Barodius' orders without considering whether it is right or wrong. He is a teacher and trainer of Airzel, who shares a Spectra- Gus relationship with him. This relationship is also shown between him and Barodius, with Barodius in the \\"Spectra\\" role and Gill in the \\"Gus\\" role (reverse of his relationship with Airzel). It is shown that many times in the series he distrusts Kazarina, and he shares a mutual hatred with her, as well as fighting over Barodius's favor. His Bakugan is Krakix. He first appears in Revelation, where he and the rest of the Twelve Orders discuss on how powerful Drago truly is. In The Secret Package, he, Airzel, and Kazarina join their brainwashed battlers against the Neathian Castle Knights. In The Element, Gill reports to Emperor Barodius that their Gundalian forces took down the second shield and Neathia's front line. In The Sacred Orb, Gill and Krakix battle against Captain Elright and Raptorix, but as Drago and Dharak come face to face, the Sacred Orb teleports the Twelve Orders back to Gundalia. In Battle For the Second Shield, before Lena leaves for Neathia with Kazarina, Gill tells her to watch her back around Kazarina, for she is loyal to no one but herself and would think of nothing of sacrificing one of her subordinates to save herself. After reporting to Barodius, she runs into Gill, letting him know of Lena's betrayal, suggesting that someone may have told her what she had planned for her. Gill replies that she got lucky today, and that you never know who you can trust. In Partners 'Til the End, Gill and Ren planned on going to Neathia to take down the second shield, but Zenet disguised herself as Ren to redeem herself. But when Krakix thumped Ren (Zenet) on the head, she morphed back to her normal self. As she begged for a second chance, Gill allowed her to accompany him on this mission. Krakix took out the Castle Knights guarding the second shield. Then, Gill had Krakix scan the shield so they could destroy it on a molecular level. But when Shun and Hawktor swooped down on them, Gill had Zenet delay him while Krakix scanned the shield. But as Contestir was about to shoot down Hawktor, he tricked him and Zenet into hitting Krakix. Gill jumped in and as he was about to finish Shun and Hawktor, Dan and Drago arrived on the scene just in time. With the combined teamwork between Dan and Shun, Gill and Zenet lost and retreated. Because of the Brawlers' interference, they were only able to transfer 76% of data from the shield. Just as Gill was about to punish Zenet, Contest spoke up for her and suggested to Gill that he should have someone loyal only to him, to keep an eye on the other members of the Twelve Orders, and volunteered Zenet for the role. Convinced, Gill decides to try it out, so he has Zenet disguise herself as Nurzak to spy on Kazarina for him. Zenet reports back to Gill with information on Kazarina and Nurzak plotting to overthrow Barodius. Despite their excellent job, Gill and Krakix dispose of Zenet and Contestir, as they saw no further use for them. In Divide and Conquer, Gill informs Barodius of Nurzak and Kazarina's plot against him. As Gill volunteered to do away with these traitors, Barodius told him otherwise and that this information does not leave his room. Furious at Kazarina, Gill vows to take her down, one way or another. In Mobile Assault Dharak suggests that they keep the Neathians busy with a wave of attacks of brainwashed battlers. He, Stoica, and Airzel lead the attack against the Neathians. With 72% of Gundalian forces down, Gill orders the first battalion to fall back and the second to prepare to attack. He then asks Kazarina to resupply him with more battlers from Earth, so she has Ren go do it, and Gill has Stoica tag along with him. In Colossus Dharak, as Stoica battles Marucho and Jake, Gill steps in for support. In Dragonoid Colossus, Gill and Jake battle each other, both using their Battle Gear, but Krakix's Vicer proves to be stronger. When Linehalt unleashes his Forbidden Power, the Twelve Orders retreat back to Neathia. In Into the Storm, Gill and Krakix defeat the Castle Knights and attack the third shield, but the third shield has a DNA barrier, preventing Gundalians from passing through the shield. He then retreats back to Gundalia and reports his findings back to Emperor Barodius. In Infiltrated, Barodius orders Gill and Airzel to separate Dan from Marucho and Shun. Gill and Airzel begin to battle Marucho and Shun, who have fallen for their trap. When Gill is prepared to take on Shun, he surprises him by finishing off Airzel, but Gill defeats both Marucho and Shun. Before Gill and Airzel can take them away, Shun throws down a smoke ball, letting Shun and Marucho escape. In Final Strike, Kazarina informs Barodius that Drago's DNA can be spliced with Dharak's DNA so Dharak can evolve, which Gill protests against, for risking their greatest weapon, the Emperor's weapon, is too great a risk. But Emperor Barodius orders him to stand down. After Dharak evolves, Barodius promotes Kazarina to his #2, infuriating a demoted Gill. Barodius then orders him to come with him. After the Brawlers break into the castle, Barodius has Gill take care of them while he heads to Neathia with Lena, Zenet, and Jesse (who are brainwashed). Once in the castle, the Brawlers run into Gill. Krakix attacks them before they can even launch their Bakugan, leaving them vulnerable. Fortunately, Ren and Linehalt counter Gill's attack before it hits the Brawlers. The Brawlers then leave Gill to Ren. In Dream Escape, Ren leaves the battle to join Dan, Fabia, and Jake, but Gill follows him as well. As the Twelve Orders reunite, they prepare to attack the Brawlers. In Gundalian Showdown, Gill, Kazarina, Stoica, and Airzel battle against the Brawlers. Just as it seems that Gill has defeated Drago, he comes out unscratched. Drago defeats him with Spire Dragon, as well as Stoica and Airzel, but not Kazarina. After the Brawlers leave for Neathia, Gill orders Stoica and Airzel to follow them. He did not go because \\"his ship was damaged by the Brawlers\\". In Broken Spell, Kazarina, looking for her sword, finds Gill, holding her sword. Gill says they need to talk about things, but Kazarina just scolds him to stay in his place. Then Gill, using Kazarina's sword, kills Kazarina, telling her to watch what she says, for words have consequences. In Code Eve, Gill and Krakix, having spotted Fabia, Nurzak, and Mason, try to keep them from returning to Neathia, but they escape on Nurzak's ship. Just as he makes it to Neathia, Gill apologizes to Emperor Barodius for being late and tells him that Kazarina was taken down in battle by Fabia. But Barodius knows it was he who finished off Kazarina. For his betrayal, Barodius has Phantom Dharak attack Gill, along with Airzel and Strikeflier, who try to protect him, but are all killed. Airzel Member of the Twelve Orders. He's a Ventus Brawler. Emperor Barodius and Gill recruited Airzel to be a warrior, and Airzel continues his battle training with Gill. He lurks in the shadows, to protect Barodius who chose him personally to be part of the 'Twelve Orders'. Airzel is the leading expert in enemy surveillance and information analysis. He always takes matters seriously, which causes him to be annoyed by Stocia's laid-back personality. Airzel is the #1 trainer on the Special Bakugan Team. His Bakugan partner is Strikeflier. He is fierce, confident, and reckless. He first appears in Revelation, where he and the rest of the Twelve Orders discuss on how powerful Drago truly is. In The Secret Package, he, Gill, and Kazarina join the brainwashed battlers from Earth against the Neathian Castle Knights. After sending Linus to Earth with the Element, Elright is confronted by Airzel, asking him where the Element is. In The Element, Airzel reports to Emperor Barodius that they had captured Captain Elright, but his interrogation has not been successful. In The Sacred Orb, Airzel battles against Shun, and having blended in with the surroundings, gained the upper hand. Just as Drago and Dharak are about to face each other, the Sacred Orb teleports the Twelve Orders back to Gundalia. In Decoy Unit, Airzel volunteers to attack Neathia and take down the third shield, taking Mason with him too, as a chance to redeem himself. With their Gundalian forces and battlers from Earth, Airzel and Mason battle against Marucho and Jake. When the battle gets intense, Marucho and Akwimos trap Strikeflier and Avior in a block of ice, with Marucho and Jake escaping Airzel and Mason. In Mobile Assault, Gill, Stoica, and Airzel lead a front line of brainwashed battlers against the Neathians. In Colossus Dharak, Airzel and Strikeflier battle Shun and Hawktor, but when Fabia intervenes, Kazarina steps in to help Airzel. In Dragonoid Colossus, Airzel and Shun continue their battle, both using Battle Gear. Just as Hawktor takes out Lumagrowl, Strikeflier sneaks up on him and Shun and finish them off. When Linehalt unleashes his Forbidden Power, the Twelve Orders retreat back to Gundalia. In Infiltrated, Emperor Barodius orders Gill and Airzel to separate Dan from Marucho and Shun. Gill and Airzel begin to battle Marucho and Shun, who have fallen for their trap. When Gill is prepared to take on Hawktor, he finishes off Airzel, but Gill defeats both Marucho and Shun. Before Gill and Airzel can take them away, Shun throws down a smoke ball, letting Shun and Marucho escape. In Final Strike, Airzel takes on Marucho as the Brawlers make their way to Dan. In Gundalian Showdown, Gill, Kazarina, Stoica, and Airzel battle the Brawlers to keep them from leaving Gundalia, but are all defeated by Drago's Spire Dragon, all but Kazarina. Just as the Brawlers take their leave, Stoica and Airzel prepare to leave for Neathia, but when Stoica wonders where Gill is, Airzel tells him that the Brawlers damaged his ship and told them to go on ahead. In Broken Spell, Stoica and Airzel reach Neathia, keeping Dan and Shun away from Barodius. After Kazarina's spell breaks, Stoica reveals that on the way to his ship, he saw Airzel and Gill talking about Kazarina. Airzel admits to Stoica that it was Gill that killed Kazarina, not Fabia, with Barodius listening in on them, thanks to Stoica's speakerphone being on. In Code Eve, Airzel realizes that Barodius was listening in on his conversation with Stoica, who had his speakerphone on. Just as Dharak prepares to attack Gill, Airzel and Strikeflier fly to his ship to protect him, but are killed along with Gill by Dharak's attack. Stoica Member of the Twelve Orders. He's an Aquos Brawler. He has a split personality: one of an angel, the other the devil, which can change in a second, so turning your back on him is a very bad idea. Stoica is usually calm and pompous, but when he is irritated, he will need a lot to calm him down. Stoica has many trick moves during battle and opponents have a hard time reading him. He has saved Gundalia many times with ingenious battling abilities. He is the youngest member of the Twelve Orders. His Bakugan partner is Lythirus. He is the only member of the Twelve Orders to show his human form. He first appears in Revelation, where he and the rest of the Twelve Orders discuss on how powerful Drago truly is. In The Sacred Orb, Stoica and Lythirius battle Marucho and Akwimos in the water. Just as Drago and Dharak are about to face each other, the Sacred Orb teleports the Twelve Orders back to Gundalia. In The Secret Switch, Stoica and Jesse find Dan, Shun, and Fabia in the jungle, wondering why they are even there in the first place. As Shun flees the scene, Stoica lets Jesse and Plitheon take on Fabia and Aranaut, but loses to them. Anxious and impatient, Stoica and Lythirius enter the battle. As he keeps taunting Dan, Stoica realizes that Dan and Shun switched Drago and Hawktor around. Even with Razoid, Stoica and Jesse both lose to Dan and Fabia. In Curtain Call, as he and Kazarina try to blame each other for loss of the second shield, Stoica suggests they blame Jesse for their mistakes. Unfortunately, Jesse has escaped, so he sends Ren to go retrieve him. After losing to Fabia and Jake, Ren returns to Gundalia with Jesse for Kazarina and Stoica. Just as they are about to dispose of Jesse, Plitheon speaks out of wanting to leave Jesse. However, Lumagrowl and Lythirius subdue Plitheon for turning on his partner. After disposing of Plitheon, Kazarina and Stoica do the same with Jesse. While walking down the hall, planning their report for Barodius, Kazarina and Stoica run into Nurzak, who tells them that they may be able to fool the others, he can see them for who they really are. In Mobile Assault, Gill, Stoica, and Airzel lead a front line of brainwashed battlers against the Neathians. Then, Gill has Stoica go to Earth to recruit more battlers from Earth. In Bakugan Interspace, Stoica and Ren, in their human forms, go to recruit new battlers, but Stoica leaves Ren to do the recruiting, while he goes searching for battlers in Bayview City. He then follows Koji, a battler, and persuades him into coming with him to Gundalia, so Kazarina can brainwash him (Koji having no clue of Stoica's intentions, merely that he was going to get a chance to have a brawl). In Colossus Dharak, Stoica takes on Marucho and Jake, but Gill steps in. In Dragonoid Colossus, Stoica is seen battling against Marucho, with both Lythirius and Akwimos using their Battle Gears. Thanks to Razoid, Stoica and Lythirius beat Marucho and Akwimos. Then, just as Linehalt unleashes his Forbidden Power, the Twelve Orders retreat back to Gundalia. In Redemption, Kazarina and Stoica confront Fabia and Nurzak and engage in battle with them. As Kazarina and Stoica press on the attack with their Battle Gears, the ground under Fabia and Nurzak crumble, with them falling. They then find Fabia and Nurzak to survive their fall, thus continuing their battle. Just as they have got the upper hand, Stoica has Lythirius flood the battlefield, forcing Kazarina, Lena, Zenet, and Jesse (the last three being brainwashed) to retreat. With Fabia and Nurzak to himself, Stoica, now underwater, blasts them, sending Nurzak down the current. In Final Strike, Stoica and Lythirius knock Shun, Hawktor and Fabia to the ground as they are trying to reach Dan's location. Fabia leaves Stoica to Shun. In Gundalian Showdown, Gill, Kazarina, Stoica, and Airzel battle the Brawlers to keep them from leaving Gundalia, but are all defeated by Drago's Spire Dragon, all but Kazarina. Just as the Brawlers take their leave, Stoica and Airzel prepare to leave for Neathia, but Stoica stops to wonder where Gill is. Airzel tells him that his \\"ship was damaged when the Brawlers attacked and said to go on ahead\\", making Stoica suspicious. In Broken Spell, Stoica and Airzel reach Neathia, keeping Dan and Shun away from Barodius. After Kazarina's spell breaks, Stoica reveals that on the way to his ship, he saw Airzel and Gill talking about Kazarina. Airzel admits to Stoica that it was Gill that killed Kazarina, not Fabia, with Barodius listening in on them, thanks to Stoica's speakerphone being on. In Code Eve, Airzel realizes that Barodius was listening in on his conversation with Stoica, who had his speakerphone on. Stoica and Lythirius attack Dragonoid Colossus with acid bubbles in his eyes, blinding him in the process. But Dharak attacks Dragonoid Colossus with Stoica and Lythirius still on him, killing them all. =Chaos Army= Anubias Anubias was the leader of the team of the same name and an artificial creation of Barodius whose appearance resembled that of a Gundalian. He was a Darkus Brawler. Anubias was a competitive brawler willing to fight at any challenge. While not entirely a bad person, he looked down on those with weakness or excuses. He appeared to have a want to destroy Dan. Mag Mel absorbed and killed him in \\"Unfinished Business\\". He was mourned over by Noah and Dan, who vowed that Mag Mel would not get away with what he'd done. Sellon Sellon was the leader of the team of the same name, and was artificial creation of Barodius that resembled the appearance of a Neathian. She was a Ventus Brawler. Sellon had a mysterious personality and serious attitude towards brawling. She loved style and grace in a battle, and lived by honor. Unlike most Neathians, whose form is mainly blue and white, Sellon's is black, with tentacle like hair. She also has 6 eye looking adornments on her chest, much like the Chaos Bakugan. At the end of \\"Dangerous Beauty\\", she stole Dan's key and gave it to Mag Mel but was then absorbed and was violently killed by him. Secondary characters = _Allies_ = Gus Grav (Japanese); Crispin Freeman (English) Gus was the Vexos' second strongest player, a Subterra brawler and devoted all his free time to training. He used Subterra Primo Vulcan as his main Bakugan and Hexados as his Trap Bakugan. He only answers to Spectra. He is said to be a weasel throughout the series, and \\"Spectra's little pet\\" and \\"Spectra's lapdog\\" by the other members of the Vexos, like MyleneNew Vestroia episode 5 and Lync.New Vestroia episode 11 He was shown to be fond of the different things on Earth such as 'juice in boxes', but the planet made him uncomfortable. In episode 5, it was shown that before he joined the Vexos, he battled Spectra in the finals of the Bakugan Battle Tournament and lost. He was then offered a place in the Vexos by Spectra, where he gladly accepted. He admired Spectra a great deal and he felt that Spectra must be respected at all cost. He was shown to hate Lync because of his cheekiness. When the Vestal Palace was self-destructing, he gathered Elico and Brontes who were thrown into the ship chamber and saved Spectra and Cyborg Helios. He did not return to Vestal, but he lived with Spectra in the ship. Gus later was challenged by Volt to a battle, but won with Brontes. After the battle, he returned to Spectra, but not before tossing Brontes through the teleporter back to New Vestroia. In Avenging Spectra, Gus took King Zenoheld hostage and then battled him but when he used his attack Aquos Blast Elico (formerly used by Maylene) sacrificed himself for Gus then later in the battle Hexados sacrificed himself for Subterra Rex Vulcan then both Gus and Rex Vulcan fall defeated in battle. Since then, Spectra had vowed to avenge him. Gus was thought to have died until 10 episodes later, when it was later revealed that he survived and was placed in a cell, though how he survived was not explained. He later escaped and helped Spectra battle Zenoheld who was trying to stop Zenoheld's new weapon. Gus later made a comeback in Mechtanium Surge, though he only appeared in Episodes 25 and 26, where he teamed up with Spectra to defeat Mag Mel's Chaos Bakugan. Linus Claude A Pyrus brawler and Castle Knight from Neathia. When the Gundalians break through the second shield, Captain Elright sends Linus to Earth to give him the Element within his partner, Pyrus Neo Zip Zam. When he arrives, he meets Shun, who thinks he is Gundalian at first but realizes his is Neathian after Jesse and Ren challenge them to a battle, saying that any friend of Fabia's is a friend of his. Despite Zip Zam's power, they are both overwhelmed by Jesse and Zip Zam is taken. Linus, injured, it taken back to the brawlers while Dan heads out to win back Zip Zam. However, during that battle, Zip Zam gives the Element to Drago and subsequently dies. Zip Zam appears one final time in Linus' dream to say goodbye. Though saddened by the loss of his partner, Linus accepts that is it what he would have wanted. He returns to Neathia with the Brawlers. Much later in the series, Pyrus Rubanoid, Sid Arkale's partner before he died, accepts Linus as his new partner. Elright Elright is the Captain of the Neathian forces. He is captured by Airzel and interrogated but promptly escapes in time to join Fabia in battle. He is usually found fighting against the Gundalians or debriefing the brawlers on their next mission. In Mechtanium Surge, Elright is still the captain of the Castle Knights and is the one who leads them to aid Gundalia. Elright has become partners with Haos Aranaut and the two fought together against the chaos bakugan on Gundalia. Nurzak A former member of the Twelve Orders who is a Subterra Brawler, and the oldest Gundalian living, as he served Barodius's father (the previous Emperor), he is a scholarly and wise intellectual. Despite being the oldest of the Twelve Orders, he has the most physical energy. He is the #1 officer of the Twelve Orders and is very good at analyzing the opponent, planning strategy and evaluating the situation. His Bakugan partner is Sabator. In \\"Mechtanium Surge\\", he is now the first Prime Minister of Gundalia. Kato Marucho's butler. He has always helped the Brawlers, and flies Marucho anywhere. Hal-G once tried to trick the brawlers by impersonating Kato, but Shun found out when he did not say \\"Master Marucho.\\" He is also very polite. Kato also appears many times in Bakugan: New Vestroia assisting the Brawlers once again (even when Marucho is not there). Kato appears in the 1st and 2nd season. He did appear in the 10 episode in season 3. He also appears in Mechtanium Surge at the end of the episode Back in Sync with Marucho's father at the end of Marucho's battle with Jack and praises Marucho on his battle. Near the end of the series, he was going to take Mira, Runo, and Julie to meet up with Dan and the others, but is killed when Bakugan City is wiped off the map by Mechtavius Destroyer. However, thanks to the surviving Nonents sacrificing themselves, Dan, Shun, and Marucho are able to use the Current of Time to travel back and prevent Kato's death by destroying Mechtavius Destroyer for good. Top Brawlers The Top Brawlers are the top five Bakugan Battle Brawlers who were mind-controlled by Masquerade and Naga to take out Dan Kuso's group.

In New Vestroia, he owns Condo Apartments and is in the condo business shown on Vestal in episode 29, having moved to Vestal to maintain his business there with Sirenoid.

She found out about Bakugan when she was cleaning Dan's room. Mrs. Kuso found a Bakugan ball on a table, dropped it and it turned out to be a Pyrus Griffon. She soon feared something was going on when Dan gave her a frog keychain for her birthday only to not come home afterward and asks Runo and even Masquerade.

In New Vestroia, Dan calls her in episode 12 when he returns to Earth. In episode 14 when Dan comes into the house she goes over to hug him only to be greeted by Baron, who she called a sweetie.

Before sleeping, she waited to see Shun. After Shun thinks his mom is dead the doctor says she is just tired which turned out to be true. After Shun's initial relief, he finds a Bakugan in his mother's hand; this turned out to be Skyress, a strong and rare Bakugan. She gave this to Shun because she knew that Shun was interested in Bakugan not in ninja lessons. It is unknown if she is alive. Skyress was given to Shun to look after him since she cannot look after him herself. When Oberus gave Shun his test, she used an illusionary form of a young Shun's Mother who always wanted to play with Shun, the final game she wanted to play with him, was Bakugan. She made Shun almost wanted to stay with her since he wanted his mother to be healthy again and he wanted to stay with her. Shun's Grandfather He wants Shun to be a ninja, not a Bakugan player.

He is first seen in Moscow with Alice, fixing the gate to New Vestroia. When he tests it by sending a Russian doll, it fails to teleport he tries it with a Gate Card and it teleports. However, unknown to him or Alice, it sent thousands of gate cards into New Vestroia, one which is caught by Spectra and given to Professor Clay. Later Michael used the technology of Lync's gauntlet to fix the gate thus preventing Alice, Runo and Julie from going to New Vestroia along with Dan and Baron, as they did not have gauntlets which were required to be able to enter. Ben Gehabich Alice's uncle. Clara Gehabich Alice's aunt. Mrs. Brown Joe's mother. Maron Leltoy Baron Leltoy's younger sister and the second oldest of the Letloy siblings.

However, the Emperor of Gundalia uses his Bakugan Dharak to break down the shield to steal and absorb the energy's power. Serena's biggest challenge is to keep Neathia running smooth and keep the people calm and safe while waiting for Fabia and the Brawlers to help take down Barodius. In \\"Mechtanium Surge\\", she is revealed to be the Ambassador of Neathia and Gundalia. In order for this to happen, she resigned as Queen, thus giving the throne to Fabia. =Enemies= Gundalian Agents =Sid Arkale= Sid Arkale was a Pyrus brawler from Gundalia. He is partnered with Pyrus Rubanoid and his Battle Gear is Destrakon Gear. Sid has a feeling of doubt like he does not think Emperor Barodius's decision to let Ren handle the Battle Brawlers is a good idea. He first appears in \\"Revelation\\" with Lena Isis battling against Dan and Marucho. Although they managed to defeat Marucho, they lose to Dan and Drago with his Level 2 Battle Gear. In \\"Confrontation\\", after he failed to recruit new kids for the Gundalians, Sid battles alongside Zenet Surrow against Dan and Ren and beat them, but was later told to leave the Battle Brawlers to Ren. In \\"Hostile Takeover\\", Sid battles with Casey, a brainwashed kid, against Marucho and Jake, but loses. In \\"The Element\\", Sid steals a sealed Neo Zipzam from Ren, who tries to take it back, and he decides to battle Dan, but after throwing Neo onto the arena, he loses the battle to a newly evolved Drago. After retreating back to Gundalia, Rubanoid attempts to attack Emperor Barodius, but is struck down by Krakix and taken away by Kazarina for research. After Ren pleads mercy from the Emperor, Sid faces is fate as the Emperor disposes of him. In \\"Sid Returns\\", Sid, who awakes from a deep sleep, finds himself, Lena, Jesse and Zenet trapped in Kazarina's Lab. As Sid escapes her lab, he sees Ren alongside Gundalian soldiers running towards Gundalian transport ships. As Dan and Ren battle each other, Sid, disguised as a Gundalian soldier, joins the battle alongside Ren, but loses. After catching up with Ren, Sid is fired on by Dharak, but is saved by Ren. He then hands Rubanoid to Ren and releases his grip, falling to his death. In \\"Forgiveness\\", Sid was mentioned and shown in a flashback while Ren was battling Fabia with Rubanoid to join the Battle Brawlers or stay with the Gundalians. It is unknown if Sid survived his fall from the cliff. Unlike most Gundalian brawlers, Sid was barely seen in his Gundalian form throughout the series. =Lena Isis= Lena Isis is an Aquos brawler from Gundalia. She is partnered with Aquos Phosphos and his Battle Gear is Terrorcrest. She is an intelligent, strategic brawler and is calm, and collective in a battle. She is also clever and does not suffer from arrogance like her teammates. She first appears in \\"Revelation\\" alongside Sid Arcale against Dan and Marucho, but both lose to Drago because of his Level 2 Battle Gear. In \\"Confrontation\\", she and Mason manage to recruit some top-ranked brawlers by using their non-Guardian Bakugan and lose, thus proving they are powerful brawlers. They then bring the two kids back to Gundalia, in which Kazarina hypnotizes them. In \\"Escape From Darkness\\", she and Zenet battle Fabia and Avatar Marucho. Lena was clever enough to realize that Marucho's Aranaut was a digital clone, but did not realize that Marucho was an avatar, not until Ren put his and Marucho's conversation on the arena's big screen, letting Lena and Zenet that they are battling a clone. After that, Lena and Zenet defeat the Avatar Marucho and Fabia. They then try to take Fabia back to Gundalia, but escape Bakugan Interspace when Marucho arrives. In \\"The Sacred Orb\\", Ren, Lena, Zenet, Mason, and Jesse, in their true forms, were being talked down to by the Twelve Orders. Before heading for Neathia in \\"Battle For the Second Shield\\", Lena is warned by Gill to watch her back around Kazarina, for she is loyal to no one but herself and would think nothing of sacrificing one of her subordinates to save herself. Once on Neathia, she, alongside Kazarina, battle against Shun and Drago, but lose when Dan and Hawktor arrive. After retreating back to Gundalia, Lena and Phosphos attempt to ambush Kazarina, knowing she would sell her out to save herself, but her plan fails when Lumagrowl takes down Phosphos and Kazarina finishes her off. She is then seen unconscious in \\"Sid Returns\\", along with Sid, Zenet, and Jesse. In \\"Redemption\\", Ren and Mason sneak into Kazarina's Lab to rescue Lena, Zenet, and Jesse, but find that no one is inside. As she is battling against Fabia and Nurzak, Kazarina reveals a surprise to them: Lena, Zenet, and Jesse, all hypnotized. But once Stoica has Lythirius flood the battlefield, Kazarina has Lumagrowl retreat, along with Lena, Zenet, and Jesse. In \\"Dream Escape\\" and \\"Gundalian Showdown\\", Emperor Barodius brings Zenet, Jesse, and Lena with him as he invades Neathia and has them fight the Castle Knights. In \\"Broken Spell\\", they fight against the Brawlers just as they return to Neathia. But when Gill kills Kazarina, her spell is broken and Lena, Zenet, and Jesse are finally free. After the Brawlers fill them in on everything that has happened up until now, they decide to join them and fight against the Emperor. In \\"Code Eve\\", Ren and his teammates prepare for their attack on the Emperor. But their plan fails as Phosphos is strucken down by Phantom Dharak. =Mason Brown= An agent from Gundalia. He's a Subterra Brawler. In episode 4, he battled a random kid with a Raptorix and won. He then defeated Jake and later lost on the second match of him and Jake. In episode 5, he and Lena Isis lost to two top-ranked players while using their non-Guardian Bakugan to test their strength. The kids were then brought back to the Twelve Orders and hypnotized by Kazarina in order to recruit them. In episode 8, he faces Dan Kuso and Shun Kazami in a tag brawl with Taylor. He lost this battle even with his Battle Gear. In Episode 14, he makes a small appearance along with all of Ren's crew getting chewed out because the brawlers have joined Neathia. In episode 15, he revealed his actual form and tagged with Airzel against Marucho and Jake. It ended in a tie after Marucho and Jake fled the battle after Marucho used Akwimos's last ability, which froze Avior and Strikeflier, distracting the two Gundalians. He and Ren have a strange password they use. Mason starts by saying \\"Why does Barodius wear suspenders?\\" and Ren answers \\"To keep his pants up.\\" =Zenet Surrow= An agent from Gundalia. She's a Haos Brawler. She first appeared in episode 5, and battled against Dan Kuso and Ren Krawler alongside Sid Arcale. She managed to defeat Ren and Dan, but ended up sacrificing Contestir to negate Drago's Battle Gear. In episode 7, she teases Ren by saying \\"Aw, how adorable,\\" because he made friends with the Brawlers and that he forgot who he is and he said that she and the other moles work for him. In episode 10, she and Lena Isis battled Fabia and Avatar Marucho. She did not do much since Lena did most of the battle. She managed to take down the digital clone Aranaut and Avatar Marucho. After the battle, she suggested taking Fabia as a hostage, and upon approaching Fabia, she was thrown to the ground. In episode 13, she disguised herself as Julie Makimoto to try to steal Drago. She told Dan to give Drago to her, but the real Julie showed up. Zenet then revealed her identity, removing her disguise and battles Dan and for first time on Earth outside of Bakugan Interspace, but lost. In episode 14, Zenet, along with the members of the Minor Twelve Orders, was shown in her true form. =Jesse Glenn= An agent from Gundalia. Talks and dresses like an actor or poet. He's a Ventus Brawler. Jesse first appears in episode 5 battling kids and then kidnapping them and bringing them back to Gundalia. In episode 6, he brawls against Fabia Sheen. He was supposed to battle Dan Kuso but Fabia intervenes and brawls in Dan's place. Fabia was about to win until an error in the arena that Ren created (intended for Dan and Drago) affected Fabia and Aranaut, costing her the win. After Ren was revealed to be the enemy, Jesse left, but even after that, Ren still called Jesse a Neathian. In episode 11, he battled alongside Ren, against Shun and Linus. He is strong showing that he defeated Linus and Shun all by himself. He reappeared in episode 16 alongside Stoica to fight Dan and Fabia. However he and Stoica lose to Dan and Fabia. Team Anubias Team Anubias is a Bakugan team in Bakugan Interspace led by Anubias (who is under Mag Mel's orders). So far, only 4 members were seen and it seems like Team Anubias is composed of only male Brawlers.

He's a Pyrus Brawler. =Jack Punt= Jack is the youngest member of Team Anubias. He's an Aquos Brawler. =Robin= Robin is the quiet member of Team Anubias.

She helps Julie and Billy defeat Tricloid with her Ravenoid. =Akira= Akira is Shuji's younger brother and Nene's older brother. For most of the series, he is by Shuji's side but much later he brawls Dan and Runo alongside Shuji and Nene. He uses Subterra and his Guardian is a Centipoid. =Shuji= A brawler who uses Darkus and many different Bakugan types and kept on losing to Dan since episode 1. In the Gundalian Invaders's premiere, Shuji can be seen. His Guardian is Fear Ripper. =Ms. Purdy= Dan's class teacher. =Rikimaru= A wanna-be brawler who sought power to become the strongest brawler. In episode 3, Masquerade promised to give him such power using the Doom card. In brawler battle, he lost to Dan and his creatures. He's also another clich√© villain that acts mysteriously. =Ryo= A brawler who preferred to plan for Bakugan strategies than actual battles, he fought against Dan in episode 4 after Dan had teased Ryo for his method. With Masquerade's help, Ryo was able to defeat Dan using Bakugan with lower G power, but lost to Dan in a rematch. =Tatsuya= Tatsuya appeared in episode 5 when Runo found Dan's Baku- Pod. On the Baku-Pod was a message from Masquerade to meet him at the river at 3:00, Runo decided to go fight Masquerade, but instead of Masquerade was Tatsuya and he lost to her. He uses Pyrus Bakugan and is a bully to the local kids but most of the time instead of brawling them he just harasses them and talks a lot more than he fights. Tatsuya's Guardian Bakugan is a Pyrus Fear Ripper. His Pyrus Mantris and Stinglash was sent to the Doom Dimension by Masquerade's Centipoid easily. =Kenta and Kenji= : Kenta : Kenji They are twin brothers and magician team. They look exactly each other, except Kenta has red hair while Kenji has purple. They were recruited by Masquerade to tag brawl against Runo and Dan, who had never dueled as a team before. They lose after Dan and Runo figure out a strategy but they were winning early in the game since Runo and Dan were fighting and both had separate strategies but after Kenta lost a round he became more impulsive and didn't listen to Kenji's advice. It was also shown that Kenta taught Kenji how to play Bakugan. They use Pyrus and Darkus and their Guardians are Robotallion and Mantris. =JJ Dolls= : Jenny : Jewels and Stevie Vallance (52) Jenny and Jewels both enjoy playing Bakugan, but their manager wants them to focus on their career. Jenny's Guardian Bakugan is Aquas Siege and Jewels Guardian Bakugan is Subterra Centipoid. They both brawl against Dan and Marucho under Masquerade's orders and later against Taygen alongside Marucho. In Bakugan: New Vestroia they can be seen on a large TV screen in the background during episodes 1 and 37. =Miu and Makoto= : Miu : Makoto Shown in Episode 9. They are shown to love Bakugan, so Takashi and Kosuke taught him how to brawl. Their parents separated and now they live in different parts of the world but they were reunited after Runo and Marucho beat Kosuke and Takashi. Makoto met with Dan at an airport after hearing Drago talk before he left to reunite with Miu. Miu is shown to miss him to the point of crying and called for quitting the match. =Takashi and Kosuke= : Takashi : Kosuke They are brothers and friends to Miu and Makoto and taught him how to play. When they see Miu upset that she hasn't seen her brother yet, Masquerade tells them if they can defeat the Battle Brawlers, he will reunite Miu with her brother. They brawl Runo and Marucho but relinquishes the Doom Card when Miu starts crying. They then play them again and lose, though they were glad they had fun. Miu then gives them both a kiss on the cheek for trying to help her. He brawls using Pyrus and Darkus Bakugan. =Christopher= A seven-year-old child that never won at Bakugan until Alice trained him. In episode 24, Christopher was seen by Alice when she was shopping by the lake about to throw his Bakugan into it. Alice tries to stop him, but accidentally pushes him into it. Alice tries to help him beat his rival Travis. After Alice taught him how to be a better battler, Christopher beat Travis in a battle. He may have a crush on Alice. Christopher also tries to help Alice fight Rabeeder, alongside Klaus, whom he idolizes. He gained many helpful tips from Klaus and he was able to help Klaus win since Alice's Alpha Hydranoid was being encased in crystal at the time. He helps fight a Haos/Subterra hybrid with Alice in episode 47. His guardian is a Juggernoid. =Travis= A Darkus Brawler and a bully who picks on Christopher daily and forces him to battle just to make him lose at Bakugan so that Travis can look good. Until Christopher is helped by Alice, Travis always won. He then stopped picking on Christopher after he lost. His main Bakugan is a Mantris. Season 2 =Vestal Security= They are guards that the former King Zenoheld and Professor Clay had at the Vexos Motherpalace. They are first seen in episode 27. In episode 40, they chased Dan Kuso and Mira Clay while they sneaked into the Motherpalace. Other guards appear different in the Vestal cities. One of them has the same voice actor as the intercom that says \\"Field, Open!\\" in Interspace. Many personal was protecting the three cities. =Dark Angels= : Annie : Vanessa They are a tag team that battled Shun and Ace in the semifinal rounds of the Alpha city tournament. Both members use Haos. It is implied they are friends, or maybe even twin sisters. Their Guardians are Anchorsaur and Hammersaur. =Brandon= A minor Battle Brawler in the first season but appeared in the second one, in the theme park where the Resistance went to. He is an Aquos Brawler and fought against Naga's Bakugan. His guardian is a Juggernoid. =Agonizer= A torture machine appeared in episode 49, when Zenoheld got angry on Prince Hydron for not retrieving the Phantom Data and the other Brawlers on his side failing him. Zenoheld used the Agonizer to torture Hydron, thus punishing him for his actions. Season 3 =Koji Beetle= He first appeared in episode 3 unnamed. After meeting Fabia and asked by her if he got her message, he lied saying he did to get her attention. She then challenged him to a brawl, to know if he really did get it. Because Koji undermestiated her he lost. He reappears in episode 22, trying to get into Bakugan Interspace. Julie stops him, however, and tells him about the Gundalian-Neathian war. He leaves, thinking her story is too farfetched and is approached by Stoica who convinces him to go to Gundalia where he is quickly brainwashed by Kazarina. He battle Fabia and Dan with the Mobile Assault Vehicle and nearly wins, but loses when Drago uses his own Mobile Assault Vehicle. He is returned to Earth and wakes up in Bakugan Interspace, having no memory of what transpired. He tells Julie about what happened and vaguely remembers Dan's voice telling him about not give up on him. =Casey and Taylor= : Casey : Taylor Two brawlers who were kidnapped by the Gundalians.

Like Casey & Taylor, they're a Ventus/Darkus Team. Their Bakugan were Volt Elezoid, Longfly, Ramdol, & Ziperator. =Baroduis' Father= The former Emperor of Gundalia. Barodius disliked him for fearing the powers of the Sacred Orb and also called him a \\"superstitious old fool\\" for this. From what is indicated during Nurzak and Barodius' conversation, Barodius' Father was a kind and caring ruler, sovereign/monarch to his people and not a power crazy tyrant like Barodius. =Jin= Fabia's deceased fianc√© and Aranaut's original partner. He was killed by Kazarina in a battle and she took Aranaut back to Gundalia. Meanwhile, Fabia snuck on to Gundalia and rescued him, and the two became partners.

But in episode 35, Aranaut revealed he never forgot about Jin and he was lying the whole time to not hurt Fabia. =Robin= A young boy who was kidnapped by the Gundalians. He is used by Kazarina to bring Jake into a trap in episode 27. After that, he and other kids who were kidnapped by Gundalians return to the Earth. Like others, they lose their memories. He is said to have a sister. =Floria= Nurzak's deceased daughter. Apparently, Nurzak had preferred battling in the front over making strategies in the back. Because of his attitude, when he led a group of soldiers, which included Floria, on an attack, they were killed in battle. It is likely that because of Floria's death, Nurzak favored strategizing before making an attack. While telling Fabia this story, he mentions that she reminds him of Floria. After saving Fabia from being carried away by the water, he has a vision of Floria while being carried away himself. He apologizes for not being able to protect her, but he is glad that he managed to save Fabia. =Code Eve= The Mother Light of all Bakugan, who was inside the Sacred Orb. She created the first two bakugan the Genesis Dragonoid who created Vestroia and was the ancestor to the bakugan who resides there and was Drago direct ancestor and the Daraknoid who was the ancestor to the Bakugan of Neathia and Gundalia and was the direct ancestor to Darak. Season 4 =Dylan= Dylan appears to be some sort of dealer inside Bakugan Interspace. He is seen licking a blue and yellow striped lollipop. Both the Brawlers and Team Anubias find him quite annoying. In episode 20 \\"True Colours\\", it was revealed that he was actually a collection of data in human form created by Bakugan Interspace to cater to the desire of brawlers for more intense battles. In episode 23 he helps for Marucho to send a message for his dad. =Sion and Lucas, the Tri- Twisters= Sion: Lucas: Their first appearance is in episode 5, where Mag Mel decides to give these two boys Chaos Bakugan (Cyclone Percivals) and are brainwashed into doing his bidding after they are defeated by Anubias. They soon challenge the Brawlers, but instead of the entire members of the Brawlers showing up, Shun and Marucho decide to take them on without Dan's help. The Tri-Twisters use some underhanded tactics making it seem like the Brawlers didn't have a chance. It is soon shown that the Tri-Twisters had thrown down a third Cyclone Percival into the battlefield, as it was attacking Taylean invisibly. Soon afterwards, they are easily defeated by Sellon and Anubias (after interrupting the battle). =Bash Brothers= Their first appearance is in episode 7, where they challenged Anubias but were both defeated easily by Horridian and his BakuNano Aeroblaze. Mag Mel is watching them and decides to make them a part of his army and gives them 2 Flash Ingrams. Later, Shun and Marucho watch them destroy an unknown team with their new BakuNano mercilessly. Later, they both battle Marucho and Trister and they were defeating them. However, Shun intervenes and they battle him. At first, they are winning due to their BakuNano but are defeated ultimately by Shun. =Cameraman= He is the cameraman who follows Julie around to report the news. Included in other media =Video games= The Player Although non-Canon, the Player defeats all the Brawlers and reaches Number 1 and Dan makes him an official member of the Battle Brawlers.

Regulars The villains in the second videogame, Battle Trainer. They drive a space ship called the Dark Star and stole all Bakugan from Earth, and also deleted Dan's memory. This alien group is led by Vector (Professor Trecov); and his pals Rurock, Viper and Mantis. They wanted to create the most powerful Bakugan with the silent core, but after their defeat, they escaped but not before claiming vengeance on Dan. After the game's ending, it is revealed that the Regulars were working for Naga. Abyss Abyss is a character in Bakugan: Defenders of the Core. She is considered the goddess-guardian of her \\"Earth\\"s core, and the one responsible to alter the Bakugan Interspace to take the Player to her reality. Spectra is after her for the whole game to power-up Maxus Helios. The only one who can see her is the player of the game. She is the alternate \\"Earth's\\" Core. She seems to get power from landmarks and holograms. Also, she grows weaker as landmarks are destroyed and vexos crystals are made. She is eventually killed during the battle at the Earth's core. Ironically, the player was forced to destroy her because Maxus Helios was becoming too powerful because she was basically a power source. Throughout the story, she evolves your bakugan. =Manga= Katie Lowery She appeared in the manga The Evo Tournament. It is unknown what her main Attribute is. Her Guardian Bakugan is Chamelia, but it was sent to the Doom Dimension. Her new Guardian became Mecha Chamelia, a mechanical Bakugan built by her father. She develops a relationship with Marucho over the internet at which point Shun reveals he knew her before meeting the others. He had helped her practice for a match and offered to lend some of his abilities if he beat her in a battle. She lost and never spoke to him again and later stole his ability cards.

Life Constantine was, by his own account, born around 1500, and in 1523 gained entry into Cambridge University to study for a Bachelor of Canon Law. He adopted the Protestant doctrine, and fled to Antwerp where he met and assisted both William Tyndale and George Joye. Here he helped to translate the New Testament into English, and compiled books denouncing the Catholic Church.Lloyd (1958), pg 1115. Constantine later moved to Paris, where he studied Lutheran scriptures and began to smuggle banned literature into England. He was arrested in 1531 by Sir Thomas More;The Sixteenth Century: The Bible The Norton Anthology of English Literature after revealing the names of some of his Protestant colleagues he escaped in December of the same year, returning to Antwerp. Constantine returned to England in 1536, following More's death, and entered the service of Sir Henry Norris.Lloyd (1958), pg 1116. After Norris's death, Constantine was made the vicar of Llawhaden in Pembrokeshire, but some unguarded remarks to John Barlow in 1539 led to his imprisonment by Thomas Cromwell in the Tower of London. By 1546, Constantine had been released from imprisonment, and had regained favour with the church. He became the registrar of St David's in Wales, then gained the position of royal visitor of the diocese in 1547, ascending to Archdeacon of Carmarthen and Prebendary of Llangammarch in 1549. Although Constantine was stripped of his registrarship and livings during Mary's reign, he was back in favour by 1559 when he was appointed one of the visitors for the Western circuit of dioceses. At last, in November 1559, he was made archdeacon of Brecon by Elizabeth I. Constantine married; his only surviving child became the first wife of Thomas Younge, Archbishop of York.Prior, Mary; Women in English Society, 1500-1800, Routledge (1985), pg 98.

As of March 2017, there are over 70 HuHot Mongolian Grills in 18 states, with the vast majority located in the Midwest and Mountain West states. History The first HuHot, then called Mongo's, was built in Missoula, Montana in 1999 by the Vap family. Due to the family's experience as Godfather's Pizza franchisees, they were familiar with franchising and knew a fellow restaurateur based in the Midwest who was interested in the concept. From there, it grew by word-of-mouth. The first franchised HuHot was built in Omaha, Nebraska in 2002. There are currently 70 locations in 18 states. About one third are corporate-owned and the rest are franchised. HuHot had originally opened as \\"Mongo‚Äôs\\" but when the company decided to franchise, they found that name was already trademarked. They chose the name HuHot, from Hohhot, the capital of Inner Mongolia.  Murals  The walls of each HuHot Mongolian Grill location are covered in hand-painted murals inspired by Mongolian folk tales.

Childhood and Training Ashwin's mother, Shanta Devi Batish, was an All India Radio artist and started Ashwin on the dholak drum around the age of seven and on the sitar around the age of 12.Sitar Power - Ashwin Batish's Musical adventures by Paula Kirman: http://www.insideworldmusic.com/library/weekly/aa091401b.htm His father had bought him an inexpensive guitar and Ashwin learned to play chords, especially ones to popular Western songs that he liked to sing. He was a great fan of the Beatles, Cliff Richards, Pat Boone and other pop singers of the 1950s era. He started learning music from his father, S D Batish, in England at around age 14, including compositions in various ragas. His father would often sing and have Ashwin copy the musical phrases. The cold English weather meant that there was only one warm room in the house where all his family would gather. To Ashwin's advantage and delight, his father would always give his playing the preference, much to the dismay of his brothers and sisters. Career Ashwin moved to the United States in 1973. For the next 15 years he spent a majority of his time performing nightly with his father at their family restaurant and music club 'Batish India House.' Although his training has been in North Indian classical music, Ashwin Batish has been equally at home with Western music often performing with jazz and rock musicians. His 1980s fling with fusion music he self-titled Sitar Power was instrumental in garnering him serious airplay including a recording contract with Shanachie Records of New Jersey. After a few years under the Shanachie umbrella, Ashwin formed his own record label, Batish Records, to publish all his family's works.

As of 2011 it had a population of 264. History The town is famous for its old early Gothic church (built between 1530 and 1578), which is depicted in town's coat of arms. A new church was built in 1942. According to tradition, the village was originally the location of one of the larger pagan temples of the Baltic tribes. The town, originally named Sapie≈ºyszki in Polish was named after the Sapieha family, erstwhile mighty boyars of Smolensk and later a princely family active in the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth. The grounds of the former pagan temple were donated to Pawe≈Ç Sapieha by king of Poland Sigismund I the Old. The earlier founded a church on the ruins of the old temple and founded a new settlement there, named after himself. In the settlement, the Sapiehas also built a manor, which however did not survive to modern times. In early 17th century Andrzej Sapieha, the voivode of Polotsk, Nowogr√≥dek and Smolensk Voivodeship, sold the village to Grzegorz Massalski, the cup-bearer of Grodno. His son, Aleksander left it to his daughter, who joined the Bernardine monastery near Kaunas. Until the partitions of Poland the monastery remained the owner of the village of Sapie≈ºyszki. However, in 1795 the Prussian authorities secularised the convent and confiscated all of its properties. In 1812, during Napoleonic Wars, the church was partially demolished by French forces who used it as a stable. In mid-19th century the town had 564 inhabitants, many were Jewish. On September 4, 1941, Jews of the town were murdered in a mass execution on the western outskirts of the town. An Einsatzgruppe with local Lithuanian collaborators perpetrated the mass execution. There were a few Germans with cameras at the site. According to the J√§ger Report, 178 Jews were shot in Zapy≈°kis: 47 men, 118 women and 13 children.http://www.holocaustatlas.lt/EN/#a_atlas/search//page/1/item/137/ References *This article was initially translated from the Lithuanian Wikipedia.

History In the middle of the nineteenth century, approximately 650 Jews resided in ≈Ωasliai. On the eve of the Soviet annexation of Lithuania in 1940, the roughly 1000 Jewish inhabitants of the town made up half of the total population, making a living from commerce, artisanship and agriculture. On June 22, 1941, the German army invaded Lithuania, entering ≈Ωasliai within days thereafter. Lithuanian nationalists took over the town and began looting Jewish property and attacking local Jews. Accusing the Jews of collaborating with the Soviets, the Lithuanians detained Jewish men, and transferred them to the nearby town of Kaisiadorys. On August 17 of 1941, most of the town‚Äôs Jewish inhabitants were driven out to Kaisiadorys. Ten days later they were killed, along with Jews from Kaisiadorys and Ziezmariai.

As reviewed by McVey and Lee, the foremost distinguishing property of MMEJ is the use of microhomologous sequences during the alignment of broken ends before joining, thereby resulting in deletions flanking the original break. MMEJ is frequently associated with chromosome abnormalities such as deletions, translocations, inversions and other complex rearrangements. There are multiple pathways for repairing double strand breaks, mainly non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), homologous recombination (HR), and MMEJ. NHEJ directly joins both ends of the double strand break and is relatively accurate, although small (usually less than a few nucleotides) insertions or deletions sometimes occur. HR is highly accurate and uses the sister chromatid as a template for accurate repair of the DSB. MMEJ is distinguished from these other repair mechanisms by its use of microhomologous sequences to align the broken strands. This results in frequent deletions and occasionally insertions which are much larger than those produced by NHEJ (citation needed). MMEJ is completely independent from classical NHEJ and does not rely on NHEJ core factors such as Ku protein, DNA-PK, or Ligase IV. In MMEJ, repair of the DSB is initiated by end resection by the MRE nuclease, leaving single stranded overhangs. These single stranded overhangs anneal at microhomologies, which are short regions of complementarity, often 5‚Äì25 base pairs, between the two strands. A specialized form of MMEJ, called polymerase theta-mediated end-joining (TMEJ), is able to repair breaks using ‚â•1 bp of homology. The helicase domain of DNA polymerase theta possesses ATP-dependent single-strand annealing activity and may promote annealing of microhomologies. Following annealing, any overhanging bases (flaps) are removed by nucleases such as Fen1 and gaps are filled in by DNA polymerase theta. This gap-filling ability of polymerase theta helps to stabilize the annealing of ends with minimal complementarity. Besides microhomology footprints, polymerase theta's mutational signature also consists of (infrequent) templated inserts, which are thought to be the result of aborted template-dependent extension, followed by re-annealing at secondary homologous sequences. Cell cycle regulation MMEJ repair is low in G0/G1 phase but is increased during S-phase and G2 phase of the cell cycle. In contrast, NHEJ operates throughout the cell cycle, and homologous recombination (HR) operates only in late S and G2. Double strand break repair pathway choice The choice of which pathway is used for double strand break repair is complex. In most cases, MMEJ accounts for a minor proportion (10%) of double strand break repair, most likely in cases where the double strand break is resected but a sister chromatid is not available for homologous recombination. Cells which are deficient in either classical NHEJ or HR typically display increased MMEJ. Human homologous recombination factors suppress mutagenic MMEJ following double-strand break resection. Genes required A biochemical assay system shows that at least 6 genes are required for microhomology-mediated end joining: FEN1, Ligase III, MRE11, NBS1, PARP1 and XRCC1. All six of these genes are up-regulated in one or more cancers. In humans, DNA polymerase theta, encoded by the POLQ gene, plays a central role in microhomology-mediated end joining. Polymerase theta utilizes its helicase domain to displace replication protein A (RPA) from DNA ends and promote microhomology annealing. Polymerase theta also uses its polymerase activity to conduct fill-in synthesis, which helps to stabilize paired ends. In cancer Approximately half of all ovarian cancers are deficient in homologous recombination (HR). These HR-deficient tumors upregulate polymerase theta (POLQ), resulting in an increase in MMEJ. These tumors are hyper-reliant upon MMEJ, so that knockdown of polymerase theta results in substantial lethality. In most cell types, MMEJ makes a minor contribution to double strand break repair. The hyper-reliance of HR-deficient tumors upon MMEJ may represent a possible drug target for cancer treatment. MMEJ always involves insertions or deletions, so that it is a mutagenic pathway. Cells with increased MMEJ may have higher genomic instability and a predisposition towards cancer development, although this has not been demonstrated directly. In a crustacean Penaeus monodon is a marine crustacean widely consumed for its nutritional value. Repair of double-strand breaks in this organism can occur by HRR, but NHEJ is undetectable. While HRR appears to be the major double- strand break repair pathway, MMEJ was also found to play a significant role in repair of DNA double-strand breaks.

She is a professor emerita at the University of Iowa.  Early life and education  Nieh Hua-ling was born on 11 January 1925 in Wuhan, Hubei, China. In 1936, Nieh's father, an official of the Kuomintang administration, was executed by the Communist Red Army during the Chinese Civil War. In 1948, she graduated with a degree in English from the Western Languages Department of National Central University. Following the communist revolution in China, she and her family relocated to Taiwan.  Career  In Taiwan, Nieh became the literary editor and a member of the editorial board of Free China, a liberal intellectual magazine. She served in these positions until 1960, when the magazine was closed down by the Chiang Kai-shek administration. She also began to teach creative writing courses at National Taiwan University and Tunghai University, becoming the first faculty member to do so in Chinese. She met Paul Engle, then director of the Iowa Writers' Workshop, while he was visiting Taiwan to research the contemporary literary scene in Asia. He invited her to attend the Writers' Workshop. As the political climate grew worse in Taiwan, she was placed under surveillance and prevented from publishing. She decided to accept Engle's invitation and arrived in Iowa City in 1964 with seven books already published. In 1966, after receiving her Master of Fine Arts degree in fiction from the Writers' Workshop, she suggested to Engle, then retiring from the Workshop, that they start a writing program solely for international writers. Their joint plan was to invite published writers from all over the world to Iowa City to hone their craft, exchange ideas, and create cross-cultural friendships. With support from the University of Iowa and a private grant, the first group of international writers convened in Iowa City in 1967 as the first participants in the International Writing Program (IWP). They were married in 1971. With Engle as director and Nieh Engle as assistant director and then associate director, the International Writing Program grew into a recognized residency for literary artists. As an active editor, Nieh Engle sought to introduce little-known Chinese literary trends emerging even in the middle of the Cultural Revolution. She and Engle translated and edited a collection of Mao Zedong's poems. This was followed by a two-volume scholarly collection, Literature of the Hundred Flowers, which she edited and co-translated. In 1976, to honor their role in promoting exchange among international artists, 300 writers advanced the Engles for the Nobel Peace Prize. The pair was officially nominated by US Ambassador at Large W. Averell Harriman. In 1979 they coordinated a \\"Chinese Weekend,\\" one of the first encounters between writers from mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the diaspora after 1949.\\"Publishing: Chinese Weekend in Iowa.\\" Mitgang, Herbert. New York Times; Aug. 17, 1979 Nieh Engle continued as the director of the International Writing Program (IWP) after Engle's retirement in 1977. She retired in 1988, and currently serves as a member of the IWP Advisory Board. She was also a member of the panel of judges for the prestigious Asiaweek Short Story Competition.Asiaweek, December 21‚Äì28, 1986, p.100 At the University of Iowa, she was co-director of the Translation Workshop from 1975 to 1988. She has received several honorary doctorates as well as an award for Distinguished Service to the Arts from the State of Iowa and the National Association of Governors in 1982. The Chinese magazine Asia Weekly named her novel Sang ch'ing yu t'ao hung (Mulberry and Peach) as one of the top 100 Chinese novels of the 20th century.Asia Weekly, June 14‚Äì20, 1999 Alongside her administrative and editorial work, Nieh Engle has maintained an active literary career. She is the author of more than two dozen books, written in Chinese and widely translated, including novels, essay collections, collections of stories, translations, and edited works. These include Mulberry and Peach, which, in its English translation (Mulberry and Peach: Two Women of China), won an American Book Award in 1990; Thirty Years Later (San shih nien hou); Black, the Most Beautiful Color (Hei she, he she, tsui mei li ti yen she); and People in the Twentieth Century (Jen tsai erh shih shih chi). Her most recent novel in Chinese, Far Away, a River (Qian shan wai, shui chang liu), depicts one of the themes that are often reflected in her novels: the search for identity and roots. Her memoir, Images of Three Lives, a picture-essay book, chronicles her experiences in China, Taiwan and the United States.

Gameplay alt=A screenshot outside with Kurisu in the center foreground and a mobile phone on the right. Kurisu has long brown hair and is wearing a collared shirt with a red tie and a brown jacket on top. She has a slightly annoyed expression on her face. The mobile phone on the right is displaying text with some characters in blue and underlined. The current date in the game's world is displayed in the top left corner. A translucent text box at the bottom displays text. Steins;Gates gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent reading the text that appears on the screen, which represents either the dialogue between the various characters or the thoughts of the protagonist. Like many other visual novels, there are specific points in Steins;Gate where the user is given a choice to affect the direction of the game. For these decision points, Steins;Gate presents the user with the system which is similar to the \\"delusional trigger\\" system that was introduced in Chaos;Head. When the player receives a phone call, the player can choose to answer or ignore the call. Incoming text messages have specific words underlined and highlighted in blue, much like a hyperlink on a browser, which the player can select to reply to the text message. Most phone calls or text messages do not require a response, though there are certain points in the game where the player is required to take action. Depending on the player's choices of how to respond to these phone calls and text messages, the plot will progress in a specific direction. Synopsis =Setting and themes= Steins;Gate is set in the summer of 2010, approximately one year after the events that took place in Chaos;Head, in Akihabara. Physical locales of Akihabara like the Radio Kaikan building can be spotted in the game. According to Chiyomaru Shikura, who headed the planning of Steins;Gate, Akihabara was chosen because it is an easy place for acquiring hardware parts, which makes it the ideal place for people interested in inventing and tinkering with things. The notion of time and time traveling are the main themes of the game. The concept of cause and effect is featured prominently in the game as the protagonist travels back in time numerous times to perform different actions in an attempt to alter what has happened in the future. Steins;Gate also features hard science fiction elements. =Characters= ; :The player assumes the role of Rintaro Okabe, the protagonist of Steins;Gate. Okabe is an eccentric individual, a self- proclaimed mad scientist who often goes by the pseudonym '. Mayuri and Daru call him , a portmanteau of his surname and given name. He is the founder of what he calls the in Akihabara, where he spends most of his time and has dubbed himself Lab Member No. 001 (as he is the first person to join). Okabe gives off the appearance of being delusional and paranoid, frequently referring to the \\"Organization\\" that is after him, talking to himself on his phone, and engaging in fits of maniacal laughter. He is frequently mocked for this behavior, mostly by Kurisu and Daru, and referred to as a chunibyou. Most of the time he takes on a fairly arrogant personality. He is usually seen wearing a lab coat. As he experiments with time travel, he learns that he is the only one who possesses the ability to determine changes between different timelines, which he dubs \\"Reading Steiner\\". He is 18 years old and a first- year student at Tokyo Denki University. :He is actually a kind-hearted person who always helps others that are in trouble. He acted strangely by talking to himself on his phone and saying all those strange things like the \\"Organization\\" just to make his childhood friend, Shiina Mayuri happy. Shiina Mayuri was in great sadness when her grandmother passed away. Moreover, he protected Urushibara Luka from bullies at the first time he met Luka and as a result, Luka was grateful to Okabe and treated Okabe as his role model. ; :Kurisu Makise is the main heroine of the game and Lab Member No. 004. She is an 18-year-old neuroscience researcher at an American university who can speak and read English well. Having had her research published in the academic journal Science at this age, Makise is extremely talented. She had skipped a grade in the American school system. Okabe simply tends to call her or one of the several nicknames he comes up with, such as , \\"the Zombie\\", and \\"Celeb Sev\\", which bugs her to varying degrees. She is something of a mild tsundere, although she will object to it whenever someone (usually Daru) calls her that. She does not get along with her father and has not spoken to him in many years. She posts on @chan (the game's in-universe version of 2channel) under the name \\"KuriGohan and Kamehameha\\"; the alias also makes a cameo on Kaito Yashio's PokeCom tablet in episode 9 of Robotics;Notes. ; :Mayuri Shiina is a long-time childhood best friend of Rintaro and is a bit of an airhead, as well as Lab Member No. 002. Shiina enjoys creating cosplay costumes and has a part- time job at a maid caf√© called \\"Mayqueen Nyannyan\\". She often calls herself , a portmanteau of her given name and surname, which is also what Daru calls her. She has a distinctive sing-song way of speaking, and she typically sings when she arrives or introduces herself. Several years prior she lost her grandmother under unknown circumstances, and to prevent her from succumbing to grief, Okabe declared her his \\"hostage\\", his entire eccentric persona being for her sake.

On July 28, 2010, Rintaro Okabe and his friend Mayuri Shiina head towards the Radio Kaikan building for a conference, where Rintaro finds a girl named Kurisu Makise lying in a pool of blood.Translated quote: \\"Everybody's faces turned pale white upon seeing Kurisu's body.\\" As Rintaro sends a text message about the incident to his friend, Itaru \\"Daru\\" Hashida, he experiences a strange phenomenon and the people around him disappear, with no one else noticing anything had changed.Translated quote: \\"Just now, thousands of pedestrians disappeared in an instant! You saw it too, right!? / I didn't see anything. Now hurry up and leave.\\" After later running into Kurisu, who is strangely alive and well, and discovering the message he had sent to Itaru had arrived a week before he sent it,Translated quote: \\"You should be dead! Why are you here...!?\\" Translated quote: \\"Well, you sent me a message like that a week ago, no?\\" Rintaro soon deduces that the 'Mobile Microwave' he and his friends had been developing is, in fact, a time machine capable of sending text messages to the past.Translated quote: \\"The mail was sent to the \\"past\\".\\" He and his friends soon learn that SERN, an organization that has been researching time travel for some time, has actually succeeded in sending humans into the past although they seem to have all resulted in the test subjects' deaths. Rintaro begins experimenting with , which begin to cause major differences in the timeline. Kurisu also manages to create a device to send a person's memories through the microwave, allowing that person to effectively leap into the past. However, SERN learns of the time machine and sends a group led by Moeka to retrieve it, killing Mayuri in the process.Translated quote: \\"We... are from SERN.\\" Using Kurisu's time leap machine, Rintaro travels back in time numerous times to try to save Mayuri, but to no avail. As Rintaro reaches wit's end, he is approached by Suzuha Amane, a girl from a future ruled by SERN due to their possession of a time machine, who tells him that he needs to return to a Beta worldline in which Mayuri won't die. By undoing the effects of the D-Mails that caused shifts in the timeline, Rintaro regains possession of an IBN 5100 PC that they lost earlier, allowing them to crack into SERN's systems and delete the evidence of Rintaro's original D-Mail. However, Rintaro realizes that by doing so, he would have to return to a world line in which Kurisu is dead. After realizing their feelings for each other, Kurisu tells Rintaro to save Mayuri.Translated quote: \\"Go to the Beta (Œ≤) worldline. A world where Mayuri doesn't die.\\" Reluctantly, Rintaro agrees and deletes the evidence of his D-Mail from SERN's database, returning him to the Beta world line. Sometime later, Suzuha appears before Rintaro, having arrived in a time machine from the future. She tells Rintaro that the only way to prevent World War III in the future is to prevent Kurisu's death at the hands of her father, Dr. Nakabachi, who stole her time travel theory to publish it under his own name.Translated quote: \\"In the future of this worldline, World War 3 has occurred.\\" However, this operation ends in a disaster as Rintaro ends up killing Kurisu himself by mistake.Translated quote: \\"I killed Kurisu, for the second time...\\" After this failure, Rintaro receives a message from his future self, telling him that the way to save Kurisu without altering the events that led to him developing a time machine is to fool his past self into believing Kurisu had been killed and thus achieving the final divergence value of 1.048596%, which he dubs the 'Steins Gate'.Translated quote: \\"Those feelings of guilt and regret have now connected with me who completed this plan in 2025.\\" Translated quote: \\"The person to \\"trick\\" is you yourself / The you from the very beginning, who witnessed the bloodstained Kurisu Makise lying on the ground\\" Returning to the past again, Rintaro puts his own life in danger in order to save Kurisu's life, prevent Nakabachi from successfully escaping with the time travel theory, and fool his past self, setting him on his journey through time. Returning to the Steins Gate world line, safe from the threat of a third world war, Rintaro and Kurisu manage to reunite by chance (or by fate) in the streets of Akihabara.Translated quote: \\"We meet again, Christina--\\" Alternate endings The player's choices throughout the game may result in alternate endings. In the Suzuha Amane Ending, Okabe decides to not send the D-Mail that would prevent him from pursuing Suzuha. To prevent Mayuri's death, he re-lives the final two days before her murder through constant time- leaping. After countless leaps, Okabe loses all emotion and personality due to re-living the same two days for all eternity. Eventually, Suzuha notices Okabe's behavior. She tells him that he will slowly \\"die\\" on the inside, and the world's set divergence will continue as planned. Both of them decide to travel to the past together and vow to stop SERN's dystopian future, despite the possibility of both losing their memories on arrival. In the Faris NyanNyan Ending, Okabe decides to not send the D-Mail that results in the death of Faris' father to try to stop the loss of the IBN 5100 computer. He instead sends a different D-Mail in an attempt to convince Faris' father to not part with the IBN computer. Beyond 1% divergence is achieved, but the divergence meter gives a strange output and none of Okabe's friends have any memories of him. In this worldline, Okabe and Faris are a couple and live together, participating in RaiNet Access Battlers card game tournaments. Although disappointed that none of his friends remember him, Okabe is still satisfied that he was able to prevent Mayuri's death. He decides to build a new life with Faris at his side. In the Luka Urushibara Ending, Okabe decides to not send the D-Mail that reverts Luka to a guy. He fully accepts Mayuri's expected death and makes no more attempts to save her and they spend the last two days together before she dies of a heart attack. Okabe and Luka decide to spend the rest of their lives together, both of them sharing a pang of guilt and sadness that only they would understand. In the Mayuri Shiina Ending, Okabe must choose between saving Mayuri or Kurisu. Realizing that he harbors romantic feelings for Mayuri, Okabe and Kurisu decide to return to the Beta worldline in which Kurisu's murder continues as planned. After hacking into SERN's database with the IBN computer, a 1% divergence is achieved. Okabe vows to remember his memories of Kurisu and spends his time with Mayuri as lovers. The Kurisu Makise Ending follows a similar route to the True End. To achieve this ending, one must have had several conversations with Kurisu throughout the game. Doing so allows Okabe and Kurisu to realize their inner feelings for each other. Unlike the True End, Kurisu's death is not prevented after the credits. Development Steins;Gate is the second collaborative work between 5pb. and Nitroplus after Chaos;Head. The game was created with the concept of \\"99% science (reality) and 1% fantasy\\" in mind. The planning for Steins;Gate was headed by Chiyomaru Shikura of 5pb. The characters were designed by Ryohei Fuke, also known as 'Huke' (known as one of the illustrators of Metal Gear series, and the creator of Black Rock Shooter franchise) whereas the gadgets were designed by Sh@rp. Naotaka Hayashi of 5pb. wrote the scenario with assistance from Vio Shimokura of Nitroplus. Tatsuya Matsuhara from 5pb. was the producer and Tos≈ç Pehara from Nitroplus was the art director. The music was composed by Takeshi Abo of 5pb. and Toshimichi Isoe of Zizz Studio. Shikura, Hayashi, Matsuhara, Abo, and Isoe had all previously worked on Chaos;Head. The title \\"Steins;Gate\\" had no specific meaning, being coined from the German word \\"Stein\\" meaning stone, and tying in with famous physicist Albert Einstein. Steins;Gate was inspired by earlier visual novels written by Hiroyuki Kanno. These include Eve Burst Error (1995), and most notably the time-travel adventure YU-NO: A Girl Who Chants Love at the Bound of this World (1996). Matsuhara, who came up with the concept of the phone trigger system, stated that he initially wanted to incorporate the player's own mobile phone into the system. However, the idea was abandoned due to concerns that it might clash with Japan's privacy laws. When asked if the phone trigger system would be used in a possible sequel to the game, Hayashi stated that he hoped this would not be the case and recalled saying \\"who thought of this system!\\" while writing the contents of the text messages. While Shikura did not directly contribute to the script itself, Hayashi stated that Shikura helped with the overall plot and provided assistance with the second half of the story. In particular, Shikura helped a lot with the time-traveling aspects of the story. Hayashi stated that while he did not want the script to repeat the same text over and over again, it was ultimately unavoidable due to the player having to travel back in time so he tried to emphasize the overall tempo of the plot's development and how the plot unfolded. With regards to the theme of time traveling, Hayashi had felt that it seemed like an overdone topic and expressed concern over it when he first heard the idea from Shikura. Prior to the game's announcement, a teaser site was featured on 5pb.'s website that simply referred to the game as Project S;G and stating that it was going to be a collaboration between 5pb. and Nitroplus. Nitroplus's website had also hinted at this on its 10th anniversary website. Matsuhara, who was also the producer for Chaos;Head, had previously stated that the game would be centred on Akihabara and that the project with Nitroplus would be the second part in a series around the theme \\"\\". On June 12, 2009, the countdown expired and the name Steins;Gate was revealed. Kana Hanazawa stated that she was happy to have been selected to be in Steins;Gate as she felt that it was not common to be able to play a part in a serious game. She also thought that the game gives the player more of a thrilling sensation rather than a frightening one and it entices the player to continue reading. Release history Steins;Gate was first declared gold on September 18, 2009 with a demo of the game being made available a few weeks later on the Xbox Live Marketplace on October 7, 2009 for Xbox Live Gold members and then publicly on October 14, 2009. The demo allows the player to play through the prologue and the game's first chapter. Steins;Gate was released in both limited and regular editions on October 15, 2009.

At Anime Expo 2013, JAST USA announced that they would be licensing the PC version of the game in North America. The game was released on March 31, 2014 in a Limited Edition, as well as digitally. The Limited Edition contained a deluxe collector's box, a fan book with artwork, a set of replica Future Gadget Laboratory pins, the manual, and game disc. A physical Standard Edition later followed.

On May 1, 2018, Spike Chunsoft took over publishing of the Steam version of the game from Mages/5pb. Reception =Reviews= Senji Ishii of Famitsu Xbox 360 praised the scenario for its detail and noted that events that were overlooked as insignificant later returned to affect events of the future. Due to the way the plot ties the many different events of the game together, Ishii believes it must have been a lot of work to write the scenarios. In 2009, the Famitsu Awards gave Steins;Gate an annual Game of Excellence award. 4Gamer.net commented that Steins;Gate is comparable to 428: Shibuya Scramble and felt that it is a gem that has not been seen in recent years. ITmedia Gamez noted that players should be attentive to all the details in the story as the twists will surprise the player in many different ways. It was also suggested to the player that the characters' voices be left turned on as the voice acting is very good. The review did caution that players who have played through the demo and who did not enjoy the atmosphere of the game were not likely to find the rest of the game interesting. Steins;Gate has also been praised by Square Enix producer Tomoya Asano, who described it as having \\"appealing and likable characters and a scenario that surprised players\\"; this led to Steins;Gate writer Naotaka Hayashi writing the plot and characters for the role-playing video game Bravely Default: Flying Fairy. In 2011, Steins;Gate was voted #6 in Famitsus poll of \\"most tear-inducing games\\" of all time. In 2017, Famitsu readers voted it the best adventure game of all time. The later English release of the Steins;Gate visual novel has also been well received. On Metacritic, it is the seventh highest-rated PC game of 2014, and the highest-rated PS Vita game of 2015. USgamer also gave it a perfect 5 out of 5 stars, concluding that it makes \\"excellent use of the visual novel medium to tell its story\\" and \\"is a beautifully crafted piece of interactive fiction that blends character drama, sci-fi and critique of popular culture into a compelling and memorable whole.\\" GameFan praised the plot as \\"outstanding\\", \\"well written\\" and \\"the best storyline in a game released this year, period.\\" They stated the \\"twists and turns, branching plot points, multiple endings and plot development is amazing\\" and \\"an interesting phone-based choice system makes the game feel far more engaging than similar games in the genre\\". Dealspwn praised the plot, characters, artwork, \\"excellent\\" writing and localisation, and the phone trigger system for giving \\"real choices with huge consequences\\", but criticized it for having a slow start and \\"lots of\\" technical jargon. GamesMaster said it was smart, \\"with an unforgettable protagonist\\", and is one \\"of the great visual novels.\\" Syfy called it one \\"of the best Visual Novels of all time,\\" stating that, while \\"bad guys exist,\\" \\"by trying to save the future, you become one yourself\\", making \\"choices whose devastating consequences you couldn‚Äôt predict.\\" Official PlayStation Magazine said \\"it's a story you'll want to see through.\\" Meghan Sullivan of IGN gave it a generally favorable review, praising the story, characters, choices, and endings, but criticized it for \\"intrusive dating elements\\". Steins;Gate was nominated for the 2015 Golden Joystick Award in the \\"Best Handheld / Mobile Game\\" category. =Sales= Steins;Gate placed 13th in sales during its first week of release with 16,434 copies sold, 28th on its second week with 4,253 copies, and 26th on its third week with 6,095 copies, totaling 26,782 copies by October 29, 2009.

Related media A promotional model of the crashed time machine on the real life Radio Kaikan building in Akihabara in October 2011 =Video games= The success of Steins;Gate spawned additional sequels. Steins;Gate: Hiyoku Renri no Darling was released on June 6, 2011, and is similar to Chaos;Head Love Chu Chu! in terms of style. The story for this sequel is unrelated and non-canon to the original game, and is more comedic in tone. It was originally an Xbox 360 exclusive, though ports later followed for PS3, PSP, and PlayStation Vita. A version for iOS was later released on October 3, 2013 as well. Steins;Gate: Hen'i Kuukan no Octet is a non-canon extension of the True End of the original game. Unlike the modern visual novel format of the original game, this retro game mimics the style of graphical text adventure games from the 8-bit PC era (e.g. PC-88), with the player typing short commands to interact with and explore the game world. It features all backgrounds and characters drawn in a low-color pixelated style with emulated scanlines, and chiptune music played through an emulated FM chip with no voice acting. The premise of the game features Rintaro Okabe receiving a D-Mail from himself in 2025 that states that he must save the future by reclaiming an IBN 5100 from a person under the alias \\"Neidhardt\\". This person is Takumi Nishij≈ç, the protagonist of Chaos;Head, as he runs under the same player name in his favorite MMORPG, and the D-Mail stating that \\"Neidhardt\\" lives in Shibuya and has \\"inherent, supernatural abilities\\", a reference to his power as a megalomaniac. Although non-canon, the game contains many easter eggs and references that connect Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate together. The game was released on October 28, 2011, as a PC exclusive. A game demo is currently available. An official manga adaptation of the game's story has also been released. A third spin-off game titled Steins;Gate Senkei K≈çsoku no Phenogram, was released on April 25, 2013 in Japan for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

A true sequel, Steins;Gate 0, was announced in March 2015. The game was released on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita.

Knowles died on 3 April 2008 at his home. In 2006, he was selected by incoming interim president Derek Bok to return to his position as Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on an interim basis, replacing William C. Kirby, who was ousted by now former president Lawrence Summers.Jeremy R. Knowles named Interim Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences , Harvard University Gazette, published 2006-05-22. Retrieved 2009-06-10.Daily Telegraph Obituary Biography Knowles was born in England in 1935, educated at Magdalen College School, Oxford and Balliol College, Oxford (BA 1959, DPhil 1961). He was a Pilot Officer in the Royal Air Force. During his undergraduate he did research in Richard Norman's physical organic chemistry laboratory. There, he studied electronic effects on the rates of aromatic substitution reactions. In 1960, he became a research lecturer at Oxford. He later became Fellow and Tutor at Wadham College, Oxford. Career and research In 1961, he took a post-doctoral fellowship at the California Institute of Technology, working with George S. Hammond, who was an organic photo-chemist. Together, they found that some catalyzed reactions can occur up to one-million times faster than non-catalyzed reactions. Intrigued by this discovery, Knowles became an enzymologist. For a brief time, Knowles was a visiting professor at Yale University. in 1974, Knowles moved his research group to Harvard and became a professor there. Knowles's research was on the boundary of chemistry and biochemistry, and concerned the rate and specificity of enzyme catalysis and the evolution of enzyme function. Early in his career, Knowles studied Œ±-chymotrypsin and pepsin, which are nonspecific proteases, meaning they accept a broad range of substrates. He researched what made these enzymes nonspecific and how they increased the rate of peptide-bond hydrolysis. In 1972, Knowles developed a method for photo-affinity labelling, enabling the formation of a covalent bond between a protein and a ligand under the control of light. Knowles then began seminal studies on the glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate isomerase (TIM). He took advantage of its simplicity‚Äîinterconverting a single substrate and a single product. Using the enediol intermediate of the reaction (which allowed solvent protons to enter the reaction from the middle instead of only from the substrate or product) and kinetic isotope effects, he measured the relative free energy of each intermediate and transition state, which allowed him to depict the first free energy profile for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. This work was done with his long-term collaborator, John Albery. His profile showed that TIM was a \\"perfect\\" enzyme in that catalysis is limited only by the rate of diffusion. Later, Knowles applied similar methods to proline racemase, developing an elegant method to discern whether a reaction proceeds via a stepwise or concerted manner and discovering the consequences of \\"oversaturation\\", a situation in which the interconversion of unliganded forms of the enzyme limit catalysis. At Harvard, Knowles also did important work on Œ≤-lactamases and their mechanism-based inhibitors. And, he provided key insight on the stereochemistry of phosphoryl group transfer reactions, using synthetic phosphoryl groups containing 16O, 17O, and 18O isotopes. Knowles was the author of more than 250 research papers, and advised more than 50 DPhil recipients at Oxford and at Harvard, including Hagan Bayley, Stephen L. Buchwald, and Ronald T. Raines. =Awards and honours= Knowles was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (FAAAS), and a Fellow of American Philosophical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences. Among his awards are the Royal Society of Chemistry's Charmian Medal, the Bader Award, the Repligen Corporation Award in Chemistry of Biological Processes, the Prelog Medal, the Robert A. Welch Award in Chemistry, the Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award, and the Nakanishi Prize. He was awarded the Davy Medal of the Royal Society, and was an Honorary Fellow of Balliol College and of Wadham College, Oxford. He held honorary degrees from the University of Edinburgh and the Eidgen√∂ssische Technische Hochschule in Z√ºrich. He was appointed Order of the British Empire in the 1993 Birthday Honours.

He attained the \\"rank\\" of Commodore and died of gangrene after being wounded in action during the Battle of Cape Spartel, commanding HMS Ganges. Family life FieldingHis name is probably more properly spelled Feilding as this is how we find details about his family life in e.g. Burke's Peerage; however, the name is spelled Fielding in the biography that is here cited. was the son of Charles Feilding, Colonel in the Guards and Equerry to king George II of England, and Anne Palmer. His biographers apparently thought it more important that he was related to the fourth Earl of Denbigh, whose third son his father was. (He himself was a second son.) He married Sophia Finch, a Woman of the Bedchamber of the Queen (Charlotte) on 29 February 1772. (She was a sister of George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea.) They had three daughters and a son, also called Charles, who became a rear- admiral in the Royal Navy. Career Fielding enlisted in the Royal Navy at an early age, probably following the usual career after starting as a midshipman. From his early career little is known, according to his biographer, Charnock, but he was appointed a Post-Captain on 27 August 1760 (during the Seven Years' War) and given command of HMS Flamstead (20). In 1762 he was given command of HMS Unicorn which was decommissioned after the end of the war. Apparently, he did not receive a new command until 1770, when he was appointed to HMS Achilles (a fourth-rate of 60 guns, launched in 1757) as flag captain of Admiral Sir Francis Geary.Charnock, p. 391 Soon after, he received command of HMS Rainbow (44) on which he sailed till he received command of HMS Kent in 1772. During his tenure the Kent experienced an explosion in July, 1774 in which eleven seamen lost their lives. Apparently, he was not blamed, because he retained his command for the usual term. In 1776 he received command of HMS Diamond with which he transported troops to America, where the American Revolution had begun. He remained in that area for some years and in 1778 temporarily commanded the Halifax Station, where he distinguished himself.Charnock, p. 392, fn. * After his return to Europe in 1779 he was given command of HMS Namur, a second rate of 90 guns, and put in charge of a squadron of ships of the line cruising the English Channel to intercept Dutch convoys. As officer commanding a squadron he was allowed to carry the title of \\"commodore\\" though his formal rank remained that of captain. He intercepted in peace time a convoy escorted by a smaller squadron of naval vessels of the Dutch Republic under command of Rear-Admiral Count Lodewijk van Bylandt, which led to the celebrated Affair of Fielding and Bylandt of 31 December 1779.Charnock, p. 392 The commotion this incident caused in the Republic would eventually lead to the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War. Shortly afterwards he was removed to HMS Minerva in which he accompanied Admiral George Darby, when the latter relieved Gibraltar in April, 1781. After the commissioning of HMS Ganges in 1782 he became her first captain. He accompanied Admiral Howe (with whom he had already served in American waters) to Gibraltar in September, 1782. He was lightly wounded by a splinter in the arm during the skirmish that is known as the Battle of Cape Spartel on 20 October 1782. Though the wound was far from serious, infection set in and Fielding died of gangrene on 11 January of the following year.Charnock, p. 393 Notes Sources * (1807) The Naval Chronicle.

She manifested at Samding Monastery in order to tame Yamdrok Lake, a sacred lake as well as a dangerous flashpoint for massive flooding events in Tibet. However, her effects were more practical: as abbess of Samding, she stopped the invasion of the Dzungars, who were reportedly terrified of her great siddhi powers.

Some sources claim she was born a year before the death of the previous incarnation (and therefore cannot be the true reincarnation).When a Woman Becomes a Religious Dynasty: The Samding Dorje Phagmo of Tibet (2007), pp. 299‚Äì300. Hildegard Diemberger. Columbia University Press, New York. . However, Dechen Ch√∂kyi Dr√∂nma was recognised by the present 14th Dalai Lama as a true incarnation and served as a vice president of the Buddhist Association of China in 1956 while he was president, and Choekyi Gyaltsen, 10th Panchen Lama also as vice president. She went to Lhasa in 1958 and received the empowerment of Yamantaka from the Dalai Lama and the empowerment of Vajrayogini from the Dalai Lama's tutor, Trijang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso.Hildegard Diemberger in When a Woman Becomes a Religious Dynasty: The Samding Dorje Phagmo of Tibet.

Other Dorje Phagmo incarnation lineages  According to Diemberger there also is a Dorje Phagmo line in Bhutan: Iconography One of the distinctive features of the Samding Dorje Phagmo's iconography is a black hat. This hat can be seen in both ancient and modern mural paintings as well as in photographs of the later reincarnations. This black hat is very similar to that of the Karmapa and is linked to the dakinis and Yeshe Tsogyal in particular.Hildegard Diemberger in When a Woman Becomes a Religious Dynasty: The Samding Dorje Phagmo of Tibet.

Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co., 433 U.S. 562 (1977), was an important U.S. Supreme Court case concerning rights of publicity.. The Court held that the First and Fourteenth Amendments do not immunize the news media from civil liability when they broadcast a performer's entire act without his consent, and the Constitution does not prevent a state from requiring broadcasters to compensate performers. It was the first time (and so far the only time) the Supreme Court heard a case on rights of publicity.  Facts and procedural history  Petitioner Hugo Zacchini had a human cannonball act which he performed at various venues. During August 1972, he was performing his act at the Geauga County Fair in Burton, Ohio. On August 30, Zacchini noticed a freelance reporter from Scripps-Howard Broadcasting (which operated WEWS-TV in Cleveland) who had brought a movie camera into the fair. Zacchini asked the reporter not to film his act. The reporter did not film Zacchini's act that day, but did film him the next day. The footage taken by the reporter was about fifteen seconds long, sufficient to capture Zacchini's entire act. Zacchini filed suit against Scripps-Howard in Ohio state court, alleging that the local reporter \\"showed and commercialized the film of his act without his consent,\\" and that such conduct was an \\"unlawful appropriation of plaintiff's professional property.\\" The trial court granted the defendant summary judgment. The Ohio Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Zacchini's complaint stated a cause of action for conversion and for infringement of a common law copyright, and that the press was not privileged to show Zacchini's entire act on television without compensating him. The case was then heard by the Ohio Supreme Court, who reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals in favor of Scripps-Howard. The Ohio Supreme Court held that although Scripps- Howard would be liable for appropriating Zacchini's name, likeness, and performance, > A TV station has a privilege to report in its newscasts matters of > legitimate public interest which would otherwise be protected by an > individual's right of publicity, unless the actual intent of the TV station > was to appropriate the benefit of the publicity for some nonprivileged > private use, or unless the actual intent was to injure the individual.433 > U.S. at 565 (internal quotation marks omitted) The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments immunized respondent from damages for its alleged infringement of Zacchini's right of publicity under Ohio state law.  Decision  = Majority opinion = Justice White wrote for the majority. He held first that, because the Ohio Supreme Court based its decision on the scope of protection offered to the press by the Federal constitution (rather than the Ohio state constitution), no adequate and independent state ground existed for the Ohio Supreme Court's decision, and the U.S. Supreme Court therefore had jurisdiction. Moving on to the substantive constitutional issue of the case, White disagreed with the Ohio Supreme Court that the press should be privileged in showing Zacchini's entire act. He distinguished this case from Time, Inc. v. Hill, the U.S. Supreme Court case upon which the Ohio Supreme Court relied in their opinion. Time, Inc. v. Hill was a case which dealt with the tort of \\"false light\\", i.e. portraying a person in a misleading or embarrassing manner, rather than the appropriation of a performer's act or likeness, which was at stake there. White analogized Zacchini's interest in protecting his act from being shown without his permission to those interests protected by patent and copyright: Zacchini not only had a commercial interest in being compensated for the time and effort involved in his performance, but also the \\"economic incentive for him to make the investment required to produce a performance of interest to the public\\".433 U.S. at 576 White concluded by saying that while a state government may pass a law shielding the press from liability for broadcasting performers' acts, the First and Fourteenth amendments do not require the states to do so. = Dissenting opinions = Justice Powell, joined by justices Brennan and Marshall, disagreed with the standard set forth by the majority. Powell felt that the majority concentrated too heavily on the fact that the footage which was broadcast constituted Zacchini's \\"entire act\\" (which, Powell noted, was a rather uncertain standard in itself), rather than examining the purpose for which the footage was used. Since the footage was used for the purpose of reporting news, rather than for commercial exploitation, Powell asserted that the television station's use of the footage should be considered privileged from liability. He worried that the majority's holding may have a chilling effect on freedom of the press: > The Court's holding that the station's ordinary news report may give rise to > substantial liability has disturbing implications, for the decision could > lead to a degree of media self-censorship. Hereafter, whenever a television > news editor is unsure whether certain film footage received from a camera > crew might be held to portray an \\"entire act,\\" he may decline coverage ‚Äì > even of clearly newsworthy events ‚Äì or confine the broadcast to watered-down > verbal reporting, perhaps with an occasional still picture. The public is > then the loser. This is hardly the kind of news reportage that the First > Amendment is meant to foster.433 U.S. at 580‚Äì581 (Powell, J., dissenting) > (internal citations omitted) Justice Stevens wrote a separate dissent. He felt that a better resolution of the case would have been to remand it back to the Ohio Supreme Court for clarification of the state law issue before attempting to resolve the constitutional issue. Stevens felt that it was not clear whether the Ohio Supreme Court was basing its holding purely on the boundaries of common law torts or the First Amendment.

The site is operated and maintained by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and includes an improved campground as well as an informative walking trail showcasing the petroglyphs. Prior to 1989, the site was part of Painted Rock State Park, which included camping facilities on the nearby Painted Rock Reservoir, referred to as the \\"Lake Unit\\". When the state turned control of the park over to the BLM in 1989, the Lake Unit was closed due to concerns over pollutants in the Gila River and is not maintained by the BLM. Currently, there is no public access to Painted Rock Dam or the Lake Unit. History Inscriptions made by modern visitors are interspersed among the prehistoric petroglyphs. The Painted Rock Petroglyph Site is located on the eastern edge of the Painted Rock Mountains and about eighteen miles west by northwest of Gila Bend, Arizona. The area is mostly flat and sandy with May-Oct daytime temperatures in the 100s. The annual rainfall is only about six inches and the nearest irrigational water is the Gila River. In prehistoric times the Gila flowed west out of the mountains of western New Mexico, made a big dogleg turn at the town of Gila Bend and continued west to empty into the Colorado River. The Hohokam people once lived and farmed here. Ruins of their late Pioneer Period (AD 350 - AD 550) and Early Colonial Period (AD 550 - AD 700) villages are found to the north and west, and ruins of their Sedentary - Classic Period (AD 900 - AD 1400) villages are found to the south and east. Over forty petroglyph sites have been recorded in the area, however; most of these sites are small with only a few dozen petroglyphs. The Painted Rock Site is the largest known site with about 800 images. The petroglyphs are pecked onto weathered basalt boulders overlaying a granite outcrop. The outcrop is in the form of an east to west orientated oval about 400' long, and about 20' tall with two small knob tops. Most of the petroglyphs are concentrated on the boulders along the eastern edge, but the petroglyphs face in all directions from that edge. Although considered a Hohokam rock art site, Painted Rock is on the extreme western edge of the Hohokam cultural area. East of Painted Rock, petroglyphs take on more typical Hohokam characteristics, while petroglyphs farther west take on more Patayan characteristics. Found here and in nearby areas of the Gila River are petroglyphs of Archaic origin. Painted Rock also bears the inscriptions of historic passers-by. Juan Bautista de Anza passed near here during his 1775-1776 expedition, followed by the Mormon Battalion in the 1840s, the Butterfield Overland Mail, and countless numbers of pioneers. During World War II, General George Patton used this area as headquarters for tank training. Similar petroglyphs Fifteen miles up the Gila River in the Gila Bend Mountains there are similar ancient petroglyphs with stick figures with long, wavy headdresses and solid circles in the middle of their bodies. These are not common in other parts of the American Southwest.Wilson, Dave (1999) \\"Gila Bend Mountain Ruin\\" Hiking Ruins Seldom Seen Falcon Publishing, Helena, Montana, pp. 31-32, Hohokam style petroglyphs can be found on Tumamoc Hill and Martinez Hill in Tucson, AZ. This style of petroglyphs consists of an assortment of lines and geometric patterns.  Preservation Efforts  The BLM maintains Painted Rock, paving roads and parking lots, posting informational signs, and maintaining camp sites and eating areas. In the 1990s, the BLM removed a large fence that surrounded Painted Rock and exchanged the fence for signs. Prior to the removal of the fence, people climbed on the rocks, and some rocks were even stolen. The signs seem to be somewhat effective in protecting the site, as there has been less vandalism since 2000, yet vandalism remains on many rocks. If tourism increases, there are concerns that the current management practices will not be enough to continue protecting Painted Rock.Wright, Aaron M. ‚ÄúAssessing the Stability and Sustainability of Rock Art Sites: Insight from Southwestern Arizona.‚Äù Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory. 25.3 911‚Äì952. Web. The rocks experience natural weathering, and vandalism and tourism accelerate this natural process. Lichen are luckily not an issue for these rocks because of the hot and arid climate in Arizona. Calcium carbonate does not affect the petroglyphs, although it has been found at the base of some rocks below the petroglyphs. It is suspected that the presence of calcium carbonate at the base of some rocks is caused by erosion from foot traffic in the site. In greater quantities, calcium carbonate would increase weathering and cause deterioration. While other sites are greatly affected by lichen and calcium carbonate, the weathering at this site is mainly a result of wind and water. Archaeology Southwest is a nonprofit organization in Tucson, AZ that works on conservation projects. This organization is working toward turning the Great Gila River Bend into a national monument. One of the reasons for wanting to turn the area into a national monument is researchers' desire to fully survey and inventory the region. Exact locations of sites and landmarks need to be mapped, and this should be completed soon because Phoenix is expanding. Continued population increase will put the petroglyphs at risk of destruction and vandalism. The cliff side of the Great Bend provides natural protection to its petroglyphs because of its stable, basaltic composition. It is well-sheltered and difficult to access, which aid in preserving the petroglyphs, but it is open to the public. The site is currently classified as an \\"Area of Critical Environmental Concern\\" indicating that more protection needs to be established in order for the petroglyphs to be properly maintained.

Tom Cruise Purple is sold by cannabis purveyors in Northern California, and is a popular choice among vaporizer users. The strain is sold legally in California, as a medical cannabis product.

It makes you laugh hysterically while maintaining iron-fisted control of everyone around you.\\" Ryan Tate of Gawker commented, \\"How high do you have to be to name a grade of medical marijuana after lawsuit-happy Scientologist Tom Cruise?\\" CNN television host A.J.

Nobody really thinks that Tom Cruise is endorsing this particular kind of marijuana. Why don't celebrities occasionally just laugh - just laugh at things? This is obviously supposed to be a joke.

Cruise has sought legal advice about what action should be taken regarding the name. He has considered filing a lawsuit against the manufacturers of the product. As a follower of Scientology, Cruise is opposed to the use of psychotropic drugs. He was reported to be furious over the existence of the product.

Construction started in 1748 and it eventually reached a length of over of a tunnel, providing drainage to over 100 mines at an average depth of .Buckley, p.13 The adit was the brainchild of John Williams (born 1714) of Scorrier who was the manager of Poldice mine. Although work was started in 1748, it did not reach Poldice mine until the late 1760s. By 1778 the adit had been extended past Wheal Busy to Wheal Peevor, and another branch, known as the Consols Adit was driven west in the 1770s and 80s to drain the Consolidated Mines and United Mines.Buckley, pp.47‚Äì49 By 1792 a branch from Poldice extended to Wheal Unity. Carrick Roads, showing the silted-up Restronguet Creek at centre right The portal of the adit is in the Carnon Valley below the hamlet of Twelveheads. In 1839, probably at its peak, it discharged over 14.5 million gallons (66 million litres) of water per day into the Carnon River. At that time the adit had more steam engines pumping into it than were used by the whole of continental Europe and America combined. The Carnon River empties into Restronguet Creek (a tidal arm of the Carrick Roads upstream from Falmouth). Major floods in the winter of 1876 caused large quantities of gangue and silt to be washed into the higher part of Restronguet Creek, permanently damaging navigational access to the upper quays at Devoran. Although all the mines served by the Great County Adit have closed and it is unmaintained, it still drains many of their underground workings today; in the summer of 1980 the flow was 500,000 gallons per day.Buckley, p.80 See also *Mining in Cornwall References Sources  Category:History of Cornwall Category:Mining in Cornwall Category:History of mining in the United Kingdom Category:Tin mines in England Category:Industrial archaeological sites in Cornwall ","title":"Great County Adit"},{"id":"23185898","text":"Nationality words link to articles with information on the nation's poetry or literature (for instance, Irish or France).

In 2017, he was appointed as an honorary doctor at Malm√∂ University. He is a brother to the documentary filmmaker Magnus Gertten. In 1994, he founded WG Film, a production company based in Malm√∂. Nowadays, he combines filmmaking with his role as a creative producer. His films have reached an audience in more than 100 countries. In 2015, Aktuell H√•llbarhet named Gertten as the 45 most environmentally influential person in Sweden. Career in Film  As of recent years, Gertten has directed his focus towards global matters and injustices. With the documentary film Bikes vs Cars (2015), he examines the emergence of mass motoring and the current struggle between cyclists and motorists in different metropolises across the world. The film was premiered at South by Southwest (SXSW) and quickly gained international attention. Today, the film has been shown in more than 70 countries, with more than 2000 showings. In 2016, Gertten was awarded ‚ÄùTalents du V√©lo‚Äù, a cycling award for people who promote cycling as a means of transport. Currently, Gertten is working on a production an environmental film, exposing the consequences of gold production in South Africa. The film is being produced in co-production with two South African filmmakers. Between 1986 and 1994, Gertten worked as a foreign reporter in South Africa. Gertten worked as a journalist for newspapers, radio and television in Africa, Latin America, Asia and Europe during the 1980s and 1990s. In 1995 he published the travel book Ung man s√∂ker v√§rlden (Young man looking for the World) through the publisher Gong Gong f√∂rlag. He worked as a columnist for the newspaper Arbetet in the 1990s and for Kv√§llsposten in 2001‚Äì2003. He has also worked as a producer of documentaries and entertainment shows for the Swedish television channels SVT, TV 4 and TV 3. Legal battle with Bananas Fredrik Gertten's film Bananas!* (2009) exposed the battle of Nicaraguan fruit workers against the international corporation Dole. Following the release of the film, the banana giant opted to sue Gertten, his company and the film's producer Margarete Jang√•rd. The film gained wide support from the Riksdag and the case was withdrawn within two months. The battle accompanying the film along with the freedom of speech led Gertten to several awards, including Anna Politkovskaya Freedom of Speech Award. The film was also awarded the Fuf-award, a yearly prize for especially meaningful efforts in international development and assistance work by the Swedish Association for Development. Following the legal case, Max, a Swedish fast-food chain, discontinued serving Dole's fruit salad at its restaurants. In addition, the sales of FairTrade bananas in Sweden increased from 5 percent market share to 10. Big Boys Gone Bananas!* (2011), a film examining the legal process behind Bananas!*, was premiered at Sundance Film Festival and has also been shown at Toronto, IDFA and Berlinale film festivals, reaching an audience in more than 80 countries. Films about Malm√∂ During the earlier years of WG Film, Gertten used Malm√∂ as a baseline. He has both documented and critically examined the city's social transformations since the 1980s. Often co-produced, his documentaries about Malm√∂ have addressed Malm√∂ FF and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, in their successes and adversities (True Blue, 1998; True Blue 2; 2001; The Way Back, 2002; Becoming Zlatan, 2016). Other Gertten's films based in Malm√∂ address the construction of the √ñresund Bridge (Walking on Water, 2000), termination of the newspaper Arbetet (The Death of a Working Man's Newspaper, 2001), demolition of the Kockums Crane (Bye Bye Malm√∂, 2003) and the story of the Turning Torso (The Socialist, the Architect, and the Twisted Tower, 2005). Dr Pei-Sze Chow's doctoral thesis researching the history of √ñresund describes three of Gertten's films (Walking on Water, 2000; Bye Bye Malm√∂, 2003; The Socialist, the Architect, and the Twisted Tower, 2005) as a documentation of human relations surrounding the construction of various landmarks in the beginning of the 2000s. According to Chow, Gertten's films can be viewed as an unplanned trilogy of cinematic portraits which link socio-politic changes and architectural transformation.

Rancho Dominguez is located between Compton, California, Long Beach, California and Carson, California. The Communities of Unincorporated Rancho Dominguez are: Rancho Dominguez, East Rancho Dominguez, and West Rancho Dominguez. Prior to earlier partitioning, Rancho Dominguez also contained the sites of the cities of Compton, California, Carson, California and a portion of North Long Beach, California. History Originally Rancho Dominguez was a small part of the Spanish land grant Rancho San Pedro, from the King of Spain in 1784. The Dominguez Rancho Adobe Museum on South Alameda Avenue is the historic ranch home of land grantee Juan Dominguez and Manuel Dominguez, the men for whom the area is named. The Dominguez family lived in the home until the 1920s and it is now a retirement home for Claretian Catholic priests. In the late 1800s most of the southern part of Rancho Dominguez and the land leading down to the Los Angeles Harbor was acquired by the railroad industry. Today these railroad tracks are used for the same purpose, and is a valuable tie between the Port of Los Angeles and Downtown Los Angeles. Rancho Dominguez was home to California State University, Dominguez Hills. However, when Carson gained cityhood in 1968, it incorporated the Dominguez Hills section of Rancho Dominguez within its city boundaries. Present day The Los Angeles County Sheriff Department(LASD) from the Carson Sheriff Station patrol West Rancho Dominguez and Rancho Dominguez. East Rancho Dominguez is patrolled by the Compton Sheriff Station. Developments The Dominguez area south of Compton along South Alameda includes the Dominguez Rancho Adobe, the community known as Dominguez, Dominguez Elementary, Dominguez Park, and Rancho Dominguez Preparatory School. = Annexation issues = The city of Compton has tried multiple times to annex East Rancho Dominguez, sometimes known as East Compton, and it shares Compton's zip code of 90221. West Rancho Dominguez shares that same zip code but Compton has no interest in annexing that part of unincorporated Los Angeles County due to environmental waste issues with industries and businesses in that region. The Community of Rancho Dominguez south of Compton is a Warehousing and Transportation Industry area that collects great tax revenue for the County of Los Angeles.

Student government appeared at BYU as early as the 1900s. Throughout its existence, the student government took different forms. Up until 1933, the student government association was known as the student body, after which it was known as the Associated Students of Brigham Young University (ASBYU). During its early history the student body sought to provide students with campus events and forms of entertainment for its students; however, with the transition to ASBYU, the organization sought to not only provide for the social life of students but also seek to advocate for their needs. The structure of modern BYUSA includes a president and executive vice-president as well as seven area vice-presidents in charge of a distinct sect of BYUSA which include Campus activities (Y-Activities and AIM), Clubs, Student Advisory Council, Student Honor, Communications, and Involvement. Throughout its history, the student government at BYU has frequently clashed with the administration at BYU. Sometimes finding themselves underneath the control of BYU administration and prominent LDS Church leaders on the Board of Trustees, the student body leadership often attempted to reorganize or protest in order to assert their desire to affect policy at BYU. BYUSA was reorganized and rechartered in 1988, while Jeffrey R. Holland was the university president. Following their rechartering, BYUSA reevaluated their role at BYU, seeking to emulate their motto \\"students serving students\\" by focusing their attention as a student government on advisement and service. A prominent controversy surrounding BYUSA and BYU administration revolved around the firing of a BYUSA faculty advisor for writing a letter to the school newspaper, asking for more transparency in BYUSA elections which led to student protestation of the firing and the call for more freedom for students to express opinions. In the 1990s and the 2000s, BYUSA made university history by electing its first female BYUSA president in 1991 and its first African- American student body president in 2002. History The organization of student government at BYU can be traced to the early 1900s. According to Brigham Young University: The First One Hundred Years, the student government organization officially began in 1909. However, according to Brigham Young University: A House of Faith, student government began in December 1902. Regardless of the discrepancy, a de facto student government existed at BYU as early as 1899 with the establishment of the first student newspaper at BYU, White and Blue. While, not an official student government, the newspaper used their influence to establish student policies. Until 1933, the student government association was known by the title the \\"student body\\", after which it was known as ASBYU. During the university presidency of Franklin S. Harris, ASBYU ran with little supervision from administration or faculty. In 1937, the Board of Control, made up of administration chosen student members, was dissolved and students were granted permission to hold primary elections, however, students continued to notice the lack of student government's power for the next 20 years. Early duties of student government included running intercollegiate athletics, managing the Student Loan Fund, operating the BYU bookstore, planning campus social activities, maintaining the paint on the \\"Y\\" on the mountainside near BYU, and overseeing freshman initiation. The ASBYU senate was more outspoken than other student government branches but was frequently censored by the administration. For example, in 1958, senate members proposed a \\"dead week\\" before final exams with no university activities; however, administrators compelled ASBYU members to schedule activities anyway so students would not be forced to travel off-campus for \\"less desirable recreation\\". Administration pushed back on the senate led by BYU president Ernest L. Wilkinson who reminded students that the university was \\"private...not a republic\\" and that it was \\"ludicrous\\" to think students could affect university policy. From the 1950s to the 1970s, interest in student government was on a steady decline due to the creation of local religious organizations that became the new social units for students. Additionally, interest in ASBYU had decreased because students began to identify with their major rather than their class in school. Despite its declining interest, ASBYU funded and helped organize many campus events and improve student and BYU relations. Throughout the history of ASBYU, student body officials had been forced to resign due to moral or legal violations which included public \\"lewdness\\", embezzlement, and unauthorized use of university vehicles among other violations. Consequently, some students suggested that student officers be appointed by local ecclesiastical leaders rather than elected. President of BYU Dallin H. Oaks argued that it was important for students to experienced the democratic system and ecclesiastical appointment of leadership was never implemented. In 1988, ASBYU was restructured and renamed BYUSA by BYU president Jeffrey R. Holland. According to the director of the Honor Code Office, Rush Sumpter, ASBYU became too powerful with students believing they \\"could do their own thing\\". Additionally, Sumpter stated that elections became exclusive to wealthy students who could afford to campaign, social clubs had too much control, and activities excluded students. John Coleman became the new president of BYUSA with advisement and service rather than power, being the focus of the government modeled institution. Despite being the equivalent of a student government, the association claims to function as a student service association, because students work with administration to solve problems rather than have the power to make direct change. The name was initially changed to the Student Service Association of Brigham Young University (SSABYU) but was changed to BYUSA due to potential abuse of the acronym. In 1991, Amy Baird was elected the first female president of BYUSA. In 2002, Rob Foster became the first African-American BYUSA president, the Daily Herald noted this as significant, because African-Americans make up less than 1% of enrollment at BYU. In 2006, controversy surrounding BYU's administration of BYUSA was heightened when Todd Hendricks, a BYUSA advisor, was fired from the university. The Daily Herald reported that Hendricks was fired for submitting a letter to the school's newspaper The Daily Universe which urged for more transparency in BYUSA elections. The firing led to student protests and concern that BYU administration had too much control over student government. A mostly silent student protest was held on March 31, 2006 where students protested the firing of Hendricks and the lack of freedom for students to express their opinions. In 2016, the first all-female presidency of BYUSA was elected with Avery Harding as president and Addie Hulme as vice-president. BYUSA instituted PEN talk panels (Perspective Education Narratives), modeled off TED talks, to allow BYU students a safe place to discuss various topics with the goal of better understanding minority groups at BYU. Organization BYUSA functions to serve and advise. Every March full-time students participate in electing a new president and executive vice president to a one- year term. Candidates for president and executive vice president must be in good honor code standing and have completed two semesters of service leadership experience at the university. The remaining members of the BYUSA presidency are appointed by the incoming president and executive vice president. The BYUSA Presidency is made up of six distinct areas. Each area is led by an area vice president and each member of the presidency serves for a one-year term, alongside the President and Executive Vice President. Additionally, each area vice president appoints executive directors who serve as volunteers from the beginning of summer term to the end of the following winter semester. The six departments of BYUSA are campus activities, clubs, the Student Advisory Council, the Student Honor department, communications, and involvement. Campus Activities plans, implements, and evaluates large- scale, campus-wide activities for the students, including popular activities like the semi-annual Battle of the Bands and True Blue Foam. In 2017, the campus activities department was divided into Y-Activities and AIM (Arts, Interests and Music). The Clubs area provides administrative oversight for over 100 recognized BYUSA clubs. This area directs the chartering of campus clubs and the training of club officers to ensure the success of the clubs and involvement of students. The Student Advisory Council, or SAC, established in 1988 with the reorganization BYUSA, helps to perform the organizational mission in advising the administration and students across campus. The Student Honor department is tasked with the primary mission of promoting the university Honor Code. In 2007, the Student Honor Association was placed under the BYUSA, with the role of Student Honor Association President becoming an official BYUSA Vice President. Communications helps to coordinate the marketing effort of the association, aiding recruitment and retention of volunteers. Elections The BYUSA election process begins in October, once applications are accepted, and ends in March, with a primary and final voting. As of 2020, candidates for BYUSA President and Executive Vice President run independently, instead of a pair. https://byusa.byu.edu/leadership- opportunities#:~:text=BYUSA%20Elections%20is%20a%204,with%20primary%20and%20final%20voting. In past years and due to various reasons, the BYUSA elections have caused campus-wide controversy. Across multiple years, candidates have been disqualified and, in 2006, a candidates disqualification led to the firing of a full-time employee. After a successful election and at the end of the out- going administration's term, new BYUSA officers gather atop the Spencer W. Kimball Tower to perform the \\"Pass the Torch\\" Ceremony. During this ceremony the outgoing BYUSA President gives the \\"Oath of Office\\" to the incoming BYUSA President. Notable Alumni * Rex E.

It was founded in 1948 by Rainer Hildebrandt, G√ºnther Birkenfeld and Ernst Benda, and existed until 1959. http://www.dhm.de/ausstellungen/kalter_krieg/brosch_02.htm http://www.jugendopposition.de/index.php?id=2860 Hildebrandt would later establish the Checkpoint Charlie Museum. History The KgU received significant financial support from several Western intelligence agencies as well as the government of West Germany and the Ford Foundation. The US Army's Counterintelligence Corps (CIC) provided funding from the group's creation in the late 1940s. By the early 1950s, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) gradually replaced the CIC as the KgU's most prominent American backer. According to CIA documents, the KgU ran approximately 500 agents in East Germany in the early 1950s, which, according to historian Enrico Heitzer, put it on par with the Gehlen Organization, the predecessor to the West German intelligence service Bundesnachrichtendienst. The KgU's activities included sabotage, arson and poison attacks as well as aggressive economic warfare, such as Operation Osterhase (\\"Easter Bunny\\"), in which the group sent 150,000 fake letters to East German stores, ordering drastic price cuts in order to cause a run on already scarce consumer goods. Other activities included collecting data on individuals imprisoned in East Germany and passing it on to their relatives, as well as collecting names of informers to the East German government and passing it on to RIAS, which would then broadcast so-called \\"snitch reports\\" in order to silence informers and discourage others from engaging in similar activities. The KgU also aided the CIA in building up a so-called stay-behind network to be used in the event of a hypothetical Soviet invasion. Infiltration of the KgU by Stasi operatives and the arrest of several of its agents in East Germany eventually caused the group to dissolve in 1959, with many of its records going to the CIA. Although some KgU members, such as Rainer Hildebrandt and Ernst Tillich, had served time in prison during the Third Reich for anti-Nazi activities, as historian Enrico Heitzer points out, the group also used numerous activists with a Nazi past, many of whom hadn't changed their political views.

Their set included punked up versions of rock and roll standards such as \\"Get Back\\", \\"Rock Around The Clock\\" and the Stone's \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\", however, from the beginning the Cousins brothers were writing their own material. Nevertheless, very few actual gigs were played and even fewer recordings remain, but a recording of The So! performing \\"Rock Around The Clock\\" was placed on MySpace in 2009. The summer of 1981 saw the departure of Andrew Hawker and David Clifford when band members left school and went their separate ways. In October 1981, whilst at sixth form in Chippenham‚Äôs Sheldon and Hardenhuish Schools, the Cousins brothers teamed up with Mark Dunn on keyboards/drums and Richard Pearson on guitar/drums. The group practiced in the cellar of Mark‚Äôs parents house on Chippenham‚Äôs London Road, developing an underground garage sound from self penned tunes and covers of T. Rex, David Bowie and Lou Reed. Myke Vince joined the band in the Spring of 1982 and in June the local press carried the story that the band had changed its name. The Wiltshire Gazette and Herald ran with ‚ÄòSo... it‚Äôs Random Gender.‚Äô In the article Jon Cousins explains \\"the new name was Myke‚Äôs idea and the rest of us think it suits our image better.\\"So... it‚Äôs Random Gender, Page 2, Wiltshire Gazette and Herald, 10 June 1982 The name actually came from the Ultravox song \\"My Sex\\", composed by John Foxx. However, not all the band were happy with the new name and the Wiltshire Gazette and Herald of 29 July 1982 reported that \\"The bands line up is now Mike Vince (drums), Richard Pearson (guitar), Simon Cousins (bass and vocals) and Jon Cousins (rhythm guitar and vocals).\\"Band gives first gig Page 2, Wiltshire Gazette and Herald, 29 July 1982 The article reported on the \\"Gig in the Barn at Sevington Farm\\", 10 July 1982 where an audience of 150 people saw Random Gender perform their first show at the north Wiltshire home of the Cousins brothers‚Äô mother and stepfather, Judith and Roger Pope. Poster advertising the first Gig in the Barn at Sevington Farm, 10 July 1982 With the departure of Mark Dunn, Random Gender moved their base to Sevington Farm, where they adapted an outhouse into their practice room. Shortly after the move to Sevington Farm that Random Gender recorded The Blue Set demo at The Practice Room. This tape included their signature tune, the haunting \\"My Death\\" written by Jon Cousins about the events in Poland in 1981/2 when the government introduced martial law in an attempt to crush the Solidarity movement. At this time the Cousins brothers also began working with local Chippenham songwriter Eddie Deedigan in the Triangle project. During October 1982, Richard Pearson left Random Gender and on 4 November 1982 the Wiltshire Gazette and Herald reported that \\"guitarist Eddie Deedigan has replaced Richard Pearson.\\"Group Is Hit, Front Page, Wiltshire Gazette and Herald, 4 November 1982 Eddie Deedigan introduced a folk influence to the band's music, which was an influence that grew in prominence in the Cousins brothers song writing and became the main genre of Random Gender's successors, Ophiuchus. In spring on 1983, Random Gender recruited keyboard player Mark Nochols. The band played their second \\"Gig in the Barn at Sevington Farm\\" on 30 April 1983. It is believed the audience exceeded 400, with special busses being laid on from nearby towns of Chippenham and Calne for the night. The show was a massive success, establishing Random Gender as a band, but also marked the departure of both Mark Nichols and Eddie Deedigan from the line up. Eddie Deedigan would later go on to form the band Circus with Tom Aitkenhead and Damon Albarn of Blur.Harris, John. Britpop! Cool Britannia and the Spectacular Demise of English Rock. 2004. page 45. Da Capo Press. Earlier that Spring, the Cousins brothers had starred in a sixth form production of Tom Stoppard‚Äôs Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead at Sheldon School. Other members of the cast included Gender guitarist Eddie Deedigan and keyboard player Richard Hughes, who was recruited that summer to replace Mark Nichols. In the summer of 1983, Myke Vince‚Äôs father John Vince, a lecturer at Corsham Art College in Wiltshire, began to act as Random Gender's manager. John Vince encouraged the band to develop as artists, producing their own posters, arranging photo shoots, engaging with the media and expanding their musical expression. In an interview for Wiltshire Gazette and Herald in 1985 he explained his passion for the band: \\"They have a depth to their music that a lot of young bands lack\\" adding that \\"Their music is well thought out, tight and professional.\\"German tour offered band on the upbeat, page 5, Wiltshire Gazette and Herald, 19 September 1985 In October 1983, Random Gender were in the studio for the first time recording their second demo The Foxhole Sessions. This session as the name implies, was recorded at the Foxhole Studio in Wick between 8 p.m. and midnight on 13 October. The Demo had four of the band's original numbers, including a new version of \\"My Death\\", now with keyboard arrangement by Richard Hughes, and the track Stage, written after the experience of their acting debut. On 25 January 1984 Random Gender played on the bill at Richard Branson‚Äôs Goldiggers Club in Chippenham. They proved so popular that they were given a gig in their own right in April. The Goldiggers gig was reported in The Wiltshire Gazette and Herald which interviewed Jon, Myke and Richard. Jon stated, \\"It‚Äôs the first time a local band has played at the club in their own right and not as a support act for someone else.\\"Random Gender seem all set for the big time, Page 3, Wiltshire Gazette and Herald, 20 April 1984 In June, the band were recording for the second time, this time in Frank Aust's studio in Bath, where they cut two track;\\"Night and Day / The Journey\\", which were released as a demo single. At the same time the band were playing regular gigs in Bristol and Bath and had become a six piece as was reported in the Chippenham News on 27 July 1984. \\"The line-up now includes Jane Hicks (dance, vocals and percussion) and it has been joined at some recent gigs by Pat D‚ÄôArcy (Saxophone).\\"Random Gender, Front page, Chippenham News, 27 July 1984 Jane Hick was the Drama Teacher at Sheldon School in Chippenham and had been the director of the production of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead the year before. She had approached the band to ask them if she could join on a temporary basis in order to get an equity card. Pat D‚ÄôArcy had been travelling from Stafford at the weekends to play sax with the band since meeting them in the Spring, whilst working in Wiltshire. The band's gig at Bath's St. James Wine Vaults on 20 July 1984 was a critical success attracting a number of reporters from different publications. Simon Kinnersley, of the Bath and West Evening Chronicle, wrote \\"The most arresting feature of their music is the inclusion of a sax, which not only beefs up their sound, but seems to pump the whole thing along and make them much more distinctive and varied\\",Kinnersley, Simon. Random notes on a band with sax appeal, Page 20, Bath and West Evening Chronicle, 27 July 1984 Dave Massey of Sounds added that \\"there was a hint of the Beatles circa ‚Äô66 and, more odd, something of Roxy ‚Äô72-‚Äò74 .\\"Massey, Dave. Gender Tender, Sounds Music Paper, 28 July 1984 and Mark Ashton of Venue Magazine summed up Random Gender as \\"well worth watching, fizzy, flippant and sunny side up.\\"Ashton, Mark. Random Gender, Band Profile, page 35, Venue Magazine, 3 August 1984 A week later the band were back in the studio working on \\"The Man with the Face\\", which was recorded on 26 July 1984 in Yate, Avon. This is the only Random Gender recording to feature Jane Hick who performed backing vocals. At this time Jon Cousins also began to work on a solo project inspired by the Celtic mythology of the Welsh Nation, \\"The Mabinogion: The Mabinogi of Math 'Ab Mathonwy and the Sons of Don\\" . The ten songs of the Mabinogion were recorded at Robert Craven‚Äôs studio in Bath during July and August 1984. Jon enlisted the help of his girlfriend Rachel Bowen on recorder, Jane Hicks‚Äô husband Andy on flute and his brother Simon on various instruments. Three of the songs ‚Äì The Sin, The Death of Pryderi, and The Punishment, featured a full Random Gender line up of Jon Cousins, Simon Cousins, Myke Vince and Richard Hughes. In the August 1984 Jane Hicks qualified for her Equity card and left the band, leaving the five members of its final line up: Jon Cousins, guitar and vocals; Simon Cousins, bass and vocals; Myke Vince on drums and vocals; Richard Hughes, keyboards and vocals; and Pat D‚ÄôArcy on saxophone and vocals. Random Gender became a firm favourite at Bristol's The Thekla, which was run by Ki Longfellow and her husband Vivian Stanshall, who is best known as the singer with the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band. Among Random Gender's regular audience members at The Thekla was the actor David Rappaport, who would take great delight in introducing them onto stage. 31 December 1984 saw Pat D‚ÄôArcy and Simon Cousins travelling to Stafford to play at a New Year's Eve bash with Pat's friend Pete Haycock from the Climax Blues Band. Earlier that month, 12 December 1984, Random Gender played their first gig at the Granary Club in Bristol, supporting The Harpoons and Automatic Dlamini. The latter featured an unknown PJ Harvey as their lead singer. Random Gender returned to the Granary as the headline act on 18 April 1985.Read, Al. The Granary Club: The Rock Years 1969 - 1988. 2003. page 260. Broadcast Books. On 14 March 1985 the band played their first gig at Peewee Hunt's Real Ale Bar in Trowbridge. Sue Hampton of the Wiltshire Gazette and Herald attended the show and reported that the band \\"won over the audience with their light refreshing style of music.\\"Hampton, Sue. Random Gender are a hit, page 8, Wiltshire Gazette and Herald, 21 March 1985 The band were asked to return for another gig in May 1985, with Peewee's becoming one of the band's regular gigs throughout the rest of their career. 15 April 1985 saw Random Gender's first appearance at another prestigious venue, Moles Night Club in Bath. This gig was reviewed by Mark Ashton of the Venue Magazine who called them \\"an oddball mix of present, past, taste, trend, fad and fun.\\" Random Gender worked hard throughout the summer with Simon Kinnersly of Bath and West Evening Chronicle commenting that \\"They‚Äôve been seen in almost every venue in the area, gradually consolidating their reputation and improving their style and sound. So much that they‚Äôre one of the best bands around.\\"Kinnersley, Simon, Moving up in the world on self-belief, Bath And West Evening Chronicle Thursday, 13 June 1985 During this time the band also made their final appearance at Chippenham's Goldiggers on 27 August 1985 \\"playing at the mini Live Aid show\\" Concert for Ethiopia. At the concert they were reunited with Eddie Deedigan who was compere for the nine-hour special. Also on the bill were Bobby McVay, Loose Ends and Princess. The event raised ¬£5,000 for the appeal. Random Gender playing at the Swindon Live Aid Fun Day, 21 September 1985 In the late summer of 1985 the Random Gender returned to Robert Craven‚Äôs Studio in Bath to record their third version of \\"My Death\\", this time with the saxophone of Pat D‚ÄôArcy, who had made the move from Stafford to Wiltshire and consolidated his place in the group. Also joining the band at this time was Liverpool's electronics wizard, Glen Wardle who became their regular Sound Engineer. Random Gender appeared in the final of the Wiltshire Music for Today competition at Salisbury Arts Centre on 15 September 1985. Their appearance at the event was covered by the Wiltshire Gazette and Herald and the Chippenham Times and News. The Gazette and Herald recorded that the competition \\"winners were the Calling from Swindon, Random Gender came second.\\" Both papers ran a story that the band had been offered a trip to Europe as a consequence of their Live Aid appearance at Goldiggers. The Gazette and Herald with the headline, \\"German tour offered band on the upbeat.\\" The Times and News stating that \\"The band were spotted by an agent who offered them a tour of Germany next month.\\"Live Aid run of luck for Chippenham band, page 3, Chippenham Times and News, 20 September 1985 Whether this was a clever piece of marketing or a real story seems unclear, however, the tour of Germany never materialised, instead they played a short tour of Staffordshire later that month. Random Gender's first and only airplay came by virtue of their appearance at Swindon's Live Aid fun day on 21 September 1985. They were playing in the background as the roving reporter on GWR Radio made occasional contact with the DJ on the Saturday afternoon broadcast. The Wiltshire Gazette and Herald reported that Random Gender \\"played for free\\" and \\"that ¬£300 was raised from the event.\\"Band of hope for Africa, page 8, Wiltshire Gazette and Herald, 26 September 1985 In the autumn of 1985, Random Gender returned to Robert Craven‚Äôs studio in Bath to record what turned out to be their last session. They produced one track, \\"Chain to Break\\", with a view to making their first single. In an interview with Five Minutes Magazine the band discussed their plans to secure sponsorship and their concerns to keep artistic control. Jon Cousins expressed the bands position \\"To get any further, we can only do that if we‚Äôve got some sort of backing. We need somebody who is going to sponsor us but who doesn‚Äôt want to change us.\\"Not So Random, page 20, Five Minutes Magazine, Number 1, November 1985 Random Gender found a financial backer in Wiltshire businessman John Senior Stern who agreed to put up the finances for a single. The group began negotiations with Pete Haycock who agreed to be their producer on the project. They provided him with tapes of all of their songs and Pete Haycock chose In Search Of The East and My Death as the two songs for the single. In the spring of 1986, Random Gender teamed up with photographer Martin Tom Sawyer to do a photo shoot for the single cover at Sevington Farm. A draft cover was developed, but the band broke up before there was a chance for the single to be produced. A new band, Ophiuchus rose out of the ashes of Random Gender, and it was this band that went on to record their first single Serpent and the Bearded King with Pete Haycock as producer. The original line up of Ophiuchus included the Cousins Brothers and Pat D‚ÄôArcy. But this was short lived with Simon Cousins leaving to join Mike Badger who formed The Onset in December 1986.Nicolson, Barry. There He Goes, Page 30, NME, 11 April 2009. In addition to Jon Cousins and Pat D‚ÄôArcy, ex-Gender members Myke Vince and Glen Wardle both played with Ophiuchus and appear on the \\"Serpent\\" single, which was released in 1987.

The town was planned and established by Lake Harris between 1912 and 1915 as a service town supporting ranchers in the surrounding area. The place was recognized as a town in 1915 when a post office was established. Tours of the site are available by appointment. History Jay Em is located on the old Texas Trail, running north‚Äìsouth through Goshen County, and featured the last watering hole before reaching Lusk. The land around the watering hole was claimed by Jim Moore in the 1860s. By 1869, Moore had the second largest cattle ranch in the Wyoming Territory, under the brand \\"J Rolling M\\", leading to the naming of a small drainage \\"Jay Em Creek\\". Moore died in 1875, but his brand outlived him. In 1905, Silas Harris and his three sons took over the Jay Em Cattle Company. One of his sons, Lake Harris, established a post office in the Jay Em Ranch's bunkhouse, bringing the mail from Rawhide Buttes. The Harris family also established a general store on the ranch. Lake Harris filed a homestead claim in 1912 on Rawhide Creek, where he planned and built a small town. He first built his own house, then a feed store, which housed the post office from 1915. The Harris general store moved into Jay Em in 1918, and Harris built a lumber and general supply store shortly after. A newspaper, the weekly Jay Em Sentinel and Fort Laramie News (circulation 300), inevitably edited by Lake Harris, ran from 1917 to 1921. The Farmers State Bank was built in Jay Em in 1920. The town continued through the 1920s and 1930s as a regional center for commerce in northern Goshen County. In 1935, Lake Harris established the Jay Em Stone Company, making tombstones and building products from stone quarried around the Rawhide Buttes. After the 1930s, Jay Em declined as the automobile made it easier for local residents to travel to larger towns. The general store lasted until the late 1970s. Lake Harris died in 1983 at the age of 96. The few remaining residents of Jay Em have moved to more modern accommodations scattered around the edge of town, leaving the center vacant.

It was founded around 1235-1241 by Roesia de Verdon and dissolved in October 1538. It was dedicated to the Holy Trinity and St Mary. History The priory was founded c. 1239 by Rhosese (or Roesia) de Verdon.Grace Dieu Priory, English Heritage: PastScape. The priory was endowed with the manors of Belton, Leicestershire and \\"Kirkby in Kesteven\\" (Kirkby la Thorpe?), Lincolnshire; as well as the advowson of Belton Church. The priory was unusual in being independent of outside control. The nuns called themselves \\"the White Nuns of St. Augustine\\", and there is thought to be no other houses of their order in the country. The priory was fairly large, having in 1337 sixteen nuns. It also had an attached hospital which cared for twelve poor people. The priory did, however, have some unusual practices: for example, the nuns were forbidden to ever leave the priory's precincts.\\"House of Augustinian nuns: The priory of Grace Dieu\\", A History of the County of Leicestershire: Volume 2 (1954), pp. 27-28. Date accessed: 20 June 2013. The priory escaped the first wave of dissolution of the smaller monasteries, but was finally dissolved in 1538. =After Dissolution= Following the Dissolution, the site was granted to Sir Humphrey Foster who sold it to John Beaumont in 1539. He converted the priory buildings into a residence which remained within his family until 1684, when it was bought by Sir Ambrose Phillipps, a wealthy lawyer, who also built nearby Garendon Hall. Sir Ambrose had most of the buildings pulled down, and by 1730 the remaining buildings were ruinous, with only two sections still roofed.Hillier, Kenneth and Ryder, Peter F: Grace Dieu Priory, published by Ashby-de-la-Zouch Museum and the Grace Dieu Prior Trust, July 2006 The priory passed through the Phillips and March families until 1833 when Charles March Philips gave the priory to his son Ambrose Lisle March Phillips, who assumed the surname \\"De Lisle\\". Ambrose constructed a new house in the Tudor-gothic style, known as Grace Dieu Manor, south of the priory ruins. The March Phillips de Lisle family owned the house until 1933, although their main residence was at the Hall they built at the former Garendon Abbey. Following the death of two of its heads in quick succession, the family needed to tighten its belt and so in 1885 moved out of Garendon and into Grace Dieu Manor. A return to fortune allowed the family to return to Garendon once more in 1907, however. Finally in 1964 Garendon Hall was demolished and the family returned to Grace Dieu for a final time, selling the house within a decade. Grace Dieu Manor then became a Catholic school. In 1972 the family moved to Quenby Hall, but following the collapse of the family cheese making business, the family has been forced to offer the Hall for sale (it has been for sale since 2012). The priory buildings still exist as ruins.Harvey, Alfred (1912) Leicestershire. London: Methuen A conservation project on the remains was completed in 2005. It is managed by the Friends of Grace Dieu Priory, who work together with the Grace Dieu Priory Trust and the Grace Dieu Estate to ensure it stays open to members of the public. Paranormal Phenomena The priory is reputed to be the site of frequent paranormal phenomena, sometimes attributed to the priory's proximity to the Thringstone Fault, several ley lines and some possible Pagan significance attached to the site. The ruins are home to the mythical ghost the White Lady. A comprehensive record of sightings, dating back as far as 1926, has been compiled by Stephen Neale Badcock, with all accounts backed up by information sources. Many of the sightings share a remarkable uniformity in terms of description and specific location, tending to refer to white or grey apparitions, robed, with no hands or feet, hovering or gliding above ground level and appearing on the opposite side of the road to the priory, in the vicinity of an old 'bus shelter. Paul Devereux refers to the Grace Dieu phenomenon in his 1982 book, \\"Earth Lights: Towards and Explanation of the UFO Enigma\\", and sets out his theory that such manifestations are a rare but naturally occurring phenomenon, wrought by unusual electromagnetic fields associated with fault areas which interfere with the normal cycles of the atmosphere.Devereux, Paul: 'Earth Lights', Turnstone Press Ltd, 1982, p 208-9 Expanding on this, Neale Badcock's research has shown that the site of Grace Dieu priory is located directly above the Thringstone Fault, as shown by a geological map produced by the Leicester Literary and Philosophical Society in 1965. The site is also located close to a standing stone, in a field to the west of the priory, examples of which are often found close to geological faults. The presence of this stone suggests that the area may have been regarded as a sacred site in ancient times, Mesolithic flint scrapers having been found around the base of the stone.John Dickinson, Grace Dieu Archaeological Society: 'The Ghosts of Grace Dieu', Pukka Publications, 2004, p 10. As such, it has been suggested that the site's prehistoric religious significance may have influenced the choice of location for the mediaeval monastic foundation. However, whilst this may have been the case for many Christian foundations during the Saxon period (the nearby parish church at Whitwick for example would almost certainly date back to a Saxon origin, intentionally sited in a sacred place, above a natural spring) it is probable that the link between the much later foundation of Grace Dieu Priory and a site of possible pagan significance occurs more by co-incidence. Hillier and Ryder offer a more prosaic explanation for the location of the nunnery, suggesting that the chief influence would have been its proximity to a fresh water source.

It is considered endangered and is legally protected in the state of Michigan. Description Like most underwings, C. amestris has a brightly colored hindwing and brownish-gray forewings, the wingspan is 1.6-1.8in (4-4.5 cm). The forewings have a blotch that strongly resembles a kidney shape, beyond that the wing has mixed wavy lines. The hindwings have two wavy black lines separating a yellow-orange coloration. The caterpillar of this species is bluish white with a yellowish coloring on the dorsum, or top side. It also has an orange band along with 7 thin black lines on its sides. Habitat Between June and August this moth can be seen in dry-mesic prairie lands and oak forest. Due to only having one host plant, Amorpha canescens, the moth is hard to find in even these areas.
